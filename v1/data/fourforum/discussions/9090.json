   "I posted this in civil rights, but I feel it should be posted here as well.\n I saw this web page, and was struck by the hill billy legislation in a country in modern Europe:\n \n Act Against Homophobia (AAH) is an initiative caused by the Faroese government's homophobic legislation. The Faroese government refuses, for instance, to legislate against discrimination of people because of their sexual preferences. This means that in the Faroe Islands, discrimination of homosexuals is perfectly legal according to the law. \n \n This signature collection campaign has been launched to show the Faroese government and parliament, that the surrounding world does not find discriminating acts against homosexuals acceptable, whether or not they are committed in the name of Christianity. This country's current legislation is a strong violation of The United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights.\n \n Unfortunately, right now violence and discrimination against people who have spoken up about their homosexuality in public is not uncommon in the Faroe Islands. And because there is no law to protect the homosexual \n minority against such discrimination, it is often considered legal and acceptable to commit these actions against homosexuals.\n \n Take action against discrimination of homosexuals and sign the AAH\n \n All signatures will be sent to the Faroese Government.\n \n http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html",

   "Don't you think that those Baltic countries are discrediting entire European Union by their pronounced fascist political course?

And this bronze statue of a soldier has become symbol of European liberation from Nazis. Its dismantling is insulting not only Russian patriotic feelings. And what about Germany?\n Germans had suffered too much from Hitler's regime and such memorials are symbolizing their liberation either. And by such actions Estonian authorities insult historical memory of Germany too. \n So while All-European Constitution doesn't exist yet Germany as head of the EU and one of the most influential countries of the Union should think of proper bill putting all EU members in their places. The Union should be divided onto 2 parts.\n One will consist of Old European countries.

The EU is too big to be run as one super-state where everything is meant to be the same for all. It needs totally rethinking and very much more devolved on the member states",

   "Making heroes of fascists in Estonia is disgusting. Even more disgusting is the fact that Estonian social-democrats are taking part in it. When approving of that scandalous law allowing the demolition of WW 2 memorials in Estonia they are actually defaming whole European Social-Democrats' movement always cherishing humanistic values and decisively battling xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Now, some Estonian leaders Eiki Nestor (number 2 figure in the party) should be made just subject for special exploration. The man's said to have voiced the idea of demolition of some burial places of Holocaust WW 2 under the mask of the law in some business interests (construction works or something like that). That's top of cynicism! Previously when occupying the position of social affairs minister he suggested limited access to the key state positions of Jews. Nestor wants his country free of any \"foreign element\" they say.",

   "I hear the Web site of Belgium's Defense Ministry was hacked by a group of Turkish nationalists, which call themselves \"Grandchildren of the Ottoman Empire and Children of Turkey\". Although Defense Minister of Belgium, Andre Flahaut can not find any explanations of it, I suppose that this group has chosen a Belgian government site not quite by chance. \n In such a way Turkish nationalists try to show European countries their muscles. They are interested in Turkish top position in Muslim world. And acting through their gang of hackers, they make efforts to defeat Turkish entry into EU. \n It is enough to note that the Web sites of European governments had faced similar attacks earlier, too. At the start Turkish nationalists claim that \"the Kurdistan Worker's Party is a terrorist organization, supported by the West\" and that is why they destroy Western sites. But after possible Turkish entry into European Union they begin to kill us!",

   "To be honest I simply cannot understand why members of European Parliament don't want to move hand of foot to stop that outrage that currently takes place in Estonia. Don't they really care? Don't they give a damn for fascism taking rise in this country? Am I the only one who thinks fascism a serious threat? I mean it! Estonia has gone too far in their \"struggle for restoration of independence\", which in fact turned out to be a mere rehabilitation of fascism and an attempt to reconsider results of the WW2! Gosh, if we don't want fascism be back in Europe, we must do something to prevent its uprising! First of all why don't European Parliament introduce some economic sanctions against Estonia? This measure of restraint proved to be rather effective, didn't it? But we must do it now before it's too late!",

   "They say Europe should be united. Now guys we've got good enough common ground to realize the idea. In a joint effort we may clean Europe out of neo-fascism! Let it be our lofty aim for the nearest perspective at least. And I think this is a smart chance for young European folks to overcome so called generation gap and continue that noble combat on fascism older folks lead in 40s. \n Estonia may be the starting point. Since 1991 after the formation of Estonian independent \"democratic\" state ex-Estonian fascists have held annual marches of SS vets there and erected memorials honoring Hitler's Nazi collaborators. \n Mind that till now that was the position of local radical nationalists. Now there's bill in the Estonian parliament under consideration to dismantle Bronze Soldier (symbolic monument honoring the WWII anti-fascists' fighting). This means reanimation of fascism is formal line of Tallinn. \n I suggest following Latvian anti-fascists led. They are just picketing Estonian embassy and other Estonian facilities in Riga and other Latvian cities. And in Belgium they are making Estonia's drive to pose Hitler beasts as heroes subject of Parliament debate. I guess we should press our relevant parliaments to do same sort of thing. \n \n P.S If we were quick enough to identify neo-fascist challenge earlier we wouldn't get just out of the blue that shocking caucus of neo-fascists and Holocaust deniers in European parliament now.",

   "Speaking about parliamentary elections in Estonia which is to take place on March 4. Honestly, I often visit this country on business trips so I may say I know this country quite well and people that live there. So according to my observations many Estonians from amongst most clearheaded ones admit that the anti-Soviet memorial law runs against Estonia's constitution. In all objectivity this law is forced through by certain political parties in Estonian parliament known as that having nationalistic and pro-fascist trend, which are Res Publica, Social Democratic Party, Pro Patria Party and Reform Party. \n \n It must be admitted that these four parties work purposefully for touching nationalist feelings of Estonian population. If I were Estonian I would not give my vote for them. I hate it when someone tries to play me around. But it is just what these four parties try to do to people of Estonia. Besides, they infract the constitution in order to achieve some goals of their own (for instance, remain in power) and don't give a damn for consequences, which may be very serious taking into account that all EU member states are very disaffected with Estonia as neo-fascists are rising up there.",

   "Last night the demonstration for witness of Bronze Soldier in Tallinn downtown was put down cruelly by police. Batons, tear-gas and water-jets was used against unarmed crowd.\n Yes, this is EU methods of curbing but the reasons of it don't keep within European frameworks! Unfortunately I can say nothing besides it was fascist intrigues of Estonian power.\n Well, it's really clear that by this way Estonian officials tried to keep Tallinn to order. But I think that it could be sensible to keep its nation from those moods. Estonia officials' action must get due appraisal and condemnation from European community as conflicting with common to all mankind principles of keeping memory about Fascism victims!\n EU officials have to make accurate signal to Estonia that we'll never take the policy of concealment this problem. Memorials of War and its victims must be in plain view of new generation for its edification but not hide in some parks and cemetery!",
