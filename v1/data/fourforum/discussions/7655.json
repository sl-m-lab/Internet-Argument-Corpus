Anything that involves strong belief, political, religious, whatever, can be used as an excuse for hatred.\n\n \n Yes, anything can be used to fuel hatred. However, religion is a uniquely powerful position to do so. Politics, fashion, opinion; these all have as their motivating force what a person thinks. And everyone knows that people are fallible. You may believe that what someone says is true, but at heart you always know that they might not be. Religions, on the other hand, have as their motivation God's will, or at least what someone says is God's will. If, like the Quakers, you think that God's will is to be peacful than everything is fine. But it's not hard to convince people that God's will is to smite the unbelievers, vanquish the heathens, or otherwise commit horrid acts of violence. And since we're talking about God here then questioning this becomes blashphemy. With humanistic movements people make the calls and people are responsible for the decisions. With religious movements God is responsible, not people. And that frees people to act out in ways that they might not otherwise. While I fully admit that good has been done in the name of religion and by religious people, atrocities have also been commited in religion's name. And while I believe that the good acts could still happen without religion, I'm less sure about the atrocities.",

They are merely abusing it as an excuse to pick sides. \n \n Eg, the Crusades: \"I'm a Christian, he's a Muslim, it says in the bible \"Thou shalt not kill\" but I'll kill him in the name of my religion anyway!\"\n \n They are just using religion to divide people and create their own enemies. \n Their actual religious beliefs are irrelevant. The real beliefs that they follow are their own warped ideas in their own mind. They may claim it's for their own religion, but most religions would condone what they do. \n \n It's their own twisted interpretation that leaves out the part about \"Turning the other cheek\" and inserts a \"Kill all the unbelievers\" into their mental bible.\n \n For the most part, religion does good for the world.

Religions claim to be following the will of God. However, no one actually knows what the will of God is for sure. None the less, followers of religions are sure, absolutely sure, that they have it right. Religion, by its nature, requires belief and submission despite lack of evidence. And most of the people in the world are fine with this. Given this, its easy to see how someone can use this power for evil. Since no evidence is required, and God can't be asked directly for confirmation of his wishes, it's quite easy for someone to simply say they are doing God's will and have his followers commit all sorts of acts. He may even believe it himself! So while the dogmas of specific religions aren't to blame, the very nature of religion itself makes it uniquely susceptible to abuse, and particularly likely to be the source of great harm.",

   "The conflict in Iraq is as much tribal as anything else: the ruling classes were Sunni tribes, who had the power but were in the minority. Now, some of them are rather resentful about losing the power. Where these political divides do not exist, Shi'a and Sunni tend to live peacefully, just like Protestants and Catholics do without the political and cultural divides in Ireland. The problem with religion in these circumstances is merely that it becomes a marker, less obvious than race, but more obvious than status or political position, that can be used to simplify the idea of an 'enemy'. Of course, anything that brings a sense of community can also cause hardening of opinions against outsiders, but most of the time these communities provide support, both physical and psychological.\n \n Few atheists may 'kill in the name of atheism', but religion provides a need for certainty easily replaced by fascism, communism, social darwinism, fanatical devotion to the advance of science etc. In fact, Jung would argue that the loss of a long-developed religious framework for the inner life of symbols leaves us with a 'heap of broken images' making the rise of these as well as fundamentalist, literalist, religion and certain personality disorders almost inevitable.",

Respect their space. Evidently, you will have gotten over your hatred of religion when that occurs.\n \n \n \n\n Don't talk to me of such things. I am an Atheist. I have morals and standards and I respect the beliefs of others.\nRespecting the beliefs of others precludes hatred of religion. Which is it to be?\n \n \nTalk to the Sunnis and Shi'ites and tell them to stop killing each other. It makes them and all religion look very bad and evil. I cannot respect Islam until this is accomplished.\nAre you practicing establishment of guilt by association? I know some really wicked women, but that doesn't make them all bad.\n \n \n ....\n \n \n \n \n ....\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n And, Right Seeker, I would advise you to leave me alone and address all of this at your brother Muslims who have lost their way.\nWhose way should they hold to?\n \n \n \n\n I have found the way. I know that my way is sound. I know that I do not have to blow up sacred edifices to prove that my way is correct. Go out and talk to those who need your guidance. I do not.\nRadical Muslims need the guidance of peaceful Muslims. Everybody needs to be taught and to live by the golden rule.\n \n I share your disgust with violence as a way to promote religion. However, hatred is not a solution regardless of how peaceful one claims to be. I don't really hate rapists, murderers or child molesters. I hate rape, murder and molestation.\n \n We could learn greatly from our ancestors.\n \n One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about a\n battle that goes on inside people. He said, \"My son, the battle is between 2\n \"wolves\" inside us all.\n \n One is Evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret,\n greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false\n pride, superiority, and ego.\n \n The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility,\n kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.\"\n \n The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather:\n \"Which wolf wins?\"\n \n The old Cherokee simply replied, \"The one you feed.\"\n \n \n ...and you gotta know the Cherokees had life figured out...they let the women run the show and inherit the property.",

   "You can be taught to believe something without any evidence, which is ignorant in a sense.\nI'm just confused by what 'learn not to be ignorant' means. Does it mean 'learn stuff' or learning some new way of processing information?\n \n \nThe fact that children can be made to believe anything does not mean to say it's the only reason people are religous. Adults can convert because they choose to. This obviously has no effect on the fact that children believe what they are taught.\nthe 'IF caught at an early age' implies to me that 'catching' some poor innocent kid is necessary. It certainly read as an 'if and only if' to me. I may be wrong.\n \n \nHe was referring to religion itself, not the belief in a deity. The belief in a deity could be a natural part of some people, yes. But organise religion, building temples and churches and spending time praying in them, is not.\nQuite untrue. Ritual is probably as old as religion: indeed, belief in a deity may come out of adding an idea of personhood and essentially an anthropomorphisation of magic. Similarly, Jung's psychology does not merely say that there is some archetype conforming to God, but shows a need for a life of symbolism and ritual that has only been satisfactorily served by religion (though ideas like fascism and communism use parts of them they tend to be fragmented and thus damaging)\n \n \nYes, that's true, subjectively to some people it has meaning. However, on this planet there are unfortunately multiple religions, and therefore only one out of many can be subjectively meaningful.\nWhat? The whole point of 'subjectively meaningful' is surely that it doesn't have to be universal, but changes by perspective? T S Eliot is subjectively meaningful to me, as is Donne. There doesn't have to be only one, and even if they both claimed to be the only poet, I could find meaning without agreeing with that bit, or I could like Donne and someone else Eliot, so both would be subjectively meaningful.\n \n \nHe means that even if a religion was right, there would be litttle benefit in it. God exists? Ok, so get on with your everyday life...\nIf you're right that what he meant, he makes no argument. And as the sentence I quote starts 'one step further' and follows from a sentence ending 'given that \"sin\" is just part of a made up religion and has no basis in reality', I think the apparent argument is more: it's not true so it makes no sense. If it IS that there would be no benefit, that needs a lot of backing up.",

Your thinking here is self contradictory.\n \n Paragraph three - By no means do I have no responsibility to behave properly. In fact the apostle Paul lays out this very vein of thinking in the book of Romans. He even answers the questions you pose. Because I am MADE righteous (good), then how will I continue to do evil.

That is a pretty awesome resource compared to depending on my own flawed and failing self. If I know I have worth then I behave like it.

One can draw conclusions based on what I have said or what the bible says, but God really is the one who decides. It is why Jesus us tells us to love our neighbor without defining who our neighbor is. The point of the good samaritan for instance is not who is my neighbor that I should love them only but rather that I am to be a neighbor to all regardless of their state. God is not discriminant with his love. He will lavish it on all who will accept it. If one does not want it then God will not force it.\n \n With that, you can disagree if you like.

   "You assume religion is 'made up' which implies it's deliberate creation. It seems (have you read the books I refer to, or any on this subject?) that it arises more naturally than this: I have little doubt that if we brought up children with no religion and isolated them from the community religion would occur in them.\n\n \n Relgion would \"occur\" in them? That doesn't make sense to me.\n \n You may mean that instinctively, without education, humans will make up answers to \"questions\" they have? That's not religion, that's called superstition, or ignorance, or error, and not everyone does it. It's also done for practical reasons, when a conscious individual has not yet developed or learned better ways to cope with reality. Some of that is no doubt, pre-programmed, but can certainly be over-ridden. Any meaningful use of the word religion in this context is the conscious act of codifying a specific set of beliefs or rules into a \"system\", that is then a \"religion\". That's a choice, by definition. And yes, all religion in that context must have originated with someone, so it's again either made-up, or taught.\n \n We can drop the word \"natural\", it's not designed to be used when we're at this depth of discussion (just use other language to specifically describe what is meant).\n \n \n \nThis doesn't get my point: are you saying we are gaining the knowledge that allows us to gain knowledge?\n\n Absolutely not, that wouldn't be reasonable, but I will have to explain it a bit more:\n \n For reason we accept certain \"axioms\" before we can start jabbering about what's what. They are roughly things like:\n Existence (I have to exist to type this, else, I cannot type).\n Consciousness (I'm doing something, by choice, typing this)\n Identity (to use logic we must start with a=a, that is, I'm doing SOMETHING).\n Knowledge is then the correlation of what we observe in reality to our rational \"system\", which includes the \"givens\", shown above.\n \n So, try it out, it works (for good reason).\n \n As to knowledge yielding more knowledge, that's to be expected, I learn more every day, relying on prior knowledge, don't you? (everyone does) It's foundational, and in fact, relies on new knowledge being logically consistent with prior knowledge, else, there is a contradiction somewhere.\n \n \nThen why single out children? And how do you account for the intelligent religious: more specifically the fact that no correlation is found between intelligence and religion?\n\n \n Why not single them out? That's when most americans are introduced to religions, and in many cases, essentially brain-washed into believing in them. Children are generally less able to think critically, especially when their primary sources of trust, their parents, are the ones doing the telling. Social conditioning, early developed bonds of trust, lack of critical thinking at early ages, lack of developed system of reason at an early age, all obvious as far as I'm concerned (there are exceptions of course).\n \n \nThe psychological gives you reasons, rather than making it inevitable. Religion in this way is similar to loving someone: it's not totally involuntary nor rationally chosen. The point is that there is some need for a symbolic, ritual life which religion fulfills. Whether this need reflects the existence of a supernatural dimension or the inner workings of the unconscious alone, and if there is a clear distinction, is something I am not qualified to judge.\n\n \n I have never had a need for religion, despite being rasied as a catholic. The only thing religion did for me was waste some time, and show me the wrong way. So no, there is no such \"need\" for religion, I'm evidence, and I'm sure many will say the same. You don't need to go to a book for that, it's elementary. I'm saying that with adequate education, a rational individual may no longer deny reality, and no longer fabricates reality. We call this delusional, and lying, in common english. At best, we call it ignorance or error.\n \n Oh, and any \"love\" that's purely emotional is worthless to me, except as a pass/fail criteria for spending time with someone. The \"love\" I participate in, is a choice, and it's only that choice that I value, in being loved, or giving it. Any social animal can \"love\" someone emotionally. But to love them by choice (and all the implied benefits in a particular society) is what I value. That's how unconditional love is achieved, through choice, not through obeying one's instincts. I would say I'm compatible mentally and physically to someone, and that if numerous other \"reasoned\" criteria are met, I may make the choice to love that person. Infatuation != love, but then again, that's why we have to be specific, love is too broad a term.\n \n \nBassman assumes that it's a problem with mankind's position. This belief arises from his faith position. However, I agree that the context moved swiftly from general points to this: the main problem of religion as understood from his perspective\n\n \n OK, but basing any argument on a position that by definition does not rely on evidence is absurd to me.\n \n Thanks for keeping the tone neutral, I find that rare on such topics.\n \n -Mach",

   "\n With that, you can disagree if you like. I have no argument with you on that. I am not trying to convince you that you should or shouldn't do or believe anything. That is between you and God as far as I am concerned. My argument was with your statements. I offer my beliefs and logic as you commented on them. I simply explained. You changed what you thought based on my explanations. \n\n Yeah, a reasonable discussion on the religions forum. I guess miracles do happen!\n \n I guess my main problem with what you're saying is that the condition that you're describing doesn't correspond to what I would call \"good\", or indeed to any standard definition. Terms like salvation, divinity, or grace seem more on the mark. While it's certainly valid for you to not presume on God's opinion of people's actions, it seems to me that you should still be able to have an opinion of your own. Otherwise the concept of earthly justice goes out the door, and we might as well shut down the courts and jails. It seems to me that \"performing actions society approves of\" and \"performing actions God approves of\", while they're similar, should still have different terms. The former is generally called good, the later is sometimes called being in a state of grace. If you call the later \"good\" then you leave us with no word to describe the former.\n \n \n\n However, I do like hearing what others believe. I don't always get why anyone would want to live in a world where things that happen are random and without purpose (not that you think that). I don;t get it because it seems very hopeless to me.\n \n\n Actually, I do think most events are random, and any purpose man has he makes for himself.

   "Relgion would \"occur\" in them? That doesn't make sense to me.\n \n You may mean that instinctively, without education, humans will make up answers to \"questions\" they have? That's not religion, that's called superstition, or ignorance, or error, and not everyone does it.\nYou have returned to 'make up'. The point is that ideas of God, like ideas of space, time, causality, morality etc. seem to be the way that people process the world. It's not an a priori belief, but it is an a priori tendency. To follow Jung, God as an archetype exists in the human collective unconscious, although he is only consciously known under certain circumstances\n \n \nIt's also done for practical reasons, when a conscious individual has not yet developed or learned better ways to cope with reality. Some of that is no doubt, pre-programmed, but can certainly be over-ridden.\nFirstly, you assume that there are better ways to deal with reality, but the religious are often happier, and according to some definitions more mentally healthy.\n \n \nAny meaningful use of the word religion in this context is the conscious act of codifying a specific set of beliefs or rules into a \"system\", that is then a \"religion\". That's a choice, by definition. And yes, all religion in that context must have originated with someone, so it's again either made-up, or taught.\nYou assume religion is defined by its dogma. In such as sense, than you are right that it is definitionally a conscious choice. However, Glock (1962), a psychologist of religion defined 5 types of religiousness: beliefs, practise, feelings, knowledge and effects. It seems likely that belief would be the first of these, and practise may well precede belief and knowledge, which seems to be your definition. Rites can precede abstract understandings of what is going on in them.\n \n \nWe can drop the word \"natural\", it's not designed to be used when we're at this depth of discussion (just use other language to specifically describe what is meant).\nThat seems reasonable. My point is that religion is 'natural' in that it seems to arise in similar forms in human individuals and societies.\n \n \nAbsolutely not, that wouldn't be reasonable, but I will have to explain it a bit more:\n \n For reason we accept certain \"axioms\" before we can start jabbering about what's what. They are roughly things like:\n Existence (I have to exist to type this, else, I cannot type).\n Consciousness (I'm doing something, by choice, typing this)\n Identity (to use logic we must start with a=a, that is, I'm doing SOMETHING).\n Knowledge is then the correlation of what we observe in reality to our rational \"system\", which includes the \"givens\", shown above.\nOK. I see more what you mean. But your definition of consciousness seems to be more 'free will'. Identity is the foundation of logic, correct?\n \n I would argue that these are OK as long as we don't stretch them too far. do you mean that I have to accept your physical existence as a starting point? Because that isn't foundational for me. Also, we should bear in mind that any conclusions based on these axioms are only provisional, unless we prove the axioms. And that the axioms can't prove themselves, of course. \n \n \nAs to knowledge yielding more knowledge, that's to be expected, I learn more every day, relying on prior knowledge, don't you? (everyone does) It's foundational, and in fact, relies on new knowledge being logically consistent with prior knowledge, else, there is a contradiction somewhere.\nI'm fine with that, for a certain weak definition of knowledge (we aren't totally certain, we rely on the axioms etc), I just thought you implied there was some special step at the start.\n \n \nWhy not single them out? That's when most americans are introduced to religions, and in many cases, essentially brain-washed into believing in them. Children are generally less able to think critically, especially when their primary sources of trust, their parents, are the ones doing the telling. Social conditioning, early developed bonds of trust, lack of critical thinking at early ages, lack of developed system of reason at an early age, all obvious as far as I'm concerned (there are exceptions of course).\nChildren are also brought up in a secular framework, of course, and this can be as restrictive. But my point was that by focusing on children, you implied that only those lacking critical thinking were religious, which seems odd.\n \n Also, if you check out the stages of cognitive development according to Jean Piaget, and the work done on these by later psychologists, there is a general agreement that most children will either discard these beliefs or make them more complex as the rest of their reasoning matures.\n \n \nI have never had a need for religion, despite being rasied as a catholic. The only thing religion did for me was waste some time, and show me the wrong way. So no, there is no such \"need\" for religion, I'm evidence, and I'm sure many will say the same.\nI said there may be a need for a symbolic life, and religion can provide this. This is the idea of Jung, who stresses that this need for 'religion', did not mean orthodox or traditional forms. If the symbols of Catholicism were not living for you: if they did not channel your experience of the world and allow you to grow and develop psychically, then discarding them is the best thing to do 'religiously'. Jung does use the term 'religion', but as you connect this with dogma, perhaps, 'the numinous' is better: a need for a higher, more inner understanding.\n \n \nYou don't need to go to a book for that, it's elementary. I'm saying that with adequate education, a rational individual may no longer deny reality, and no longer fabricates reality. We call this delusional, and lying, in common english. At best, we call it ignorance or error.\nYou assume the role of religion is to deny or fabricate reality, by which I suspect you mean empirical external reality. I would say that it is more to do with human reality: the psyche.\n \n \nOh, and any \"love\" that's purely emotional is worthless to me, except as a pass/fail criteria for spending time with someone.\nBut this is my point: there is an involuntary aspect, but more is needed. \n \n \nThe \"love\" I participate in, is a choice, and it's only that choice that I value, in being loved, or giving it. Any social animal can \"love\" someone emotionally. But to love them by choice (and all the implied benefits in a particular society) is what I value. That's how unconditional love is achieved, through choice, not through obeying one's instincts. I would say I'm compatible mentally and physically to someone, and that if numerous other \"reasoned\" criteria are met, I may make the choice to love that person. Infatuation != love, but then again, that's why we have to be specific, love is too broad a term.\nYou seem to be working on a principle of agape: what you call unconditional love. I was referring to eros: romantic love. And romantic love is different to either lust, like or compassion. To use the nouns as verbs, you can 'eros' someone without 'agapaing' them and vice versa. I used to think that romantic love was the simple combination of like and lust: that it resided in the heart because it was between the brain and the genitals, as such. Not until I fell in love did I see this was inadaquete.\n \n \n \n \nOK, but basing any argument on a position that by definition does not rely on evidence is absurd to me.\nWell, you don't know it isn't based on evidence, though you're probably right. But certainly, it seems out of context of the rest of his argument.\n \n \nThanks for keeping the tone neutral, I find that rare on such topics.\n \n -Mach\nWell, thanks for responding sensibly: it's hard to find religious or non-religious forums such as this who will discuss rather than throwing insults and generalisations around. It's very important to me, as it allows real exchange of ideas. Also, I find it easy as I do not have a clear position and can sympathise with atheist and strongly religious, and tend to disagree with whoever I'm speaking with: thus the incident of me being called an atheist antichrist and ordered 'back to my cathedral' on the same day ;)\n \n If you are willing to discuss such topics on such unemotive grounds, I would find it interesting, although as I am not religious as such it might be best if we find a third, confessedly religious individual to add to our debates.",

   "You have returned to 'make up'. The point is that ideas of God, like ideas of space, time, causality, morality etc. seem to be the way that people process the world. It's not an a priori belief, but it is an a priori tendency. To follow Jung, God as an archetype exists in the human collective unconscious, although he is only consciously known under certain circumstances\n When I read \"a priori\" I start thinking crazy person. I understand the notion that the brain is wired a certain way, however we seem to be able to deconstruct that and put it, like everything else, into a logical, reasoned system of knowledge. Just like theology, which in some cases is a reasoned, logical approach to studying unreasonable, illogical systems.\n \n \nFirstly, you assume that there are better ways to deal with reality, but the religious are often happier, and according to some definitions more mentally healthy.\n\n \n Of course I assume that! I divide them up though to make sense of it, two different things:\n \n 1. Describing reality (knowing it), through science\n 2. Dealing with reality -< your choice, as long as you to not DENY reality on a regular basis. This is \"dealing\" with the human condition.\n \n There is no other rational way to gather knowledge of reality. There are plenty of ways to deal with the human condition, including even physical means such as alcohol, drugs, even surgery. \n \n As to health, reason seems to be the only ethical approach to existence, but we shouldn't cloud the dsicussion, a new topic would be great for that.\n \n \nYou assume religion is defined by its dogma. In such as sense, than you are right that it is definitionally a conscious choice. However, Glock (1962), a psychologist of religion defined 5 types of religiousness: beliefs, practise, feelings, knowledge and effects. It seems likely that belief would be the first of these, and practise may well precede belief and knowledge, which seems to be your definition. Rites can precede abstract understandings of what is going on in them.\n\n \n But, fundamental combinations of A and B are sitll combinations of A and B. A common \"error\" often seen with people claiming to be reasonable when they use both faith AND reason for some particular thing (threads on this board I'm sure). The system of belief you describe is a combination of faith and reason. Sure, the reasoned parts make sense, but the religious mumbo jumbo is still ethically bankrupt and IMO dangerous to us humans. \n \n I'll show you. My super faith, call it Forumism, combines both practice and knowledge and observation, as well as dogmatic belief that Z is a planet hidden in a volcano on earth.\n \n Now, realistically the notion of \"Z\" is illogical, but the important thing isn't that dogmatic beliefs are irrational, it's that any system, like Forumism, is still classified as a \"faith based system\". Indeed, it meets the definition. Reasonable systems are self-consistent and all knowledge requires evidence/observation. All, being the operative word here. Even if \"Z\" is the only dumb thing in Forumism, it's still not a reasonable system as a system. It's pass/fail.\n \n \nThat seems reasonable. My point is that religion is 'natural' in that it seems to arise in similar forms in human individuals and societies.\n\n The same can be said for non-believers, they naturally appear in all human societies, so do homosexuals, so do rapists, it's all natural. That's why nature isn't a good guide to ethics :)\n \n \nOK. I see more what you mean. But your definition of consciousness seems to be more 'free will'. Identity is the foundation of logic, correct?\n\n In general, yes. Sentience, another word, all have roughly the same meaning I think in this respect. \"Consciousness\" was taken directly from objectivism (which means nothing, I put no faith in any philosophy, especially objectivism, Rand just so happened to have written the basics of reasoning down).\n \n \nI would argue that these are OK as long as we don't stretch them too far. do you mean that I have to accept your physical existence as a starting point? Because that isn't foundational for me. Also, we should bear in mind that any conclusions based on these axioms are only provisional, unless we prove the axioms. And that the axioms can't prove themselves, of course. \n Only if we intend to remain reasonable. If you are debating with \"me\", and you reject the notion that I am, then you're entering into lala land, and I cannot follow ;). As to what \"I\" am, there is only one reasoned answer...another human, similar to you in terms of consciousness, but a different identity. Does that mean I CANNOT be a machine? No, it just means to believe that would be \"unreasonable\" since you have no evidence to support that, or even to support that it's possible given today's technology. And I agree on \"provisional\", but keep it in context. ALL science is provisional, based on...drum roll...evidence/observation! See how it all works out? Makes it easier on my mind...\n \n \nAlso, if you check out the stages of cognitive development according to Jean Piaget, and the work done on these by later psychologists, there is a general agreement that most children will either discard these beliefs or make them more complex as the rest of their reasoning matures.\n I know, that's why we have apologetics, ID, the political movement of the religious right, super churches that make hundreds of millions tax free, etc. Just because something is based on bad reasoning, doesn't mean it cannot be complex. Sophistry is arguably a more \"complex\" system than reasoned debate anyway :) \n \n \nI said there may be a need for a symbolic life, and religion can provide this. This is the idea of Jung, who stresses that this need for 'religion', did not mean orthodox or traditional forms. If the symbols of Catholicism were not living for you: if they did not channel your experience of the world and allow you to grow and develop psychically, then discarding them is the best thing to do 'religiously'. Jung does use the term 'religion', but as you connect this with dogma, perhaps, 'the numinous' is better: a need for a higher, more inner understanding.\n\n I disagree with Jung about dogma or religion providing that need. Heroic leaders of certain pagan warrior cultures were revered for their prowess in battle and their ability to give their soldiers a purpose..worth dying for in many cases. It met those \"needs\". Just as a fulfilling career can meet those nodes in a large segment of society. Are they shooting for REAL things? No, generally they form a set of ideals, and strive for them, knowing they will never actually attain them. Same thing, just sans religious faith based mythology.\n \n \nYou assume the role of religion is to deny or fabricate reality, by which I suspect you mean empirical external reality. I would say that it is more to do with human reality: the psyche.\n\n If all religions of the world, especially in America where I live, did was promote reasonable guidelines for helping the psyche and society, I wouldn't be posting (well, probably not). As it turns out, it's primarily promoted as dogmatic truths, and on large scales used to gain power by a minority (through money and influence). I care about human society, I must also care about those things I think harm it.\n \n \nYou seem to be working on a principle of agape: what you call unconditional love. I was referring to eros: romantic love. \n\n Good analysis, and that leads right to me agreeing. Yes, religion is emotionally based, not based on reason, which is why it's not reliable to based anything important on. It's most certainly filling a need for the reptillian brain. Again though, it's not the only way to tickle that lizard (see non-religous ways above)\n \n \n \nthus the incident of me being called an atheist antichrist and ordered 'back to my cathedral' on the same day ;)\n\n I can see it! :)\n \n -Mach\n \n OK, unless you have a burning question in a response, I'll be happy to leave it at that.",

My reference was not to the intelligence applied to the concepts, but the level of intellectual advancement (different to IQ) that the concepts themselves show.\n \n \nI disagree with Jung about dogma or religion providing that need. Heroic leaders of certain pagan warrior cultures were revered for their prowess in battle and their ability to give their soldiers a purpose..worth dying for in many cases. It met those \"needs\". Just as a fulfilling career can meet those nodes in a large segment of society. Are they shooting for REAL things? No, generally they form a set of ideals, and strive for them, knowing they will never actually attain them. Same thing, just sans religious faith based mythology.\nI doubt that warfare alone was enough: religion, culture, tribe, family would have been present. And the point is that careers often leave people with a mid-life crisis, a sense of unfulfillment etc. Religion, at the very least, was found to be theraputic for Jung: he said that not a single person he cured in the latter half of their life (after 35), was not suffering from alienation from religion or a symbolic life in this sense.\n \n \nIf all religions of the world, especially in America where I live, did was promote reasonable guidelines for helping the psyche and society, I wouldn't be posting (well, probably not).

The catastrophe -- one of the largest, if not the largest forest fire in recorded history -- resulted in Congress appropriating money for fire suppression by the U.S. Forest Service in the national forests. Congress had set aside the national forests in the 1890s to guarantee a timber supply and for other uses.

Otherwise, not so much.\n\n \n You should be very careful. I work in the medicaid funded system. I am quite aware of what they do in other countries. Canada (a third world country by the way) is the closest and they have nearly no service funded for folks with mental illness and disability. Not that it does not exist only that it cannot support the population even close.\n \n Still, it is an easy thing to prove that the US has the single highest standard of living for all of its citizens.\n \n Here are some basic statistics from the UN. You will see that saying the US is not \"blessed\" in comparison to other countries is a highly questionable position to take.\n \n EF\n \n Facts and figures about conditions in human settlements from UN-HABITAT's State of the World's Cities: 2001\n \n Shelter\n \u0095 75% of the world's countries have constitutions or national laws that promote the full and progressive realisation of the right to adequate housing. \n \u0095 61% of countries in the world have constitutions or national laws that protect against forced evictions. \n \u0095 Households in cities of developing countries need an average of 8 times their annual income to buying a house; in Africa, they need an average of 12.5 times their annual income, while in Latin America, they only need 5.4 times their annual income. The highest rents are in the Arab States, where a household spends an average of 45% of its monthly income on rent.\n \u0095 One out of every four countries in the developing world have constitutions or national laws which prevent women from owning land and/or taking mortgages in their own names. Customary or legal constraints to women owning land or property are highest in Africa, the Arab States, Asia and Latin America.\n \u0095 Real estate costs are highest in Asia and the Pacific where one square metre of land for a serviced plot costs an average of US$ 3.1. Africa is at the lowest end of the real estate market with an average price of US$ 0.15 per square metre.\n \u0095 Less than 20% of households in Africa are connected to piped water and only 40% have access to water within 200 meters of their house.\n \n Society\n \u0095 5.8% of children in cities of the developing world die before reaching the age of five years. \n \u0095 29% of cities in the developing world have areas considered as inaccessible or dangerous to the police. In Latin America and the Caribbean, this figure is 48 %.\n \u0095 In cities of the developing world, one out of every four households lives in poverty. 40% of African urban households and 25% of Latin American urban households are living below the locally defined poverty lines.\n \n Environment\n \u0095 City dwellers in Africa only use 50 litres of water per person per day. The highest median price of water is also highest in Africa. \n \u0095 In highly industrialised countries, almost 100% of households are connected to piped water. The average water consumption for these households is 215 litres per person daily.\n \u0095 Less than 35% of cities in the developing world have their wastewater treated. \n \u0095 In countries with economies in transition, 75% of solid wastes are disposed of in open dumps. \n \u0095 71% of the world's cities have building codes with anti-cyclone and anti-seismic building standards based on hazard and vulnerability assessment.\n \u0095 Buses and minibuses are the most common mode of transport in the world's cities. Cars are the second most common mode used, while walking is the third most common mode. Travel time in Asian cities appears to be the longest with an average of 42 minutes per trip. \n \n \n Economy\n \u0095 37% of the population in cities of the developing world is employed within the informal sector. \n \u0095 70% of the world's cities have developed city-to-city international co-operation. 68% of these cities are affiliated to one or more international association of local authorities.\n \u0095 63% of the world's cities have established new public-private partnerships in the last five years.\n \n \n Governance\n \u0095 49% of the world's cities have established urban environmental plans.\n \u0095 The absolute quantity of local government income varies enormously, with total local government revenue per person in cities of highly industrialised countries being 9 times that of cities in the developing world, 39 times that of African cities and 18 times that of Latin American cities. \n \u0095 60% of the world's cities involve civil society in a formal participatory process prior to the implementation of major public projects. \n \u0095 70% of cities in the world undertake regular independent auditing of municipal accounts. 78% of the world's cities publicly announce contracts and tenders for municipal services. 55% of cities have laws that govern disclosure of potential conflict of interest.\n \n \n \n For further information, please contact : Mr. Sharad Shankardass, Spokesperson, or Ms. Zahra Hassan, Press & Media Liaison, Press & Media Relations Unit, Tel: (254 2) 623153/623151, Fax: (254 2) 624060, E-mail: habitat.press@unhabitat.org, Website: www.unhabitat.org",

The fact that you tend to run from your opinion without sustantiation is, in actuality the definition of \"blathering\". The fact that you disagree with the President is obvious, and good people can agree to disagree. However, If you wish to dismiss the fact that the U.S. has been \"blessed\"- the next logical step would be for you to define \"Blessing\".\n \n Again, the Israeli children were proclaimed to be under God's blessing when they were comfortable and prosperous. For you to disagree, you must define \"blessed\" in your vocabulary. Bush being President or not has no bearing on the definition. Perhaps YOU aren't blessed because Bush is President, but that would be a situation of your own making- not God. \n \n \n particualrly underneath bush is more than a little sad. \n\n \n What you mean is YOU are a little sad- which has nothing to do with the nation being blessed, or not blessed. I think you would do well to organize your thoughts, get your emotions under control and THEN come back and represent your ideas with a little more logic and cohesivness. Otherwise you're going to continue to sound like an adolecent who failed to get his way.\n Having said this, you still haven't deliniated what is and isn't \"blessed\". Whereas I've given you an historical, and accurate definition.\n \n \nI am sure all those brave military men and women who were maimed and killed think the U.S. is not so blessed because of Bushes actions.\n\n \n I would challenge you to prove that position. If you can, I'll concede it. What I know from the military people my dad deals with on a regular basis is \"yeah, we want to come home, but we want to come home when we've finished what we started\". They believe in, and are steadfast in their devotion to the mission. My dad works with the military daily, and his insight would carry far more gravitas than an obscure opinion started with \"Im sure the\". Again, you need to put your emotions on the back burner, collect your FACTS, then come back and present your position from that perspective. I think you'll be disappointed in what those facts truly are.\n But again, sorry if I've violated your sensitivities by not being \"tactful\".",

Even if I don't agree with him, I can see the point Easyrider is trying to make. Basically without taxes to do that, people would have more to donate as they want to. Now I'm sure some would just take it and not donate any to the less fortunate people, but I would hope more people could be compassionate, but think of it this way. They are taking your money and giving it to people for healthcare. No asking permission, no nothing.

I'll build another library. You agree it's good for the government to build libraries (I know I do), so how about I go in, steal your money, and use it to help me build it? What? You like money more than other people having the opportunity to read?\n \n In my opinion this is how it should be. Healthcare is not provided to anyone initially. The people who can afford it can buy it if they want to. The people who can show they can't afford it are given it for free or a reduced price if they can afford it. This (along with schools) are one of the core things I think is important to provide everyone an opportunity for.

   "Answering the Rabbis . . . \n \n Faith and Law \n \n Rabbi Simlai said, \"Moses gave Israel 613 commandments. David reduced them to 10, Isaiah to 2, but Habakkuk to one: the righteous shall live by his faith\" (Makkot 23b). \n \n What does it mean that the righteous shall live by his faith? If we were to suppose that to live by faith is to live in perfect obedience to all 613 commandments, then no-one, apart from the Messiah, would be declared faithful and no-one would ever be declared righteous in the sight of God. If to live by faith means living in obedience to the whole Law, then Rabbi Simlai's comment is of no consequence. In other words, living by faith is not based upon obedience to the law. \n \n Jesus reminded the Pharisees that faithfulness to God was not determined by strict observance of the law: \"Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread - which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests\" (Matthew 12:3-4). Those who do not live by faith, but who try to attain righteousness through observance of the law, condemn themselves whenever they break even the least of the commandments: For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it (James 2:10). \n \n Many Jews understand living by faith as a collective obligation of the community to resist assimilation and to reject pagan religious beliefs and practices. But true faithfulness is not expressed just by holding to a belief. As James points out, even satan and the demons believe that there is only one God and are terrified by his power and authority (James 2:19), but that does not make them faithful. Neither is faithfulness simply a matter of observing rules and religious traditions: \"These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men\" (Isaiah 29:13). \n \n Faithfulness for an Israelite is expressed through faithfulness to the covenant established by God. Membership of the covenant nation was not merely by birth or by circumcision. The Law stipulated many examples of disobedience for which a person was to be completely cut off (excommunicated) from the covenant community. The most serious act of unfaithfulness, for which a person was to be cut off from the covenant community, was to refuse to heed the word of God spoken through the Messiah (Deuteronomy 18:19). Even (the Jewish Rabbi) Maimonides, though not acknowledging that Jesus is the Messiah, affirmed that faithfulness to God is expressed by believing in the Messiah: \"Whoever does not believe in him (the Messiah), or does not hope for his coming, shows a lack of faith not only in the prophets, but also in the Torah.\" \n True faithfulness is found only in the Messiah (the Anointed King), in whom the whole nation is corporately represented. Any faith that is not established upon him represents unfaithfulness. Yet the great irony is that many Jewish people are afraid to confess their faith in Jesus the Messiah for fear of losing their Jewish identity and being ostracized by the rest of the unbelieving Jewish community! \n \n Following the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem in 70AD, a divine judgment against the people for failing to listen to the Messiah, every effort was made by the Rabbis to preserve Jewish identity and religion - although it had become practically impossible to observe two-thirds of the law. By manipulating and exploiting the people's ignorance of Scripture and fear of assimilation the Rabbis succeeded in establishing a stronghold over the people, predicating Jewish identity on a denial of Jesus, the very one in whom true Jewish identity is to be found and through whom true faithfulness to God has been revealed! The Jewish leaders were destined to reject their Anointed King Messiah, the very Cornerstone of the Jewish faith (see Psalm 118:22). The Lord warned that judgment would come against the leaders: \n \n But the people have not returned to him who struck them, nor have they sought the Lord Almighty. So the Lord will cut off from Israel both head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day; the elders and prominent men are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail. Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astr#ay (Isaiah 9:13-16). \n \n Tragically, many people are held in religious bondage and have not been set free to worship God in Spirit and in truth, yet they remain in the darkness, naively believing that they are steadfastly faithful to their religion, culture and nation. Einstein said that it is far easier to smash an atom than to smash a prejudice. Jewish people are born into a prejudice that has been established for centuries and which keeps many Jews from the knowledge of the Messiah. The Rabbis keep the Jewish people under the bondage of sin because they insist that righteousness may be attained by observing the law, but, as the apostle Paul wrote, \"the law is not based on faith\" (Galatians 3:12). It is impossible to be made righteous through observing the Law. True faith is to believe and trust in God's promise of redemption which has been fulfilled through Jesus the Messiah: For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: \"The righteous will live by faith\" (Romans 1:17). \n \n messianicgoodnews.org",

   "Jewish Rabbis, etc., on the Afterlife, the Resurrection, and Hell\n \n Reward & Punishment:\n \n What do the Rabbis teach about the concept of the good being rewarded and the evil being punished? What does that entail? Is it similar to what Christians believe? Is there such a thing as \"eternal hell\" in the Jewish Faith??\n \n Answer:\n One of the basic principles of Judaism is that God rewards those who obey His commands and punishes those who disobey. The primary place for both reward and punishment is the afterlife. It is, of course, nearly impossible for us to have any real idea what the actual nature of this reward and punishment is like. While I suspect that the basic idea is similar to that of Christianity, there are probably some important differences. I am not familiar, in any detail, with Christian theology on this point.\n <b<Regarding \"eternal hell\", the Talmud teaches us that sinners are released from Hell (Gehinnom in Hebrew) after 12 months (Eduyos 2:10). There are, however, some exceptions to this rule in cases of extreme wickedness where the punishment is truly eternal (Talmud Rosh HaShana 17a).</b<\n \n http://members.aol.com/lazera/archive/belief.html\n \n From Rabbi Yaakov Feldman (Torah.org)\n \n There are two facets of the afterlife: \"Gan Eden\", and \"Gehenom\". Gan Eden (which translates as \"The Garden of Eden\" since it's the spiritual counterpart of the earthly Garden depicted in Genesis) is where the soul delights in G-d. And Gehenom (which is usually taken to be \"hell\" but is actually different) is where the soul suffers the consequences of its misdeeds.\n \n Understand of course that the consequences the soul suffers in Gehenom are spiritual in nature. After all, the body is buried in the ground, so anything that happens after death is non-physical. The sort of \"pain\" the soul suffers in Gehenom can best be depicted as an existential anguish and mortal discomfit brought on by catching sight of oneself for the first time. \n \n http://www.torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class47.html\n \n Rabbis Meir and Levi - Afterlife in the Torah\n \n \n Rabbi Meir said: Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage: \"Then will Moses and the children of Israel sing this song to the Lord [Exodus 15:1]. It does not say \"sang\" but rather \"will sing\". Therefore, resurrection is deducible from the Torah. Again, Rabbi Joshua b. Levi asked: \"Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah?

So, the execution of Jesus by the Romans on the cross was not an acceptable sacrifice. \n \n\n \n Au contraire. \n \n The parallels between Gen 22, in which God orders Abraham to sacrifice his son, and the cross on which Jesus is sacrificed as the Lamb of God are obvious, but here are a few notes. The sacrifice of Isaac was a 'type' of the Old Testament. It looks forward to its ultimate fulfillment in the New Testament. On its own, it looks like God is just testing the faith of Abraham (Gen 22:1). But in the light of the New Testament and the cross we can see the heart of God when He sacrificed his one and only Son, whom He loved on the cross. The result was that He would get a bride for his Son, that is, the church.\n First, note how the NT comments on this passage:\n (Heb 11:17-19 NIV) By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, {18} even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" {19} Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. \n In order to understand God's test of Abraham we have to know that God's promises to Abraham specifically said that they would be fulfilled through his son Isaac. God does not test us without giving us his promises. God has given us his promises in the bible.\n Gen 17:19 Then God said, \"Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. \n (Gen 21:12 NIV) But God said to him, \"Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. \n Abraham is listed in Heb 11 as a man of faith. We should note that his obedience in being prepared to obey God's order to sacrifice Isaac was based on God's previous dealings with him. His faith was not blind faith. It was based on his own experience of God. God had previously said to Abraham \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\"\n Now, we have the Genesis account.\n (Gen 22 NIV) Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, \"Abraham!\" \"Here I am,\" he replied. {2} Then God said, \"Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.\" \n &#61623; \"Some time later\" - Isaac, the son of promise, had been born, and Abraham had sent Ishmael and Hagar away. Isaac would have been a young man by then. \n &#61623; Abraham was open to the voice of God, God speaks and he says \"Here I am\" \n &#61623; This is stated as a 'test'. Does Abraham really believe the promises that God has already made about Isaac? Gen 17:19, Gen 21:12 \n &#61623; Abraham was told to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved. This parallels Jesus \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\". Mat 3:17, John 3:16, Heb 11:17, 1 John 4:9. \n &#61623; Through Abraham, the father of Isaac. We see and feel the father heart of God as he sacrifices Jesus on the cross. \n &#61623; Abraham exhibits faith in God's promises, that would be fulfilled through Isaac and his descendants, Gen 17:19, Gen 21:12, Heb 11:17-18 \n &#61623; As a result of his faith in God's promises Abraham was obedient. Note: faith results in obedience, and faith has an object, God's promises. \n &#61623; If God sacrificed Isaac, then Abraham reasoned that God would raise Isaac from the dead in order to keep his promise to Abraham. Heb 11:19 \n &#61623; It was God's will to afflict his son, Isa 53:4 \n &#61623; A burnt offering is a pleasing aroma to the Lord (Gen 8:20, Exo 29:18 ). Jesus was also a fragrant offering to God, Eph 5:2. See also Phil 4:18 \n &#61623; Mt Moriah was where Solomon's Temple was built. 2 Chr 3:1 Where future burnt offerings would be made 1 Ki 8:64 \n {Gen 22:3} Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. {4} On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. {5} He said to his servants, \"Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.\" {6} Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, {7} Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, \"Father?\" \"Yes, my son?\" Abraham replied. \"The fire and wood are here,\" Isaac said, \"but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\" {8} Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" And the two of them went on together. \n &#61623; \"Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey.\" Abraham did not delay his obedience to the voice of God. \n &#61623; Jesus went to Jerusalem on a donkey \n &#61623; Two servants went with Isaac, just as two thieves where crucified with Jesus. \n &#61623; Third day, Jesus rose on the third day, Abraham received his son back on the third day alive. \n &#61623; v5 \"We will worship and then we will come back to you\" - this was an act of worship on Abraham's part (Rom 12:1), and he expected to come back with the boy. \n &#61623; Isaac carried the wood for his sacrifice just as Jesus carried his cross to the place of execution. \n &#61623; God provided Jesus as the lamb. \n &#61623; Jesus is our sacrificial lamb, 1 Cor 5:7. \n &#61623; The father was to sacrifice his son. The crucifixion of Jesus was the father's idea, Acts 2:23. \n {Gen 22:9} When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. {10} Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. {11} But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, \"Abraham! Abraham!\" \"Here I am,\" he replied. {12} \"Do not lay a hand on the boy,\" he said. \"Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.\" \n &#61623; Abraham was open to the voice of God, God speaks and he says \"Here I am\" \n &#61623; The intent of Abraham to sacrifice his son, was as good as the deed. God tested Abraham to the fullest extent, and he passed the test. \n &#61623; Abraham did not withhold his only son, the son whom he loved. Just as God did not withhold his only son, whom he loved, to pay for our sins. Mat 3:17. He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-- Rom 8:32 \n &#61623; Jesus was sacrificed on the altar of the cross to pay for our sins. 1 Cor 5:7 Eph 5:2 \n &#61623; Isaac yields himself to his fathers will. Just as Jesus yields himself to his Father's will. Luke 22:42 \n {Gen 22:13} Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. {14} So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, \"On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.\" \n &#61623; God provided the ram as a substitute for Isaac.

   "Au contraire. \n \n The parallels between Gen 22, in which God orders Abraham to sacrifice his son, and the cross on which Jesus is sacrificed as the Lamb of God are obvious, but here are a few notes. The sacrifice of Isaac was a 'type' of the Old Testament. It looks forward to its ultimate fulfillment in the New Testament. On its own, it looks like God is just testing the faith of Abraham (Gen 22:1). But in the light of the New Testament and the cross we can see the heart of God when He sacrificed his one and only Son, whom He loved on the cross. The result was that He would get a bride for his Son, that is, the church.\n First, note how the NT comments on this passage:\n (Heb 11:17-19 NIV) By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, {18} even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" {19} Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. \n In order to understand God's test of Abraham we have to know that God's promises to Abraham specifically said that they would be fulfilled through his son Isaac. God does not test us without giving us his promises. God has given us his promises in the bible.\n Gen 17:19 Then God said, \"Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. \n (Gen 21:12 NIV) But God said to him, \"Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. \n Abraham is listed in Heb 11 as a man of faith. We should note that his obedience in being prepared to obey God's order to sacrifice Isaac was based on God's previous dealings with him. His faith was not blind faith. It was based on his own experience of God. God had previously said to Abraham \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\"\n Now, we have the Genesis account.\n (Gen 22 NIV) Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, \"Abraham!\" \"Here I am,\" he replied. {2} Then God said, \"Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.\" \n &#61623; \"Some time later\" - Isaac, the son of promise, had been born, and Abraham had sent Ishmael and Hagar away. Isaac would have been a young man by then. \n &#61623; Abraham was open to the voice of God, God speaks and he says \"Here I am\" \n &#61623; This is stated as a 'test'. Does Abraham really believe the promises that God has already made about Isaac? Gen 17:19, Gen 21:12 \n &#61623; Abraham was told to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved. This parallels Jesus \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\". Mat 3:17, John 3:16, Heb 11:17, 1 John 4:9. \n &#61623; Through Abraham, the father of Isaac. We see and feel the father heart of God as he sacrifices Jesus on the cross. \n &#61623; Abraham exhibits faith in God's promises, that would be fulfilled through Isaac and his descendants, Gen 17:19, Gen 21:12, Heb 11:17-18 \n &#61623; As a result of his faith in God's promises Abraham was obedient. Note: faith results in obedience, and faith has an object, God's promises. \n &#61623; If God sacrificed Isaac, then Abraham reasoned that God would raise Isaac from the dead in order to keep his promise to Abraham. Heb 11:19 \n &#61623; It was God's will to afflict his son, Isa 53:4 \n &#61623; A burnt offering is a pleasing aroma to the Lord (Gen 8:20, Exo 29:18 ). Jesus was also a fragrant offering to God, Eph 5:2. See also Phil 4:18 \n &#61623; Mt Moriah was where Solomon's Temple was built. 2 Chr 3:1 Where future burnt offerings would be made 1 Ki 8:64 \n {Gen 22:3} Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. {4} On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. {5} He said to his servants, \"Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.\" {6} Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, {7} Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, \"Father?\" \"Yes, my son?\" Abraham replied. \"The fire and wood are here,\" Isaac said, \"but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\" {8} Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" And the two of them went on together. \n &#61623; \"Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey.\" Abraham did not delay his obedience to the voice of God. \n &#61623; Jesus went to Jerusalem on a donkey \n &#61623; Two servants went with Isaac, just as two thieves where crucified with Jesus. \n &#61623; Third day, Jesus rose on the third day, Abraham received his son back on the third day alive. \n &#61623; v5 \"We will worship and then we will come back to you\" - this was an act of worship on Abraham's part (Rom 12:1), and he expected to come back with the boy. \n &#61623; Isaac carried the wood for his sacrifice just as Jesus carried his cross to the place of execution. \n &#61623; God provided Jesus as the lamb. \n &#61623; Jesus is our sacrificial lamb, 1 Cor 5:7. \n &#61623; The father was to sacrifice his son. The crucifixion of Jesus was the father's idea, Acts 2:23. \n {Gen 22:9} When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. {10} Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. {11} But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, \"Abraham! Abraham!\" \"Here I am,\" he replied. {12} \"Do not lay a hand on the boy,\" he said. \"Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.\" \n &#61623; Abraham was open to the voice of God, God speaks and he says \"Here I am\" \n &#61623; The intent of Abraham to sacrifice his son, was as good as the deed. God tested Abraham to the fullest extent, and he passed the test. \n &#61623; Abraham did not withhold his only son, the son whom he loved. Just as God did not withhold his only son, whom he loved, to pay for our sins. Mat 3:17. He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-- Rom 8:32 \n &#61623; Jesus was sacrificed on the altar of the cross to pay for our sins. 1 Cor 5:7 Eph 5:2 \n &#61623; Isaac yields himself to his fathers will. Just as Jesus yields himself to his Father's will. Luke 22:42 \n {Gen 22:13} Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. {14} So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, \"On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.\" \n &#61623; God provided the ram as a substitute for Isaac. God provided his Son who died as our substitute for our sins. \n &#61623; The mountain of the Lord is the same mountain that Jesus was crucified. \n &#61623; The Lord will provide - Jehovah-jireh \n {Gen 22:15} The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time {16} and said, \"I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, {17} I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, {18} and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.\" {19} Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba. \n &#61623; In the words above God ratifies his covenant to Abraham, see Gen 17:19, Gen 21:12 \n &#61623; \"through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed\" ,This is fulfilled when Jesus died for our sins, then people from every nation will be blessed (Great commission, Mat 28:19), Rev 5:9. \n &#61623; \"because you have obeyed me\", because Jesus obeyed God, he would bring many sons to glory. Heb 2:10 \n &#61623; God did not withhold his only son, Rom 8:32 \n &#61623; Abraham received his son 'back from the dead', Heb 11:19. \n {Gen 22:20} Some time later Abraham was told, \"Milcah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: {21} Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), {22} Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.\" {23} Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.

And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.\n \n 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: 'In the mount where HaShem is seen.'\n \n 15 And the angel of HaShem called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,\n \n 16 and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith HaShem, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,\n \n 17 that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;\n \n 18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.'\n\n \n \n Further from: Essay\n The Binding of Isaac: Event and Edifice\n by Yanki Tauber\n \n His essay says: \nMaimonides[3] explains that the akeidah (the \"binding [of Isaac]\") served to establish two key axioms of the Jewish faith: \n \n a) the extent of man's capacity to love, fear and serve G-d; \n \n b) the principle of \"prophecy\" - the fact that G-d communicates His will to man. \n \n By binding Isaac upon the altar, Abraham demonstrated that man is capable of a love and awe of G-d that surpasses his every other feeling or commitment. For what greater love is there than the love of a parent for his child? What greater fear is there than a parent's fear for the life of his child?[4]\n \n With the akeidah, Abraham set his commitment to G-d above these most basic truths of human nature, establishing it as the all-surpassing consideration in the life of man. \n \n Beyond the Most Unreasonable Doubt\n \n \n The second truth established by the akeidah is the principle of prophecy. \n \n \n\n \n Please note nothing about no human sacrifice\n \n and also Rabbi Judah states \nR. Judah says: When the sword touched Isaac's throat his soul flew clean out of him. And when He let His voice be heard from between the cherubim, \"Lay not thy hand upon the lad.\" The lad's soul was returned to his body. Then his father unbound him and Isaac rose, knowing that in this way the dead would come back to life in the future; whereupon he began to recite, \"Blessed are You, LORD, who resurrects the dead.\" (Pirkei Rabbi Elieazer) \n \n \n showing that this is actually a foreshadowing of resurrection doctrine.\n \n also from: TEST OF FAITH \n \n by Steve Lerner \n Torah from Dixie Staff Writer \n \n \nEven the manner in which Hashem commands Abraham in the beginning of the akeidah, and toward the end, seems to follow the above pattern. The original request to take Isaac is conveyed through the name of Hashem which corresponds to the measure of strict justice, Elokim. The command to spare Isaac is voiced in the name of Hashem which corresponds to mercy and compassion. The akeidah, therefore seems to be a reenactment in human terms of what took place in Hashem's mind during creation regarding the form of justice which would be appropriate for this world. \n \n \n\n \n This does not show that there is no need for further sacrifice, it establishes the personality of God as being both Just and Merciful. \n \n It forshadows the need for all of human sin to be paid for. \n \n All of these point not to the lack of a need for the sacrifice of Jesus but rather this combined with continuing and repeated animal sacrifices show that only God in the form of man COULD actually make the necessary sacrifice.\n \n The interpretation in the definition you provided is not exactly \"scripture\" per se but I have given the actual scripture which is from a jewish website that shows no where in it the interpretation held. It merely states the event. You can also see by these other passages that there are many interpretations to the scripture within the jewish community.\n \n I find it interesting Trebor that you use orthodox interpretations and reformed interpretations where they fit for your argument and the two sects are often at odds on interpretation. Is there one that you particularly hold to?\n \n EF",

   "That's pretty dumb. That's like saying that you hate all people except the ones who have no gender becasue people have fought the opposite gender, or saying all people are bad because theyh all have a race and major issues often have something to do with race. That's like saying people are bad because they are mean to other people. How can you hate a broad topic because a subcategory did something bad? You must hate all cats too becasue they fight eachother a lot. You must hate dogs, fish, birds, bunnies... etc..... you must be a very hateful person. Is there anyone you can like? I don't think so, because everyone has done something bad at some point. You must be such a misanthrope! I pity you.. You are missing out.

Man makes the choice.\n \n For love to be truly love, it must be freely given and received.

It simply makes no sense.\n \n This is why I say it is arrogant. I have the right to question just as you do. I am not saying you have no right to question God's existence, merely that judging him as a murderer is very arrogant given who you are and who he is.

The problem with that is that the beliefs are well documented long before the church was established. Especially if you consider religion in general. Your argument simply does not logically wash.\n\n \n hmm, if this were correct, and morales were established in or out of religion...Why is it we need the church again?\n \n \nPeople have the free will to choose or not choose. God hardening people's hearts or commanding the destruction of an army or city or what have you, are items that are not understood by simply taking them out of context as you have done. You provide no logical analysis, no context either historical or otherwise, and therefore no proof or even real argumentation. \n\n \n If our destiny is known, as it must be since God is supposedly all-knowing, then there is no action we can make to yield an alternate destiny. This is because actions that would yield a destiny unknown to God would mean that God is not omniscient, which is impossible. That means that the only possible actions we can make are actions that coincide with what will yield the destiny He knew we were going to have.\n \n Our actions are predetermined, they follow a set path that God already knows about.\n \n What is this free will you talk about?\n \n \nGod did choose the hebrews to be his own people. He did bring judgement on those who harmed those. He did use people for HIS own glory. However, as a perfect and infinite being He would actually been unjust if he bowed to the will of a human which is finite, and imperfect. God did create man with the choice. Man makes the choice\n \n For love to be truly love, it must be freely given and received. If God did not create man with choice then there would be no such thing as love.\n\n \n As above, we dont really have the choice. We have to follow his predetermined set path. If we dont then god didnt know about it, if that is the case, then he is not perfect and all knowing.\n \n Your agument is that the Bible says god is all-loving, but his actions contradict, therefore an all-loving Christian God does not exist.\n \n There are way too many holes the Bible doesn't fill. If God does exist, he certainly isn't all-loving, so the Bible would be wrong(For God so loved the world...=no, he didn't he destroyed most of it once and apparently plans to do it again). The Bible contradicts itself and provides too many paradoxical situations for it to make any sense or have any sort of validity.\n \n \nIf I am wrong here, please provide me a reference and analysis other than you simply stating that God must be evil because he commands the deaths of others. God is GOD and you are not.\n \n \n Thankfully I am not god, never claimed to be, never will. I just dont think I have it in me to throw a temper tantrum and slaughter countless men, women, children and animals on a whim just because i happen to feel like it one day.\n \n \nTherefore, it would be wrong for you to judge the infinite.

   "First off I'd like to say thank you for staying civil in posting. Most of the time I ponder/pose questions to people they get annoyed right off the bat and result to bashing more than anything else. Which in turn annoys me. But thanks\n \n Secondly, I came to this thread a little late so I must clarify my stance a little. I dont HATE religion as the title states, its more of I dont understand why, as a society, people choose to follow it blindly.\n\n \n You are welcome. Thank you for accepting these as arguments and not attacks.\n \n \nNeither can any proof of Adam or Eve or Abraham or countless other ficticious stories the bible claims happened. All we had is someone's word that it happened. Yes that is the basis for faith but as our intelligence grows as a species, we must question the reasoning behind why people 2000+ years ago thought the way they did.\n\n \n Actually, all we have is someone's word that MUCH of history happened. We simply cannot observe it. I have posted elsewhere in this forum concerning the evidence for events in the bible actually occurring. There is as much evidence of the events 2000 or 4000 or 6000 years ago as described in the bible and more than there are for events such as hannible crossing the alps, for the existence of socrates, for des cartes writings, for the early mesopotamian wars, for the babylonian conflicts etc. This is what I meant by contextual arguments. For one to say that the bible is fictitious and then not talk about a comparison of evidence between biblical events and events for extrabiblical events denies the context.\n \n \n \n \nhmm, if this were correct, and morales were established in or out of religion...Why is it we need the church again?!\n\n \n The Church was established by Jesus, not to have morals (morale is the term used to describe how I am feeling about an event), but rather to spread the news about the God of Love. He did say after all that the greatest commandment was to love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul and the second greatest was to love your neighbor as yourself. It is not a matter of living a moral life ( a list of do's and don'ts) but rather living a life of Love. This can only be done in dependence on God. This is what the church is to do. To love one another and to love their community. \n \n Sadly many churches do not do this but spout morals and condemnation and give a wrong view of God based on their own self righteous attitudes rather than what scripture says.\n \n \n \n \nIf our destiny is known, as it must be since God is supposedly all-knowing, then there is no action we can make to yield an alternate destiny. This is because actions that would yield a destiny unknown to God would mean that God is not omniscient, which is impossible. That means that the only possible actions we can make are actions that coincide with what will yield the destiny He knew we were going to have.\n \n Our actions are predetermined, they follow a set path that God already knows about.\n \n What is this free will you talk about?\n \n As above, we dont really have the choice. We have to follow his predetermined set path. If we dont then god didnt know about it, if that is the case, then he is not perfect and all knowing.\n \n Your agument is that the Bible says god is all-loving, but his actions contradict, therefore an all-loving Christian God does not exist.\n \n There are way too many holes the Bible doesn't fill. If God does exist, he certainly isn't all-loving, so the Bible would be wrong(For God so loved the world...=no, he didn't he destroyed most of it once and apparently plans to do it again). The Bible contradicts itself and provides too many paradoxical situations for it to make any sense or have any sort of validity.!\n\n \n Predestination as known at the time of the new testament did not mean, as so many westerners believe, that all was determined beforehand. Rather it meant to mark out a boundary. The meaning is concerning one's nature not ones choices. For instance, I am a human. There is no way I can choose to do things as a lamp. I am not a lamp. I can only act in accordance with my nature. i (again this is a historical context which is often left out of these discussions).\n \n The bible does not contradict itself when considered in full context. God may have destroyed nearly all life on the planet once, but, that would be a very short sighted view point to say that it was a bad thing. To do that one must assume that this life is all there is. If there is an eternal life (and when speaking of God you must assume that there is) then God saved those from a life spent apart from Him. We do not know the final fate in eternity of any of those. God spared them great suffering. Your side assumes God is evil, my side assumes God is not. The error in the logic is that you cannot go backwards. One must assume the evil or goodness of god to come to either of those conclusions.\n \n My statement that God is love comes from his revelation of himself in the bible and in Jesus. I do not determine it based on events. You cannot. You must assume one or the other and then you can prove it either way doing it backwards. The problem is that the logic does not flow in that direction. \n \n \nThankfully I am not god, never claimed to be, never will. I just dont think I have it in me to throw a temper tantrum and slaughter countless men, women, children and animals on a whim just because i happen to feel like it one day.!\n\n \n You might be surprised one day to find just what you are capable of. I am capable of nearly any heinous act except for the theft of rap music. Just ain't going to happen. Ever heard of the term, \"There but for the grace of God go I.\" This is what it means. It is God's goodness that I do not want to and have not committed crimes. \n \n But, God determines good or bad because it is God that created the universe and God who sees all and knows all.\n \n \nWell IF he exists:\n \n Who am I to judge Him? I am using what HE gave me, so I am doing His will. All things are done through Him, right? So who are YOU to question HIS will, He clearly wants me to question Him, or else He would not have created me. He created me for a purpose and I am fulfilling that purpose- you are also being arrogant for questioning your own God's intentions and will!\n\n \n God did not create you in order to judge him. He did create you to question and to reason. Just because you are using what he gave you does not mean you are using it the way he intended. That is what free will is. You get to choose to do with it what you will. God himself will not violate that. His foreknowledge does not translate to control. I have heard that argument as well. God does not choose for you just because he knows. You can see what your kids are going to do in the near future (especially the younger ones) and sometimes you intervene and other times they need to learn the hard way so you let it happen. You are not evil because of that, you are simply helping your child to grow. The argument you raise is an post hoc ergo procter hoc fallacy.\n \n EF",

I would venture to say we have a lot more evidence of say the Civil War (which is history) or the Jurassic period for that matter, than anything the bible has to offer.\n \n \n...but rather to spread the news about the God of Love. He did say after all that the greatest commandment was to love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul and the second greatest was to love your neighbor as yourself. It is not a matter of living a moral life ( a list of do's and don'ts) but rather living a life of Love. This can only be done in dependence on God.\n\n \n But he is not the God of love. He creates people KNOWING ahead of time they will go to hell. He purposely creates people to be sent to eternal damnation and suffering. Why should I love your god if he doesnt love all his creations? If he truly loved everyone, WHY is there Satan? He sent his son to die for our sins, Why can't he die for Satan's sins and forgive him too? Only seems fair.\n \n Disclaimer* I am not posting the below to advocate the worship of the devil over god (I do neither as neither exhist anyhow).\n \n SATAN\n \u0095Satan, like Prometheus, gave knowledge to humanity by giving Eve the fruit from the forbidden tree. Because of Satan, humanity gained knowledge of good and evil, according to Genesis. Since we couldn't have possessed knowledge of good and evil before eating the fruit, Adam and Eve couldn't have known that eating the fruit was evil, so it seems a little harsh to punish them as severely as God did. Satan gave humans true capacity for moral judgment, unlike God, who simply expected everyone to mindlessly obey his orders. \n \u0095There is no biblical record of Satan engaging in the murder of torture of any human being, unlike God, who is guilty (and proudly guilty) of commiting genocide. \n \u0095There is no biblical record of Satan ever ordering someone to kill someone else, unlike God, who has repeatedly demanded the deaths of those who commit even the smallest of offenses. \n \u0095Satan will not be holding a massively dramatic ceremony full of blood and death for the return of his son to Earth. God apparently will. \n \n GOD\n \u0095God takes away Adam and Eve's eternal life, thus commiting the first murder, and holds their descendants responsible and visiting Adam and Eve's punishment down on their children. In today's moral standards, the sins of the father die with the father. \n \u0095God destroys all life on Earth in a great flood, except for a drunk (Noah) and his family, for failing to worship him. \n \u0095God's tenth plague upon the Israelites was the unjustified murder of all firstborn sons in Egypt, which undoubtedly included little children. \n \u0095Before sending the plagues to Egypt, God \"hardened Pharaoh's heart\" so that he wouldn't let the Israelites go, so he could have an excuse to visit horrible plagues upon them, like boils, killing cattle and murdering all firstborn sons. (Exodus 4:21) \n \u0095God orders the Levites to kill their \"every man and his neighbor\" for worshipping another god. This cost 3000 lives. (Exodus 32:27) \n \u0095God sends a plague to the Israelites, apparently feeling that mass-butchery wasn't enough of a punishment. (Exodus 32:35) \n \u0095God kills Onan for refusing to impregnate his late brother's (whom God also slew) wife and instead \"spilling his seed on the ground.\" (Genesis 38:8-10) \n \u0095God kills the entire populations of Soddom and Gammorah (again, including women, children and infants) for practicing certain sexual techniques. \n \u0095God gives all Philistines hemorrhoids in their pubic areas. (1 Samuel 5:9) \n \u0095God kills over 50,000 people for looking at an ark. (1 Samuel 6:19) \n \u0095God kills 70,000 people because King David decided to have a census. (1 Chronicles 21:7-14) \n \u0095God approves of slavery, and instructs owners to beat their slaves. (Proverbs 29:19) \n \u0095And, finally, God makes sure that if you are guilty of even the smallest transgression, you shall suffer endlessly for all eternity, following a dramatic homecoming for Jesus, who will be extremely [annoyed] at everyone for putting him to death, even though he knew what was going to happen beforehand (sounds a little like suicide to me) and he could have easily avoided it by using his power as God to perform a miracle and prove who he was. (See the entire book of Revelation) \n \n From this point of view, looks more like Satan is a Saint and God is the one who should be in charge of hell.\n \n \nPredestination as known at the time of the new testament did not mean, as so many westerners believe, that all was determined beforehand. Rather it meant to mark out a boundary. The meaning is concerning one's nature not ones choices. For instance, I am a human. \n\n \n That still doesn't answer the question of free will. Ancient dictionary meanings of predestination aside...God is supposedly all knowing and all loving. If I do something that god didnt know about then he is not all knowing as the christian bible describes him. If I do something that condemns me to hell how can he be all loving? So either...\n \n 1) God is flawed for not being all knowing or all loving or ...\n 2) The Bible (his word) or the religion as a whole, is flawed in the description of God.\n \n \nThe bible does not contradict itself when considered in full context. God may have destroyed nearly all life on the planet once, but, that would be a very short sighted view point to say that it was a bad thing. To do that one must assume that this life is all there is. If there is an eternal life (and when speaking of God you must assume that there is) then God saved those from a life spent apart from Him. We do not know the final fate in eternity of any of those. God spared them great suffering.\n\n \n I once saw a website that listed 360+ bible contradictions. I'll search for that sometime this week so I have some ammunition, the bible does indeed contradict itself many times.\n \n God destroyed all of mankind (cept noah and his family) so he could spare them from great suffering?!? Drowning is not pleasurable despite what you may think. That aside, why did he kill them? For failing to worship him and other various evil acts. What is the punishment for that? Eternal damnation. So how again did he spare them from great suffering? Oh by sending them to hell...apparently for his own amusement.\n \n \n \nYou might be surprised one day to find just what you are capable of. I am capable of nearly any heinous act except for the theft of rap music. Just ain't going to happen. Ever heard of the term, \"There but for the grace of God go I.\" This is what it means. It is God's goodness that I do not want to and have not committed crimes.\n\n \n Amusing about the rap, I happen to agree. Never the less, I dont follow God's teachings, I dont believe in them and I dont believe in him....Yet I still wont go slaughtering innocent men, women and children. So you see it's not god's goodness that stops me from doing it, its who I am and what I believe to be wrong. That is what keeps me from lowering myself to the christian god's level.\n \n \nBut, God determines good or bad because it is God that created the universe and God who sees all and knows all.\n\n \n Funny you should say that....\n \n Why did Adam receive punishment for eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil? Without the knowledge to discern good from evil, how can one be held responsible for actions that are evil? To receive a punishment, one is to have known that an action was wrong before hand. Adam did not know his actions were wrong, because he did not understand right from wrong, he had not been given that knowledge, but he was held accountable for failing a test on knowledge and information he was never given. You might say that God told Adam not to eat from the tree, but without knowing right from wrong, eating from the tree was just as right or wrong as listening to God's word. If Adam had no knowledge of good from evil, could not discern the two, how is he to be held responsible for commiting evil? Adam coudn't have known it was evil without the knowledge of good and evil.\n \n All that aside, if he DID know it was evil, somehow, why did God seem to entrap Adam? Why create Eve to lure Adam? Why put the tree there in the first place? If it is to provide a test, why test at all? God knows the actions that are going to take place, so why choose to punish Adam when he knows he was going to do wrong? What does that prove?\n \n \n \nGod did not create you in order to judge him. He did create you to question and to reason. Just because you are using what he gave you does not mean you are using it the way he intended. \n\n \n But I AM using it the way he intended. He KNEW ahead of time that I would judge him in this way....he is supposedly all knowing right? He KNEW I would do exactly this and yet still he created me. Why? Because I'm doing exactly as he planned for me to do.\n \n \n You are not evil because of that, you are simply helping your child to grow. The argument you raise is an post hoc ergo procter hoc fallacy.\n\n Murdering innocent children is hardly helping them to grow emoticon_confused",

They want to debate from some kind of neutral, outside, elevated position - against a belief in God or gods. They want their \"neutral\" position to be a combination of several beliefs, so that they can argue from different positions as the debate requires.

   "I'm not sure i believe that and I'm not sure any history major would side with you on this one either. I would venture to say we have a lot more evidence of say the Civil War (which is history) or the Jurassic period for that matter, than anything the bible has to offer.\n \n \n \n But he is not the God of love. He creates people KNOWING ahead of time they will go to hell. He purposely creates people to be sent to eternal damnation and suffering. Why should I love your god if he doesnt love all his creations? If he truly loved everyone, WHY is there Satan? He sent his son to die for our sins, Why can't he die for Satan's sins and forgive him too? Only seems fair.\n \n Disclaimer* I am not posting the below to advocate the worship of the devil over god (I do neither as neither exhist anyhow).\n \n SATAN\n \u0095Satan, like Prometheus, gave knowledge to humanity by giving Eve the fruit from the forbidden tree. Because of Satan, humanity gained knowledge of good and evil, according to Genesis. Since we couldn't have possessed knowledge of good and evil before eating the fruit, Adam and Eve couldn't have known that eating the fruit was evil, so it seems a little harsh to punish them as severely as God did. Satan gave humans true capacity for moral judgment, unlike God, who simply expected everyone to mindlessly obey his orders. \n \u0095There is no biblical record of Satan engaging in the murder of torture of any human being, unlike God, who is guilty (and proudly guilty) of commiting genocide. \n \u0095There is no biblical record of Satan ever ordering someone to kill someone else, unlike God, who has repeatedly demanded the deaths of those who commit even the smallest of offenses. \n \u0095Satan will not be holding a massively dramatic ceremony full of blood and death for the return of his son to Earth. God apparently will. \n \n GOD\n \u0095God takes away Adam and Eve's eternal life, thus commiting the first murder, and holds their descendants responsible and visiting Adam and Eve's punishment down on their children. In today's moral standards, the sins of the father die with the father. \n \u0095God destroys all life on Earth in a great flood, except for a drunk (Noah) and his family, for failing to worship him. \n \u0095God's tenth plague upon the Israelites was the unjustified murder of all firstborn sons in Egypt, which undoubtedly included little children. \n \u0095Before sending the plagues to Egypt, God \"hardened Pharaoh's heart\" so that he wouldn't let the Israelites go, so he could have an excuse to visit horrible plagues upon them, like boils, killing cattle and murdering all firstborn sons. (Exodus 4:21) \n \u0095God orders the Levites to kill their \"every man and his neighbor\" for worshipping another god. This cost 3000 lives. (Exodus 32:27) \n \u0095God sends a plague to the Israelites, apparently feeling that mass-butchery wasn't enough of a punishment. (Exodus 32:35) \n \u0095God kills Onan for refusing to impregnate his late brother's (whom God also slew) wife and instead \"spilling his seed on the ground.\" (Genesis 38:8-10) \n \u0095God kills the entire populations of Soddom and Gammorah (again, including women, children and infants) for practicing certain sexual techniques. \n \u0095God gives all Philistines hemorrhoids in their pubic areas. (1 Samuel 5:9) \n \u0095God kills over 50,000 people for looking at an ark. (1 Samuel 6:19) \n \u0095God kills 70,000 people because King David decided to have a census. (1 Chronicles 21:7-14) \n \u0095God approves of slavery, and instructs owners to beat their slaves. (Proverbs 29:19) \n \u0095And, finally, God makes sure that if you are guilty of even the smallest transgression, you shall suffer endlessly for all eternity, following a dramatic homecoming for Jesus, who will be extremely [annoyed] at everyone for putting him to death, even though he knew what was going to happen beforehand (sounds a little like suicide to me) and he could have easily avoided it by using his power as God to perform a miracle and prove who he was. (See the entire book of Revelation) \n \n From this point of view, looks more like Satan is a Saint and God is the one who should be in charge of hell.\n \n \n \n That still doesn't answer the question of free will. Ancient dictionary meanings of predestination aside...God is supposedly all knowing and all loving. If I do something that god didnt know about then he is not all knowing as the christian bible describes him. If I do something that condemns me to hell how can he be all loving? So either...\n \n 1) God is flawed for not being all knowing or all loving or ...\n 2) The Bible (his word) or the religion as a whole, is flawed in the description of God.\n \n \n \n I once saw a website that listed 360+ bible contradictions. I'll search for that sometime this week so I have some ammunition, the bible does indeed contradict itself many times.\n \n God destroyed all of mankind (cept noah and his family) so he could spare them from great suffering?!? Drowning is not pleasurable despite what you may think. That aside, why did he kill them? For failing to worship him and other various evil acts. What is the punishment for that? Eternal damnation. So how again did he spare them from great suffering? Oh by sending them to hell...apparently for his own amusement.\n \n \n \n \n Amusing about the rap, I happen to agree. Never the less, I dont follow God's teachings, I dont believe in them and I dont believe in him....Yet I still wont go slaughtering innocent men, women and children. So you see it's not god's goodness that stops me from doing it, its who I am and what I believe to be wrong. That is what keeps me from lowering myself to the christian god's level.\n \n \n \n Funny you should say that....\n \n Why did Adam receive punishment for eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil? Without the knowledge to discern good from evil, how can one be held responsible for actions that are evil? To receive a punishment, one is to have known that an action was wrong before hand. Adam did not know his actions were wrong, because he did not understand right from wrong, he had not been given that knowledge, but he was held accountable for failing a test on knowledge and information he was never given. You might say that God told Adam not to eat from the tree, but without knowing right from wrong, eating from the tree was just as right or wrong as listening to God's word. If Adam had no knowledge of good from evil, could not discern the two, how is he to be held responsible for commiting evil? Adam coudn't have known it was evil without the knowledge of good and evil.\n \n All that aside, if he DID know it was evil, somehow, why did God seem to entrap Adam? Why create Eve to lure Adam? Why put the tree there in the first place? If it is to provide a test, why test at all? God knows the actions that are going to take place, so why choose to punish Adam when he knows he was going to do wrong? What does that prove?\n \n \n \n \n But I AM using it the way he intended. He KNEW ahead of time that I would judge him in this way....he is supposedly all knowing right? He KNEW I would do exactly this and yet still he created me. Why? Because I'm doing exactly as he planned for me to do.\n \n \n Murdering innocent children is hardly helping them to grow emoticon_confused\n\n \n I cannot possibly answer all of your post at this time due to my own time constraints. Here is what I will say, I have already posted a comparison of documentary evidence of events described in the bible with documentary evidence of other historical events. There is literraly more than 100 times the evidence for many many (agreed not all) biblical events compared on an event by event basis. I am not sure which thread it is in. I will do a search and post the thread link later.\n \n As for, \"If GOd is love then why does satan exist\" the answer is simple. Love cannot exist without a choice between good and evil exist. If there was no evil then no one would know the difference. Love is a verb (as I am using it) and it means a process by which needs are met. If there was only good and no evil, if everyone was without need without hardship without problems then there would be no needs to be met and no way to recieve love. I have posted this elsewhere as well.\n \n If you look at the comparison between God and Satan that you posted, without too much difficulty, you will find the logical fallacies. Most of them are begged questions, or slippery slope. I have read the satanist bible and it is fascinating that people actually believe such things because the logic is so fundamentally flawed that it would convince only those who truly WANTED to believe it.\n \n I am sorry that I have so little time. I will post that link, but then I am afraid that it may be a while before I can get back to the topic. Look for more responses though. They will just take some time as my work is heating up (end of Fiscal Year stuff).\n \n Thanks\n \n EF\n \n EF",
