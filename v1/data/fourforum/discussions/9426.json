   "WW, I'd like to take another shot at this, if that's OK with you. I know in another thread you pretty much decided I wasn't worth talking to any more, but I think there we were both guilty of jumping to conclusions and then being reluctant to back down when our error was demonstrated.\n \n So, I propose the following:\n \n Here we discuss EAM. We leave Darwinism / Modern Synthesis to one side - that means I don't try to describe how Darwinism explains the same observations, and you don't criticise Darwinism or contrast it with EAM. If EAM is a viable hypothesis then it should be able to stand on its own merit, and that means it should be explanatory and predictive with regard to observable facts. Leaving Darwinian evolution out of the discussion should also help to avoid confusion over terminology.\n \n Also, I propose that we refrain from bringing up or alluding to old grievances: fresh thread, fresh start.\n \n So, to get the ball rolling, I've taken this from another thread:\n \nToday's Lamarckian theory is generational, in that it depends upon both physical responses in a parent and physiological responses to those responses in the embryonic and developing offspring. It's still called, \"evolutionary development\", although it should be called, \"developmental evolution\". I call it \"Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis\", \"EAM\" for short. By this measure any change in trait epigenetically inherited by an offspring from a parent is evolutionary, even if there is no genetic/allelic change involved. It speaks to the evolution of whole, real, organisms\n\n When considering EAM as you have described it, there are a few things I notice about the mental image of evolutionary change it evokes.\n \n First, although the proposed progression of adaptive response is fairly straightforward (behavior, morphology, epigenetic inheritance, genetic change), the scope of change within a given interval remains ambiguous. I don't know, for instance, how many generations I should be imagining for behavioural change to be reflected in a genetic change, or which adaptive responses occur within the lifetime of an organism and which manifest as a discontinuity between generations (eg offspring differing genetically from the parent). Also, it seems odd that regardless of the magnitude of the effect of the 'eventual' genetic change, and regardless of its targeted specifity, it always seems to take the form of a tiny, local change to a single gene - this suggests that, at the very least, the genetic code of living organisms constitutes a limiting factor in what can be achieved 'in one bound' by EAM. \n \n It would really help, I think, if you could clarify the parameters within which EAM operates.\n \n The second thing I note is that the mental image is linear: parent to offspring to offspring to offspring. While this suffices for bacterial, clonal ancestry, generalising this mental image to a (potentially very large) interbreeding population of two sexes introduces some troublesome questions.\n \n For one, does EAM in an interbreeding, dual-gender population require consensus of ancestry to progress the adoption of adaptive traits, or is a chronic stimulus applied to just one of the many lineages that can be traced back from any given organism sufficient to progress 'developmental evolution'? \n \n In trying to answer that for myself, I considered that, although many adaptive traits are shared by both sexes, others are gender specific in their expression - even contradictory between male and female. EAM, as I understand it, predicts such traits could only be developed along pure maternal or paternal lineage. Rationale: until a trait is encoded in a gene, there is no way for a nascent female-specific trait to be passed down via a male ancestor, since that ancestor will neither epigenetically inherit the trait nor experience the chronic stimulus necessary to advance its development.\n \n By definition, every organism has only one pure maternal lineage and one pure paternal lineage, so it follows that if even a single lineage experiencing a 'chronic stimulus' can be traced back from an organism, there is the potential for it to develop an adaptive genetic trait. Ancestral consensus (both parents, all four grandparents etc all being nudged in the same direction) is not required.\n \n I'll leave it there for today and await your response.",

What I will say is that one key point to remember is that the scope of epigenetic inheritance is still defined by the organism's genes. So while it's possible for epigenetic processes to give rise to previously un-expressed traits, the potential to express those traits was always inherent in the genes - 'always' here meaning 'for as long as those genes have existed'. Without the genes, there is no scope for epigenetic inheritence. \n \n \nThis seems to overthrow the whole silly theory right there because new, beneficial traits can arise without selection.\n\n \n Forgive me for saying so, but that demonstrates a terribly confused grasp of evolutionary theory. Of course new, beneficial traits can arise without selection - selection isn't involved in the origination of traits; no evolutionist would claim otherwise.\n \n What selection does is affect the distribution of traits within a population. This might not seem terribly important until you consider that it will therefore help determine which trait-bearing organisms are around in subsequent generations to develop (or inherit through interbreeding) further adaptive traits. Selection helps ensure that adaptive traits accumulate, and thus have been pivotal in shaping the overall genetic structure of the organisms around us. This is true whether you subscribe to Lamarckism or Darwinism.\n \n \nPersonally, I don't see why this EAM is not accepted by evolutionists. i really don't. It makes sense and it doesn't necessarily point to a creator. As well, as a Christian, I don't see how it invalidates supernatural creation. It's a no-brainer...everyone should be happy.\n\n \n Whether an idea makes everyone happy is entirely beside the point; science isn't politics. Plenty of ideas sound plausible but don't accurately reflect reality, the latter being the real acid test. I haven't accepted EAM because I've been shown no evidence to support it. Although some of the events described as 'steps' in EAM do occur (behavioural response to stimuli, morphological response to behavioural change, epigenetic inheritance and genetic change), EAM's stringing together of these events (and others) into a universal causal sequence is not supported by observation - not only are observed patterns of mutation inexplicable in Lamarckian terms, but morphological and epigenetic adaptation are themselves defined by the organism's genes - suggesting that EAM is (perhaps understandably) putting the cart before the horse.",

Realistic Answer: they don't.\n \n Besides that, Darwinian theory says that new traits arise because of randomly mutating genes -- or at least that used to be the story. Regardless of the mechanism, the variation HAS to be random....if it's not random -- that is if variation arises from the individual -- then selection is left out of a creative job. So, when a parent's offspring inherit a new trait by way of the parent's diet, for example, then the trait is not random.\n \n [GOULD] Challenges to Neo-Darwinism 57\n The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics - the forces that pro-duce the raw material of genetic variation - are random, in the special sense of \"not inherently directed toward adaptation.\" That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur\"at random,\" in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction - and be the creative force of evolution - by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.",

   "Traits acquired through the mechanims of Epigenetics are not random....which I would suggest is responsible for most of evolution. Gould on the requirements of natural selection:\n \n Natural Selection as a Creative Force \n \n Natural selection ranked as a standard item in biological discourse -- but with a crucial difference from Darwin's version: the usual interpretation invoked natural selection as part of a larger argument for created permanency. Natural selection, in this negative formulation, acted only to preserve the type, constant and inviolate, by eliminating extreme variants and unfit individuals who threatened to degrade the essence of created form. (Gould 2002: 137-139) \n \n (....) Darwin's theory ... cannot be equated with the simple claim that natural selection operates. Nearly all his colleagues and predecessors accepted this postulate. Darwin, in his characteristic and radical way, grasped that this standard mechanism for preserving the type could be inverted, and then converted into the primary cause of evolutionary change. Natural selection obviously lies at the center of Darwin's theory, but we must recognize, as Darwin's second key postulate, that claim that natural selection acts as the creative force of evolutionary change. The essence of Darwinism cannot reside in the mere observation that natural selection operates -- for everyone had long accepted a negative role for natural selection in eliminating the unfit and preserving the type. (Gould 2002: 139) \n \n (....) We have lost this context and distinction today, and our current perspective often hampers an understanding of the late 19th century literature and its preoccupations. Anyone who has read deeply in this literature knows that no argument inspired more discussion, while no Darwinian claim seemed more vulnerable to critics, than the proposition that natural selection should be viewed as a positive force, and therefore as the primary cause of evolutionary change. The \"creativity of natural selection\" -- the phrase generally used in Darwin's time as a shorthand description of the problem -- set the cardinal subject for debate about evolutionary mechanisms during Darwin's lifetime and throughout the late 19th century. [It is poised to once again become the central question due to the amazing scientific discoveries taking place in evo-devo.] (Gould 2002: 139) \n \n Non-Darwinian evolutionists did not deny the reality, or the operationality, of natural selection as a genuine cause stated in the most basic or abstract manner. (....) They held, rather, that natural selection, as a headsman or executioner, could only eliminate the unfit, while some other cause must play the positive role of constructing the fit. (Gould 2002: 139) \n \n (....) We can understand the trouble that Darwin's contemporaries experienced in comprehending how selection could work as a creative force when we confront the central paradox of Darwin's crucial argument: natural selection makes nothing; it can only choose among variants originating by other means. How then can selection possibly be conceived as a \"progressive,\" or \"creative,\" or \"positive\" force? (Gould 2002: 140) \n \n The Requirements for Variation \n \n In order to act as raw material only, variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives. first and foremost, variation must exist in sufficient amounts, for natural selection can make nothing, and must rely upon bounty thus provided; but variation must not be too florid or showy either, lest it become the creative agent of change itself. Variation, in short, must be copious, small in extent, and undirected. A full taxonomy of non-Darwinian evolutionary theories may be elaborated by their denials of one or more of these central assumptions. (Gould 2002: 141) \n \n COPIOUS. Since natural selection makes nothing and can only work with raw material presented to its stringent review, variation must be generated in copious and dependable amounts.... Darwin's scenario for selective modification always includes the postulate, usually stated explicitly, that all structures vary, and therefore evolve.... If these universally recognized distinctions arise as consequences of differences in the intrinsic capacity of species to vary, then Darwin's key postulate of copiousness would be compromised -- for failure of sufficient raw material would then be setting a primary limit upon the rate and style of evolutionary change, and selection would not occupy the driver's seat. (Gould 2002: 141-142) \n \n Darwin responds by denying this interpretation, and arguing that differing intensities of selection, rather than intrinsically distinct capacities for variation, generally cause the greater or lesser differentiation observed among domestic species. I regard this argument as among the most forced and uncomfortable in the Origin -- a rare example of Darwinian special pleading. But Darwin realizes the centrality of copiousness to his argument for the creativity of natural selection, and he must therefore face the issue directly: \n \n Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds for the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt the display of distinct breeds (p. 42). \n \n Second, copiousness must also be asserted in the face of a powerful argument about limits to variation following modal departure from \"type.\" To use Fleeming Jenkin's (1867) famous analogy: a species may be compared to a rigid sphere, with modal morphology of individuals at the center, and limits to variation defined by the surface. So long as individuals lie near the center, variation will be copious in all directions [isotropic; non-directional]. But if selection brings the mode to the surface, then further variation in the same direction will cease -- and evolution will be stymied by an intrinsic limitation upon raw material, even when selection would favor further movement. Evolution, in other words, might consume its own fuel and bring itself to an eventual halt thereby. This potential refutation stood out as especially serious -- not only for threatening the creativity of natural selection, but also for challenging the validity of uniformitarian extrapolation as a methodology of research. Darwin responded, as required by logical necessity, that such limits do not exist, and that new spheres of equal radius can be reconstructed around new modes: \"No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification\" (p. 8). (Gould 2002: 142) \n \n (....) One of the most appealing features of Mendalism a strong reason for acceptance following its \"rediscovery\" in 1900 lay in the argument that mutation could restore variation \"used up\" by selection. (Gould 2002: 143) \n \n [See Klein & Tanaka, 2002, \"Where Do We Come From: The Molecular Evidence for Human Descent,\" p. 197-204, regarding atavism.] \n \n SMALL IN EXTENT. If the variations that yielded evolutionary change were large -- producing new major features, or even new taxa in a single step then natural selection would not disappear as an evolutionary force. Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman -- to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit new saltation to spread among organisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the population. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish -- for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, the quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian -- despite the protestations of de Vries ..., who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a negative force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word \"rapid\" or the name \"Goldschmidt,\" testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice. (Gould 2002: 143) \n \n Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso.... At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a creative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. (Gould 2002: 143-142) \n \n (....) \n \n UNDIRECTED. Textbooks of evolution still often refer to variation as \"random.\" We all recognize this designation is a misnomer, but continue to use the phrase by force of habit. Darwinians have never argued for \"random\" mutation in the restricted and technical sense of \"equally likely in all directions,\" as in tossing a die. [Rather it means statistical frequencies around a modal norm, like the bell curve for example, which does not imply that the underlying cause is totally random like tossing die.] But our sloppy use of \"random\" (see Eble, 1999) does capture, at least in a vernacular sense, the essence of the important claim that we do wish to convey -- namely, that variation must be unrelated to the direction of evolutionary change; or, more strongly, that nothing about the process of creating raw material biases the pathway of subsequent change in adaptive directions. This fundamental postulate gives Darwinism its \"two step\" character, the \"chance\" and \"necessity\" of Monad's famous formulation the separation of a source of raw material (mutation, recombination, etc.) from a force of change (natural selection). (Gould 2002: 144) \n \n In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection. He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material, and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selection.... He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation, particularly reversions toward ancestral features. But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection. Thus, by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency, selection controls the direction of change: \"When under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved\" (p. 15) (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n We may summarize Darwin's third requirement for variation under the rubric of isotropy, a common term in mineralogy (and other sciences) for the concept of a structure or system that exhibits no preferred pathway as a consequence of construction with equal properties in all directions. Darwinian variation must be copious in amount, small in extent, and effectively isotropic. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Only under these stringent conditions can natural selection -- a force that makes nothing directly, and must rely upon variation for all raw material -- be legitimately regarded as creative. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Gradualism. Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If important new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in the production of the variation itself. Natural selection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin's creative mode. (Gould 2002: 149) \n \n (....) INSENSIBILITY OF INTERMEDIACY. We now come to the heart of what natural selection requires. This ... \"just right,\" statement does not advance a claim about how much time a transition must take, or how variable a rate of change might be. (....) [And in this meaning of \"gradualism,\" it is simply asserted that] ... in going from A to a substantially different B, evolution must pass through a long and insensible sequence of intermediary steps -- in other words, that ancestor and descendant must be linked by a series of changes, each within the range of what natural selection might construct from ordinary variability. Without gradualism in this form, large variations of discontinuous morphological import -- rather than natural selection -- might provide the creative force of evolutionary change. But if the tiny increment of each step remains inconsequential in itself, then creativity must reside in the summation of these steps into something substantial - natural selection, in Darwin's theory, acts as the agent of accumulation. (Gould 2002: 150) \n \n (....) If the altered morphology of new species often arose in single steps by fortuitous macromutation, then selection would lose its creative role and could act only as a secondary and auxiliary force to spread the sudden blessing through a population. But can we justify Darwin's application of the same claim to single organs? (....) Would natural selection perish if change in this mode were common? I don't think so. Darwinian theory would require some adjustments and compromises - particularly a toning down of assertions about isotropy of variation, and a more vigorous study of internal constraint in genetics and development ... -- but natural selection would still enjoy a status far higher than that of a mere executioner. A new organ does not make a new species; and a new morphology must be brought into functional integration -- a process that requires secondary adaptation and fine tuning, presumably by natural selection, whatever the extent of the initial step.

As for your\n questions raised in the OP, I'm not sure that there are any absolute answers.\n \n For instance, you say;\n \n \n\n First, although the proposed progression of adaptive response is fairly straightforward (behavior, morphology, epigenetic inheritance, genetic change), the scope of change within a given interval remains ambiguous.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it does. In non-mechanical cause/effect events the relation between motivation and response is not necessarily automatic and invariable; which, IMHO, is why the behaviourist learning model foundered. But that is not a problem unless you insist upon 1 to 1, 'billiard ball' cause/effect mechanics.\n \n \n\n I don't know, for instance, how many generations I should be imagining for behavioural change to be reflected in a genetic change, or which adaptive responses occur within the lifetime of an organism and which manifest as a discontinuity between generations (eg offspring differing genetically from the parent). \n\n \n **\n Nor will you ever. The intitial conditions, especially internally within the biosystem, but even externally wrt 'stimulus', are far too variable and local to permit such specification. For one thing, there is no guarantee that the affected organism even, 'has what it takes', to overcome adversity or take advantage of opportunity. What is certain is that, if and when \"options\" are informationally available to a system, and materially 'do-able', then the organism, provided a change is to its advantage in terms of 'energy in', 'productivity out', will take advantage of its best option to restructure itself , so as to better serve the 'life' goals of survival, well-being, and usually, reproduction. Often that 'best option' is only discovered through a general goal-seeking, teleological, heuristic process of trial and error focused upon relief of the stress/disequilibrium caused by the stimulus. That by itself could prove a 'hit-or-miss' proposition. And there is never any guarantee that the 'best option available' is going to be a good one, or even satisfactory.\n Often adaptation is impossible or insufficient, no matter how much time and biochemistry you throw at it.\n \n \n \n\n Also, it seems odd that regardless of the magnitude of the effect of the 'eventual' genetic change, and regardless of its targeted specifity, it always seems to take the form of a tiny, local change to a single gene \n\n \n **\n Not with EAM it doesn't. Such point mutations are purely darwinian. EAM deals with the information restructuring, both in the organism as a whole, and in its genome as a whole. If sometime the restructuring actually requires as little as one point mutation, well and good, but I don't think that that is the usual thing. And for most truly momentous evolutionary changes in organisms, those that are referred to as 'macro-evolutionary', point mutations won't cut it. Not even nearly.\n \n \n\n - this suggests that, at the very least, the genetic code of living organisms constitutes a limiting factor in what can be achieved 'in one bound' by EAM.\n\n \n **\n Your assumption was wrong. This \" constitutes a limiting factor in what can be achieved 'in one bound' by [\"RMNS\"]\", and is why the idea of 'punk-eek' was, and still is, so vigourously opposed and rationalised by darwinists. EAM has no problem with multiple restructuring, via developmental biology, not only of one or more vital morphological or biochemical traits, but of brod and important relationships and structures within the genome, so that great changes could appear in as little as a single generation. These would not be \"hopeful monsters\" created by feckless genetic accidents, but intelligently redesigned systems, tailor-made to fit organismic requirements where and when information and material options present themselves.\n \n So let's be civil with one another and maybe we'll have fun exploring the topic. Please try to keep in mind that, if you insist upon mechanical explanations that reduce to 'matter in motion', you won't get any here.

What troubles me is this notion that while vitality is given to be universal, there's this caveat that a given organism might not 'have what it takes' to adapt, even if that organism is a biological clone of another in the same situation that does manage to adapt. I don't see how this can be portrayed as anything other than one organism being 'lucky' and another 'unlucky', which you explicitly disallowed by saying that chance plays no part in evolution.\n \n As for the mechanics of successful adaptation, well, I'm not asking for specifics, but I do feel that the terms you use would benefit (as far as saying something that could be confirmed or used predictively goes) from having at least outline parameters.\n \n I've already talked about 'materially doable', but what about 'informationally available'? Let me try to explain why I find this unsatisfactory: if I go out at night and look up, more or less a quarter of the universe is 'informationally available' to me via electromagnetic waves. However my senses are capable of apprehending only a minuscule fraction of that data, and my mind capable of comprehending even less. What I'm trying to establish is whether EAM is in any way dependent upon the organism's existing physical conduits for taking in data. I tend to think it would have to be, because otherwise EAM would represent a short-cut that would render the development of complex sensory apparatus redundant. To put it another way, if an organism is already aware of stimuli that tell it an eye would be a really good idea, it doesn't actually need the eye at all.\n \n Then there's the 'options' implied by that data. Here I start to find the going especially tricky. For example, if a macro-sized organism finds no accessible or digestible food in one place, it will probably try looking somewhere else. But bacteria don't have that option; they allegedly adapt by modifying their genetic code to make absorption of a new food source possible. So here's the rub: why doesn't the macro organism, which actually digests its food using billions of bacteria in its gut, able to eat more or less anything it wants? Or, equally, morph to render previously inaccessible food (which might surround it in abundance, only fractionally beyond its capacity to obtain) available? \n \n I hasten to reiterate that I'm not bringing these points up to criticise the EAM hypothesis; I'm bringing up points that occur to me as I try to get my head around what it's saying.\n \n \nOften that 'best option' is only discovered through a general goal-seeking, teleological, heuristic process of trial and error focused upon relief of the stress/disequilibrium caused by the stimulus. That by itself could prove a 'hit-or-miss' proposition.\n\n \n This again sounds like chance by another name; it might work or it might not. As far as heuristic trial-and-error processes involving intelligence and direction, I'd just like to reiterate my request for clarification: are we deriving our certainty of directed evolution from EAM, or the other way around?\n \n \nNot with EAM it doesn't. Such point mutations are purely darwinian. EAM deals with the information restructuring, both in the organism as a whole, and in its genome as a whole. If sometime the restructuring actually requires as little as one point mutation, well and good, but I don't think that that is the usual thing. And for most truly momentous evolutionary changes in organisms, those that are referred to as 'macro-evolutionary', point mutations won't cut it. Not even nearly.\n\n \n Well, point mutations are only one possible kind of mutation; there are many other kinds that are also atomic (in the sense of being irreducibly simple), but ok, so EAM predicts we should be able to see wholesale genetic changes, essentially unlimited in scope, within a single generation? There's no reason why this couldn't happen?\n \n \nYour assumption was wrong. This \" constitutes a limiting factor in what can be achieved 'in one bound' by [\"RMNS\"]\", and is why the idea of 'punk-eek' was, and still is, so vigourously opposed and rationalised by darwinists.\n\n \n Well, I was the one who suggested we not stray into Darwinian territory, so I'd respectfully ask that you not read anything into my lack of response to that here.\n \n \nPlease try to keep in mind that, if you insist upon mechanical explanations that reduce to 'matter in motion', you won't get any here. There is no 'clock-work' physicality in EAM, hence no mechanical determinism in its operation. Just freedom and creativity and intelligence and volition. And so on.\n\n \n I think my greatest concern is that in this EAM strays dangerously close to the explanatory-but-not-predictive realm of \"god did it\" - not, I hasten to add, because there's anything inherently religious about it, but because it is verging on the unfalsifiable. Any adaptive mutation we observe, EAM has it covered 'somehow' - the organism 'somehow' detected this stimulus (even one quite abstract and complex in nature), 'somehow' understood what it meant, and 'somehow' altered its genetic code in response. And those that didn't, just didn't 'have what it takes'.\n \n I'm therefore interested to know: is there anything we could conceivably observe that would falsify EAM?\n \n Thanks for replying.",

I am trying to answer your questions about my understanding of just how biological evolution operates, here on a public internet forum. As such I am presenting and defending broad and general ideas, not limited observations taken from particular lab works, nor the narrow inferences drawn from such particulars. I will speak of natural observations that generate the EAM hypothesis, and tests that would confirm it, as occasion arises.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Yes, it does.

Organisms are physical systems in terms of their construction materials, or as we may say, their substance. The point is, that if you insist upon understanding organisms in terms of their physical constituents and their geographical distrubution, you will have no greater success in understanding them than you would if you tried to understand newspapers, and how they change from day to day, in physical terms of the paper and ink and presses and all the other mechanical and chemical processes used to construct them, distribute them, and count up their readership stats.\n \n You have to consider those physical/mechanical as secondary and subordinate to intelligence and volition and the other psychical, dynamic factors involved in being alive, as apart from being inanimate or inert, if you want to understand biology. If you start from a metaphysical postulate that affirms that there is no qualitative difference between 'the quick and the dead', or between biology, physics, and chemistry, then you are doomed to never truly understand biology at all.\n \n \n\n You say lower down that the response must be 'materially doable'. It's like a game of chess: the players may be skilled to a greater or lesser degree and the winner unpredictable, but they must still abide by the rules of the game. What I'm trying to establish are the rules by which EAM plays.\n\n \n **\n Nice analogy, except that, unfortunately for science, organisms are not so limited in their options as chess pieces are, and chance, in the form of natural environmental exigencies, does play a roll in evolution that it never has in chess. Coffee-housing and kibbitzing aside. ;)\n \n \n\n I'm trying to get a handle, initially, on how much of the end-to-end process EAM describes can be encapsulated within the lifetime of an organism.\n\n \n **\n That would depend upon the point in the organism's lifetime at which the external environmental stimulus went into action. Obviosly if it began before, and continued throughout, an individual's lifetime, from conception on, it will have more effect upon it it than if the stimulus only acted on it during its final days.\n \n \n\n Can a single organism experience a stimulus, change its behaviour and morphology and self-modify its genome?\n\n \n **\n Change its behaviour and morphology in its own lifetime? In a trivial sense,yes, as in dieting and body-building. In an evolutionary sense, no. That requires developmental evolution, and that requires generational change. Genomic change may require many generations of epigenetic transformation before the 'new' organisms stimulate a 'new' genome to reflect their 'new' reality.\n It is often said of Lamarck (by his enemies and detractors) that he claimed that evolution was accomplished in a single organism's lifetime, thanks to its personal response to its particular environment. That is, for example, that one giraffe stretched its neck reach for the highest leaves, and that stretched neck was passed on to its offspring. I don't believe that Lamarck was ever that simple-minded, despite what neo-darwinists like Wiesmann have claimed. I've never found anything that directly quotes Lamarck himself to that effect.\n \n \n\n If so, how quickly? If not, why not? Why are multiple generations required (if indeed they are)?\n\n \n **\n Because by definition ' biological evolution' is an historical and extended process, not an immediate and short-term one. Otherwise we would say that 'der governator', \" biologically evolved\" from skinny kid to Mr. Universe to moviestar to governor of California. But we don't mean 'individual evolution' when we say 'biological evolution', and that's just the meaning for those words arrived at by common agreement. We agree to require change over at least one generation.\n \n [quote]\n \n\n What constitutes 'doable' - or, alternatively, how are the physical properties of the organism linked with what is 'doable'?\n\n \n **\n You'd have to start with the physical properties of 'carbon-based lifeforms', at least for this biosphere. Perhaps there are others for other worlds. The point is that every organism has physical limitations, and they vary. Simply said, diving birds, even penguins, cannot develop gills and become 'water-breathing', no matter what. They simply no longer possess the information required for such a restructuring of their respiratory systems, not the physical biochemistry and systemic conformation that would enable the reworking of the complex physical respiratory system they have now, for the complex physical system possessed by fish.\n Same goes for whales, walruses, pearl divers, and so forth.\n \n \n\n The other question I asked concerned interbreeding populations, where there is no single lineage to trace. I think the point about pure male and pure female lineages being the only viable ones for developing gender-specific traits is a valid one; do you have any comments on this or its implications?\n\n \n **\n Well, I shouldn't point out that gender-specific trait lineages is a real problem for RMNS, but I will. Not so for EAM. Where eventual fixation in the genome is directed by the organism itself, and not, 'chance minus selection', there is no difficulty with differences that are gender or otherwise specified.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Nor will you ever. <snip< For one thing, there is no guarantee that the affected organism even, 'has what it takes', to overcome adversity or take advantage of opportunity.

What I do say is that no two organisms are exactly alike. You may say that two cloned cells are exactly alike, and for sake of argument I will agree. But is the stimulus and other environmental conditions involving those exact twins also exactly alike? If it/they is/are, then, all things being equal, the outcomes _must_ be identical. That is, either both identical cells 'have what it takes', and adapt, or neither does, and they don't.\n Please remember that in the most common examples, i.e., eusocial bacteria, yeasts, and whatnot, the individual cell is not what 'adapts', since it is no more the organism, eg., you, then is one of your own skin cells. Colonies and eusocial collectivities and eukaryotic organisms adapt or not, and none of them, not even identical twins, are truly identical. Nor are their personal environments, aka, 'umwelts', and it is the 'umwelt' that counts wrt individual organisms and their adaptability, almost as much as the individual itself.\n \n \n\n I don't see how this can be portrayed as anything other than one organism being 'lucky' and another 'unlucky', which you explicitly disallowed by saying that chance plays no part in evolution.\n\n \n **\n I've never claimed that chance plays no part in evolution, as an historical biological process. Of course it does, since environmental change is largely unpredictable, at best chaotic, and so environmental stimulus is chance-based. But where darwinism makes the randomly occuring environmental exigencies out to be the mechanical and predictable and directional element in their \"RMNS\", i.e., \"Natural Selection\", EAM does not. \n The universal, non-random element in EAM is a force, Vitality. The local and relative aspects of organismic evolution are all of the physical/material conditions involved, including the material design and construction of the organism and its environment. It is in those material elements that both random and mechanical behaviours are located. In this case, random behaviours in the environment, and mechanical behaviours in the organism itself. Along with random mechanical system failure within the organism (entropy).\n Unlike darwinism, EAM does not attribute organic evolution to random mechanical system failure (entropic genomic action) plus randomly occuring, chaotic external stimuli, (environmental \"selection\"). EAM places evolution entirely inside and endogenous to, the organism itself. \n The environment exogenous to the organism simply acts as a stimulus to action, to a dynamic internal response. That response may become autonomic and apparently mechanical over generations, but originally the systematic behaviour was not at all mechanical. Only the particulate behaviour of its most basic molecular components was ever naturally mechanical. If the complex system itself was truly mechanical, then the only change it could ever experience would be entropic; and organic evolution is nothing if it is not the opposite of entropic dissolution.\n \n What I did say is that chance plays no part in the internally directed response mechanism that organisms undergo under direct stimulus. Granted, the heuristic 'trial-and-error' approach may \"appear\" chance-based, but since it is directed and constrained by its goal, that is, it is teleological, it is goal-based, it is NOT chance-based, open-ended, non-directional and stochastic. \n \n \n\n As for the mechanics of successful adaptation, well, I'm not asking for specifics, but I do feel that the terms you use would benefit (as far as saying something that could be confirmed or used predictively goes) from having at least outline parameters.\n\n \n **\n I believe that the 'mechanics' of epigenetic inheritance and developmental biology will handle that. After that you have to abandon the purely material and physical 'mechanics' involved, and come to grips with the realization that these mechanical behaviours do not drive themselves, any more than commuter traffic and highway systems are explained by the mechanics of the internal combustion engine and the automatic transmission.\n \n \n\n I've already talked about 'materially doable', but what about 'informationally available'? Let me try to explain why I find this unsatisfactory: if I go out at night and look up, more or less a quarter of the universe is 'informationally available' to me via electromagnetic waves. However my senses are capable of apprehending only a minuscule fraction of that data, and my mind capable of comprehending even less. What I'm trying to establish is whether EAM is in any way dependent upon the organism's existing physical conduits for taking in data.\n\n \n **\n Absolutely, yes. The psychical properties of any living organism depend and vary not in accord with the amount of Vitality available to them, which is universal, but according to their particular physical design and its ability ability to tap into and harness Vitality. In terms of 'information', Vitality represents the 'whole' of it, but acquired information is system-dependent.\n Simple cells are less capable of harnessing Vitality as a source of their dynamic, information-based behaviour than are eukaryotic organisms or even eusocial cell collectivities. But then, they don't need to be, since they need only relatively simple behaviours to achieve their goals, so no problem. Which ios why a sponge is not as intelligent or as emotional or as ambitious as a shark, for instance.\n \n \n\n For example, if a macro-sized organism finds no accessible or digestible food in one place, it will probably try looking somewhere else. But bacteria don't have that option; they allegedly adapt by modifying their genetic code to make absorption of a new food source possible. So here's the rub: why doesn't the macro organism, which actually digests its food using billions of bacteria in its gut, able to eat more or less anything it wants? Or, equally, morph to render previously inaccessible food (which might surround it in abundance, only fractionally beyond its capacity to obtain) available? \n\n \n **\n What makes you so sure that, over all the generations that have passed, that that isn't just what happened? And I'm not so sure that digestion is strictly a matter of gut bacteria, in any case. It's not a matter of bacteria being able to eat something so that we can then eat them. The biochemistry of nutruient take-up into the circulatory system is a tad more bio-chemically complex than that.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Often that 'best option' is only discovered through a general goal-seeking, teleological, heuristic process of trial and error focused upon relief of the stress/disequilibrium caused by the stimulus. That by itself could prove a 'hit-or-miss' proposition. \n \n \n This again sounds like chance by another name; it might work or it might not. As far as heuristic trial-and-error processes involving intelligence and direction, I'd just like to reiterate my request for clarification: are we deriving our certainty of directed evolution from EAM, or the other way around?\n\n \n **\n We are deriving our inference of EAM from observations of directed evolution.\n \n \n \n\n ok, so EAM predicts we should be able to see wholesale genetic changes, essentially unlimited in scope, within a single generation? There's no reason why this couldn't happen?\n\n \n **\n Not at all. See above, limitations both informational and physical on evolutionary change.\n \n \n\n I think my greatest concern is that in this EAM strays dangerously close to the explanatory-but-not-predictive realm of \"god did it\" - not, I hasten to add, because there's anything inherently religious about it, but because it is verging on the unfalsifiable. Any adaptive mutation we observe, EAM has it covered 'somehow' - the organism 'somehow' detected this stimulus (even one quite abstract and complex in nature), 'somehow' understood what it meant, and 'somehow' altered its genetic code in response. And those that didn't, just didn't 'have what it takes'.\n \n I'm therefore interested to know: is there anything we could conceivably observe that would falsify EAM?\n\n \n **\n Sure. A meaningful change in an organism and its lineage that improves its ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce that involve no immediate and proximate stimulus observed in an unaltered environment to which it and its fellows are already adapted. That would show that its evolution was accidental, not teleological.\n \n \n\n Thanks for replying.\n\n \n **\n You're welcome. This is much more enjoyable.",

   "Walking-fish:\n This is one long argument that I haven't completely processed in my mind. But one glaring question keeps surfacing. How do you account for the exogenous environment affecting changes in the internal environment of the organism? I can fully appreciate how internal relationships act as mutual selecting agents, as when the selection for an organ will act to select for a concomitant rerouting of circulation. For example, this occured with the evolution of lungs from the swim bladder, as the 6th Aortic arch became revamped. But these are perfectly darwinian mechanisms where the organism responds as a whole via selection of mutated genes in response to the outer environment - not as some self-directed epigenetic process acting on its own initiative. It just seems like fanciful thinking to me, unless someone can show me evidence that is more tangible than the speculations so far put forth.",

   "You have to consider those physical/mechanical as secondary and subordinate to intelligence and volition and the other psychical, dynamic factors involved in being alive,\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're saying here logically follows from the other responses you've made. For instance:\n \n \nSimply said, diving birds, even penguins, cannot develop gills and become 'water-breathing', no matter what. They simply no longer possess the information required for such a restructuring of their respiratory systems,\n\n \n Here their intelligence and volition is subordinate to their material characteristics, and by inference this will always be true: intelligence has to work with the tools available to it, just as even the best chess players are subordinate to the rules of the game. Yet this seems to be contradicted by the claims made for vitality: that it manipulates matter in a non-mechanical way; causes it to behave in ways it would normally not.\n \n What I'm trying to get at is the nature of this interface between the material and the supernatural. It's not enough to simply say there is one; for EAM to achieve something more than being a statement of opinion it needs to be explanatory: why is vitality limited by some material considerations and not others?\n \n \nNice analogy, except that, unfortunately for science, organisms are not so limited in their options as chess pieces are, and chance, in the form of natural environmental exigencies, does play a roll in evolution that it never has in chess. Coffee-housing and kibbitzing aside. ;)\n\n \n Oh, I think there are probably a lot of unconsidered variables in many chess games :) But you appreciate the point: if EAM cannot define its own parameters then we are watching a game where any move might be possible by either player at any time using any piece; we would have no idea why the board looked as it did at any given time - and although I wouldn't presume to be able to predict Kasparov's next move, I should at least be able to narrow down those available to him.\n \n \nChange its behaviour and morphology in its own lifetime? In a trivial sense,yes, as in dieting and body-building. In an evolutionary sense, no. That requires developmental evolution, and that requires generational change. Genomic change may require many generations of epigenetic transformation before the 'new' organisms stimulate a 'new' genome to reflect their 'new' reality.\n\n \n You say 'may', which is kind of the point I'm making: we cannot derive from EAM any reason why the process would have to take several generations to produce a new genome. The fact is, at one moment one organism has one genome, in the next it (or its offspring) has another. What makes that moment, or the circumstances surrounding it, special? Why did it have to proceed via these intermediate, materially unrelated stages when they do not, so far as I can see, make the actual final step of physical genome change any less complex or 'difficult' to achieve?\n \n \nBecause by definition ' biological evolution' is an historical and extended process, not an immediate and short-term one. <snip< We agree to require change over at least one generation.\n\n \n Sorry to keep pressing the point, but whatever we decide to make the word evolution mean won't have the slightest impact on what's actually happening in nature. Organisms won't refrain from enacting morphological and genetic change within a single lifetime just out of respect for a dictionary definition :) So why doesn't it happen?\n \n \nWell, I shouldn't point out that gender-specific trait lineages is a real problem for RMNS, but I will. Not so for EAM. Where eventual fixation in the genome is directed by the organism itself, <snip< there is no difficulty with differences that are gender or otherwise specified.\n\n \n I didn't actually say it was a problem. I said that logically those traits could only be developed along the pure male or pure female lineages until genetic fixation, since no other lineage would experience the chronic stimulus to advance the development of that trait, or actually 'want' to epigenetically inherit it. It follows that EAM can act along a single lineage of the many leading to any given organism in an interbreeding population; there is no requirement for ancestral consensus. The point I was leading up to is that this would suggest we should see many more unique traits than we actually do, because simple statistics would suggest that at least one of the hundreds of lineages leading to many organisms would be likely to have experienced some kind of chronic stimulus.\n \n \nPlease remember that in the most common examples, i.e., eusocial bacteria, yeasts, and whatnot, the individual cell is not what 'adapts', since it is no more the organism, eg., you, then is one of your own skin cells.\n\n \n Now, I'm sorry but I'm going to have to take strong exception to that. Bacteria, unlike my skin cells, are complete and self-sufficient organisms in their own right. Colonies may exhibit higher-level emergent behaviour, but so do colonies or packs of all kinds of animals - birds in flight, fish in shoal etc. There is certainly a blurred distinction between single and multi-cellular life, somewhere around the point where cells cease to be capable of independence and start to specialise, but bacteria and yeast are firmly on the 'independent organisms' side of that line.\n \n \nWhat I did say is that chance plays no part in the internally directed response mechanism that organisms undergo under direct stimulus. Granted, the heuristic 'trial-and-error' approach may \"appear\" chance-based, but since it is directed and constrained by its goal, that is, it is teleological, it is goal-based, it is NOT chance-based, open-ended, non-directional and stochastic.\n\n \n \nWe are deriving our inference of EAM from observations of directed evolution.\n\n \n I find these statements taken together highly intriguing. I'm still having difficulty seeing where this certainty comes from that all adaptation, on every level, occurs as a result of intelligently directed processes. The former statement above is a reiteration of that assertion. The latter claim that EAM is inferred from observations of directed evolution still leaves a very large hole in that certainty: I don't know what specific evidence you're referring to, but behavioural response to stimulus, genetically determined morphological response to behavior, genetically and chemically driven examples of epigenetic inheritance mechanisms do not add up to an overarching intelligence.\n \n Don't get me wrong: if the observable 'room' for non-intelligent adaptive processes was tiny I wouldn't try to play the 'god of the gaps' argument. But the evidence I've seen thus far does not support the conclusion that intelligence is involved anywhere beyond the conventionally accepted realm of behavioural modification.\n \n \nAnd I'm not so sure that digestion is strictly a matter of gut bacteria, in any case. It's not a matter of bacteria being able to eat something so that we can then eat them. The biochemistry of nutruient take-up into the circulatory system is a tad more bio-chemically complex than that.\n\n \n Oh, undoubtedly. But it's no more biochemically complex than any other system vitality is claimed to influence, and I do recall you saying that elements within a complex automatically do what's best for the collective.\n \n Regarding the scope of change under EAM:\n \n \nNot at all. See above, limitations both informational and physical on evolutionary change.\n\n \n I'm scratching my head a little over this, because your last statement on the scope of EAM was:\n \n \nEAM has no problem with multiple restructuring, via developmental biology, not only of one or more vital morphological or biochemical traits, but of brod and important relationships and structures within the genome, so that great changes could appear in as little as a single generation.\n\n \n So what can and can't it do? \n \n I still haven't grasped why EAM counts as a genuine hypothesis. Its capabilities don't seem to be based on any kind of principle; they're simply enumerated to account for observations - or in some cases preferred interpretations of observations. \n \n There seems little reason, for example, to declare that EAM can produce sweeping, genome-spanning changes in a single generation except to make it fulfil a particular interpretation of punctuated equilibrium, that interpretation in turn seemingly chosen for no other reason than to preclude alternative theories. I'm going to break my own rule a tiny bit here by mentioning localised speciation and migration as a gradualistic hypothesis to explain the same observations. I feel justified in doing so because it's perfectly compatible with EAM, and doesn't beg these awkward questions about why EAM can produce some huge, sweeping changes but not others.\n \n \nSure. A meaningful change in an organism and its lineage that improves its ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce that involve no immediate and proximate stimulus observed in an unaltered environment to which it and its fellows are already adapted. That would show that its evolution was accidental, not teleological.\n\n \n I have to call the validity of that into question. If such a change occurred you could simply claim that its fellows were clearly not 'already adapted', and continue to make that claim ad infinitum as more and more adaptations occurred. I believe this is referred to as the 'no true scotsman' fallacy.\n \n There are similar loopholes in 'unaltered environment' - one could simply claim that the environment for that organism was different and we just weren't looking in the right place or the right way to see it. Either that, or one could simply invoke the troublingly vague 'may take many generations' caveat and say that this is a response to a change in the environment that occurred before one started observing. Or as a last resort one could claim that the artificially stable environment we imposed itself constituted a change from the naturally variable environment in which the organism was previously living.\n \n But ok, let's accept it as a placeholder and talk about this likely candidate for delivering such falsification. Note for the record that the title, \"Directed Evolution of Metabolic Pathways\", refers to evolution 'directed' by the constraints of the particular environment they set up, and is not intended to imply volition on the part of the single-celled participants.\n \n A few salient details from that paper:\n \n 1. The chemostat was continuously and vigorously agitated, and represented an extremely stable chemical environment.\n \n 2. No adaptive improvement of any kind was detected for about 180 generations.\n \n 3. Bearers of each successive adaptive mutation displaced unmutated cells at a rate mathematically consistent with the (later measured) differential reproductive success afforded by their mutation. In other words, it wasn't the case that more and more cells mutated - or if they did the effect was completely overshadowed by differential reproductive rates. Rather the evidence points to a single cell experiencing the mutation and surviving to reproduce.\n \n 4. It required 400,000,000,000 effective cell generations for two adaptive mutations to arise.\n \n Applying your stated criteria for falsification, the 'wiggle room' it leaves becomes apparent. Although absolutely no improvement was observed for 180 stable generations, and no further improvement for another 220, the vagueness with which EAM's parameters are defined means we can still say that the chemostat represented a novel environment in which the cells were desperately trying and failing to 'do better', despite the eventual improvements, when 'found', being simple atomic mutations of individual genes. We have a potential falsification of the assertion that EAM can induce sweeping genetic change at a single step, given the 220,000,000,000 cell generations it took to arrive at the second adaptive mutation to the exact same chemical environment - but again, EAM only says it's possible, not that it will definitely happen.\n \n There's no evidence of any intermediate behavioural or epigenetic steps, but since the displacement rates indicate that only one out of 180,000,000,000 cells could actually have taken them, we can always say they must have happened, but we missed them.\n \n My concern is that this is an experiment which, on the face of it, does exactly what your falsification test demands: it shows gradual adaptation in a stable environment - yet we can wriggle out of it by arbitrarily dilating or contracting the parameters of how EAM 'must have' worked in that specific situation.",

A sculpture can be limited by the substance used to construct it, but it will always be subordinate to the intelligence, volition, and creativity of the sculpter. The same goes for most artefacts. You can build aeroplanes, but not out of lead, knives, but not out of marshmallow. Yes, every organism is limited by the abilities and substances available to it, including its own intelligence, and yes, that local intelligence is limited by the organic design of each organism. But that changes nothing, since EAM never pretended to be magical, capable of 'creatio ex nihilo', in the first place. If you're wondering, that would mean that Vitality could not generate life to begin with unless material conditions were 'just so'. Hence the viability of \"The Strong Anthropic Principle\". The difference being that even if the material conditions that were part of genesis on this planet were duplicated, their mere duplication cannot account for the generation of life. In se, they are necessary, but insufficient. Simply waving off the problem by an appeal to bottom-up \"emergence\" is simply another appeal to\"spontaneous generation\",. that is the miracle/magic of the superstition, 'creatio ex nihilo'.\n \n \n\n Yet this seems to be contradicted by the claims made for vitality: that it manipulates matter in a non-mechanical way; causes it to behave in ways it would normally not.\n\n \n **\n Since we, and every other life form, can manipulate matter and cause it to behave in ways that it would not normally, as per the four physical forces, behave, the claim seems indisputable.\n \n \n\n What I'm trying to get at is the nature of this interface between the material and the supernatural.\n\n \n **\n As I've told you before.

We know change happens. In fact, we know that 'stasis' is an illusion. It is the nature of the universe to be in a state of perpetual flux. The issues for science are what forces rationalise that flux sufficient to create at least temporal order, stability, law, predictability, and sanity. The forces of this universe do that, no matter what generates them, themselves. One of the greatest forces for imposing law and order on chaos and insanity, without which nothing would have any temporal stability, ergo no actual existence at all, is intelligence. We see this in human affairs, and it is not the least bit difficult to expand that observation to non-human systems. Including biosystems.\n \n \n\n Why did it have to proceed via these intermediate, materially unrelated stages when they do not, so far as I can see, make the actual final step of physical genome change any less complex or 'difficult' to achieve?\n\n \n **\n The entire point of a genome is to avoid change, and preserve and conserve stability and stasis. Of course it is difficult to overcome its intrinsic resistance to change. If it changed with with the weather, it would be worthless. Naturally, it would be the last piece of the organism to accept change. To ask 'why' that which requires a natural progression could not be circumvented by a simple wish or a word, is to once again ask why what you assume is 'supernatural' cannot achieve what it does the easy way, i.e., \"magically\".\n You really need to get past your prejudiced assumption that all that does not suit the materialist/mechanist metaphysic is an appeal to the supernatural and magical.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Because by definition ' biological evolution' is an historical and extended process, not an immediate and short-term one. <snip< We agree to require change over at least one generation. \n \n \n Sorry to keep pressing the point, but whatever we decide to make the word evolution mean won't have the slightest impact on what's actually happening in nature.

Much easier to remodel a design while you're building it, that is, during the developmental stage. And that requires at least two generations--parent generation and offspring generation. Which is no doubt why life comes in many generations instead of one long and unchanging one, in the first place.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Well, I shouldn't point out that gender-specific trait lineages is a real problem for RMNS, but I will.

Especially when _modern_science has emphatically established the reality of epigenetic inheritance and developmental evolution. Having once accepted that some specified organismic stimulation can alter the genome in a restricted fashion over several generations, then there can be no objection to the assertion that, under certain conditions, much more sweeping behavioural, morphological, and hence, genomic changes, can take place in a shorter time.\n The issue is the power that enables change and reformation. Enough of it and the job can be done, providing that what is to be done is possible at all.\n \n Moreover, EAM, though claiming that rapid, multi-faceted changes in morphology are possible under the teleological stimulus of EAM, whereas under RMNS they are plainly impossible, does not insist that all changes occur simultaneously. Only those that in those rare instances of what is called, 'macroevolution', can have no viable intermediates.\n \n \n\n I'm going to break my own rule a tiny bit here by mentioning localised speciation and migration as a gradualistic hypothesis to explain the same observations. I feel justified in doing so because it's perfectly compatible with EAM, and doesn't beg these awkward questions about why EAM can produce some huge, sweeping changes but not others.\n\n \n **\n Again, except in those rare instances in which there cannot be viable alternatives, (at least, not without a great deal of specious rationalization), eg., the whale's pelvic girdle, evolutionary change is seldom broad. Simply because, in a teleological process, a systematic change is never any greater than it absolutely has to be, nor any quicker than is necessary, either. The point is, that broder changes can be accomplished in much shorter time frames in an intelligent, intentional process than could ever be as the result of random chance.\n \n And, if EAM can direct a point mutation, it can direct a chromosomal mutation by exactly the same token.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Sure. A meaningful change in an organism and its lineage that improves its ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce that involve no immediate and proximate stimulus observed in an unaltered environment to which it and its fellows are already adapted. That would show that its evolution was accidental, not teleological. \n \n \n I have to call the validity of that into question. If such a change occurred you could simply claim that its fellows were clearly not 'already adapted', and continue to make that claim ad infinitum as more and more adaptations occurred. I believe this is referred to as the 'no true scotsman' fallacy.\n\n \n **\n That fallacy is the fallacy of making a thing so or not so by arbitrary definition. If the definition is the consequence of factual observation, or even of generally accepted usage, then calling attention to the fact that this or that does not match the definition is not a fallacy. To claim otherwise is to resort to the fallacy of 'special pleading'.\n \n In my example, it requires no more than a history of the organism in that environment to establish that no great change has occurred in either over many generations, and since it can be shown that the organisms in question have survived, indeed, thrived and reproduced quite satisfactorily over that historical span, that they are in fact, adapted. What you are attempting to do here is nullify the entire concept of adaptedness.\n \n \n\n There are similar loopholes in 'unaltered environment' - one could simply claim that the environment for that organism was different and we just weren't looking in the right place or the right way to see it.\n\n \n **\n An 'argument from ignorance' as ever was. People are always free to make irrational arguments. It's up to rational people to dismiss them.\n \n \n\n Either that, or one could simply invoke the troublingly vague 'may take many generations' caveat and say that this is a response to a change in the environment that occurred before one started observing.\n\n \n **\n The past is no longer the 'black box' it used to be. Modern science has many reliable methods of establishing what exactly took place in the history of any geographical ecosystem. Your objections are entirely spurious.\n \n \n \n\n Or as a last resort one could claim that the artificially stable environment we imposed itself constituted a change from the naturally variable environment in which the organism was previously living.\n\n \n **\n Who said anything about \"impos[ing]\" an \"artificially stable environment\"?!?!\n Most ecosystems, (barring those now undergoing radical shakeups thanks to global warming) are stable, within given parameters, over long timespans, with no help from us needed or given.\n \n \n\n But ok, let's accept it as a placeholder and talk about this likely candidate for delivering such falsification. Note for the record that the title, \"Directed Evolution of Metabolic Pathways\", refers to evolution 'directed' by the constraints of the particular environment they set up, and is not intended to imply volition on the part of the single-celled participants.\n \n A few salient details from that paper:\n \n 1. The chemostat was continuously and vigorously agitated, and represented an extremely stable chemical environment.\n \n 2. No adaptive improvement of any kind was detected for about 180 generations.\n \n 3. Bearers of each successive adaptive mutation displaced unmutated cells at a rate mathematically consistent with the (later measured) differential reproductive success afforded by their mutation. In other words, it wasn't the case that more and more cells mutated - or if they did the effect was completely overshadowed by differential reproductive rates. Rather the evidence points to a single cell experiencing the mutation and surviving to reproduce.\n \n 4. It required 400,000,000,000 effective cell generations for two adaptive mutations to arise.\n \n Applying your stated criteria for falsification, the 'wiggle room' it leaves becomes apparent. Although absolutely no improvement was observed for 180 stable generations, and no further improvement for another 220, the vagueness with which EAM's parameters are defined means we can still say that the chemostat represented a novel environment in which the cells were desperately trying and failing to 'do better', despite the eventual improvements, when 'found', being simple atomic mutations of individual genes. We have a potential falsification of the assertion that EAM can induce sweeping genetic change at a single step, given the 220,000,000,000 cell generations it took to arrive at the second adaptive mutation to the exact same chemical environment - but again, EAM only says it's possible, not that it will definitely happen.\n\n \n **\n If it took 220,000,000,000 generations, then the bacteria can't have been very highly stimulated to do anything at all, at least not to their genes. And again, we disagree completely over the nature of microbiological lifeforms. With that in mind your interpretation of events and mine are not going to jibe.\n I haven't read the paper for that very reason. Along with the fact that arguing the implications of that paper would require another thread of its own.\n \n \n\n My concern is that this is an experiment which, on the face of it, does exactly what your falsification test demands: it shows gradual adaptation in a stable environment - yet we can wriggle out of it by arbitrarily dilating or contracting the parameters of how EAM 'must have' worked in that specific situation.\n\n \n **\n What, exaxctly, was the 'adaptation' you speak of, and to what did it adapt?\n It seems to me that you are playing fast and loose with that word. You have a mutation in a bacteria colony. Nobody denies that they happen. The issue is, are they always accidental and entropic? Why is this genetic mutation accidental and 'adaptive'?",

   "**\n \n From snowflake formation to growth of bacterial colonies II: Cooperative formation of complex colonial patterns\n \n \n ESHEL BEN-JACOB \n \n Abstract: \n \n In nature, bacterial colonies must often cope with hostile environmental conditions. To do so they have developed sophisticated cooperative behaviour and intricate communication capabilities, such as direct cell- cell physical interactions via extra-membrane polymers, collective production of extracellular 'wetting' fluid for movement on hard surfaces, longrange chemical signalling such as quorum sensing and chemotactic (bias of movement according to gradient of chemical agent) signalling, collective activation and deactivation of genes and even exchange of genetic material. Utilizing these capabilities, the bacterial colonies develop complex spatio-temporal patterns in response to adverse growth conditions. We present a wealth of beautiful patterns formed during colonial development of various bacterial strains and for different environmental conditions. Invoking ideas from pattern formation in non-living systems and using generic modelling we are able to reveal novel bacterial strategies which account for the salient features of the evolved patterns. Using the models, we demonstrate how bacterial communication leads to colonial self-organization that can only be achieved via cooperative behaviour of the cells. It can be viewed as the action of a singular feedback between the microscopic level (the individual cells) and the macroscopic level (the colony) in the determination of the emerging patterns. \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2674708",

   "**\n Authors: Mahadevan, S\n For a long time, the ability to communicate has been considered as an exclusive property of multicellular \"higher\" organisms. However, research over the past few decades has raised serious doubts about this point of view. Complex behaviours such as chemotaxis, quorum sensing and biofilm formation show that bacteria can communicate with the environment, within the species and with other species (O'Toole et al 2000; Miller and Bassler 2001 for reviews). Apparently bacteria use physical signals as part of sophisticated signalling systems that function over distances that are substantially larger than cellular dimensions (which are of the order of one to a few \u00b5m).\n Full-text available from: http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00000209/01/bacterial_communication.pdf \n http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00000209/",

   "**\n \n REVIEW ARTICLE\n Bacteria harnessing complexity\n E. Ben Jacob&#8727;, Y. Aharonov and Y. Shapira\n ABSTRACT\n The study of bacterial colonies is a crucial step towards understanding biofilms.\n We review some of the exciting discoveries about bacterial self-organization\n that might shed new light on biocomplexity in general and biofilms in particular.\n This review is aimed at researchers from different disciplines - microbiology,\n biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and computer science. To make\n the presentation comprehensible we have avoided the use of specialized\n terminology of the different disciplines and limited the experimental and\n computational details.\n Bacteria can self-organize into hierarchically structured colonies of 109 to\n 1012 bacteria, each utilizing a great variety of biochemical communication\n agents, such as simple molecules, polymers, peptides, complex proteins,\n genetic material and also \"cassettes of genetic information\" such as plasmids\n and viruses. Bacteria use their intracellular flexibility, involving signal transduction networks and genomic plasticity, to collectively maintain self and shared interpretations of chemical cues, exchange of meaning-bearing chemical messages, and dialogues. The meaning-based communication permits the formation of colonial intentional behavior, purposeful alteration of colony structure and decision-making - features we might begin to associate with bacterial social intelligence. Such social intelligence, should it exist, would require going beyond communication to encompass additional intracellular processes, as yet unknown, for generating inheritable colonial memory and commonly shared genomic context.

They are able to reverse the spontaneous course\n of entropy increase and convert high-entropy inorganic\n substances into low-entropy life-sustaining molecules.\n Three and a half billion years have passed and the existence\n of higher organisms depends on this unique bacterial\n know-how. Even for us, with all our scientific knowledge\n and technological advances, the ways in which bacteria\n solved this fundamental requirement for life are still a\n mystery (Schr\u00a8odinger, 1944, 1958, 1992; Liebes et al., 1998;\n Margulies & Dolan, 2002).\n We do know that this is not a solitary endeavor for\n the bacteria and, under natural conditions, they employ\n chemical communication to form hierarchically structured\n colonies of 109 to 1012 bacteria each (Kuner & Kaiser,\n 1982;Matsushita & Fuijikawa, 1990; Ohgiwari et al., 1992;\n Ben Jacob et al., 1994; Salmond et al., 1995; Shapiro, 1995;\n Wirth et al., 1996; Shapiro & Dworkin, 1997; Dunny &\n Winans, 1999; Shimkets, 1999; Bassler, 2002;Miller, 2002;\n Mok et al., 2003; Velicer, 2003; Xavier & Bassler, 2003).\n By acting jointly, they can make use of any available\n source of energy and imbalances in any environments,\n from deep inside the earth's crust to nuclear reactors and\n from freezing icebergs to sulfuric hot springs, and they\n can convert any available substances, from tar to metals.\n Under unpredictable hostile environmental conditions,\n when the odds are against survival, the bacteria turn to a\n wide range of strategies for adaptable collective responses.\n These cooperative modes of behavior are manifested\n through remarkable different patterns formed during\n colonial self-organization.

   "'Limited by' is not the same as 'subordinate to'.\n\n \n Semantically, perhaps, but not in practical terms. My wishes and desires are limited by, and thus subordinate to my income - a source of perennial dissatisfaction. However you wish to phrase the situation, it remains what it is: a force that can mobilise matter to act - on a molecular level - against its nature, which is nevertheless constrained by other limitations that same matter imposes. Note that I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with that, just that it begs the question why. Why so far, and no further? What prevents vitality from knowing more than it does, if it is as you say universal? Penguins eat fish all the time, which contain DNA explaining exactly how gills work - why can't vitality understand and harness the information in that DNA, when it apparently can understand and harness, even design DNA for the organism itself?\n \n \nSince we, and every other life form, can manipulate matter and cause it to behave in ways that it would not normally, as per the four physical forces, behave, the claim seems indisputable.\n\n \n That's not actually true. To get matter outside our bodies to behave other than it would 'at rest' we must interact with it via the material interface of physics. With vitality the Newton's Cradle has no 'first ball'. If you're talking about the matter of our own bodies, you're assuming the conclusions of your own hypothesis: that life requires an additional explanatory force. What you're trying to prove is that matter, configured as it is in our bodies, wouldn't behave the way we observe it to.\n \n \nAs I've told you before. If you insist upon believing that the natural force, Vitality, and all thing pertinent to life, including intelligence, volition, emotion, and every other psychical phenomenon are somehow \"supernatural\", for no better reaspon than that your metaphysic disregards anything that doesn't cast a shadow when you hold a candle to it, then we have no common ground for discussion.\n\n \n Sorry; if I refer to it as supernatural it is for lack of a better term - partly because I still see no quantitative measurement or prediction being possible, unlike the other 'intangibles' such as gravity. I also think of it as supernatural because its existence, unlike gravity et al, strongly implies a creator. Your instinct might be to disagree, but think: the universe can function perfectly well without this force, whose purpose concerns - not matter, but high-level abstract concepts like 'survival', 'thriving', and 'reproduction' - concepts which, in the absence of a creator, would not even exist before the first life emerged.\n \n \nBecause it is natural; not omnipotent and magical.\n\n \n You're misunderstanding the question: it could still be natural and subject to quite different limitations. The pertinent question is: why those limitations and not others?\n \n \nThe entire point of a genome is to avoid change, and preserve and conserve stability and stasis. Of course it is difficult to overcome its intrinsic resistance to change. If it changed with with the weather, it would be worthless.\n\n \n But it isn't changing with the weather; according to you it's changing as a result of the intelligent action of Vitality. How can mere insensate molecules 'resist' Vitality? Why can they only be persuaded to change after a process of behavioural and epigenetic inheritance?\n \n \nTo ask 'why' that which requires a natural progression could not be circumvented by a simple wish or a word, is to once again ask why what you assume is 'supernatural' cannot achieve what it does the easy way, i.e., \"magically\".\n\n \n That simply isn't an answer. All you're saying is that 'it has rules because it's natural, not supernatural'. The question is not 'why rules?' but 'why those rules?'. In fact, the question is what are the rules?\n \n \nI don't know from statistics. I've never known them to do anything but reflect whatever is, whatever it is. If you want to make inferences from them, go ahead, but as far as I'm concerned it amounts to nothing but abstract speculation, armchair theorizing.\n\n \n A little respect for the - admittedly drab - world of statistics would not go amiss here. Most of the drugs you'll ever have to take in your life have been proven effective using statistics (it being fundamentally impossible to both give and not give medicine to the same patient to see which works out the best). My point is simply that, given the huge number of animals (heck, people) around us, and the huge number of lineages each possesses, we really ought to observe coincidentally chronic stimulus down one lineage inducing EAM's radical, sweeping genetic changes. But we don't.\n \n \nNo, they are not. You need to catch up on your micro-biology. But you are right in so far as the 'collective intelligence' exhibited by flocks, herds, schools and so forth, is an actuality in its own right.\n\n \n If a single bacterium can give rise to a colony, then it counts as an organism in its own right. Sorry, but I'm just not going to budge on this. Colonies might be capable of 'more', but that doesn't detract from what a single bacterium can do. In any case, the tests relevant to this discussion exclude colony-level influence by their very nature. If human beings were all near-simultaneously infected with a near-instantly lethal virus, our collective - our society - would have bugger all to do with who lived and who died. Thus it is with bacterial samples exposed to phage.\n \n \nOh, puhleeeze! They are explicitly related to a natural causal force, Vitality!!\n Why do you have objections to that when you can find no objection to a hypothesis, RMNS, which reduces to the principle of spontaneous generation?\n\n \n RMNS is off the table here. The fact is, I still have no idea what 'principle' underlies the alleged capabilities of EAM. It can supposedly do this, that, or the other because we've seen those things happen (or interpreted observations a particular way) but there's no generalisation. EAM gives no reason for only 1 in 100,000,000 bacteria surviving plating on phage, or it taking 180 generations for yeast to partially adapt to phosphate deprivation. It makes no predictions; only that adaption 'will happen'. \n \n \nOnce you accept that organisms have the power to redesign and/or reform their behaviour and morphology in any way, (and that's pretty much undeniable), then you cannot logically argue that you can improve your cardio-vascular system but not your genomic (inheritance) system.\n\n \n I can if I can show that the parameters for the cardio-vascular system are genetically encoded - that is to say, that the morphological response to behaviour is predefined by the genetic makeup of the organism. So far, all the examples you've given have been of that type: genetically predefined responses to frequently experienced environmental variations. There is no adaptive gap for vitality to fill.\n \n \nThat fallacy is the fallacy of making a thing so or not so by arbitrary definition. If the definition is the consequence of factual observation, or even of generally accepted usage, then calling attention to the fact that this or that does not match the definition is not a fallacy. To claim otherwise is to resort to the fallacy of 'special pleading'.\n\n \n You are absolutely right, and that's exactly my point. The 'falsification criteria' that you devised says: \"If we see an organism improve for no apparent reason when it was already adapted, EAM is falsified\". But if we see an improvement then by definition it was not already adapted. Your statement describes the falsification of EAM arising from a logically impossible situation. It is therefore not a valid description of an observation that could falsify EAM.\n \n \nIf it took 220,000,000,000 generations, then the bacteria can't have been very highly stimulated to do anything at all, at least not to their genes.\n\n \n It took 180 for one mutation and another 220 for the second. The 'effective cell generations' is calculated by factoring in the number of cells involved in each generation. \n \n The adaptations to the low-phosphate environment yielded a very significant reproductive advantage - significant enough for the mutants to rapidly displace the non-mutants. Why doesn't this count as 'highly stimulated'?\n \n \nThe issue is, are they always accidental and entropic? Why is this genetic mutation accidental and 'adaptive'?\n\n \n Actually, in this thread that's not the issue at all. The issue here is why it took 1,000,000,000 cells 180 generations to respond to a phosphate-limited environment, why only one in that billion actually succeeded, and why it didn't also enact the second adaptive mutation that required another 220 generations, despite both mutations being atomic (as in indivisibly simple). The issue is: how is that supposed to indicate intelligence at work? What in the description of EAM would lead us to expect this kind of observation?\n \n You've posted a number of links to research into the eusocial behaviour of bacteria. It's very interesting stuff, and goes a long way towards filling the developmental gap between single and multi-celled organisms, but the fact remains that the Fluctuation Test by its very nature excludes the possibility of organised eusocial response, as does the constant and vigorous agitation of the yeast cell solution in the linked study, the relevance of the which is this: if your proposed falsification criteria for EAM actually means anything, then it has been roundly falsified: the linked yeast study describes a stable environment, hundreds of stable generations and then POW: a new and much more successful strain emerges for no apparent reason. Not only that, but another couple of hundred generations later POW: an even better strain emerges for no apparent reason.\n \n I'll have to leave it there for now; it's late and I have to conserve my energy for arguing with marc9000.",

   "\n However you wish to phrase the situation, it remains what it is: a force that can mobilise matter to act - on a molecular level - against its nature, which is nevertheless constrained by other limitations that same matter imposes.\n\n \n **\n I do not assert that Vitality, in your words, \"can mobilise matter to act - on a molecular level - against its nature\". On the molecular level molecules and other 'bits of stuff' can only do what the molecular forces, the strong and weak nuclear forces, cause them to do. We can also include gravity/mass and electro-magnetism/charges as causal forces ( force fields) within molecules.\n \n I do not assert, as some panpsychists do, that Vitality operates at that level. As far as I am concerned, Vitality is a force that operates within complex, dynamic, self-organized and self-directed complex systems, not within molecules. That is, in my current opinion, Vitality is exogenous at the atomic and molecular levels, and endogenous at the biosystems level.\n \n What Vitality does is to temporarily arrest the rate of entropic change that is a natural consequence of the ordering of matter into structured forms, at least at the level of autopoietic systems. It has nothing to do with natural physical systems, or artificial machine systems, such as solar systems and/or computer systems, except indirectly in the latter case. The creation of dynamic, complex, autonomous, self-organising and self-directing systems, i.e., organisms, by organising and energising certain ordered structures of dynamically interacting material parts, (molecules and other bits of stuff), does not not go contrary to the natural behaviours of these bits of stuff, but only to the entropy that continuously and unceasingly seeks to eliminate dynamism and replace it with static equilibrium by by diminishing the order in the system and decreasing the coherence and synergy of its constituent parts and their overall productivity.\n \n Now, I do not know why our universe produces natural systems, and I do not know why it is entropic wrt those systems. It just seems to be a requisite property of existence itself. IAC, systems and their creation in the face of entropy, and their inevitable destruction thanks to entropy, are perfectly natural. Thus, if inertia and gravity can create and sustain solar systems, then Vitality can create and sustain biosystems, and be no less natural for it.\n \n \n \n\n Note that I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with that, just that it begs the question why. Why so far, and no further? What prevents vitality from knowing more than it does, if it is as you say universal?\n\n \n **\n I've never claimed that Vitality \"knows\" anything. I have claimed that biosystems, thanks to the utilization of Vitality in their systemic operations, to create psychical properties, sometimes \"know\", or are at least \"aware of\", some things.\n \n \n\n Penguins eat fish all the time, which contain DNA explaining exactly how gills work - why can't vitality understand and harness the information in that DNA, when it apparently can understand and harness, even design DNA for the organism itself?\n\n \n **\n I don't say that Vitality, given certain requisite conditions, could never accomplish such a task. I do know that in the world as it is, those conditions cannot arise naturally. Why not? Because Vitality does not operate magically, via instantaneous 'poofs' of special creation or spontaneous generation. Vitality operates developmentally, which requires an extended temporal period. It's the old, 'Rome wasn't built in a day.\", objection.\n \n Now time requires, for living biosystems, some life-supporting cross-over during the replacement of one vital system for another. That means that while a penguin shifts from air-breathing lungs to water-breathing gills, it needs some way to get oxygen into the bloodstream. This requires the investment of so much more energy than normal (supporting and maintaining two partial systems instead of one fully operational system) during the developmental cross-over period, that it's insupportable. The more complex a system is, the more energy, including vital energy, it takes to redesign and rebuild it it, and that has to be measured against the cost of not redesigning it. That is why even small trait redesigns are resisted, and do not take place unless they are necessary to the organism. In the case of marine mammals and birds, the cost is not balanced by necessity; not even close, since their respiuratory systems are so complex. Simpler creatures such as reptiles and insects, when faced with chronic necessity, can and do shift from water breathing to air-breathing in the course of their development. Eg. frogs and dragonflies. And of course, they reverse from air-breathing to water-breathing in the course of generation and reproduction.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Since we, and every other life form, can manipulate matter and cause it to behave in ways that it would not normally, as per the four physical forces, behave, the claim seems indisputable. \n \n \n That's not actually true. To get matter outside our bodies to behave other than it would 'at rest' we must interact with it via the material interface of physics.\n\n \n **\n Not only physics, but the psychical properties of motivation and volition. Without them we would leave everything, \"at rest\". The same for dynamic complex self-determined biosystems of all kinds. It takes both the psychical interface of Vitality and the material interface of physics before they can do what they do. But what they do cannot be done \"via the material interface of physics\", alone. A stone cannot roll uphill, but you can climb one. If you've a mind to.\n \n \n\n With vitality the Newton's Cradle has no 'first ball'. \n\n \n **\n What makes you say that? The 'balls', meaning the material components of a system are there, whether it is an artificially contrived system like \"Newton's Cradle\", or a dynamic configuration developmentally devised by natural forces.\n In the case of the 'cradle' the 'first ball' does nothing until an intelligent operator is motivated to move it. IOW, the operation of the 'cradle' owes as much to Vitality as it does to whatever mysterious physical drive makes the balls behave as described by \"Newton's Third Law\". They simply do act as they do and that makes what they do, \"natural\". Just as 'gravity', whatever it is, does what it does, and that makes it, 'natural'. Just as Vitality, as expressed as living systems, does what they do, and so is also, 'natural'. Not 'mechanical', but 'natural' all the same.\n \n \n\n If you're talking about the matter of our own bodies, you're assuming the conclusions of your own hypothesis: that life requires an additional explanatory force.\n\n \n **\n You've got it wrong. I am infering from empirical observation of behaviours, and the difference in behaviours between simple bits of stuff, and even simple mechanical systems, as contrasted with autopoietic living biosystems, \n that the four accepted 'physical' forces are necessary, but insufficient, to account for those differences. Thus my hypothesis--that life requires an additional explanatory force. Pointing out the observations that led to the hypothesis is is not \"assuming the conclusions of your own hypothesis\", but demonstrating where the hypothesis came from. For instance, if you are dead, you can no more get out of bed and walk than the first ball in a \"Newton's Cradle\" can starting swinging all by itself, using only the four 'physical' forces for causation in either case.\n \n \n\n What you're trying to prove is that matter, configured as it is in our bodies, wouldn't behave the way we observe it to.\n\n \n **\n Of course I'm not doing any such thing. Whyever would I. What is, is, and I've never said otherwise, since such a thing would be insane. How odd of you to make such an accusation!?!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n As I've told you before. If you insist upon believing that the natural force, Vitality, and all thing pertinent to life, including intelligence, volition, emotion, and every other psychical phenomenon are somehow \"supernatural\", for no better reaspon than that your metaphysic disregards anything that doesn't cast a shadow when you hold a candle to it, then we have no common ground for discussion. \n \n \n Sorry; if I refer to it as supernatural it is for lack of a better term\n\n \n **\n Actually, you say \"supernatural\" because you falsely equate the 'natural' with the 'mechanical', and so for you, anything that is not 'mechanical' is automatically 'supernatural'.\n \n Mechanism-\"The doctrine that all natural phenomena are explicable by material causes and mechanical principles.\" [answers.com]\n \n That's a metaphysical postulate, not a scientific principle. You're going to have to learn to get past it, or you'll never understand anything I'm saying.\n \n \n\n - partly because I still see no quantitative measurement or prediction being possible, unlike the other 'intangibles' such as gravity.\n\n \n **\n We have tests for psychical properties, as expressed in observable behaviours. We even use them on things as simple as plants. Those tests are descriptive and measurable. Just like everything else. Measurement of psychical phenomena requires no more than common agreement on an arbitrarily established criterion, just like weight or distance. \n \n \n\n I also think of it as supernatural because its existence, unlike gravity et al, strongly implies a creator.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it does, though not the 'creationist' creator. But that objection is, again, metaphysical and not scientific. Science does not rise or fall on the postulate of a 'creator'. But materialism and its many offshoots certainly do, since they are inherently atheistic.\n \n \n\n Your instinct might be to disagree, but think: the universe can function perfectly well without this force, whose purpose concerns - not matter, but high-level abstract concepts like 'survival', 'thriving', and 'reproduction' - concepts which, in the absence of a creator, would not even exist before the first life emerged.\n\n \n **\n Oh, I agree altogether. All the more so since I scorn \"creatio ex nihilo\", or as materialists put it, \"spontaneous generation\".\n \n \n\n You're misunderstanding the question: it could still be natural and subject to quite different limitations. The pertinent question is: why those limitations and not others?\n\n \n **\n Why is the universe as it is? Why is the strong anthropic principle the fact of the matter? Why is anything natural the way it is, and not some other way? Why is it that when you drop the first ball in Newton's Cradle, everything doesn't just stop dead, instead of doing what it does do? I don't know. Ask whoever put this show together.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The entire point of a genome is to avoid change, and preserve and conserve stability and stasis. Of course it is difficult to overcome its intrinsic resistance to change. If it changed with with the weather, it would be worthless. \n \n \n But it isn't changing with the weather; according to you it's changing as a result of the intelligent action of Vitality. How can mere insensate molecules 'resist' Vitality?\n\n \n **\n I don't know if they can. 'Mind over matter' is still an open question, and so far the evidence is positive. But it's irrelevent to this discussion, since I'm not discussing molecules, per se, but rather the interrelationships and structuring of molecules into synergistic systems. In terms of the genomic, conservation of form over generations', system, it is an information system by which related molecules act as symbols for meanings. If your mind can rewrite a sentence here in this thread, why can't your organism, or any organism, rewrite the info in its genomic code?\n \n \n\n Why can they only be persuaded to change after a process of behavioural and epigenetic inheritance?\n\n \n **\n Why is there any such thing as stability in existence? Why doesn't the flux of change happen so constantly and immediately that nothing ever gets to exist?\n Why is stasis necessary to actual existence? Why is stasis necessary to form?\n Why not 're-invent the wheel' with each new generation? It takes a great deal of 'energy' to create the stasis that makes form possible. Form is vital to existence, yet entropy is there to destroy it. Why? Because, as the eastern thinkers have it, that is the 'wheel' of existence. Creation and destruction, with temporary formation. Any system that conserves form against the ravages of entropy is going to resist any change unless and until it is forced to accept it. That's how actuality works.\n \n \n\n That simply isn't an answer. All you're saying is that 'it has rules because it's natural, not supernatural'. The question is not 'why rules?' but 'why those rules?'. In fact, the question is what are the rules?\n\n \n **\n Certain rules permit change, other rules maintain stasis. I've mentioned the most important rules. Such as, rule number one--\"If it ain't broke, don't try to 'fix' it.\" Rule two--\"Nothing springs from nothing.\" Rule three, \"If the game isn't worth the candle, don't play.\" and four, \"Do what you can, and can what you can't.\", and finally, five, \"Keep your eyes on the prize.\"\n \n \n\n My point is simply that, given the huge number of animals (heck, people) around us, and the huge number of lineages each possesses, we really ought to observe coincidentally chronic stimulus down one lineage inducing EAM's radical, sweeping genetic changes. But we don't.\n\n \n **\n Since I don't know what you mean, in empirical terms, when you say, \"we really ought to observe coincidentally chronic stimulus down one lineage inducing EAM's radical, sweeping genetic changes\", I can't comment. Perhaps if you gave a concrete example I might grasp your meaning.\n \n \n\n If a single bacterium can give rise to a colony, then it counts as an organism in its own right.\n\n \n **\n Perhaps, but not a complete organism. No more than a zygote is a complete human being, or an egg is a complete chicken. My point is that we don't study human behaviour by studying zygotes, and we don't study poultry behaviour by studying eggs, so we shouldn't be studying eucharyotic bacteria behaviour in terms of single cells instead of multi-cellular systems called colonies. We are all made up od cells, but do you award the title of 'organism' to each of the individual cells in your own body? No? Then don't do it to bacteria, unless you've got solid scientific reasons for making that distinction.\n \n \n \n\n Sorry, but I'm just not going to budge on this. Colonies might be capable of 'more', but that doesn't detract from what a single bacterium can do.\n\n \n **\n I've never said otherwise. My point is that colonies can do more than single cells, and so judging the capacities of bacteria generally based on the genomic capacities of a single bacterium simply detracts from what a colony is capable of doing. And that, \"single bacterium as independent organism whose capacities do not expand synergistically during colony development\", or, 'What's true for for a single bacterium is equally true for a whole bunch of 'em.\" point of view, is what makes the old LD'43 experiments, etc., null and void.\n \n \n\n In any case, the tests relevant to this discussion exclude colony-level influence by their very nature.\n\n \n **\n Absolutely not!! We are discussing autopoietic systems, and that's what eusocial bacteria colonies are. I'm not about to discuss chickens and limit tests to what can be done with eggs!!\n \n \n\n If human beings were all near-simultaneously infected with a near-instantly lethal virus, our collective - our society - would have bugger all to do with who lived and who died.\n\n \n **\n False analogy. Proper analogy--if all cells in a human being \"were all near-simultaneously infected with a near-instantly lethal virus, our collective - our [body] - would have bugger all to do with [which cells] lived and [which cells] died. Which is an absurd truism.\n \n \n\n The fact is, I still have no idea what 'principle' underlies the alleged capabilities of EAM. It can supposedly do this, that, or the other because we've seen those things happen (or interpreted observations a particular way) but there's no generalisation.\n\n \n **\n Here's a generalization for you. EAM says that all living organisms strive to survive, thrive, and ususually, to reproduce. That is, that all live organisms behave teleologically, both in whole and in part. That live organisms can only be understood wholistically, and not reductively, and therefore that all organismic behaviour, taken wholistically, including organismic development, organismic adaptation, organismic inheritance, and organismic evolution, is teleological-- not accidental or mechanical, is dynamic-- not passive, is endogenously self-directed,-- not externally compelled or predestined or programmed, neither by G*D nor by physical mechanics.\n \n \n\n EAM gives no reason for only 1 in 100,000,000 bacteria surviving plating on phage, or it taking 180 generations for yeast to partially adapt to phosphate deprivation. It makes no predictions; only that adaption 'will happen'. \n\n \n **\n I gave you a reason. In brief, change is hard for an established form to accomplish, and so change does not happen if it doesn't have to, except when caused by destructive entropic factors. Also, when operating collectively, therec is always some 'division of labour' in order to conserve energy and options. Thus an inherited immune reaction in bacteria may only be expressed in a few cells at any given time, or, thousands of cells may have to die in order for some cells to have enough time to reproduce and so to developmentally revert and recoup an artificially removed phage resistance.\n \n Modern microbiology opens a lot of theoretical doors that the out-dated, 'passively awaiting spontaneous generation of phage resistance' model used by L*D in '43 could never have imagined.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Once you accept that organisms have the power to redesign and/or reform their behaviour and morphology in any way, (and that's pretty much undeniable), then you cannot logically argue that you can improve your cardio-vascular system but not your genomic (inheritance) system. \n \n \n I can if I can show that the parameters for the cardio-vascular system are genetically encoded - that is to say, that the morphological response to behaviour is predefined by the genetic makeup of the organism.\n\n \n **\n But the parameters, that is, the broadest limits, of your cardio-vascular system is so encoded. What makes you think that the parameters of your genomic system is not? What makes you believe that if an improved and highly productive cardiovascular system became essential to your very survival, that your offspring would not epigenetically inherit an improved cardio-vascular system out of the genomic parameters available to it during development? What makes you think that this high-end epigenetically enhanced cardio-vascular system, if driven by necessity, would not eventually exceed those original genetic parameters? And that that would eventually force an expansion of those genetic parameters, and result in more permanent evolution? Are your objections based upon empirical science and observations of wild organisms, or are they only theoretical, and derived from an 'a priori' metaphysical belief?\n \n \n\n So far, all the examples you've given have been of that type: genetically predefined responses to frequently experienced environmental variations. There is no adaptive gap for vitality to fill.\n\n \n **\n I don't remember what examples you say I've given, but what difference does it make, since the issue is not examples of natural evolution, micro or macro, but rather the mechanism that causes them, i.e., RMNS or EAM? And BTW, there are examples around of micro-evolution of organisms under novel envirommental stimuli. If such observed trait modification is observed, even though it may be within genetic parameters, if the expression is a direct response to a given stimulus, then it's still teleological EAM, and not accidental darwinian expression.\n \n \n\n You are absolutely right, and that's exactly my point. The 'falsification criteria' that you devised says: \"If we see an organism improve for no apparent reason when it was already adapted, EAM is falsified\". But if we see an improvement then by definition it was not already adapted. Your statement describes the falsification of EAM arising from a logically impossible situation. It is therefore not a valid description of an observation that could falsify EAM.\n\n \n **\n Alright. Let's say then, that if we see a novel trait arise, or a meaningful difference in a normal, trait, that observably enhances any organism's ability to to survive, thrive, and reproduce, in comparison to its fellows, when to all intents and purposes it, its fellows, and its forebears had been surviving, thriving, and reproducing quite satisfactorily for generations in a particular and essentially established ecosystem, then we may say that a beneficial mutation arose by accident. If you still don't like this, suggest something else that will demonstrate that beneficial mutations can and do arise spontaneously, without regard for environmental stimulus.\n \n \n\n The adaptations to the low-phosphate environment yielded a very significant reproductive advantage - significant enough for the mutants to rapidly displace the non-mutants. Why doesn't this count as 'highly stimulated'?\n\n \n \n **\n Were the non-mutants starving? I don't know if they were highly stimulated or not. If they were, then they responded to the stimulus, and they had to work at developing a good response for some time before they succeeded. If they weren't highly stimulated, then the marvel is that even a modest stimulus brought on an adaptive mutation.\n \n Call that an assumption, but it is no more an assumption than the assumption that the adaptive mutation was caused by a passing gamma ray.\n \n \n\n Actually, in this thread that's not the issue at all. The issue here is why it took 1,000,000,000 cells 180 generations to respond to a phosphate-limited environment, why only one in that billion actually succeeded, and why it didn't also enact the second adaptive mutation that required another 220 generations, despite both mutations being atomic (as in indivisibly simple). The issue is: how is that supposed to indicate intelligence at work? What in the description of EAM would lead us to expect this kind of observation?\n\n \n **\n In this particular instance there are many variables that I have not been made aware of, but in general EAM says that the greater the change required, and the milder the stimulus to make it, the longer the time taken todevelopmentally accomplish it.\n \n \n\n You've posted a number of links to research into the eusocial behaviour of bacteria. It's very interesting stuff, and goes a long way towards filling the developmental gap between single and multi-celled organisms, but the fact remains that the Fluctuation Test by its very nature excludes the possibility of organised eusocial response,\n\n \n **\n No, it absolutely does not exclude any such thing. \n \n \n\n as does the constant and vigorous agitation of the yeast cell solution in the linked study,\n\n \n **\n It doesn't, either.\n \n \n\n the relevance of the which is this: if your proposed falsification criteria for EAM actually means anything, then it has been roundly falsified: the linked yeast study describes a stable environment, hundreds of stable generations and then POW: a new and much more successful strain emerges for no apparent reason. Not only that, but another couple of hundred generations later POW: an even better strain emerges for no apparent reason.\n\n \n **\n Were these yeasts living in the same environment to which they and their forebears normally and naturally inhabited, or were the experimental conditions different from their normal natural environment? Somehow I suspect the latter to be the case.",

   "I do not assert that Vitality, in your words, \"can mobilise matter to act - on a molecular level - against its nature\".\n\n \n You assert precisely that when you describe vitality modifying a molecular genetic code that is (by your own description) inherently static and resistant to change.\n \n \nThus, if inertia and gravity can create and sustain solar systems, then Vitality can create and sustain biosystems, and be no less natural for it.\n\n \n There is a very important distinction to be made here: gravity et al create solar systems unintentionally. Gravity is a property of what is already there: matter, and fusion etc is the emergent result. With vitality, we are talking about a force that acts to bring about a specific conceptual result: it supposedly brings about that which could be said to possess its properties - equivalent to gravity bringing about the first mass. Comparisons with other natural forces are not valid.\n \n \nI don't say that Vitality, given certain requisite conditions, could never accomplish such a task. I do know that in the world as it is, those conditions cannot arise naturally. Why not? Because Vitality does not operate magically, via instantaneous 'poofs' of special creation or spontaneous generation.\n\n \n But every claim you make describes just such a magical 'poof' - just a very small one. What I'm trying to extract from EAM is a reason for their small scale.\n \n \nYou've got it wrong. I am infering from empirical observation of behaviours, and the difference in behaviours between simple bits of stuff, and even simple mechanical systems, as contrasted with autopoietic living biosystems, \n that the four accepted 'physical' forces are necessary, but insufficient, to account for those differences.\n\n \n But what justification do you have for making that inference? If you looked and saw a dead brick and a live brick, you would have a case for suspecting an additional force involved in animating one lump of clay rather than another. But a living creature is physically distinguishable from a dead one, never mind from inanimate clay. There remains the possibility that the only difference you are actually seeing between life and non-life is its configuration - that you are simply wrong to believe that words like teleological and autopoietic can't apply to appropriately configured matter. Like I pointed out earlier, the universe isn't going to change the way it works out of respect for a dictionary definition.\n \n \nPointing out the observations that led to the hypothesis is is not \"assuming the conclusions of your own hypothesis\", but demonstrating where the hypothesis came from.\n\n \nOf course I'm not doing any such thing. Whyever would I. What is, is, and I've never said otherwise, since such a thing would be insane. How odd of you to make such an accusation!?!\n\n \n As I said, your assumption is that appropriately configured matter, together with the existing physical forces, can't behave the way we see living creatures behave. However, when you compare the living and the dead and the fundamentally inanimate you see physical differences. If you saw no physical differences then you would be justified in hypothesising a qualitative difference that we cannot or have not directly observed - but until then the possibility remains that the differences are, quite straightforwardly, the ones we can see.\n \n \nI don't know if they can. 'Mind over matter' is still an open question, and so far the evidence is positive\n\n \n We're not talking about mind over matter, though; we're talking about vitality over matter. They clearly can't be the same thing because my mind is entirely ignorant of the supposed power I wield over my genetic code. \n \n \nIn terms of the genomic, conservation of form over generations', system, it is an information system by which related molecules act as symbols for meanings. If your mind can rewrite a sentence here in this thread, why can't your organism, or any organism, rewrite the info in its genomic code?\n\n \n Turn that question around: why, then, can't organisms - any organism - read? Why can only those with large physical brains perform such a feat? You cannot take abilities that demonstrably require certain physical characteristics and use them to justify the alleged capabilities of a metaphysical force in organisms without those characteristics.\n \n \nSince I don't know what you mean, in empirical terms, when you say, \"we really ought to observe coincidentally chronic stimulus down one lineage inducing EAM's radical, sweeping genetic changes\", I can't comment. Perhaps if you gave a concrete example I might grasp your meaning.\n\n \n How can I give you a concrete example of what we don't observe? The questions is, why don't we see wild genetic aberrations - huge sweeping changes to a single individual - as a result of coincidentally chronic stimulus occurring down one of the hundreds of lineages leading to that organism?\n \n \nPerhaps, but not a complete organism.\n\n \n We're playing with definitions here. If a society can accomplish more than an individual, that says something about society, not whether that individual counts as an organism or not. Unless you're prepared to go the whole hog and say that the entire biosphere is the 'one true organism' you have no justification for selectively adjusting the meaning of the word to skirt around awkward bacterial test results.\n \n \nAnd that, \"single bacterium as independent organism whose capacities do not expand synergistically during colony development\", or, 'What's true for for a single bacterium is equally true for a whole bunch of 'em.\" point of view, is what makes the old LD'43 experiments, etc., null and void.\n\n \n But you've never actually demonstrated an understanding of the fluctuation test results - your previous comments in that respect clearly showed that you had failed to appreciate what was being described as significant.\n \n \nAbsolutely not!! We are discussing autopoietic systems, and that's what eusocial bacteria colonies are. I'm not about to discuss chickens and limit tests to what can be done with eggs!!\n\n \n Nobody's asking you to. Organised bacterial/yeast structures cannot persist in a medium experiencing constant and vigorous physical agitation (the yeast research) and in the fluctuation test, the significant result is the markedly different pattern of survival between the samples taken in the first and second parts of the experiment, despite all colonies being the same size.\n \n \nFalse analogy.\n\n \n Only according to your arbitrarily - and incorrectly - shifted goalposts. Here's why the analogy is correct:\n \n 1. Both bacteria and humans act together in societies, accomplishing things they cannot alone. Yet they are individually (ok, it takes two humans - chalk one up for the independence of bacteria) capable of surviving, thriving and reproducing.\n \n 2. In both cases, the virus kills the organism, not the society: it does not necessarily directly kill every cell (or even any cell) in the human body, but it disrupts the interdependent systems that keep it functional - just as it does to the systems within a bacterium.\n \n 3. In both cases, the virus can kill almost any amount of organisms without impeding the survival of the society. An argument could be made that a handful of surviving humans would be less likely to make it than a handful of surviving bacteria, but that only serves to demonstrate that bacteria are more ruggedly independent of society than humans, not less.\n \n \nHere's a generalization for you. <snip<\n\n \n Unfortunately, that's a philosophical statement, not anything that can be used to delimit or predict. Remember: I quite agree that organisms are on some levels teleological; what I remain to be convinced of is that there is even a need for everything about an organism on every level to operate teleologically in order to explain what we see around us.\n \n \nBut the parameters, that is, the broadest limits, of your cardio-vascular system is so encoded. What makes you think that the parameters of your genomic system is not?\n\n \n Oh, I don't doubt that to some extent it probably is; there are a number of studies showing, for example, that the accuracy of cell reproduction can be (via a chemical trigger) adversely affected by stress, leading to an increased mutation rate in circumstances to which the organism is (presumably, given the presence of stress) not terribly well suited. But again, that chemical triggering mechanism is encoded within the genes.\n \n Your hypothesis is that the limits are not encoded in the genes - that vitality can, without any existing genes telling it what to do, invent new and broader parameters by inventing new genes to define them.\n \n \nWhat makes you believe that if an improved and highly productive cardiovascular system became essential to your very survival, that your offspring would not epigenetically inherit an improved cardio-vascular system out of the genomic parameters available to it during development?\n\n \n The lack of any existing chemical pathways to induce such epigenetic inheritance in my offspring.\n \n \nWhat makes you think that this high-end epigenetically enhanced cardio-vascular system, if driven by necessity, would not eventually exceed those original genetic parameters?\n\n \n Because that's logically impossible; they couldn't have been the parameters if they can be exceeded.\n \n \nAnd that that would eventually force an expansion of those genetic parameters, and result in more permanent evolution?\n\n \n Here's this word again: 'force'. We're not talking about brute tension between molecules, here, like air pressure 'forcing' a balloon to expand. We're talking about a highly abstract concept somehow 'pushing' on a curled up molecule and making it change in a specific adaptive way. This seems, on merit, indistinguishable from the idea that the DNA is made to 'feel guilty' and that evolution proceeds by emotional blackmail. You're glossing over a really huge, huge gap in EAM theory by talking on the elevated abstract plane of notions like 'giving under pressure', relying on our human-level understanding of different conceptual 'kinds' of pressure to bridge the gulf. But it's inappropriate: figuring out a new improved genetic code to represent a desired expansion of epigenetic parameters has to make solving Rubik's Cube look like a stroll in the park, yet you want to talk about it as if it were as straightforward as gravitational attraction.\n \n \nAnd BTW, there are examples around of micro-evolution of organisms under novel envirommental stimuli. If such observed trait modification is observed, even though it may be within genetic parameters, if the expression is a direct response to a given stimulus, then it's still teleological EAM, and not accidental darwinian expression.\n\n \n Not at all - if the expression is a traceable mechanical response encoded by the genes, there's nothing teleological about it. You would have to prove that the mechanical response was put in the genes teleologically.\n \n \nAlright. Let's say then, that if we see a novel trait arise, or a meaningful difference in a normal, trait, that observably enhances any organism's ability to to survive, thrive, and reproduce, in comparison to its fellows, when to all intents and purposes it, its fellows, and its forebears had been surviving, thriving, and reproducing quite satisfactorily for generations in a particular and essentially established ecosystem, then we may say that a beneficial mutation arose by accident.\n\n \n I'm still not happy with 'quite satisfactorily', since that appears to leave equal wriggle-room to 'already adapted'. In the yeast example, adaptation occured after 180 stable, happily reproducing generations. A further adaptation occurred after another 220 stable, happily reproducing generations - yet the improvements in each case were substantial. Are you willing to accept that these could have been accidental?\n \n \nIf you still don't like this, suggest something else that will demonstrate that beneficial mutations can and do arise spontaneously, without regard for environmental stimulus.\n\n \n The Fluctuation Test is just such a demonstration. Results from both parts of the test aligned precisely with the predicted effects of a random mutation at a particular gene locus occuring during cell division prior to phage exposure. There is no equivalent EAM explanation for the differing results.\n \n \nWere the non-mutants starving? I don't know if they were highly stimulated or not. If they were, then they responded to the stimulus, and they had to work at developing a good response for some time before they succeeded.\n Call that an assumption, but it is no more an assumption than the assumption that the adaptive mutation was caused by a passing gamma ray.\n\n \n I'm pretty sure that's not the specific assumption made, but you have it there in a nutshell: whatever you look at you interpret according to your philosophy that all adaptive mutations must be intelligently directed. \n \n \nNo, it absolutely does not exclude any such thing. \n It doesn't, either.\n\n \n What reasoning or evidence do you have for these assertions? How can a stable colony structure develop and persist in a medium that is being constantly churned?\n \n \nWere these yeasts living in the same environment to which they and their forebears normally and naturally inhabited, or were the experimental conditions different from their normal natural environment? Somehow I suspect the latter to be the case.\n\n \n I have to give myself a small pat on the back here. This is precisely the evasion I predicted earlier: the 'stable' environment doesn't count because it wasn't the same as before the experiment started. However, by the time the bacteria were 180 generations in, the environment had been extraordinarily stable for quite some time, likewise after the next 220 generations.\n \n This is what I mean by EAM not being falsifiable. Once you assume directed evolution, and so long as you avoid making any clear predictions, you can make up any excuse you like.\n \n Putting the problem of finding a falsification test of EAM aside, I'd like to bring up the core issue that's been bugging me since we first discussed it a few posts ago:\n \n \nYou may say that two cloned cells are exactly alike, and for sake of argument I will agree. But is the stimulus and other environmental conditions involving those exact twins also exactly alike? If it/they is/are, then, all things being equal, the outcomes _must_ be identical. That is, either both identical cells 'have what it takes', and adapt, or neither does, and they don't.\n\n \n We've discussed how some organisms just 'have what it takes', that vitality is universal, and you've also said that cloned organisms ought to respond identically. So I'm prompted to ask: if vitality is universal, and clonal organisms ought to be expected to respond the same to the same stimulus, it follows that 'having what it takes' is something physical, genetic and pre-existing - in other words, a feature of the organism's genome that existed prior to the stimulus being applied. Without a causal reason for being there (the stimulus, as we have said, not yet having been applied), it can only be there by chance.\n \n Call that a 'lucky adaptive variant conferring a benefit in a new environment', or call it a 'lucky variant enabling successful response to a stimulus', either way a great many of your criticisms of Darwinian evolution must either evaporate or apply with equal weight to EAM: if an organism's differentially successful response to a stimulus (compared to its peers in the population) depends in any way upon its unique physical makeup prior to the stimulus, then that organism simply 'got lucky'. Nothing could have intentionally made that particular organism more ready for that stimulus than its peers, because that would imply the future occurrence and nature of the stimulus was known.\n \n Your thoughts?",

Our difficulty arise, I believe, because you seem, to me at least, to be suggesting that I say that Vitality, as a force operates, operates within, and is inherent to, atoms and molecules. Some pan-psychists take this position, but I do not. Now, I may be mistaken and perhaps that is not your interpretation of what claim for Vitality, but you'll have to tell me.\n \n My actual claim for Vitality is this. Matter can be ordered and systematised. This can be done without the aid of Vitality. Crystals, for instance, are ordered entities whose symetrical structures arise from their own intrinsic physical properties, in a purely mechanical fashion. What they are is determined by initial conditions. At a more basic level, I say that the same principle applies to atoms and molecules, intrinsically and inherently, as applies to crystals. These are 'non-operating' systems. Operating systems are usually mechanical, as well. For example, gravitational systems, such as solar systems and drainage systems, and geothermal systems, and machine systems and sewer systems and so forth. These are essentially closed systems. The four physical forces can completely account for them, their generation, maintainence, and eventual entropic ends as per the 2LoT. Such systems I leave to the mechanics, the chemists, the physicists, and the engineers.\n \n However to my mind their is a another order of system in the universe, the self-generating, self-maintaining, self-directing autopoietic information system that relies on information feedback and non-determined behaviours. \n I usually refer to such systems as autopoietic, although my take is somewhat different from the original--\n \n \"Autopoiesis literally means \"auto (self)-creation\" (from the Greek: auto - &#945;&#965;&#964;&#972; for self- and poiesis - &#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; for creation or production) and expresses a fundamental complementarity between structure and function. The term was originally introduced by Chilean biologists Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana in 1973:\" [ansers.com]\n \n The original 'autopoiesis' is strictly mechanist, and merely distinguishes between a system that produces and sustains itself, as opposed to an operating system that produces a 'product', such as a factory or a machine would do (called allopoiesis). I marry this mechanical 'autopoiesis' in the single cell, or in an organismic community of cells, to information theory. It is at this level that Vitality is introduced as an energy input into open, operating, living biosystems. At this stage Vitality operates within the system, but not within its molecular parts. However, it does operate, systematically, upon those molecular parts as a force acting upon them from outside of themselves, but within the system itself, while Vitality itself originates from beyond the physical system, and is what _informs_, {as in, \"To give form or character to; imbue with a quality or an essence, to be a pervasive presence in; animate: --answers.com}, organises, drives, and maintains it and its synergy, as a 'whole system', against the physical entropy inherent in its material, chemical, molecular parts. Vitality is the positive organising force, 'negentropy' or 'syntropy', that counters the natural tendency of all mechanical/physical systems (entropy) to become incoherent, too succumb to disorder, and to become stagnant and static and uniform.\n \n \"Syntropy is a term popularized by Buckminster Fuller but also developed by others to refer to an \"anti-entropy\" or \"negentropy\". The following definition, referencing Fuller, can be found on a web site on \"Whole Systems\": \"A tendency towards order and symmetrical combinations, designs of ever more advantageous and orderly patterns. Evolutionary cooperation. Anti-entropy.\"[1] Fuller's use dates to 1956. Also, see Fuller's Synergetics, chapter on \"Radiation and Gravity,\" \"Local Conservation and Cosmic Regeneration\", sections 541.16 through 541.18 [2].\" [answers.com]\n \n It is my opinion that the organization, dynamism, synergy, and informed, selective behaviours of living autopoietic biosystems depend upon the 'syntropy' afforded those systems by the natural force, Vitality.\n \n Now, if you understood me to mean this all along, then I apologise for misunderstanding you.\n \n Break time. More later. This is fun. :) Not like with electrolyte, but you might take a peek at my post to him my with my link to Brig Klyce on the nature of 'logical', as opposed to 'thermodynamic', [i.e., mechanical], entropy.",

   "\n Quote:\n Thus, if inertia and gravity can create and sustain solar systems, then Vitality can create and sustain biosystems, and be no less natural for it. \n \n \n There is a very important distinction to be made here: gravity et al create solar systems unintentionally. Gravity is a property of what is already there: matter, and fusion etc is the emergent result. With vitality, we are talking about a force that acts to bring about a specific conceptual result:\n\n \n **\n I don't know where you got the impression that Vitality specifies \"a specific conceptual result\"? Vitality takes material, mechanical systems, like solar systems, and informs them so that they become informationally sensitive systems. Such systems process data in order to create meaning (information), but no particular conceptual result is ever predetermined by that process. That's what causes differences of opinion, like ours.\n \n And who says gravity is a property of what is already there, apart from materialists who insist, metaphysically, that everything begins with 'bits of stuff'? As a dynamist, I believe that forces preceed matter. That 'matter' is an epiphenomenon of interacting forces. Because I believe, metaphysically, that everything, including matter, begins with forces and their fields. That forces are the source of all energy, and that 'matter' is just one form of that energy. Whatever it is that 'energy' really is. Whatever 'forces' really are.\n \n \n\n it supposedly brings about that which could be said to possess its properties - equivalent to gravity bringing about the first mass.\n\n \n \n **\n Yep.\n \n \n\n Comparisons with other natural forces are not valid.\n\n \n **\n I say they are. And I say Vitality has a field just like the other forces. And that it preceeds its effects. Just like gravity preceeds mass, and magnetism preceeds magnets.\n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n I don't say that Vitality, given certain requisite conditions, could never accomplish such a task. I do know that in the world as it is, those conditions cannot arise naturally. Why not? Because Vitality does not operate magically, via instantaneous 'poofs' of special creation or spontaneous generation. \n \n \n But every claim you make describes just such a magical 'poof' - just a very small one. What I'm trying to extract from EAM is a reason for their small scale.[quote]\n \n **\n You've lost me here. What's small about going from dinosaur to bird, or from 'stuff' to life?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You've got it wrong. I am infering from empirical observation of behaviours, and the difference in behaviours between simple bits of stuff, and even simple mechanical systems, as contrasted with autopoietic living biosystems, \n that the four accepted 'physical' forces are necessary, but insufficient, to account for those differences. \n \n \n But what justification do you have for making that inference? If you looked and saw a dead brick and a live brick, you would have a case for suspecting an additional force involved in animating one lump of clay rather than another.\n\n \n **\n If I ever saw a live brick, either it wouldn't be a brick, or I wouldn't be myself.\n You cannot animate bricks. Not even vitality can do that. Why? Because you do not have the right material components for that sort of system. Just like you cannot build skyscrapers out of icecream.\n \n \n\n But a living creature is physically distinguishable from a dead one, never mind from inanimate clay. There remains the possibility that the only difference you are actually seeing between life and non-life is its configuration \n\n \n **\n Actually, that is my point, exactly. Because, you see, 'configuration', 'organization', 'systematization', 'design', etc. are all abstractions that can be expressed concretely, but are not concrete [material, substantial, corporeal], themselves.\n \n [quote]\n - that you are simply wrong to believe that words like teleological and autopoietic can't apply to appropriately configured matter.\n\n \n **\n Oooops, lost me again. What do you mean by \"configured matter\"?\n \n \n\n Like I pointed out earlier, the universe isn't going to change the way it works out of respect for a dictionary definition.\n\n \n **\n Nor will it for a self-serving semantic distortion made up to support an 'a priori' metaphysical postulate.\n \n [quite]\n Quote:\n Pointing out the observations that led to the hypothesis is is not \"assuming the conclusions of your own hypothesis\", but demonstrating where the hypothesis came from. \n \n Quote:\n Of course I'm not doing any such thing. Whyever would I. What is, is, and I've never said otherwise, since such a thing would be insane. How odd of you to make such an accusation!?! \n \n \n As I said, your assumption is that appropriately configured matter, together with the existing physical forces, can't behave the way we see living creatures behave.\n\n \n **\n I still don't know what you mean by 'appropriately configured matter'. Rodin's \"Thinker\" is \"appropriately configured matter\", so far as I can tell, but neither the four physical forces, nor the force of Vitality itself, is ever going to get that statue to get up off its duff and get to work!! ;)\n \n \n\n However, when you compare the living and the dead and the fundamentally inanimate you see physical differences. If you saw no physical differences then you would be justified in hypothesising a qualitative difference that we cannot or have not directly observed - but until then the possibility remains that the differences are, quite straightforwardly, the ones we can see.\n\n \n **\n True. Hearts stop beating, electrical activity ceases and so on. But you see, that raise the question of why there was a beating heart and electrical activity in the brain, but now there isn't. Simply pointing out that hearts beat and synapses fire doesn't explain why they do that when you're alive, but not when you're dead.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I don't know if they can. 'Mind over matter' is still an open question, and so far the evidence is positive \n \n \n We're not talking about mind over matter, though; we're talking about vitality over matter. They clearly can't be the same thing because my mind is entirely ignorant of the supposed power I wield over my genetic code. \n\n \n \n **\n You're confusing vitality with your mind, which it is not, and your mind with your consciousness, which it is not. Your consciousness, including your self-consciousness, is only a part of your mind. Your mind also maintains what we call an 'unconscious' awareness, like all live organisms do, and although you are not conscious of it, it is aware of everything going on in body, including your genetic code. Mind does not reside solely in the brain as some materialists (and others!!) maintain, but in every living cell in your body. And in every living cell in a blade of grass, come to that.\n \n \"mind--The collective conscious and unconscious processes in a sentient organism that direct and influence mental and physical behavior.\" [answers.com]\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n In terms of the genomic, conservation of form over generations', system, it is an information system by which related molecules act as symbols for meanings. If your mind can rewrite a sentence here in this thread, why can't your organism, or any organism, rewrite the info in its genomic code? \n \n \n Turn that question around: why, then, can't organisms - any organism - read? Why can only those with large physical brains perform such a feat? You cannot take abilities that demonstrably require certain physical characteristics and use them to justify the alleged capabilities of a metaphysical force in organisms without those characteristics.\n\n \n **\n Most organisms do not have psychical abilities of human beings. Even human beings do not have the psychical abilities of other human beings. I think that probably it's safe to say that an amoeba does not have the psychical qualities of an antelope. That is because although Vitality, the source of all psychical phenomena is universal, like gravity, the physical biosystems that engage Vitality are different. Therefore the local expressions of Vitality's effects vary. A gnat is not a Newton, any more than the moon is a Black Hole.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Since I don't know what you mean, in empirical terms, when you say, \"we really ought to observe coincidentally chronic stimulus down one lineage inducing EAM's radical, sweeping genetic changes\", I can't comment. Perhaps if you gave a concrete example I might grasp your meaning. \n \n \n How can I give you a concrete example of what we don't observe? The questions is, why don't we see wild genetic aberrations - huge sweeping changes to a single individual -\n\n \n **\n Well, I can't guess what you are trying to put across if you can't express it more graphically, or at least change your wording.\n \n First of all, \"wild genetic aberrations\" do not take place in an individual's lifetime, unless, perhaps, if he is heavily irradiated.\n \n But if you mean a genotype is altered between parent and offspring, chromsomal mutations do happen. By accident. Entropically and destructively.\n Because the responsive system that was supposed to prevent that, failed. Take the thalidomide disaster, for example.\n \n So we do see them, although our bodies do everything they can to prevent them. They are not impossible, and when they are accidental, they are not pretty. But logically, if an organism can prevent them from happening, it must also possess the ability to make them happen, IF NEEDS BE.\n \n \n \n\n as a result of coincidentally chronic stimulus occurring down one of the hundreds of lineages leading to that organism?\n\n \n **\n Sorry, but I have no clue what this means. What does coincidence have to do with anything?\n \n And since when does an organism have any more than two 'lineages', (supposing its a sexual being), that is, its paternal lineage and its maternal lineage. \n \n Apart from sexually stimulated behaviour arising from sexual selection processes, (such as lions fighting for a pride of lionesses), I can't think what you are talking about. But why in the world that would stimulate, \"wild genetic aberrations - huge sweeping changes to a single individual\", I cannot begin to guess.emoticon_confused",

   "\n Quote:\n Perhaps, but not a complete organism. \n \n \n We're playing with definitions here. \n\n \n **\n Of course we are. You cannot discuss ideas without discussing the meanings of the words used to communicate those ideas. Without shared semantics we go nowhere.\n \n As to this point in our discussion of life and lifeforms, we bring up theidea of organismic development. For me an understanding of development is crucial to an understanding of life. as a darwinist, you would like to go straight from random genetic mutation to 'natural selection' and bypass development altogether. And that is a key point of disagreement between us. Even leaving the concept of Vitality aside, development as the seat of evolution, and not selection, would still essentially divide us.\n \n \n\n If a society can accomplish more than an individual, that says something about society, not whether that individual counts as an organism or not.\n\n \n **\n So what does, and when does, an individual anything/something become an actual organism? When is an organism not really an organism? I say that you do not have an organism as such until you have a self-directed, self-organised, self-determined entity with a sense of individual and/or collective identity. That is, when it is aware, at least unconsciously, of the distinction between 'self' and 'other'.\n \n This is an important question. It arise again and again in the abortion debate, for instance, and in the 'cloning' debate, and in the bio-engineering debate.\n For instance, is a zygote an organism, i.e., a human being? If not, at what stage of development does an embryonic lifeform become a true organism, in this case, a true human being? I don't want to start any fresh debates on any of the above issues, but I hope you see my point, and the point of the criteria and limitations I place on the concept of 'complete and fully realized organism'.\n \n \n\n Unless you're prepared to go the whole hog and say that the entire biosphere is the 'one true organism' you have no justification for selectively adjusting the meaning of the word to skirt around awkward bacterial test results.\n\n \n **\n I'm not, as you accuse, \"selectively adjusting the meaning of the word to skirt around awkward bacterial test results\". I'm saying that those tests were flawed because they were based upon an entirely false understanding of the microbiological world, because that understanding made absolutely no provision for developmental biology in eucaryotic bacteris, but simply assumed the darwinian position that leaps from inherited variation/accidental genetic mutation straight to environmental culling of some genotypic variations, pretty much ignoring the phenotype and it development altogether.\n \n As for your point re \"the whole biosphere\", that is actually the interpretation of reality that I favour. That is, that there is really onlyb \"one life\" on this planet, but it expresses itself in a multiplicity of forms, and we have to be very careful about our taxonomy of those forms, right down to identifying one individual as differed from another. As you know, (or perhaps hadn't noticed yet?), I'm a big fan of, \"Oneness\". :)\n \n Which is why I'm so pro theories that stress co-operation, sharing, and synergy, and so anti theories that stress division, elitism, egoism, and competition. Such as RMNS darwinism.\n \n But with particular reference to LD'43 and bacteria, take a look at this--\n \n \"Connections\n Biology's next revolution\n Nigel Goldenfeld1 and Carl Woese2\n \n Nigel Goldenfeld is in the Department of Physics and Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1110 West Green Street, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA.\n Carl Woese is in the Department of Microbiology and Institute for Genomic Biology, 601 South Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA.\n \n Top of pageAbstractThe emerging picture of microbes as gene-swapping collectives demands a revision of such concepts as organism, species and evolution itself.\n \n One of the most fundamental patterns of scientific discovery is the revolution in thought that accompanies a new body of data. Satellite-based astronomy has, during the past decade, overthrown our most cherished ideas of cosmology, especially those relating to the size, dynamics and composition of the Universe.\n \n \n KAPUSTA\n Similarly, the convergence of fresh theoretical ideas in evolution and the coming avalanche of genomic data will profoundly alter our understanding of the biosphere - and is likely to lead to revision of concepts such as species, organism and evolution. Here we explain why we foresee such a dramatic transformation, and why we believe the molecular reductionism that dominated twentieth-century biology will be superseded by an interdisciplinary approach that embraces collective phenomena.\n \n The place to start is horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the non-genealogical transfer of genetic material from one organism to another - such as from one bacterium to another or from viruses to bacteria. Among microbes, HGT is pervasive and powerful - for example, in accelerating the spread of antibiotic resistance. Owing to HGT, it is not a good approximation to regard microbes as organisms dominated by individual characteristics. In fact, their communications by genetic or quorum-sensing channels indicate that microbial behaviour must be understood as predominantly cooperative.\n \n In the wild, microbes form communities, invade biochemical niches and partake in biogeochemical cycles. The available studies strongly indicate that microbes absorb and discard genes as needed, in response to their environment. Rather than discrete genomes, we see a continuum of genomic possibilities, which casts doubt on the validity of the concept of a 'species' when extended into the microbial realm. The uselessness of the species concept is inherent in the recent forays into metagenomics - the study of genomes recovered from natural samples as opposed to clonal cultures. For example, studies of the spatial distribution of rhodopsin genes in marine microbes suggest such genes are 'cosmopolitan', wandering among bacteria (or archaea) as environmental pressures dictate.\n \n Equally exciting is the realization that viruses have a fundamental role in the biosphere, in both immediate and long-term evolutionary senses. Recent work suggests that viruses are an important repository and memory of a community's genetic information, contributing to the system's evolutionary dynamics and stability. This is hinted at, for example, by prophage induction, in which viruses latent in cells can become activated by environmental influences. The ensuing destruction of the cell and viral replication is a potent mechanism for the dispersal of host and viral genes.\n \n It is becoming clear that microorganisms have a remarkable ability to reconstruct their genomes in the face of dire environmental stresses, and that in some cases their collective interactions with viruses may be crucial to this. In such a situation, how valid is the very concept of an organism in isolation? It seems that there is a continuity of energy flux and informational transfer from the genome up through cells, community, virosphere and environment. We would go so far as to suggest that a defining characteristic of life is the strong dependency on flux from the environment - be it of energy, chemicals, metabolites or genes.\n \n Nowhere are the implications of collective phenomena, mediated by HGT, so pervasive and important as in evolution. A computer scientist might term the cell's translational apparatus (used to convert genetic information to proteins) an 'operating system', by which all innovation is communicated and realized. The fundamental role of translation, represented in particular by the genetic code, is shown by the clearly documented optimization of the code. Its special role in any form of life leads to the striking prediction that early life evolved in a lamarckian way, with vertical descent marginalized by the more powerful early forms of HGT.\n \n Refinement through the horizontal sharing of genetic innovations would have triggered an explosion of genetic novelty, until the level of complexity required a transition to the current era of vertical evolution. Thus, we regard as regrettable the conventional concatenation of Darwin's name with evolution, because other modalities must also be considered.\n \n This is an extraordinary time for biology, because the perspective we have indicated places biology within a context that must necessarily engage other disciplines more strongly aware of the importance of collective phenomena. Questions suggested by the generic energy, information and gene flows to which we have alluded will probably require resolution in the spirit of statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. In time, the current approach of post-hoc modelling will be replaced by interplay between quantitative prediction and experimental test, nowadays more characteristic of the physical sciences.\n \n Sometimes, language expresses ignorance rather than knowledge, as in the case of the word 'prokaryote', now superseded by the terms archaea and bacteria. We foresee that in biology, new concepts will require a new language, grounded in mathematics and the discoveries emerging from the data we have highlighted. During an earlier revolution, Antoine Lavoisier observed that scientific progress, like evolution, must overcome a challenge of communication: \"We cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it.\" Biology is about to meet this challenge.\n \n Further reading\n \n Frigaard, N., Martinez, A., Mincer, T. & DeLong, E.

But not because I failed to understand the tests and their results, as you believe. I failed to appreciate their significance, or rather, was able and and am still able, to appreciate their insignificance, because, unlike yourself and other darwinists, I had, and still have, a much better understanding of them and their inherently flawed inferences than you do.\n That is, unless the above article has finally caused the light to dawn for you, which I doubt.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Absolutely not!! We are discussing autopoietic systems, and that's what eusocial bacteria colonies are. I'm not about to discuss chickens and limit tests to what can be done with eggs!! \n \n \n Nobody's asking you to. Organised bacterial/yeast structures cannot persist in a medium experiencing constant and vigorous physical agitation (the yeast research)\n\n \n **\n So what? They still inter-communicate, so they still constitute one entity even though no specific individual parts are in any static spatial relation to\n any other specific individual parts, and since we are not talking specialized function divided among different parts, as in the organs of eukaryotes, that simply doesn't matter. The one and only fact out of your yeast experiment was that a genetic mutation arose twice in a population that was kept in a state of perpetual internal flux. Not the normal life-style experienced by yeasts. Perpetual internal flux in and of itself can be seen as a stimulus [stress inducement] toward an adaptive response. Whether or not the increase in the relative number of cells carrying that mutation, compared to the number that did not mutate, was caused by 'selection', (which reduces to, \"failure to adapt to the environment as well as your competitors\"), or was caused by EAM, (which signifies \"improved adaptation to the environment shared with others\") is simply one assumption opposed to another. IAC, the assumption that the genetic mutation was not adaptive is untenable, since 'differential fitness', as you guys call it, was a result of it, and so there must have been some stimulus toward adaptation before it occurred. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.\n \n \n\n and in the fluctuation test, the significant result is the markedly different pattern of survival between the samples taken in the first and second parts of the experiment, despite all colonies being the same size.\n\n \n **\n As I've pointed out a hundred times, \"the markedly different pattern of survival\" is an observed effect, and like the fact of evolution, has no more signifance than the fact that it is a fact. What would be truly significant would be an empirically testable causal explanation for the fact of that observed effect. And that is where you darwinists retreat into metaphysical speculation, instead of science. You make inferences that depend on A/. appearances, and B/ your a priori assumptions re causation/genesis. In a word, you assume that if a numerical result looks like it occurred randomly, then it did in fact occur randomly. If it occurred randomly, then it occurred, (was generated), spontaneously, without non-coincidental reference to past or future. If we do not allow for developmental processes between the first artificially non-resistant 'seeds' of embryonic colonies, and the fully developed colonies ( I think what's name, Ben Eschel[?], gives a quantitative measurement for this in one of the links I supplied), then we must assume spontaneous generation. But of course, though L&D might have assumed this in '43, no modern microbiologist would do so. And finally, in ignorance of what we know of eusocial bacteria, as in the above link and the others I gave you, we would have to assume, as L&D did, rightly or wrongly, that the mutation occurred prior to phage exposure. The point is, that knowing bacterial abilities, and not knowing for a certainty that no bacteria on any plate were not able to survive long enough to reproduce, we cannot even say that much for a certainty. Although the 'timing' is not nearly so significant as they assumed, since directed Lamarckian evolution does not have to re-invent the wheel with every generation's novel and immediate experience of a certain stimulus. That is, the 'when' of the mutation is not nearly as significant as the 'how' and the 'why' of it. If the mutation, was novel(i.e., spontaneous), and not retrogressive(developmentally directed back to the bacteria's normal state of diffused colonial resistance to the historically encountered phage), you would never know from just looking at the final 'statistical pattern'. You people just assume spontaneous generation on the basis of a metaphysical presumption, and in science, that's a no-no. But I've told you people this a hundred times and you've always ignored me, so I don't expect any greater success this time.\n \n Ho-hum. Time for a break.",

   "\n Quote:\n False analogy. \n \n Only according to your arbitrarily - and incorrectly - shifted goalposts.\n\n \n **\n Well, from where I'm standing, I'd have to say that you, \"arbitrarily - and incorrectly\", put the goalposts on the fifty-yard line. \n \n \n\n Here's why the analogy is correct:\n \n 1. Both bacteria and humans act together in societies, accomplishing things they cannot alone. Yet they are individually (ok, it takes two humans - chalk one up for the independence of bacteria) capable of surviving, thriving and reproducing.\n\n \n **\n So what? This is irrelevent to my point about bacteria. Bacteria colonies interact with each other, too, and individual human cells are not organisms by your definition, are they, even though they too can exercise a certain amount of autonomous behaviour.\n \n \n\n 2. In both cases, the virus kills the organism, not the society: it does not necessarily directly kill every cell (or even any cell) in the human body, but it disrupts the interdependent systems that keep it functional - just as it does to the systems within a bacterium.\n\n \n **\n Actually, although bacteria attack organic systems one cell at a time, they do not 'kill' any organism until they have killed a sufficient number of individual cells to \"disrupt[] the interdependent systems that keep [the whole organism] functional\". And that applies equally and in the exact same fashion to both eukaryotes and eusocial organisms such as bacteria. That is why both eukaryotes and eusocial bacteria colonies have developed systematic immune responses to viruses.\n \n \n\n 3. In both cases, the virus can kill almost any amount of organisms without impeding the survival of the society.\n\n \n **\n Or, \"the virus can kill almost any amount of [cells] without impeding the survival of the [organism]\". So? Put this way it applies both to eukaryotes and eusocial collectives. Your distinction between the two is forced and arbitrary, therefore false.\n \n \n\n An argument could be made that a handful of surviving humans would be less likely to make it than a handful of surviving bacteria, but that only serves to demonstrate that bacteria are more ruggedly independent of society than humans, not less.\n\n \n **\n Or the argument could be made that bacteria colonies can suffer a great deal more cellular damage and system disruption and still recuperate and survive, simply because their systems are much less complex and much more generalized than the specialized \"interdependent systems\" of eukaryotic organisms. But that only serves to demonstrate that bacteria colonies are more ruggedly resistant to viral attack than are eukaryotic organisms, or that eukaryotic assemblages of synergistic cells are more susceptible to viral attacks than are eusocial assemblages of synergistic cells.\n \n \n\n Remember: I quite agree that organisms are on some levels teleological; what I remain to be convinced of is that there is even a need for everything about an organism on every level to operate teleologically in order to explain what we see around us.\n\n \n **\n Can you think of anything about any _kind_ of organism, eusocial or eukaryotic, that does not exist to some purpose, that is, is not in any way teleological? Note that anomalies applying simply to individuals do not signify.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n But the parameters, that is, the broadest limits, of your cardio-vascular system is so encoded. What makes you think that the parameters of your genomic system is not? \n \n \n Oh, I don't doubt that to some extent it probably is; there are a number of studies showing, for example, that the accuracy of cell reproduction can be (via a chemical trigger) adversely affected by stress, leading to an increased mutation rate in circumstances to which the organism is (presumably, given the presence of stress) not terribly well suited. But again, that chemical triggering mechanism is encoded within the genes.\n\n \n **\n Yes, but the issue in evolution is not the effect, (i.e., that something is encoded genetically), but the cause, (that is, how and why it was encoded genetically in the first place). You say pure chance, spontaneous generation, a spot of good luck. I say inherent teleology. Teleology can be scientifically tested. Serendipitous chance accident cannot. And that is the difference between science and pseudo-science.\n \n \n\n Your hypothesis is that the limits are not encoded in the genes - that vitality can, without any existing genes telling it what to do, invent new and broader parameters by inventing new genes to define them.\n\n \n **\n Not exactly. My hypothesis is that evolution is possible because the limits encoded in the genes are not fixed and permanent, but are open to revision by the organism itself, if and when it finds revision of its genetic limits to be within its own best interests. Whereas your hypothesis is that evolution is possible because the limits encoded in the genes are fixed and permanent, they are often damaged and destroyed and distorted by entropic accidents, so enabling novel looks to arise, some of which are not automatically fatal. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n What makes you believe that if an improved and highly productive cardiovascular system became essential to your very survival, that your offspring would not epigenetically inherit an improved cardio-vascular system out of the genomic parameters available to it during development? \n \n \n The lack of any existing chemical pathways to induce such epigenetic inheritance in my offspring.\n\n \n **\n Hmm. Who says there are none? Not modern science, since epigenetic inheritance is a proven fact. Not knowing of the \"chemical pathways\" to that fact would be an 'argumentum ad ignorantium' (sp.?), except that I'm not sure but that some of that chemistry has been noted.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n What makes you think that this high-end epigenetically enhanced cardio-vascular system, if driven by necessity, would not eventually exceed those original genetic parameters? \n \n \n Because that's logically impossible; they couldn't have been the parameters if they can be exceeded.\n\n \n **\n As I said above, only you genetic darwinists think that genetic parameters are inflexible and immutable, except by damaging entropic accident. But that belief is metaphysically founded, not scientifically demonstrated.\n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n And that that would eventually force an expansion of those genetic parameters, and result in more permanent evolution? \n \n \n\n Here's this word again: 'force'. We're not talking about brute tension between molecules, here, like air pressure 'forcing' a balloon to expand. We're talking about a highly abstract concept somehow 'pushing' on a curled up molecule and making it change in a specific adaptive way. This seems, on merit, indistinguishable from the idea that the DNA is made to 'feel guilty' and that evolution proceeds by emotional blackmail. You're glossing over a really huge, huge gap in EAM theory by talking on the elevated abstract plane of notions like 'giving under pressure', relying on our human-level understanding of different conceptual 'kinds' of pressure to bridge the gulf. But it's inappropriate: figuring out a new improved genetic code to represent a desired expansion of epigenetic parameters has to make solving Rubik's Cube look like a stroll in the park, yet you want to talk about it as if it were as straightforward as gravitational attraction.\n\n \n **\n Basically what you are saying is that 'mind' has no power over 'matter'. That the word 'force' only applies to that which moves bits of stuff, and that although the forces of gravity, electro-magnetism, and the nuclear forces can do that to bits of stuff, there is no other force with that ability. I say that all of those assumptions are metaphysical, i.e., materialist/mechanist. And that they fly in the face of what we can and do observe, empirically, scientifically, as it happens in actual biological systems. Your materialism will never explain why the mere, unsought-for, passing thought of something can cause us to break out in a sweat, or shed tears, or smile.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n And BTW, there are examples around of micro-evolution of organisms under novel envirommental stimuli. If such observed trait modification is observed, even though it may be within genetic parameters, if the expression is a direct response to a given stimulus, then it's still teleological EAM, and not accidental darwinian expression. With purposeful, productive activity, teleology is always a given, prima facie.\n \n \n Not at all - if the expression is a traceable mechanical response encoded by the genes, there's nothing teleological about it. You would have to prove that the mechanical response was put in the genes teleologically.\n\n \n **\n anything that serves a purpose is end-directed, i.e., teleological, by definition. The onus is on you to show that such a purposeful behaviour arose bt serendipitous accident, rather than by teleological direction.\n \n \"Teleology traditionally is contrasted with philosophical naturalism, which views nature as lacking design or purpose. For example, naturalism would say that a person has sight simply because they have eyes. In other words, function follows form (eyesight follows from having eyes). Teleology is the reverse of this position: a person has eyes because they have the need of eyesight. In this case, form follows function (eyes follow from having the need for eyesight).\n \n Two classic examples of these opposing views are found in Aristotle and Lucretius, the former as a supporter of teleology and the latter as a supporter of what is now called philosophical naturalism:\n \n Nature adapts the organ to the function, and not the function to the organ\n \n -Aristotle, De Partibus Animalium (On the Parts of Animals)[1]\n \n Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use.\n \n -Lucretius, De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things)[2]\n \n \n Extrinsic and intrinsic finality\n Teleology depends on the concept of a final cause or purpose inherent in all beings. There are two types of such causes, intrinsic finality and extrinsic finality.\n \n Extrinsic finality consists of a being realizing a purpose outside said being, for the utility and welfare of other beings. For instance, minerals are \"designed\" to be used by plants which are in turn \"designed\" to be used by animals.\n \n \n Intrinsic finality consists of a being realizing a purpose by means of a natural tendency directed toward the perfection of its own nature. In essence, it is what is \"good for\" a being. For example, physical masses obey universal gravitational tendencies that did not evolve, but are simply a cosmic \"given.\" Similarly, life is intended to behave in certain ways so as to preserve itself from death, disease, and pain. \" [answers.com]\n \n Needless to say EAM explicitly rejects \"extrinsic causality\" in organisms, as opposed to artefacts like computers, and beliefs like creationism, but explicitly and implicity embraces \"intrinsic causality\" in terms of biological operations and evolution.\n \n We, you and I, are merely continuing the argument between the followers of Aristotle (me), and the followers of Lucretius (you).\n \n Break time.",

   "\n Quote:\n Alright. Let's say then, that if we see a novel trait arise, or a meaningful difference in a normal, trait, that observably enhances any organism's ability to to survive, thrive, and reproduce, in comparison to its fellows, when to all intents and purposes it, its fellows, and its forebears had been surviving, thriving, and reproducing quite satisfactorily for generations in a particular and essentially established ecosystem, then we may say that a beneficial mutation arose by accident. \n \n \n I'm still not happy with 'quite satisfactorily', since that appears to leave equal wriggle-room to 'already adapted'. In the yeast example, adaptation occured after 180 stable, happily reproducing generations. A further adaptation occurred after another 220 stable, happily reproducing generations - yet the improvements in each case were substantial. Are you willing to accept that these could have been accidental?\n\n \n **\n Well, considering that their environment was far from normal and completely unnatural, I canb't help but suppose that, as I said earlier, that they must have found it stressful, and therefore stimulating. And secondly, given the fact of the rapid spread of mutated cells throughout the population, or from the other angle, the rapid decrease in non-mutated cells, there must have been some substantive cause at work. You might get away with attributing a cause for the mutation to a simple, anomalous, accident, but you can't dismiss your own 'natural selection' that way. And once you admit a cause driving the environmental 'selection' effect, you're right back to considering that same cause as an environmental 'stimulus' , teleological cause for the genetic mutation. Just like LD'43 and RMNS in general, the only empirical fact you've got is the fact of change. Your explanation for that change is purely hypothetical and untestable.\n \n OTH, EAM says that if you can identify the reason that the genetic mutation was so beneficial to the yeast cells that had it, then you should be able to identify the cause of its original appearance in the population, as linked specificallyits subsequent comparitive statistical expansion, without just assuming a fortuitous coincidence.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n If you still don't like this, suggest something else that will demonstrate that beneficial mutations can and do arise spontaneously, without regard for environmental stimulus. \n \n \n The Fluctuation Test is just such a demonstration. Results from both parts of the test aligned precisely with the predicted effects of a random mutation at a particular gene locus occuring during cell division prior to phage exposure. There is no equivalent EAM explanation for the differing results.\n\n \n **\n Yes there is, I've pointed out again and again. Most recently in my last post.\n The only reason you guys say that those results must be random generated is because they do not look as they would look if they were generated mechanically. And since you guys deny intelligent, teleological generation, a priori, as per your philosophy, the fact that a teleologically generated dispersal would look more like a randomly generated dispersal than a mechanically generated dispersal simply isn't allowed to intrude into your consciousness. The fact is, even arithmetically, statistically, let alone empirically, you have no way to discriminate between accidental, spontaneous generation of that effect, and intelligent, teleological generation of that exact same outcome. You simply make an unwarranted assumption that effect, based on the possibility that that outcome might have been spontaneous and accidental, instead of the other possibility that you refuse, philosophically, to even consider-inherent teleology. But the fact of the specificity of the mutation to the phage puts the teleological explanation way out in front of 'accidentally fortuitous' assumption. In fact, your assumption is entirely untenable in the face of what we _now_ know of eusocial bacteria colonies, revertant mutations, and on and on.\n \n Even Delbruck said that the only real conclusion that could be drawn was that the mutation occurred, temporally speaking, some time between the first cells bred for non-resistant seed cultures, and the cultures eventually plated to the phage. Even he was too much of a scientist to leap to the conclusion that that specific mutation was an accident that just happened by spontaneous generation. And as I have shown, even if the mutation did take place at the time claimed, that still does not mean that it did not occur teleologically, as per EAM, AND, knowing what we now know, even the timing assumed from the final outcome is no longer a given, not that that matters much to the debate. But as I've seen again and again, you won't allow the logic of all this to dent your faith in what you 'think' LD'43 demonstrates.\n \n Sigh. Break time.",

   "\n Quote:\n Were the non-mutants starving? I don't know if they were highly stimulated or not. If they were, then they responded to the stimulus, and they had to work at developing a good response for some time before they succeeded.\n Call that an assumption, but it is no more an assumption than the assumption that the adaptive mutation was caused by a passing gamma ray. \n \n \n I'm pretty sure that's not the specific assumption made, but you have it there in a nutshell: whatever you look at you interpret according to your philosophy that all adaptive mutations must be intelligently directed. \n\n \n **\n Just as you interpret the same things in the light of your philosophy, and conclude that all adaptive mutations must be lucky accidents.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No, it absolutely does not exclude any such thing. \n It doesn't, either. \n \n \n What reasoning or evidence do you have for these assertions? How can a stable colony structure develop and persist in a medium that is being constantly churned?\n\n \n **\n A \"stable colony structure\", whatever that is, need not be any impediment to internal communication. We aren't talking about a frog in a blender here, after all. What scientific basis is there for your objection?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Were these yeasts living in the same environment to which they and their forebears normally and naturally inhabited, or were the experimental conditions different from their normal natural environment? Somehow I suspect the latter to be the case. \n \n \n I have to give myself a small pat on the back here. This is precisely the evasion I predicted earlier: the 'stable' environment doesn't count because it wasn't the same as before the experiment started. However, by the time the bacteria were 180 generations in, the environment had been extraordinarily stable for quite some time, likewise after the next 220 generations.\n\n \n **\n You want it both ways. The cells were perfectly adapted, so they didn't change for however many generations, but then the mutated cells survived and the unmutated cells didn't, so the mutated cells were somehow more than perfectly adapted, super adapted, in fact! And that lasted until another mutation that did the same trick of multiplying until its predecessors were gone, so it must be super duper adapted, and on and on. As I keep pointing out--if you claim a genetic mutation bestows an adaptive 'fitness' advantage, (and you do!), then you have to posit a prior fitness disadvantage, or maladaptedness, (which you deny!). That is simply irrational, but you do it twice for one experiment!!\n \n \n\n This is what I mean by EAM not being falsifiable. Once you assume directed evolution, and so long as you avoid making any clear predictions, you can make up any excuse you like.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!?! This is your experiment and your claim, and just because it fails to validate your claim, once again proving your claim unfalsifiable and unverifiable, suddenly you can make a great leap of logic and claim that it proves EAM unfalsifiable?!? Amazing! This kind of irrationality just makes my head spin!!\n \n Look. You asked what would falsify EAM, and mistakenly tried to tell you. So you found another RMNS experiment, one which you and the experimenters say demonstrates the spontaneous generation of an adaptive mutation in a pre-adapted and stable environment. I've shown you where and how none of that was true, and the assumptions of spontaneous yet adaptive mutation were built on pure moondust. \n But you feel that that allows you to say that that experiment, by people who never heard of EAM, proves EAM unfalsifiable, simply because, although it did not conform to my specifications for a test to invalidate EAM, you suppose that it did!!?!! Even after I show you exactly where and why it fails to conform to my specs? That is, that it was an abnormal environment, and so therefore stressful and so therefore stimulating, and so, since the mutated cells did so much better, it had to be because they were better adapted to that environment than their predecessors (who were adapted to normal yeast environments). Yet you still insist that they must have been perfectly adapted, simply because it took many generations to accomplish an adaptive change, instead of the instantaneous 'poof' of adaptation that you demand from EAM. \n \n Look. I should never have made the mistake of letting you demand that I show you a way to invalidate EAM, 'out of the blue'. That is not how science works.You cannot scientifically attempt to invalidate a hypothesis unless it has first been first called valid, its validity based upon rational inferences drwn from empirical observations. That is, an hypothesis must at least appear to be validated, based upon certain supporting empirical observations, before you can challenge it by negating and denying the factors given as its support. You can attack the rationality of the inference, or you can throw doubt on the truth of the empirical observations, or you can do both. But you cannot do anything if there are no empirical observations and rational inferences supporting that 'hypothesis' in the first place. Why? because without them it is not a scientific hypothesis, but only a metaphysical supposition.\n \n If I simply assert that unicorns live in the public gardens, but they camouflage perfectly with their surroundings, so you can't see them, then you cannot possibly invalidate that assertion because I have presented no supporting evidence for it. But that doesn't make it true, either. It is simply a metaphysical assertion. Like angels, fairies, and space aliens among us. Also like accidental but coincidentally adaptive mutation, and a force for change called 'natural selection'.\n \n Therefore, as I said, any falsification of EAM (or RMNS or any other scientific hypothesis) must be based upon a challenge to the empirical observations that prompted the idea, and the logic in the reasoning of the inferences from those observations that led to its stated hypothesis.\n \n WRT EAM, the observations were that microevolution happens today, and that, according to the fossil record, macroevolution happened in the past. The inference made was that the mechanism for both microevolution and macroevolution is the same, since there is no observable necessity for there to be two mechanisms.\n \n It was noted that when ecosystems are stable, static, and in a state of near equilibrium, no evolution, neither micro nor macro, happens. This is readily demonstrated in today's ecosystems, both in stable systems, and in the micro-evolution observed in ecosystems in disequilibrium, (i.e.,those showing novel environmental factors). That led to the inference that evolution is adaptational, and that there is a direct correlation between the environment and an organism's evolution, or lack of evolution, within it. \n \n It was observed that in cases of true novelty, that that novelty always arose first in the environment before a correspondent novelty arose in the organism. It was inferred that evolution is responsive to, and dependent upon, environmental stimulus, whereby if an environment does not change first, an organism does not change, but if its environment changes in some robust fashion, then an most organisms will either change to suit the novel environmental circumstances, or go extinct. Except when they are already perfectly suited to the new circumstnces.\n \n It was observed that when organism changed to adapt to a novel environmental circumstance, they changed in ways specific to that novel environmental circumstance, and they did it rapidly. This was shown in antibiotic, pesticide, and herbicide resistance in microbes, insects, and plants, and in other lifeforms as well, including fish, crustaceans, and others. The basic observation of direct and specific and fairly rapid adjustment (adaptation) to the novel environmental stimulus was noted. The rapidity and specificity of the connected inter-relation of environmental stimulus and organismic response eliminated random chance from the process, and at least strongly indicated an inference of directed organismic teleological action, either internally or externally prompted.\n \n Since there was nothing empirical but the environment to do any prompting, it was assumed that the teleological behaviour of the adapting organism was self-generated, internally.\n But since nothing can come from nothing, nothing can organise or re-organise itself without some external power source. Something about the 2LoT, I believe. ;) Since this power sorce could not be located empirically in the environment, (as above), it had to exist non-empirically in the environment. We know of four non-empirically observable power sources already, from their effects upon empirically observable substances. Since these four forces are insufficient to explain this dynamic self-direction in living biosystems, a fifth force, Vitality, was inferred to that purpose.\n \n From this the basic EAM hypothesis emerged, that is, that evolution is a dynamic historical process wherein live organisms, using a natural force called Vitality, actively and dynamically seek to preserve their ability to survive, thrive, and, usually, reproduce, in direct and teleological correspondence to the novel stimuli that a chaotically but robustly altered environment pressures them to do.\n \n This can be disproven by showing, _empirically_, that any meaningful evolution is not in direct correspondence to a preceeding environmental stimuli, or by showing how that response is engendered by something other than the supposed fifth force, Vitality.\n \n BTW, since e.coli. had been in direct exposure to the phage for billions of generations, during which time it had already developed a phage-resistant immune response, LD'43 does not qualify.\n \n Time for another break.",

   "\n Putting the problem of finding a falsification test of EAM aside, I'd like to bring up the core issue that's been bugging me since we first discussed it a few posts ago:\n \n \n Quote:\n You may say that two cloned cells are exactly alike, and for sake of argument I will agree. But is the stimulus and other environmental conditions involving those exact twins also exactly alike? If it/they is/are, then, all things being equal, the outcomes _must_ be identical. That is, either both identical cells 'have what it takes', and adapt, or neither does, and they don't. \n \n \n We've discussed how some organisms just 'have what it takes', that vitality is universal, and you've also said that cloned organisms ought to respond identically.\n\n \n **\n Just to be clear, what I actually said was that identical organisms under identical circumstances must behave identically. But since in reality nothing is identical with anything else, the premise is strictly metaphysical\n \n \n\n So I'm prompted to ask: if vitality is universal, and clonal organisms ought to be expected to respond the same to the same stimulus, it follows that 'having what it takes' is something physical, genetic and pre-existing - in other words, a feature of the organism's genome that existed prior to the stimulus being applied.\n\n \n **\n By definition, in identical organisms, 'what it takes' would be identical in both instances. Meaning that all design, organization of parts, and physical composition of parts, and parts within parts, would be identical. And since parts, and parts within parts are identical, yes the DNAcids that are part of the genomes that are part of the organisms would be identical, and their reaction to the input of Vitality would also, necessarily, be identical. And those two organisms would exist identically before encountering the identical stimulus, would respond to it in identical fashion, and so would evolve identically, and in the end, still be different from what they were, but still identical.\n \n \n\n Without a causal reason for being there (the stimulus, as we have said, not yet having been applied), it can only be there by chance.\n\n \n **\n That assertion is not reasonable. It makes no sense. Icecream is fairly solid, by intention. Apply heat, and it melts. Because it melts when heat is applied, does not mean that it was what it was originally, i.e., frozen solid, \"by chance\".\n \n \n \n\n Call that a 'lucky adaptive variant conferring a benefit in a new environment', or call it a 'lucky variant enabling successful response to a stimulus', either way a great many of your criticisms of Darwinian evolution must either evaporate or apply with equal weight to EAM:\n\n \n **\n I assume that you are referring to 'what it takes' as 'adaptibility'. In two identical organisms there must be identical adaptibility. But you are assuming that that adaptibility arose originally as a matter of lucky chance, but that assumption is irrational.\n \n Besides, an \"adaptive variant\" contributes nothing to an environment, it only contributes something to itself. The environment is not a pensive, thoughtful being. It neither knows nor cares what what it's composed of. It simply is an arbitrary label for what's out there, and that could be an old or new variant, no difference to the environment.\n \n Indeed it is a matter of luck as to whether an organism, or two identical organisms, although number doesn't seem pertinent, already has an adaptability that enables adaptation to a given environmental stimulus, as opposed to another stimulus for which it has no adaptibility. In that case, both identical organisms would not adapt, they would die, and both would be identically unlucky. But that does not support your contention that \"a great many of your criticisms of Darwinian evolution must either evaporate or apply with equal weight to EAM\". Why not. Because the environment is a randomly operating chaotic process that can sometimes throw up novel stimuli that mean 'adapt or suffer the consequences'. The luck involved in that case arises out of the accidental stimulus and its correspondence to the adptability of the inherited form. Any degree of compatibility and the lucky organism adapts, no compatibility and the unlucky organism suffers, maybe dies. So far darwinism and EAM seem to agree. Adaptibility can be an accident of birth, so to speak, seemingly just a matter of inherited genes--just like having blue eyes or perfect pitch, except that survival can depend upon it.\n \n But that is not true. Where darwinism seems to say that adaptibility is a determined function of genes--that is, that what they say, goes, and cannot be countermanded, EAM says that adaptibility is a function of the organism, of which genes are only a part, and so adaptibily, survival, and evolution/extinction are not genetically, that is, mechanically, pre-determined.\n \n Thus while darwinism says that those things are simply and entirely a matter of luck, EAM says that that is not true. EAM says that in addition to inherited genes, the organism also has epigenetic powers to adapt, and that those powers are observed during development, where the organism takes it cues on adaptatyion from its environment, even when that environment is its parent organism, and not from its genes alone. You will say that epegenesis and development are chemically, mechanically directed by genes, but I will say, not entirely. Genes are also directed by information.\n \n \n\n if an organism's differentially successful response to a stimulus (compared to its peers in the population) depends in any way upon its unique physical makeup prior to the stimulus, then that organism simply 'got lucky'. Nothing could have intentionally made that particular organism more ready for that stimulus than its peers, because that would imply the future occurrence and nature of the stimulus was known.\n\n \n **\n The difference is, again, that you claim that it entirely luck. In some cases that may be true, especially in unlucky, negative ones. But I say that in positive cases, where novel adaptive forms take shape, its partly genetic luck, and partly dynamic organismic information processing.\n \n Your thoughts? ;)",

I absolutely agree that many organisms do seek to survive and thrive via directed, heuristic modification of behaviour (and location - we must not forget the adaptive power of migration) - though their capacity to vary their behaviour and the intelligence behind the 'direction' varies considerably. Without that factor in play the advantage conferred by many traits, certainly the more subtle ones, might never be realised.\n \n Consider how the initially geological time-scales involved in evolution - billions of single-celled years - have quickened latterly in direct proportion to the increasing sophistication of the organisms involved. If you want evidence that intelligence is a boon to evolution, look no further! \n \n For example, animals that can choose their mates can hasten and direct (indirectly, if you see what I mean) the footsteps of evolution by superimposing their own differential success criteria upon those dictated by the environment. This might be as simple as intelligently recognising the signs of success in another - a healthy appearance indicating excellent adaptation - and only mating with the best available, thus greatly accelerating the population-wide spread of the best genes, or it might be the comparatively Machivellian politics of a chimp tribe selecting for qualities and behaviours conducive to a successful group. \n \n Have the genes of these creatures been shaped by their behaviour? No, but they have been selected according to how well the traits they confer conform to what the organism wants - thus selected in a sense you would happily agree with, rather than the blind, constraint-based 'selection' imposed by the environment that would have shaped the interminable early years of life on Earth. After all, when an animal selects a mate it's choosing half the genes its offspring will inherit - I'd say that compares favourably with the teleological power to maybe, once in a blue moon, just possibly tweak an intron here or there :)\n \n And then there's the ability of the organism to recognise or find ways in which it is better suited to the environment, or recognise new environments to which it is suited: pushing and testing the limits of the physical form its genes describe. Humans didn't choose the forms they wear now, but they sure as heck chose to go out on the plains and find new sources of food rather than starving to death in the dwindling forests.\n \n All Darwinism actually says with regard to the teleological nature of organisms is that, like many other factors in the environment, the raw genetic material organisms get to work with is not under their control. I would contend that it does not need to be to explain our observations, and it certainly does not hand the reins of evolution entirely to either chance or an organism's genome. If anything, Darwinism is the story of life - at least to a degree - seizing the reins from its genome and doing all the better for it :)\n \n I'll leave it there for the weekend and see what your thoughts are. I think it would be interesting to examine more closely how our theories explain our observations of rapid evolution in some situations and the laboriously slow evolution we observe in others.\n \n *Not always - E-coli phage resistance for example is, in physical terms, simply a slightly malformed receptor that the phage would normally 'dock with' to transfer its lethal payload, and the immunity this malformation confers is entirely passive.

And of course, if an organism's genome, as stipulated, is entirely out of its control, an 'accident of birth', then in fact \"the reins of evolution\" hve been entirely handed over to 'chance', alone. And that ain't science. That's metaphysics.\n \n \n\n If anything, Darwinism is the story of life - at least to a degree - seizing the reins from its genome and doing all the better for it. \n\n \n **\n Au contraire, mon ami. :) Modern Darwinism is the materialist story of 'bits of stuff', called \"genes\", \"DNA\", seizing the reins of biology from life, aka, \"Vitality\", and downgrading and diminishing the wonder of life and the evolution of life forms (biology) to an accidental, chance-dependent process of spontaneously generated mechanically interacting bits of stuff, which unintentionally fall together and, by happy chance, are not entropically destroyed by the local circumstances in which, unasked, they 'just happen' to find themselves when expressed as live organisms.\n \n \n\n I'll leave it there for the weekend and see what your thoughts are. I think it would be interesting to examine more closely how our theories explain our observations of rapid evolution in some situations and the laboriously slow evolution we observe in others.\n\n \n \n **\n I mentioned this in some earlier post. The conditions that determine the rapidity of and timing of evolutionary change are--\n A/ Necessity. That is, the more robust the stimulus, the more a response is pertinent to surviving and thriving, and the more pertinent it is, the more pressing it is, and the more necessary it is to adapt (come up with a satisfactory response), or die.\n \n B/ Complexity-- Systems are information-based, and information arises out of meaningful relationships. The more complex a relationship is, the more meaningful it is. Biological systems are extremely complex, that is, meaningful, that is, interdependent. That means that changing even one part requires adjustments to all parts within the whole, but the whole essense of systematics is a system's resistance to entropic change. Complex systems, and especially highly complex self-controlled systems like organisms, are extremely conservative. In some cases they are so complex that usually it is next to impossible to change them in any robust way, and in othrs it takes a lot of time as well as effort.\n \n \n\n \n *Not always - E-coli phage resistance for example is, in physical terms, simply a slightly malformed receptor that the phage would normally 'dock with' to transfer its lethal payload, and the immunity this malformation confers is entirely passive.\n\n \n **\n Don't follow. If an elephant finds the climate growing cold and so it, and its offspring, develop thicker and thicker fur coats as an ice-age comes on, to the point that that makes them wooly mammoths, is that fur coat and the \"immunity\" it confers to vitally threatening temperatures, \"entirely passive\"?\n \n \n\n I hope you would agree that the idea of a genetic mutation leading to a bacterium with such an inheritable quirk once every 100,000,000 cell divisions or so isn't that absurd, on the face of it.\n\n \n **\n No, not on its face, or it wouldn't have become and remained the prevailing belief. It seems plausible that such an adaptive change could occur accidentally, especially if the general worldview that preceeds that proposition, that is, the intellectual substrate against which it is seen and evaluated, is materialist/mechanist. But it is still not the truth, the actual fact of the matter.\n \n I look forward to your larger overview.",

   "So you do admit to an ability in live organisms that does not exist in inert, inanimate, 'bits of stuff', therebye demonstrating an empirical criterion for distinguishing life from non-life, biology from chemistry and physics.\n\n No. As I've pointed out already, living organisms are physically distinguishable from the dead or inanimate, and you must prove that those physical differences are insufficient to explain different behaviour before a qualitative difference can be inferred. To return to your earlier response on the topic:\n \nI still don't know what you mean by 'appropriately configured matter'. Rodin's \"Thinker\" is \"appropriately configured matter\", so far as I can tell, but neither the four physical forces, nor the force of Vitality itself, is ever going to get that statue to get up off its duff and get to work!!\n\n Now, I actually think you know perfectly well what I mean by 'appropriately configured matter'. A statue is a lump of rock, only grossly similar to an actual human body (no disrespect intended to the artist). It is no more 'appropriately configured' to exhibit life than a statue of a television set is 'appropriately configured' to exhibit moving pictures.\n \n But we can make a meaningful, if simple, stone-based analogy: a square stone does not roll downhill, but a round one does - it is appropriately configured to exhibit rolling behaviour. The rounder the stone, the better it rolls - but rocks have no concept of 'better' or 'rolling' or 'roundness'; surely, then, we must infer a 'sphericality' force to materialise these notions!\n \nActually, that is my point, exactly. Because, you see, 'configuration', 'organization', 'systematization', 'design', etc. are all abstractions that can be expressed concretely, but are not concrete [material, substantial, corporeal], themselves.\n\n Clearly this is irrelevant. A round stone and a square stone are physically different configurations of matter. An observer can abstract properties, invent a word for 'round', liken the stone to other 'round' entities - but neither the abstractions, the words, or the observer himself are required for one stone to roll down a hill and another not. There need be no awareness of the concept of roundness; the stone need only be one shape rather than another and it will behave differently when it encounters an incline.\n \n Returning to the realm of living organisms, the same logic applies: whenever we compare life and non-life we observe physical differences. We can even redress some of those physical differences and restore life behaviour. You have argued in the past that 'clinically dead is not dead dead', but that's just an exercise in goalpost-moving. A few hundred years ago your 'dead dead' would have been when the heart stopped beating. Were scientists tomorrow to devise a way of redressing some of the other physical differences between the living and the dead and again restore life behaviour, you would have to move the goalposts again. \n \nSimply pointing out that hearts beat and synapses fire doesn't explain why they do that when you're alive, but not when you're dead.\n\n \"Simply pointing out that gears turn and hands move doesn't explain why they do that when the clock is working, but not when it's broken.\"\n \n This is cart and horse all over again: our hearts don't beat because we're alive; rather our ability to exhibit the behaviour we call 'living' is contingent upon, among many things, our hearts beating. Our ability to abstract the idea of a 'working' clock and a 'broken' one does not change the fact that the difference between the two is a purely physical reconfiguration.\n \n So again, no, I do not see any need to resort to Vitality to explain the different behaviour of physically different systems.\n \n \nYou kinow, it's really nice to have you finally start to agree with me on this subject.\n\n That cuts both ways, given that you've accepted that genetic suitability to (in EAM's case, adapt to) novel environments is coincidental and exists prior to the application of the stimulus :)\n \nAnd here is where we disagree. I hold that that statement on the darwinist position re genetic determinism DOES, as a matter of fact, \"hand the reins of evolution entirely to either chance or an organism's genome\".\n\n But I've already described several ways in which evolution can be hastened and directed by organismic-level actions in the Darwinian framework, so this simply isn't true.\n \nAnd of course, if an organism's genome, as stipulated, is entirely out of its control, an 'accident of birth', then in fact \"the reins of evolution\" hve been entirely handed over to 'chance', alone. And that ain't science. That's metaphysics.\n\n This too is false, for more than one reason:\n \n 1. Although an organism's genome is entirely out of its control, in the case of interbreeding animals it was not out of the control of its parents, whose choice to mate with each other determined the potential genome of the offspring.\n \n 2. Chance being a factor doesn't make analysis of the process unscientific; ask any casino owner if his profit margin is 'metaphysical'. Chance is a factor in an organism's genome, yes, but the fact that it exists at all means it is inheriting alelles that have survived non-random selective pressures - both environmental and induced organismically. \n \n Besides, as we've now agreed, the compatability between an organism's genome and a novel environment is serendipitous in both EAM and Darwinism - the only difference is that EAM requires the organism to heuristically seek out and induce the potential adaptation offered by that genome, whereas Darwinism lets the organism get on with using it.\n \nAu contraire, mon ami. :) Modern Darwinism is the materialist story of 'bits of stuff', called \"genes\", \"DNA\", seizing the reins of biology from life, aka, \"Vitality\", and downgrading and diminishing the wonder of life and the evolution of life forms\n\n You misunderstand; I'm not talking about the history of the development of Darwinism, I'm talking about the history of life as viewed in the Darwinian framework, a history in which the burgeoning intelligence of life has bootstrapped the process of evolution by applying its own selective forces.\n \nI mentioned this in some earlier post. The conditions that determine the rapidity of and timing of evolutionary change are--\n A/ Necessity. That is, the more robust the stimulus, the more a response is pertinent to surviving and thriving, and the more pertinent it is, the more pressing it is, and the more necessary it is to adapt (come up with a satisfactory response), or die.\n\n Unfortunately you're only ever able to apply this criterion as an excuse or apology for observations, not as a predictor. We've already seen this in our discussion of the yeast experiment: the stimulus 'must just not have been very robust' because the adaptations were so long in coming, despite the actual benefit of the two mutations being very substantial.\n \nB/ Complexity-- <snip< In some cases they are so complex that usually it is next to impossible to change them in any robust way, and in othrs it takes a lot of time as well as effort.\n\n Again, there's nothing quantifiable here, and your assessment of complexity is made after the fact - adaptation took a long time 'because it must have been a very complex process', or it was quick 'because it must have been simple'.\n \nDon't follow. If an elephant finds the climate growing cold and so it, and its offspring, develop thicker and thicker fur coats\n\n I don't think I mentioned elephants :) I was talking about the specific mutation that conferred phage resistance in e-coli. I referred to it as passive because with or without the phage being present the bacteria's behaviour would be unchanged; it didn't develop a mechanism that would trigger in the presence of phage and do something.\n \nNo, not on its face, or it wouldn't have become and remained the prevailing belief. It seems plausible that such an adaptive change could occur accidentally <snip< But it is still not the truth, the actual fact of the matter.\n\n So we know random mutations occur, and even to you it seems plausible that that particular adaptive change - a malformed receptor - could occur accidentally.\n \n So how do you know it didn't? Where's your proof that in this specific case the immune trait - whose distribution in all the colonies in both halves of the fluctuation test exactly matches predictions based on a random mutation occurring once every 100,000,000 cell divisions or so - wasn't a random mutation?",

The very fact that \"living organisms are physically distinguishable from the dead or inanimate\", without any change in the four physical forces that drive the physics and chemistry of physical mechanics, demonstrates that those four forces, and the physical mechanics they drive in insensible bits of stuff and passive mechanical systems, are insufficient to generate and sustain the dynamic behaviours of self-directed biosystems. Why? Because if the four physical forces were sufficient, as well as necessary, there could be no physical differences between live organisms and inert matter or mechanically operated physical systems. But even though that is simply a self-evident fact, you are determined to deny it, and there is nothing I can do about deliberate denial of self-evident facts. \n \n \n\n To return to your earlier response on the topic:\n \n Quote:\n I still don't know what you mean by 'appropriately configured matter'.

The rounder the stone, the better it rolls - but rocks have no concept of 'better' or 'rolling' or 'roundness'; surely, then, we must infer a 'sphericality' force to materialise these notions!\n\n \n **\n You are proving my point for me. That is, that it is form, not substance, that really matters, and simple physical resemblance, (ie., spatial extension in terms of physical dimensions, length, wait, interval, etc.), is insufficient to an understanding of the power of form over substance, except at the most basic, passive level. Such as your round rock rolling, as captured by our ancestors in the invention of the wheel. Trouble is, that most basic, passive level is not where we're at when discussing complex systems, especially wrt complex, dynamic, self-sustaining, self-organizing, and self-directing biosystems. At that point you can increase the accuracy of form to the physically identical levels of human bodies and TV sets, but unless something more than \"appropriately configured matter\" is added, a dead human being won't get up and climb a hill, (although it is still possible to roll a dead body down a hill, like a rock), and an 'unplugged' TV will 'pick out and present' no more sound or image out of distantly generated 'air waves' then will that cadaver's brain. Despite the fact that both the brain and the TV are \"appropiately configured matter\".\n \n \n\n Returning to the realm of living organisms, the same logic applies: whenever we compare life and non-life we observe physical differences. We can even redress some of those physical differences and restore life behaviour. You have argued in the past that 'clinically dead is not dead dead', but that's just an exercise in goalpost-moving. A few hundred years ago your 'dead dead' would have been when the heart stopped beating. Were scientists tomorrow to devise a way of redressing some of the other physical differences between the living and the dead and again restore life behaviour, you would have to move the goalposts again. \n\n \n **\n Oh, please. This 'movement of the goalposts' wrt to death is due our former ignorance of what death is. If you wish to call the scientific acquisition of knowledge of that phenomenon, 'moving the goalposts', go right ahead. But your supposition that the playing field is infinite is irrational. Death, like every form of entropy, is inevitable, but intelligent, voluntary, dynamic behaviour originally generated by Vitaliy in complex biosystems , such as doctors and research scientists, can and does stave off naturally occuring entropy, even death, for a time. Our ancestors must have noticed that when, instead of abandoning a mate with a broken leg, they reset it, bound it in a splint, and carried him for days, it healed itself. Something no broken rock or melted icecube or dead man can do\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Simply pointing out that hearts beat and synapses fire doesn't explain why they do that when you're alive, but not when you're dead. \n \n \"Simply pointing out that gears turn and hands move doesn't explain why they do that when the clock is working, but not when it's broken.\"\n\n \n **\n Absolutely right. My point, exactly!!\n \n \n\n This is cart and horse all over again: our hearts don't beat because we're alive; rather our ability to exhibit the behaviour we call 'living' is contingent upon, among many things, our hearts beating.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. Of course hearts beat because they are alive. Why else would they beat? And a reflexive twitch thanks a an electrical jolt is not 'beating', altough we know that such a twitch can restart the function in a live heart, though not in a dead one. Which is why doctors eventually quit trying and announce a time of death. And we are not alive because our hearts are beating. People do live through heart transplant surgery, after all. The fact is, our hearts are pumping, our lungs are respiring, our eyes are seeing, because we are alive;-- we are not alive because they are functioning.\n \n But that difference of opinion between us goes back a long way, at least to Lucretius, perhaps earlier. It is the old argument that first comes form , aka, 'appropriately configured matter', then follows function appropriate to that form. That is, life is an epiphenomenon of material form, that form causes function. I, and others, (Aristotle for instance), going back to Heraclitus, hold to the reverse, i.e., that form follows function. That function causes form. That life causes lifeforms.\n \n \n\n Our ability to abstract the idea of a 'working' clock and a 'broken' one does not change the fact that the difference between the two is a purely physical reconfiguration.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. A working clock is one that got, and still gets, intelligent volitional input, as necessary. That's what watchsmiths and clockmakers do. A broken clock is in an entropic state without any intelligent, volitional input with which to override that state. The difference between the the two is far from 'purely physical'.\n \n \n\n So again, no, I do not see any need to resort to Vitality to explain the different behaviour of physically different systems.\n\n \n **\n You need to rethink your reasoning.\n \n Anyhoo, time for a break. Good to have you back. I had to toy with electrolyte and his ilk over the weekend, just to stay amused. It's fun in a way, but it leaves me feeling like I've been slumming.",

Either the 'sexual selection' practiced by some parental organisms is true 'selection', that is, a volitional choice between alternates based upon an intelligently established and retained value criterion, or it is a genetically pre-determined mechanical reaction, for which there is no alternative, thus, no 'selection', in any honest sense of that word.\n \n \n\n 2.

If casino profits depended on pure chance, there wouldn't be any, since the house would only win half the time. Chance is entropic, and strives for equilibrium. The reason that casino owners get rich is because chance is distorted by their intelligent input, that is, 'the rules of the games' that they intentionally put in place that favour the house, creating a disequilibrium, advantage,between/over the whales who come to bet and/for the sharks who invite them to get eaten. \n \n \n\n Chance is a factor in an organism's genome, yes, but the fact that it exists at all means it is inheriting alelles that have survived non-random selective pressures - both environmental and induced organismically. \n\n \n **\n There are no \"non-random selective pressures\". That's more darwinist mythology. In the real world of organisms, there are only chaotic and largely unpredictable, i.e., 'random', environmental events. Whether an organism is effected negatively, positively, or trivially depends on chance and psychical abilities, not mechanical determinism, because biologically mechanical determinism is already a matter of chance, as we havealready seen, above.\n \n \n\n Besides, as we've now agreed, the compatability between an organism's genome and a novel environment is serendipitous in both EAM and Darwinism -\n\n \n **\n Not 'serendipitous'. I don't believe I ever intimated that an organism's functioning genome is always serendipitously compatible with a novel environment. It may be so, in some cases, but not all, and it is in those cases where it is not true that evolution takes place. What I maintain, whether or not you agree, is that an organism's genome's inherited genetic component is compatible with a novel environnment strictly as, 'a matter of chance', which is not the same thing as you said. Further, the degree of compatibility between genomic inheritance and novel environmental stimulus is also based on chance. But the degree to which an organism has an ability to dynamically overide this chance corrrspondence is not entirely mechanically pre-determined, but in some case cases can be overridden by psychical ability, rather than simple luck.\n \n \n\n the only difference is that EAM requires the organism to heuristically seek out and induce the potential adaptation offered by that genome, whereas Darwinism lets the organism get on with using it.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it is the only difference, but it is one heck of a difference. For one thing, what do you mean by, \"let[ting] the organism get on with using it\"? If the organism is dynamically \"using\" the genome, {as opposed to the genome mechanically \"using\" the passive organism, (as per Dawkins' summation of RMNS in his 'selfish gene' )}, then you are now talking EAM, whether you realise it or not.\n \n Another short break, back soon.",

We've already seen this in our discussion of the yeast experiment: the stimulus 'must just not have been very robust' because the adaptations were so long in coming, despite the actual benefit of the two mutations being very substantial.\n\n \n **\n You can't have it both ways. If the actual adaptive benefit to the yeast itself, (as opposed to some particular bit of molecular stuff called an allele), then the yeast cells proper had to have been under environmental stimulus, that is, maladapted to point where there ability to survive, thrive and reproduce was noticeably compromised. There is no mention of that, so let us assume that there was absolutely no difference, behaviourally, morphologically, and numerically in the yeast organisms themselves, compared prior to and post allelic mutation. In my book then, no evolution took place. Which is why I scorn your geneticism-serving definition of evolution as a statistical change in differential allele content. You guys want us to believe that evolution is something mechanical that happens by accident to bits of stuff, DNA molecules, alleles, genes, even chromsomes, as the only actual phenomenon, and which effects (i.e., somehow \"causes\") unlooked for changes in live organisms as an epiphenomenon (a secondary phenomenon that is a by-product of another phenomenon), only.\n \n I and the vast majority of human beings disagree with geneticists on this point, whether or not we dare say so publicly. We feel that evolution is something that happens to organisms as whole complex systems, such as the yeasts in that artificial apparatus, and not to their inert molecular constituents, (aka, bits of stuff, aka, alleles).\n A basket of eggs doesn't evolve just because you accidentally find more brown eggs than white, or more speckled than brown, or any other purely statistical, numerical, arithmetical, abstract distinction within the basket. The evolution comes when the egg colour makes for an empirically observable difference in the chicks they hatch, or their taste on the table, or their nutritive quality, or something else meaningful. Evolution is either a difference that makes a difference, or it's nothing at all. If it doesn't, than that basket of eggs in not undergoing evolution in any biological sense of that word. And neither did those yeasts.\n \n If, OTOH, there was a noticeable difference in the yeast's actual ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce after the mutation as compared to before it, then that difference should have been empirically noticeable at the organismic level, and a comparison between the yeasts in the artificial environment of the experimental apparatus with yeasts in their natural habitat should have been undertaken on that basis, to discover the how and why of the difference in environment that brought about that difference in outcome. There was no such thing mentioned in the paper. So either there was no empirical difference anywhere, or the experiment was intrinsically flawed.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n B/ Complexity-- <snip< In some cases they are so complex that usually it is next to impossible to change them in any robust way, and in othrs it takes a lot of time as well as effort. \n \n Again, there's nothing quantifiable here,\n\n \n **\n Time is not quantifiable. Degree of correlation between a specific cause of impaired organismic functioning seen in the environment, and a specific organismic compensatory (adaptive) trait change, is not quantifiable?!!? I beg to disagree strongly.\n \n \n\n and your assessment of complexity is made after the fact - adaptation took a long time 'because it must have been a very complex process', or it was quick 'because it must have been simple'.\n\n \n **\n No, it is not simply a post hoc judgement, like your 'fitness'. Organic and organismic complexity is an empirical phenomenon. You can tell whether a system is complex or simple just by looking at it, before anything happens to it or is done to it. Look a cell and you see, a priori, that it is a highly complex, dynamic, autopoietic system that, 'in se', is next to impossible to change short of simply destroying it, as viruses, phages, do. Many-celled systems can be changed without necessarily destroying them utterly, but the degree of complexity in their interworking cells and organic systems definitely enables quantitative prediction of the degree of difficulty involved in bringing about an effective , positive, productive change in their operations.\n \n Time for another break.",

   "No, I do not. <snip< if the four physical forces were sufficient, as well as necessary, there could be no physical differences between live organisms and inert matter or mechanically operated physical systems.\n\n That's crazy-talk, man! Logically, if the physical forces are sufficient to explain living organisms, then the behaviour that distinguishes them from the dead and inanimate should (as it is) be reflected in physical differences, just as we see a physical difference between a round and a square stone which explains their different behaviour in an otherwise identical sloping environment.\n \n Conversely, we would be forced to infer an invisible, qualitative difference only if one of two physically, electrically (etc) identical entities exhibited life behaviour and another did not - just as we would be forced to infer an invisible, qualitative difference if only one of two identically shaped and positioned stones upped and rolled down a hill.\n \nYou are proving my point for me. That is, that it is form, not substance, that really matters, \n\n Actually, that's my point that's being proved; get your own ;) Your contention is that neither what an entity is made of (substance), nor its moment-to-moment configuration (form), makes it alive.\n \nand simple physical resemblance,\n\n Again, you know full well I'm not talking about 'simple' physical resemblence, any more than your statue was an accurate analogy for 'appropriately configured matter'.\n \nIf you wish to call the scientific acquisition of knowledge of that phenomenon, 'moving the goalposts', go right ahead. But your supposition that the playing field is infinite is irrational.\n\n The field need not be infinite for it to be endlessly possible for you to move the goalposts. Your definition of 'dead' - the absence of vitality - is meaningless because vitality cannot be detected or measured. From whatever state of death doctors manage to reanimate a corpse, you would simply say that it 'couldn't have been dead dead dead, because if it was they couldn't have revived it.' It's a hypothesis that can't be disproved, but it's also entirely useless.\n \nNonsense. Of course hearts beat because they are alive. Why else would they beat?\n \n Same reason a round rock rolls down a hill: because that's what that configuration of matter and energy does according to the laws of physics.\n \nAnd a reflexive twitch thanks a an electrical jolt is not 'beating', altough we know that such a twitch can restart the function in a live heart, though not in a dead one.\n\n You again presuppose a qualitative 'live' and 'dead', rather than the observable, physically distinguishable state where the systems that could be stimulated by that jolt have also broken down. You're trying to bump-start a car when the crank-shaft's snapped - you're not fixing the right thing.\n \nThe fact is, our hearts are pumping, our lungs are respiring, our eyes are seeing, because we are alive;-- we are not alive because they are functioning.\n\n As you say later, that's opinion, not fact, and one I see no compelling reason to adopt since you have given no evidence to support it.\n \nActually, this statement isn't true, although I'm not accusing you of lying, just misunderstanding.\n\n Without an explanation for why, I don't see any reason to change my opinion. Organismic-level selection of mates, organismic-level migration and behavioural change are all ways in which selective criteria can be indirectly imposed to influence the course of evolution.\n \nWhich proves my point, and defeats your own. Either the 'sexual selection' practiced by some parental organisms is true 'selection', that is, a volitional choice between alternates based upon an intelligently established and retained value criterion, or it is a genetically pre-determined mechanical reaction, for which there is no alternative, thus, no 'selection', in any honest sense of that word.\n\n I don't want to get into another semantic wrangle. If you want to restrict our usage of the word 'selection' to the volitional influences upon reproductive success, fine, but that doesn't mean there aren't other directional influences upon reproductive success that are beyond the organism's volitional control. \n \n You've already described how an organism must 'have what it takes' to successfully adapt to a novel environment - now, whether you're prepared to call that environment's influence (which causes some organisms to fail and some to thrive, non-randomly according to their suitability to that environment) 'selection' is irrelevant; you know it happens, I know it happens - can we please, please stop arguing over whether it should be called 'selection' or not?\n \n Reality is not the all-or-nothing pure-volition-or-pure-genetics picture you're trying to paint; yes, sexual selection is a factor, but environmental constraints and environmental opportunities are also factors, and as we've already agreed, the genetic potential to thrive in those environments or take advantage of opportunities is ultimately beyond the organism's control. An organism must, as you say, 'have what it takes'.\n \nOh, please. If casino profits depended on pure chance, there wouldn't be any, since the house would only win half the time.\n\n Did I say 'pure chance', or did I say 'chance being a factor'?\n \nThere are no \"non-random selective pressures\". That's more darwinist mythology. In the real world of organisms, there are only chaotic and largely unpredictable, i.e., 'random', environmental events.\n\n *Smacks forehead* I've just understood why we keep arguing past each other on this point. Totally my bad.\n \n I chose my words poorly. I don't describe environmental selective pressures as 'non-random' because they're intelligently chosen or there's some greater pattern to them, I describe them as 'non-random' because they are, like the stimuli EAM requires, chronic: consistent across a period of time and across an interbreeding population. I know; crappy choice of words. There is no 'darwinist mythology' about this. EAM's environmental stimuli are, in the same sense, random in nature but chronic and consistent in application, correct? Same thing.\n \nNot 'serendipitous'. I don't believe I ever intimated that an organism's functioning genome is always serendipitously compatible with a novel environment.\n\n No, no; I mean what you mean: that if it is compatible, that compatability is serendipitous as opposed to intelligently brought about.\n \nBut the degree to which an organism has an ability to dynamically overide this chance corrrspondence is not entirely mechanically pre-determined, but in some case cases can be overridden by psychical ability, rather than simple luck.\n\n This sort of sounds like you want it both ways: an organism must 'have what it takes', but if it doesn't, it can 'override' not having what it takes - but doesn't that mean it did, actually, 'have what it takes'?\n \n To me it seems much more consistent to say that the organism's genome (as well as other more transient physical factors like health and wellbeing) defines the scope or potential that can be volitionally realised. Would you agree? Because otherwise there are no rules: there is no meaningful metric that can be applied to changes 'beyond the scope offered by the physical form' in order to include some changes as possible and exclude others as impossible.\n \nthe only difference is that EAM requires the organism to heuristically seek out and induce the potential adaptation offered by that genome, whereas Darwinism lets the organism get on with using it.\n \n Yes, it is the only difference, but it is one heck of a difference. For one thing, what do you mean by, \"let[ting] the organism get on with using it\"? If the organism is dynamically \"using\" the genome, {as opposed to the genome mechanically \"using\" the passive organism, (as per Dawkins' summation of RMNS in his 'selfish gene' )}, then you are now talking EAM, whether you realise it or not.\n\n I said get on with using the adaptation, not get on with using the genome. The giraffe's longer neck, the bacterium's phage immunity, etc. In both EAM and Darwinism, the genome must be fortuitously amenable to the novel environment. In EAM, the organism must then intelligently find and express the potential adaptive traits offered by its genome. In Darwinism, the trait is simply expressed, no questions asked. Actually deriving a benefit from that trait might be straightforward and automatic (phage immunity) or require a change of behaviour (arrived at heuristically or consciously), or an intelligent/heuristic migration. The latter two options mean that in higher forms of life a greater range of variant traits can actually be leveraged to confer an advantage, again refuting your claim that Darwinian evolution leaves no room for organismic-level influence.\n \nYou can't have it both ways. If the actual adaptive benefit to the yeast itself, (as opposed to some particular bit of molecular stuff called an allele), then the yeast cells proper had to have been under environmental stimulus, that is, maladapted to point where there ability to survive, thrive and reproduce was noticeably compromised. There is no mention of that, so let us assume that there was absolutely no difference, behaviourally, morphologically, and numerically in the yeast organisms themselves, compared prior to and post allelic mutation. In my book then, no evolution took place.\n\n Dear me, no! The paper describes a considerable numerical increase in yeast organisms post mutation, and goes into detail explaining the mechanics of this increase. The essentials are as follows: the medium in the chemostat is continuously refreshed, with new medium being added and old medium (including the yeast cells within it) washed out at a constant rate. The stable population density attained by yeast within the chemostat, therefore, is a function of both how rapidly they can reproduce in that particular medium and how fast the medium is being diluted. In the particular medium used in the experiment, the limiting factors on the reproductive rate of the yeast were the concentration of a particular nutrilite and the PH level of the medium. In their words:\n \nSelection therefore favored mutations increasing the rate at which acid phosphatase catalyzed the hydrolysis of very low concentrations of\n P-glycerophosphate under the adverse pH condition pertaining, and also favored mutations increasing the efficiency of orthophosphate metabolism.\n\n The first adaptive mutation increased the reproductive rate of those cells inheriting the mutation by 25%, subsequently displacing the unmutated cells and effecting an increase in stable cell density from 4.1*10^6 to 6.0*10^6 cells / ml. That's almost a 50% increase. The second adaptive mutation, occurring 220 generations later within a population almost exclusively composed of first-mutants, further increased the reproductive rate, and thus cell density from 6.0 * 10^6 to 11.0 * 10^6 cells / ml, a further improvement of 83%.\n \n I don't want it 'both ways'. This experiment shows spontaneous adaptation occurring after hundreds of generations in a chemically stable environment, exactly what EAM says can't happen. What I want is some sort of consistent reasoning other than 'must have happened like this' to support an EAM-based prediction of this behaviour.\n \n I don't really understand what you mean by adaptation being of benefit 'to an allele'. The only mechanism by which an allele can increase in frequency in a population is if organisms possessing that allele enjoy a superior reproductive rate; how else did you think the mutant strain displaced the non-mutant strain? Is that why you've been so down on NS? You think that because it refers to allele frequencies that it's somehow unrelated to the fortunes of the organisms? Hell no; the differential success of the organisms is what drives the changing allele frequencies! The contribution of the allele itself is to help or hinder the organism, which will then be reflected in the number of offspring inheriting those alleles in future generations.\n \nIf, OTOH, there was a noticeable difference in the yeast's actual ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce after the mutation as compared to before it, then that difference should have been empirically noticeable at the organismic level,\n\n Which it was :)\n \nand a comparison between the yeasts in the artificial environment of the experimental apparatus with yeasts in their natural habitat should have been undertaken on that basis, to discover the how and why of the difference in environment that brought about that difference in outcome. There was no such thing mentioned in the paper.\n\n On the contrary, such was explicitly described in great detail. \n \n There is of course no single 'natural habitat' for yeast, so a comparison with one is not really feasible. However, all environments in which yeast can survive have one factor or another limiting their reproduction (obviously, otherwise we'd all be hip-deep in yeast). What was constructed in that test was a stable environment where the actual limiting factor was known in advance: a particular nutrilite and a particular PH number. Undoubtedly many other mutations occurred during the experiment, but the point of having a known limiting factor is that mutations affecting other aspects of the yeast's metabolism simply could not yield increased reproductive rates (since the known limiting factor would still apply). Those other mutations would in that environment either be neutral or harmful (introducing a new, lower limiting factor unique to that mutant), and would thus not displace their peers. Only mutations pertaining to the limiting factor would yield improved reproduction. There is a followup paper, where the mutant genes are actually sequenced, that goes into even greater detail.\n \n Moving on:\n \nI don't think I mentioned elephants\n \n Does that mean that I can't?\n\n Not if you want to carry on talking about a malformed receptor on a bacterium :)\n \nAfter being removed from the phage the colonies went back to their normal state of carrying only a few resistant cells.\n\n Well, yes; if the resistant mutation was beneficial in all circumstances it would have inevitably displaced non-mutants long before the phage was applied. In the absence of phage, therefore, revertants enjoy a reproductive advantage and will once again reassert numerical superiority.\n \nThe most probable explanation is that once the colonies/culture attained a certain stage in development/size they simply reverted to their standard practice of carrying a few phage resistant cells among their number. After exposure to the phage those cells survived and reproduced, becoming the only survivors.\n\n You're exactly right, though not in the way you want to be. The 'standard practice of carrying a few phage resistant cells' does not imply bacterial memory of prior phage exposure, or any kind of intelligent planning. It is an inevitable consequence of there being very large numbers of bacteria in relation to the chances of specific random mutations and reversions occurring.\n \n A bacterial colony of billions is absolutely fizzing with mutations, there being just so damn many bacteria to experience them. Even if a particular mutation is, in one environment, slightly detrimental, in a sufficiently large colony there will almost always be a few possessors of said mutation kicking about, the actual proportion being determined by a) the chances of that mutation occurring in a bacterium, b) the differential reproductive rate of bacteria possessing that mutation, and c) the chances of that mutation being reverted. It's practically impossible for a particular allele to ever drift to fixation or extinction when there are billions upon billions of organisms and the chances of a mutation occurring at that locus is a comparatively likely 1 in 100,000,000. It's like the world's hardest game of whack-a-mole.\n \n Pre-phage, then, the large colony inevitably possessed a stable but small number of resistant bacteria - small because of the small chance of a non-mutant experiencing that particular mutation and because of the slight disadvantage it conferred in the absense of phage. In the presence of phage, they were the only survivors; their slight disadvantage was wiped out and they became the backbone, so to speak, of the colony. However, there would still have been revertants cropping up - and dying, obviously - because there's a small but finite chance of that happening. Remove the phage, and that tiny, tiny number of revertants will eventually predominate once more on the basis of their greater fitness in a phage-free environment.\n \n None of this requires intent on the part of the colony, or a memory of prior phage exposure. It just requires sufficient cell-division events for that particular random mutation to have a chance to arise - and that's exactly what the fluctuation test showed: first, that the number of cell division events prior to phage exposure was linked to the chances of there being resistant bacteria present when phage was applied, and second that the mutation occurred (if at all) at random times in growing colonies.\n \nHow can it be \"malformed\", when it's formation serves a vital function!?! And since it does, there is absolutely no reason to believe that its shape was changed accidentally instead of intentionally.\n\n First, it can be called 'malformed' because it's actual shape is not important, so long as it isn't the shape the phage needs to latch on to. It's a broken lock to which the phage has a key. Remind you of a certain Alanis Morissette track?\n \n Secondly, the burden of proof is upon your conjecture of an invisible mechanism; the default assumption is that this mutation, like all the others going on in that population, was undirected and random. Here we have a mutation that occurs in the absence of stimulus, after a random (but large) number of cell divisions starting with a single non-resistant bacterium. We have no evidence to support the idea of prior phage exposure being 'remembered' by that single seed bacterium - nowhere for that memory (along with the infinity of others that would be required to explain all the other supposedly planned and preemptive adaptive mutations large colonies exhibit) to reside. There's nothing distinctive or special about the actual genetic mutation itself. Random mutation - a known phenomenon - fits all the facts; there's absolutely nothing to indicate it was uniquely intelligently driven.\n \n What's interesting is that while you used to say the resistance was an intelligent response, now you're saying it was an intelligent pre-emption, further embellishing EAM. What happened to 'informationally available' and 'chronic stimulus'? What happened to behaviour, morphology, epigenetic inheritance, and all the other absolutely essential stages by which EAM progressed? Why do I get the feeling that this latest addition to EAM's arsenal is just another 'must have been like that because EAM is true' excuse?",

The illogic lies, as always, with your 'a priori' conflation of living behaviours with chemical and physical causes. Thus you start with \n \"If the physical forces [causes] are sufficient to explain both the behaviours of the living and the dead (or unliving);\"\n continues with\n \"and if the behaviours of living and non-living things are different\"\n and concludes with;\n \"Then the behaviours of living things are different from non-living things because physical forces are sufficient to explain both the behaviours of the living and of the dead.\n \n Duh!?!\n \n You could try putting it this way--\n \n \"Dead things show different behaviours from living things, and vice versa.\"\n And-\n \"All behaviours are driven driven by the 4 physical forces\"\n Therefore\n \"the 4 physical forces are sufficient to explain both the behaviours of the living and those of the dead.\n \n Again, duh?!?\n \n Or you could put it that--\n \n \"All behaviour is driven by the four physical forces.\"\n \"Live things behave differently from non-living things.\"\n \"Therefore the four physical forces are sufficient to explain different behaviours.\"\n \n Final duh?!\n \n But of course no matter how you put it, your logic is totally flawed. At no time can you assume in your argument that the four physical forces are sufficient to explain any and all behaviours, or that all behaviour is the direct or indirect result of one or more physical forces. That is what you are being asked to prove, logically, and it can only be a conclusion that follows from other premises that do not presuppose that conclusion.\n \n Now if you say that you were attacking my postulate, i.e., that if the 4 forces were sufficient, then the behaviours of both living and non-living would be indistinguishable, you would have to show why they are not identical in terms of that premise. But you simply stipulate that the behaviours of living and dead are distinguishable, (and I agree, as it is undeniable). This fact does nothing to undermine my \"if\" postulate.\n The only logical conclusion that can be drawn from that syllogism, right or wrong, is mine--that therefore the 4 forces are not sufficient to account for all behaviours, those of the living as well as those of the non-living.\n \n But let us say, for sake of argument, that they were sufficient. Given the same substances and the same forces acting upon them, how could qualitatively different behaviours ever arise? Minor differences, certainly, but behaviours of a simple, direct, passive, linear kind as opposed to complex, dynamic, self-driven and self-directed kind, not. Your only option is to deny reality to dynamically self-directed behaviours, and claim, metaphysically, that dynamic self-direction is illusory. And that is exactly what materialist/mechanists do, empirical evidence of dynamic self-direction notwithstanding. No matter what you are shown, you simply claim that it is an illusory appearance, not an observed reality. That is not science, and in fact, by extension, it undermines the whole of science and human knowledge in general, since it entails that all knowledge be illusory.\n \n Since the 4 forces are sufficient to account for all purely mechanical chemical reactions and locomotive behaviours as seen in non-living things, and can also account for _some_ of those same behaviours in living things, then that which they are not sufficient to account for are those non-linear, non-mechanical dynamic behaviours observed in living things that are never observed in non-living things, including dead things, except when artificially input by living things into non-living things.\n \n \n\n Conversely, we would be forced to infer an invisible, qualitative difference only if one of two physically, electrically (etc) identical entities exhibited life behaviour and another did not - just as we would be forced to infer an invisible, qualitative difference if only one of two identically shaped and positioned stones upped and rolled down a hill.\n\n \n **\n Ah, Frankenstein's Folly. The notion that electricity generates life, instead of lifeforms being able to generate their own electricity, chemically. I can think of some amazonian eels that will take exception to that. IOW, it is not the electricity in the biosystem that accounts for its behaviour, like some refrigerator or sewing machine, buts its self-driven behaviour (life) that accounts for the presence of that electricity. \n \n Break time.",

But what point are you trying to make with this observation? It seems to me that you are saying that both the contents of any genome and the correlation of inherited organismic traits to a randomly, spontaneously, unpredictably arising environmental change are matters of pure chance. But since that is exactly what I have been saying, and you have been denying all along, i.e., that RMNS is entirely chance-based, and so only pseudo-scientific, I really find it difficult to imagine that you've actually \"seen the light\"! :)\n \n \n \n\n I chose my words poorly. I don't describe environmental selective pressures as 'non-random' because they're intelligently chosen or there's some greater pattern to them, I describe them as 'non-random' because they are, like the stimuli EAM requires, chronic: consistent across a period of time and across an interbreeding population.\n\n \n **\n Well, this is awkward, since I apply the words 'random' (accidental) and 'non-random' (mechanical or intentional) only to change events, not ongoing states. For me randomness/chance/coincidence/accident refer to the causes of the changes, not their subsequent duration.\n \n \n\n I know; crappy choice of words. There is no 'darwinist mythology' about this. EAM's environmental stimuli are, in the same sense, random in nature but chronic and consistent in application, correct? Same thing.\n\n \n **\n Yes. But the duration of the stimulus does not make a random, spontaneously generated stimulus a non-random stimulus. An asteroid hitting the earth, for example, would be an accidental, random stimulus to severe environmental change, and those randomly generated environmental changes would be vital but randomly generated stimuli as far as organisms are concerned, and even if those changes persisted for many generations, in an ice age let's say, they would still have to be considered random changes.\n \n Therefore when those changes are labeled \"natural selection\" or 'selective forces', or whatever, they are random, chance-dependent, and so is \"NS\".\n \n The regularity and predictability in EAM does not find itself in the environment, neither in the nature of its changes, (accidental, mechanical, intentional) nor in its duration, per se. Rather the regularity and predictability of EAM is seated in the organism, that is, in it's ability to adapt to random external changes in stimuli with productive, corresponding changes of its own.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n But the degree to which an organism has an ability to dynamically overide this chance corrrspondence is not entirely mechanically pre-determined, but in some case cases can be overridden by psychical ability, rather than simple luck. \n \n This sort of sounds like you want it both ways: an organism must 'have what it takes', but if it doesn't, it can 'override' not having what it takes - but doesn't that mean it did, actually, 'have what it takes'?\n\n \n **\n When we spoke of \"what it takes\" we were referring to two different things--1/ adaptability, and 2/ genetic inheritance. It is my contention that the two are not the same thing; it is yours that they are. I suppose it's my fault for introducing such an equivocal expression. Sorry.\n \n As I see it, genetic inheritance is only part of 'what it takes', because if inheritance were all there was to it, evolution, novelty, origins, would be mechanically impossible. Whatever genes were, that would be what must be. \n \n This was the reason that the neo-darwinists fought Mendelian genetics for decades, until Fisher, Haldane, and Wright got them out of the jam by postulating that since genes were subject to entropy, sometimes that entropic genetic change (i.e., mutation) would, by pure chance, result in a malformation of the phenotype that was somehow an improvement to the biosystem's ability to productively function in a coincidentally and accidentally altered environment. Pure metaphysics, but then, people can believe just about any old story, if that's what they want to hear.\n \n EAM's way out of the difficulty lies in saying that although the genetic system for conserving productive form over generations is very strong, it can sometimes be overidden by an endogenous mutagenic ability based on the proposition that since the genetic system is an intelligence based code, not a chemical accident, that it can sometimes be intelligently re-written, when real need arises and generational development time permits. Thus EAM's volition replaces RMNS's accident as the mechanism of evolutionary change, by diminishing the strength of genetic determinism. And as such, it turns evolution into a dynamic teleological process, as opposed to a passive, directionless and meaningless accidental process.\n \n Need another break.",

   "\n To me it seems much more consistent to say that the organism's genome (as well as other more transient physical factors like health and wellbeing) defines the scope or potential that can be volitionally realised. Would you agree?\n\n \n **\n No.\n \n \n\n Because otherwise there are no rules: there is no meaningful metric that can be applied to changes 'beyond the scope offered by the physical form' in order to include some changes as possible and exclude others as impossible.\n\n \n **\n That objection applies to evolution under any theoretical mechanism. The specificity of function and complexity of operation in current physical forms are always the only limiting factors we can use to project the parameters of viable future changes in complex systems. We know that the more general the function and that the simpler the chemistry and/or engineering involved, the greater the possibility of change. Change in the size of the organism as a whole, or any part of one, without any robust change in function or inherent complexity, is the simplest and therefore the easiest change to accomplish, and the broadest in terms of parameters. \n \n Add to that EAM's principle that changed morphology is a function of changed behaviour as a function of changed environment. If the parameters of a viable environment can be established, and the parameters of behaviours that would be viable if mapped to an environment within those parameters, then projected morphological changes to organisms whose present morphology could map better to such behaviours can also be delimited.\n \n The principle of RMNS simply states that anything is possible, since randomness is unconstrained, and so can produce any form at all, prior to application, after which function arises out of whatever form is available, and is either viably correlated to the local environment, or not, by chance coincidence. EAM says no, not everything is possible, because form arises out of function, and function is tied to goals, and that teleological connection limits the range of organismic options to those that best achieve those intentional ends. So when it comes to your objection, EAM has a solid advantage over RMNS, simply because RMNS is \"open-ended\", but EAM is not.\n \n \n\n I said get on with using the adaptation, not get on with using the genome. The giraffe's longer neck, the bacterium's phage immunity, etc. \n\n \n **\n Using the adaptation afterwards is kind of a given, isn't it? What's your point?\n \n \n\n In both EAM and Darwinism, the genome must be fortuitously amenable to the novel environment.\n\n \n **\n Actually it's the organism that must, to some degree, be amenable to the novel environment to which it is now exposed, because it is the organism that survives, thrives, and reproduces, or not, in that environment; not the bits of acid in its genome. \n \n So yes, an organism, as is, must be fortuitously correlated to some degree with what the randomly altered environment is now, or it will not achieve its primary teleological goals, and will die, regardless of its genes.\n \n The difference between RMNS and EAM is this--RMNS says that coincidentally the genes in the genotype must already map to an organism pre-fitted to the novel environment, by some lucky chance. Pure luck.\n \n EAM says that the organism need only to be sufficiently fitted, by accident of birth, to survive and reproduce, without thriving, or thriving as well as it might, and it will alter itself, epigenetically, by information feedback in its systematics, until eventually its new behaviour and morphology correspond closely enough to the new environmental conditions that it can also thrive in them, or even maximize that state of well-being. A little luck and a lot of intelligence and volition.\n \n \n\n In EAM, the organism must then intelligently find and express the potential adaptive traits offered by its genome. \n\n \n \n **\n No, those offered by itself, including its phenotype.\n \n \n\n In Darwinism, the trait is simply expressed, no questions asked. Actually deriving a benefit from that trait might be straightforward and automatic (phage immunity) or require a change of behaviour (arrived at heuristically or consciously), or an intelligent/heuristic migration. The latter two options mean that in higher forms of life a greater range of variant traits can actually be leveraged to confer an advantage, again refuting your claim that Darwinian evolution leaves no room for organismic-level influence.\n\n \n **\n The last sentence here contradicts the first.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n Quote:\n You can't have it both ways. If the actual adaptive benefit to the yeast itself, (as opposed to some particular bit of molecular stuff called an allele), then the yeast cells proper had to have been under environmental stimulus, that is, maladapted to point where there ability to survive, thrive and reproduce was noticeably compromised. There is no mention of that, so let us assume that there was absolutely no difference, behaviourally, morphologically, and numerically in the yeast organisms themselves, compared prior to and post allelic mutation. In my book then, no evolution took place. \n \n Dear me, no! The paper describes a considerable numerical increase in yeast organisms post mutation, and goes into detail explaining the mechanics of this increase. The essentials are as follows: the medium in the chemostat is continuously refreshed, with new medium being added and old medium (including the yeast cells within it) washed out at a constant rate. The stable population density attained by yeast within the chemostat, therefore, is a function of both how rapidly they can reproduce in that particular medium and how fast the medium is being diluted. In the particular medium used in the experiment, the limiting factors on the reproductive rate of the yeast were the concentration of a particular nutrilite and the PH level of the medium. In their words:\n \n Quote:\n Selection therefore favored mutations increasing the rate at which acid phosphatase catalyzed the hydrolysis of very low concentrations of\n P-glycerophosphate under the adverse pH condition pertaining, and also favored mutations increasing the efficiency of orthophosphate metabolism. \n \n The first adaptive mutation increased the reproductive rate of those cells inheriting the mutation by 25%, subsequently displacing the unmutated cells and effecting an increase in stable cell density from 4.1*10^6 to 6.0*10^6 cells / ml. That's almost a 50% increase. The second adaptive mutation, occurring 220 generations later within a population almost exclusively composed of first-mutants, further increased the reproductive rate, and thus cell density from 6.0 * 10^6 to 11.0 * 10^6 cells / ml, a further improvement of 83%.\n \n I don't want it 'both ways'. This experiment shows spontaneous adaptation occurring after hundreds of generations in a chemically stable environment, exactly what EAM says can't happen.\n\n \n **\n No, it does not show any such thing. It shows yeast cells introduced into an artificial environment to which they were maladapted. After a great number of maladapted generations the yeasts underwent adaptive mutations, twice, which increased their ability to survive thrive and reproduce, once by 50%, the second by 83%. Just as EAM predicts.\n \n We are not talking perfectly adapted organisms to begin with, although we may be talking sufficiently adapted organisms to end with. IAC, the organismic need for mutation preceded the actual mutation, twice. The only thing \"random\" mutation has going for it, opposed to prima facie induced mutation, is the number of generations betwenn first exposure and mutarion, and mutatiopn and second mutation. There is no reason to believe that this temporal span arose from randomness and not the complexity of thew mutation. One way to get a better idea would be to take the total number of genetic mutations randomly available to the yeast genome per generation, i.e., the known normal mutation rate of that genome, multiply by the number of yeast cells held in the apparatus, and the number of generations. If the odds against mutation one are a 'gazillion' to one, but the mutation occured at one and a half 'gazillion' cell/generations, you've got evidence for your position. Inconclusive but supportive. If the mutation occurred in less than a 'gazillion' cell/generations, then that supportive circumstantial evidence goes to EAM. \n \n \n\n I don't really understand what you mean by adaptation being of benefit 'to an allele'. The only mechanism by which an allele can increase in frequency in a population is if organisms possessing that allele enjoy a superior reproductive rate; how else did you think the mutant strain displaced the non-mutant strain?\n\n \n **\n I simply repeated what you said. You said that the yeasts were perfectly adapted. That being true, they would have been at maximum 'fitness' from start to finish, meaning at reproductive capacity given the amount of food fed them. In that case the number of organisms would not have increased as the number of mutated alleles in the population did. It was not for me to say whether you theory allows for that or not.\n \n Now it turns out that you misled me. The yeasts were never adapted to their novel artificial environment, despite not dying out but just hanging in, for a long time. That is, they did not survive, thrive and reproduce to their best adavantage until after experiencing two mutations specifically targeted at increasing the efficiency with which they could metabolize their novel, artificially introduced food source. That's EAM all over the place.\n \n Does RM posit an actual phyical cause for those two mutations, beyond the metaphysical, \"They just 'happened', that's all.\"?\n \n \n\n Is that why you've been so down on NS? You think that because it refers to allele frequencies that it's somehow unrelated to the fortunes of the organisms?\n\n \n **\n No. My objection to NS is that it maintains that the fortunes of organisms are predetermined by genetic molecules that arose by accident, spontaneously.\n \n \n\n Hell no; the differential success of the organisms is what drives the changing allele frequencies!\n\n \n **\n That was, and now is again, my understanding, after being temporarilly derailed by tour misdirection that the yeasts, were adapted, i.e., at peak reproductive capacity given their artificial circumstances, when in fact that was not at all the case.\n \n \n\n There is of course no single 'natural habitat' for yeast, so a comparison with one is not really feasible. However, all environments in which yeast can survive have one factor or another limiting their reproduction (obviously, otherwise we'd all be hip-deep in yeast). What was constructed in that test was a stable environment where the actual limiting factor was known in advance: a particular nutrilite and a particular PH number. Undoubtedly many other mutations occurred during the experiment, but the point of having a known limiting factor is that mutations affecting other aspects of the yeast's metabolism simply could not yield increased reproductive rates (since the known limiting factor would still apply). Those other mutations would in that environment either be neutral or harmful (introducing a new, lower limiting factor unique to that mutant), and would thus not displace their peers. Only mutations pertaining to the limiting factor would yield improved reproduction. There is a followup paper, where the mutant genes are actually sequenced, that goes into even greater detail.\n\n \n **\n Well and good, but as I have no degree in genetics nor in statistical math, the actual details are of no interest to me.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n After being removed from the phage the colonies went back to their normal state of carrying only a few resistant cells. \n \n Well, yes; if the resistant mutation was beneficial in all circumstances it would have inevitably displaced non-mutants long before the phage was applied. In the absence of phage, therefore, revertants enjoy a reproductive advantage and will once again reassert numerical superiority.\n\n \n **\n Meaning phage resistance is costly, and therefore constrained by the colony.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The most probable explanation is that once the colonies/culture attained a certain stage in development/size they simply reverted to their standard practice of carrying a few phage resistant cells among their number. After exposure to the phage those cells survived and reproduced, becoming the only survivors. \n \n You're exactly right, though not in the way you want to be. The 'standard practice of carrying a few phage resistant cells' does not imply bacterial memory of prior phage exposure, or any kind of intelligent planning. It is an inevitable consequence of there being very large numbers of bacteria in relation to the chances of specific random mutations and reversions occurring.\n\n \n **\n I really have very little use for \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\". You darwinists posit three contrary principles--\n A/Beneficial mutations are created by spontaneous, anomalous accident, and then snuggle into the genome for thousands of generations against the time when their expression will provide, coincidentally, an adaptive benefit.\n B/In bacteria, beneficial mutations that have proven their adaptive benefit will be erased by ensuing mutations unless they are constantly re-introduced by even later accidental mutations, in ping-pong fashion, despite the odds against getting the mutation at all by random accident.\n C/ \"Natural Selection\", as an external agency, will erase any expressed trait in an organism that it can, prevented only by that trait's resistance to whatever local agent 'natural selection' stands for at that time.\n Meaning that phage resistance will not disappear simply because no phage [i.e., no natural selection], is present. Resistance has to be driven out by an entropic genetic accident that specifically targets a certain allele. Odds against that be damned, too.\n \n These three assertions of darwinism can't all be the case, speaking logically.\n \n \n\n A bacterial colony of billions is absolutely fizzing with mutations, there being just so damn many bacteria to experience them.\n\n \n **\n Yes, but where's the proof that those mutations are taking place by entropic accident only? HGT alone is enough to show that that is not the case. There is one heck of a lot of communicated genetic information going back and forth like backyard gossip, inter and intra-colonially.\n \n \n\n Even if a particular mutation is, in one environment, slightly detrimental, in a sufficiently large colony there will almost always be a few possessors of said mutation kicking about, the actual proportion being determined by a) the chances of that mutation occurring in a bacterium, b) the differential reproductive rate of bacteria possessing that mutation, and c) the chances of that mutation being reverted. It's practically impossible for a particular allele to ever drift to fixation or extinction when there are billions upon billions of organisms and the chances of a mutation occurring at that locus is a comparatively likely 1 in 100,000,000. It's like the world's hardest game of whack-a-mole.\n\n \n **\n Which means that whacking a particular mole at the exact time that it needs whacking is hardly a matter of chance, particularly when the wacking and un-wacking happen over and over and over again.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n Pre-phage, then, the large colony inevitably possessed a stable but small number of resistant bacteria - small because of the small chance of a non-mutant experiencing that particular mutation and because of the slight disadvantage it conferred in the absense of phage.\n\n \n **\n Granted that phage resistance is in some way costly to maintain, that still does not explain why numbers should decrease over all, unless you can show \n that resistant cells do not survive long enough to reproduce maximally. But they do so when a phage is present, so why not when the phage is not present, if an externally acting agent is what is meant by 'natural selection'? Without phage there is no externally acting agent to 'select' between resistant and non-resistant cells. Your only explanation for the rapid decrease in the comparitive number of resistant cells is the standard darwinian metaphysical retreat to the notion of spontaneous generation, or spontaneous erasure, of traits by random genetic mutation. Eam says that the colony regulates and organises itself so as not to wasdte resources when they are not immediately needed, but to spare something against emergency.\n \n \n\n In the presence of phage, they were the only survivors; their slight disadvantage was wiped out and they became the backbone, so to speak, of the colony. However, there would still have been revertants cropping up - and dying, obviously - because there's a small but finite chance of that happening. Remove the phage, and that tiny, tiny number of revertants will eventually predominate once more on the basis of their greater fitness in a phage-free environment.\n\n \n **\n Same old tautology. Which cells are the fittest? The most numerous ones. Why are they the most numerous? Because they are the fittest.\n \n \n\n None of this requires intent on the part of the colony, or a memory of prior phage exposure. \n\n \n **\n No, but it could do with a large dollop of logical thinking.\n \n \n\n It just requires sufficient cell-division events for that particular random mutation to have a chance to arise \n\n \n **\n Another appeal to \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\". The belief that if the goat gets to butt the mountain 'enough' times, the mountain will crumble into dust. Trouble is, nobody stipulates in adavance, with any degree of exactitude, just what 'enough' means. It's simply a nebulous statement of blind faith.\n \n \n\n - and that's exactly what the fluctuation test showed: first, that the number of cell division events prior to phage exposure was linked to the chances of there being resistant bacteria present when phage was applied, and second that the mutation occurred (if at all) at random times in growing colonies.\n\n \n **\n No, it did not. Where are you getting this from?!?!\n \n \n\n Secondly, the burden of proof is upon your conjecture of an invisible mechanism; the default assumption is that this mutation, like all the others going on in that population, was undirected and random.\n\n \n **\n Like heck the burden of proof lies on anyone but those who make assertions based on assumptions they make in view of this experiment. Above you make two such assumptions-- \"first, that the number of cell division events prior to phage exposure was linked to the chances of there being resistant bacteria present when phage was applied, and second that the mutation occurred (if at all) at random times in growing colonies.\" The onus is on you to provide empirical evidence validating your assumptions, not on anyone else to disprove what you have not validated to begin with.\n \n \n\n Here we have a mutation that occurs in the absence of stimulus,\n\n \n **\n That should read, \"in the absence of an external stimulus\". There is no reason to believe that no internal stimulus exists and is not in operation. But the fact that normally bacterial colonies carry resistant cells and the fact that these do not because they were artificially removed, suggests that internal stimulus is probably the cause of the mutation.\n \n \n\n after a random (but large) number of cell divisions starting with a single non-resistant bacterium. We have no evidence to support the idea of prior phage exposure being 'remembered' by that single seed bacterium - nowhere for that memory (along with the infinity of others that would be required to explain all the other supposedly planned and preemptive adaptive mutations large colonies exhibit) to reside. There's nothing distinctive or special about the actual genetic mutation itself. Random mutation - a known phenomenon - fits all the facts; there's absolutely nothing to indicate it was uniquely intelligently driven.\n\n \n **\n There is nothing to indicate that it was a lucky accident. The fact that e.coli. colonies tend naturally to contain some phage resistant cells is all the evidence necessary to the proposition that it is an intentional developmental organismic immune response.\n \n \n\n What's interesting is that while you used to say the resistance was an intelligent response, now you're saying it was an intelligent pre-emption, further embellishing EAM. What happened to 'informationally available' and 'chronic stimulus'? What happened to behaviour, morphology, epigenetic inheritance, and all the other absolutely essential stages by which EAM progressed? Why do I get the feeling that this latest addition to EAM's arsenal is just another 'must have been like that because EAM is true' excuse?\n\n \n \n **\n I do not know if this is the first time you've heard me speak of revertant mutations and immune responses and acquired immunity and inherited immune responses, but they have all been a part of the EAM hypothesis of self-organized, self-directed self-maintainance in autopoietic biosystems for the past several years, when I was a regular contributor to the ARN discussion board. EAM is not limited to primary exposure to stimuli. It also involves 'remembered' responses, be they instinctual or automatized.\n There is nothing new to EAM here, although it may be new to you.

There is no reason to believe that this temporal span arose from randomness and not the complexity of thew mutation\n\n \n Mutation rates vary at different loci, but a typical rate is something like 1 in 10^6 or 1 in 10^11 cell divisions. Here we're looking at 1.8*10^14 cell divisions for the first adaptive mutation and 2.2*10^14 cell divisions for the second. You can probably add a zero to the mutation rate to factor in the chance of a first-generation mutant or its immediate offspring not surviving to reproduce.\n \n \nOne way to get a better idea would be to take the total number of genetic mutations randomly available to the yeast genome per generation, i.e., the known normal mutation rate of that genome, multiply by the number of yeast cells held in the apparatus, and the number of generations.

You said that the yeasts were perfectly adapted.\n\n I'm sorry if that's the impression you got, but if you look back you'll see that this subject originated as an illustration of why your proposed falsification test for EAM, which required an 'already adapted' organism to spontaneously improve, was invalid. I didn't say the yeasts were perfectly adapted, I said that any improvement would demonstrate they were not previously perfectly adapted, thus making it logically impossible for EAM to be falsified in that manner - ergo, that falsification test is not a valid one.\n \n \nNow it turns out that you misled me.\n\n Such was not my intention; any misapprehension that has occurred is more likely down to faulty recall and the sheer volume of subject matter we're covering here.\n \nThe yeasts were never adapted to their novel artificial environment, despite not dying out but just hanging in, for a long time. That is, they did not survive, thrive and reproduce to their best adavantage until after experiencing two mutations specifically targeted at increasing the efficiency with which they could metabolize their novel, artificially introduced food source. That's EAM all over the place.\n\n It's much more like RM+NS all over the place, given how long it took. RM+NS actually predicts that sort of span of time for novel adaptive mutations. EAM merely shrugs and apologises for them. It 'must have been a tough assignment'.\n \nDoes RM posit an actual phyical cause for those two mutations, beyond the metaphysical, \"They just 'happened', that's all.\"?\n\n There are several known possible causes.\n \n \nNo. My objection to NS is that it maintains that the fortunes of organisms are predetermined by genetic molecules that arose by accident, spontaneously.\n\n No more so than EAM acknowledges that the fortunes of organisms are predetermined by random environmental stimuli, to which they may or may not be fortuitously adaptible. In other words, before you get excited, they are an influencing factor, but they are not the whole story.\n \nWell and good, but as I have no degree in genetics nor in statistical math, the actual details are of no interest to me.\n\n That's... pretty disappointing. You don't care about statistical math, yet you presume to be able to clearly distinguish between randomly occurring and directed mutations?\n \nMeaning phage resistance is costly, and therefore constrained by the colony.\n\n According to your philosophy, sure. But the point is, we don't need the colony to be clever for it to exhibit this behaviour, so observing this behaviour is no evidence at all that the colony is clever.\n \nI really have very little use for \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\".\n\n Ignorance of statistical principles does not make them any less valid. If a particular mutation occurs at a particular locus, at random, once every 100,000,000 cell divisions, and the population consists of 1,000,000,000 bacteria reproducing once every 20 minutes or so, the expected number of bacteria appearing with that trait each generation is 10. In a phage-free environment the malformed receptor is slightly detrimental to the bacterium, so it will remain in the minority purely based on differential reproductive rates. It's also possible for the mutation to be randomly reversed, again at a rate of the order of 1 in 100,000,000 or so, but when there aren't many bacteria with the mutation, that's obviously not going to happen very often.\n However, in the presence of phage, the mutants are the only survivors. They form a new colony of millions, then billions, and now the 1 in 100,000,000 revertant rate is no obstacle. When phage is removed the process reverses itself, with the revertants' superior fitness allowing them to displace the mutants.\n \n It does not require intelligence.\n \n \nYou darwinists posit three contrary principles--\n\n If you call me 'you darwinists' again I shall get very upset. It's particularly galling when you follow up an insulting generalisation with an almost completely innaccurate summation of what 'us darwinists' actually think.\n \nA/Beneficial mutations are created by spontaneous, anomalous accident, and then snuggle into the genome for thousands of generations against the time when their expression will provide, coincidentally, an adaptive benefit.\n\n Inaccurate. It may take many generations for a variant to encounter an environment to which it is adaptive, or it might, as in the case of the yeast experiment, occur within just such an environment. It might never happen - the lineage carrying a particular trait might die out before it ever gets the chance to be beneficial.\n \nIn bacteria, beneficial mutations that have proven their adaptive benefit will be erased by ensuing mutations unless they are constantly re-introduced by even later accidental mutations, in ping-pong fashion, despite the odds against getting the mutation at all by random accident.\n\n Again, you're missing huge chunks out of this. Beneficial mutations (in the context of bacteria in a lab) means beneficial in the current environment. So long as they're beneficial, the relatively low revertant rate for a mutation will be overwhelmed by the differential reproductive rate. EG: revertant e-coli would instantly be killed by the phage they're steeped in, and thus not compete with the mutants. Once the phage is removed, the resistant mutation is no longer beneficial. Compared to the occasional revertants, the mutants are at a reproductive disadvantage, and will be gradually numerically displaced.\n \n You say 'despite the odds', but the odds are well within the parameters of likelihood when you're talking about billions of cell divisions per hour.\n \nC/ \"Natural Selection\", as an external agency, will erase any expressed trait in an organism that it can, prevented only by that trait's resistance to whatever local agent 'natural selection' stands for at that time.\n\n Er, no. It might impose constraints, or it might offer new opportunities that allow some to flourish to an even greater extent. Just like EAM: coincidental fitness.\n \nMeaning that phage resistance will not disappear simply because no phage [i.e., no natural selection], is present. Resistance has to be driven out by an entropic genetic accident that specifically targets a certain allele. Odds against that be damned, too.\n\n Wrong, wrong, wrong. Phage resistance abates numerically because it carries a relative reproductive penalty in the absence of phage.\n \nThese three assertions of darwinism can't all be the case, speaking logically.\n\n Good job darwnism doesn't make those assertions then :)\n \n \nYes, but where's the proof that those mutations are taking place by entropic accident only?\n\n Conformation of the observed results to statistical predictions based upon the assumption of random mutation. You know: you tentatively assume your hypothesis, make predictions based upon it, then compare the results with observations. The scientific method.\n \n Right now, I'm not even trying to prove that all mutations occur at random. I'm just trying to get past this stubborn insistence of yours that random mutations cannot be adaptive. Whenever I challenge that, you dismiss my argument as 'metaphysical'. Well, if it's metaphysical reasoning to say that random mutation can produce adaptive mutations, it's equally metaphysical to assert the contrapositive. So unless you've got a better rebuttal, I suggest we accept the possibility and move on.\n \n \nWhich means that whacking a particular mole at the exact time that it needs whacking is hardly a matter of chance, particularly when the wacking and un-wacking happen over and over and over again.\n\n Well, actually the 'whack-a-mole' reference was to the influence of NS failing to entirely eliminate phage resistance in a phage-free environment - or even revertant phage susceptibility in a phage-saturated environment. Despite the latter resulting in immediate death - pretty much as NS as you can get - a billion resistant e-coli will still probably randomly throw up ten revertants every 20 minutes or so. And if the phage is removed, those handful of revertants will stop dying and begin to out-multiply their peers, and soon enough dominate the available resources once again. No intelligence or planning required.\n \nGranted that phage resistance is in some way costly to maintain, that still does not explain why numbers should decrease over all, unless you can show\n that resistant cells do not survive long enough to reproduce maximally. But they do so when a phage is present, so why not when the phage is not present, if an externally acting agent is what is meant by 'natural selection'? Without phage there is no externally acting agent to 'select' between resistant and non-resistant cells.\n\n Like I said, wrong. The malformation reduces their reproductive efficiency - they consume resources more slowly and divide less often. That opens the door to the revertants.\n \nSame old tautology. Which cells are the fittest? The most numerous ones. Why are they the most numerous? Because they are the fittest.\n\n Strictly speaking, that's not a tautology. It would be if the only way to determine the fittest was by counting them, but it isn't: there's a clear and obvious physical reason why the resistant cells multiply better in the presence of phage. What you're describing is a truthful statement that just happens to not tell the whole story.\n \nNo, but it could do with a large dollop of logical thinking.\n\n I quite agree; maybe then you'll stop getting it wrong all the time ;)\n \nAnother appeal to \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\". The belief that if the goat gets to butt the mountain 'enough' times, the mountain will crumble into dust.\n\n Who'd have thought it? The man with no interest in understanding statistics makes a really terrible analogy about their application :)\n \nTrouble is, nobody stipulates in adavance, with any degree of exactitude, just what 'enough' means.\n\n Try reading over the information above again.\n \nand that's exactly what the fluctuation test showed: first, that the number of cell division events prior to phage exposure was linked to the chances of there being resistant bacteria present when phage was applied, and second that the mutation occurred (if at all) at random times in growing colonies.\n \n No, it did not. Where are you getting this from?!?!\n\n Oh for crying out loud. Just brush up on your statistics and read the damn paper already. Do I really have to go through this again?\n \n 1. Large colony cultured from single, non-resistant bacterium. Several samples taken, all show similar numbers of surviving bacteria, indicating an even, very sparse distribution of resistant cells.\n 2. Same large colony, tiny samples (therefore very, very unlikely to contain a resistant cell to start with), cultured to the same size as samples in 1, then exposed to phage. Distribution of survivors completely different: several colonies show no survivors, one or two show very large numbers of survivors.\n \n Darwinian prediction is in accordance with results of 1: large colony with very many cell divisions = evenly distributed random resistance.\n Darwinian prediction also in accordance with results of 2: if mutation occurs at random during cell division and is subsequently inherited, then the number of resistant cells found will depend upon when and if that mutation occurs between the tiny sample being taken and the cultured colony being exposed to phage. No mutation (likely) = no survivors. Mutation relatively early in colony growth (less likely) = jackpot; lots of survivors.\n \n EAM prediction in both cases: none; whatever happens 'must have been for some reason'.\n \nThat should read, \"in the absence of an external stimulus\". There is no reason to believe that no internal stimulus exists and is not in operation. But the fact that normally bacterial colonies carry resistant cells and the fact that these do not because they were artificially removed, suggests that internal stimulus is probably the cause of the mutation.\n\n Read the paper. The resistant cells were not artificially removed. After billions of cell divisions, the large colony, which began as a single non-resistant bacterium, contained a small minority of the resistant strain. After a smaller number of cell divisions, the tiny samples had either no such resistant bacteria or a jackpot of them (which would, if the sample was allowed to grow to billions, be smoothed out by differential reproductive rates to the same low even distribution as the first large colony), indicating that the mutation occurs at random, at a rate consistent with it happening at most once in the number of cell divisions given to the tiny samples before plating.\n \nThe fact that e.coli. colonies tend naturally to contain some phage resistant cells is all the evidence necessary to the proposition that it is an intentional developmental organismic immune response.\n\n In your fondest dreams :) \"It happens\" is not the same as \"It happens just so\". The pattern of this mutation occurring is exactly statistically consistent with the simplest explanation: random mutation, a known mechanism. For us to infer any other mechanism we need something random mutation cannot explain - and this ain't it.",

   "From what I have read, WW's argumentation comes down to one, single, central proposition; that he cannot accept/believe that individual mutations of any given codon (four letter base pair sequence) can be random, or undirected. I hope to go on to show that WW is mistaken in his usage of the terms 'random' or 'undirected' or any other terminology he cares to use; even if WW has not used these exact words, from what I have read this is what is implied. There is 'random' in the classical sense of total disorganisation, and there is 'random' in the quantum sense of what actually happens in the quantum realm.\n \n Various arguments have been made as to how adaptations take place, and the point of argument rests on exactly how a change in alleles actually happens in the first place. We are all aware that the standard biological definition of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory is \"a change in allele frequency in a population over time\". Evolutionary theory then implies from this a statistical differential in reproductive rates, which is totally logical, as long as the putative mutations take place in the way that the theory suggests: individual offspring experience mutations, and on the scale of population (compared to individual) the mutations which are beneficial confer a slight increase in a factor which we can call \"likelihood to successfully reproduce\". \n \n One mutation may (probably will not) achieve this in terms of a black/white, offspring/no offspring scenario. Multiple mutations across a population will, according to the theory, produce many versions of such a non-specific scenario. Millions of such differentiations, across the spatial dimension of a population, and the temporal dimension of hundreds, thousands or even millions of generations will produce multiple survival scenarios and multiple extinction scenarios. \n \n However, the point of contention seems to be that WW takes issue with the mechanism behind a change of allele(s) within an individual line of descent; that is, what gives rise to the individual, random mutations which cause, en masse, a population to have enough variation of alleles for NS to be able to work upon them?\n \n The RM/NS argument basically says that changes to the genetic structure happen when a particular segment of DNA is reproduced imperfectly.\n \n WW's problem (as I interpret it) seems to be that the idea of this imperfect reproduction is irreconcilable with what he believes is the 'mechanistic' worldview of those people whom some colloquially term 'evolutionists'.\n \n 'Mechanism', as WW has already explained, is the idea that all natural phenomena can be explained by deterministic physical causes. That is, that nothing exists outside basic 'mechanical' systems which are deterministic and, given a scenario with certain consistent parameters, will perfrom the same function every single time. If one constrains oneself to this viewpoint, one must accept that imperfect DNA reproduction cannot take place on the scale necessary to allow for a range of mutation wide enough for NS to operate upon a population.\n \n For starters, I claim that this 'mechanistic' viewpoint as termed in a specific, philosophical way, does not apply to anyone well-versed in modern science. It certainly does not apply to me, and I am merely a novice. Determinism has been shown to be (while applicable on the macro-level) not applicable on the level of quantum physics, where genuine randomness does actually happen. \n \n A great example is radioactive decay: we can say with certainty that, at a certain time, a radioactive isotope will have decayed by a certain amount, but we can never (and according to the theory, never really means never) say exactly when said isotope will emit a radioactive particle; we can only say that there is a probability after a certain time, that the isotope will have emitted said particle, and a after another certain amount of time (this duration can only be obtained experimentally) that the isotope will definitely have emitted said particle.\n \n How does this apply to biology? First of all, all notions of 'vitality' aside, we know that animate material is composed of exactly the same 'bits of stuff' (to use WW's terminology) as inamnimate material; protons, neutrons and electrons. We also know that in quantum-mechanical experiments with inanimate material that the emittance of subatomic particles can only be specified with probablilities, not with certainties. \n \n Micro-chemistry (and micro-biology) are controlled entirely by the electromagnetic force. (I should point out here that any assertion that biology is anything but complex chemistry has absolutely no sound basis whatsoever. Biology is just a word which is used to seperate organic chemistry from inorganic chemistry, which is just chemistry.)\n \n The perfect example of how micro-biology is dominated by the electromagnetic force is the way our muscles work. A protein called myosin moves muscles. Myosin is a very big protein made up of several thousand amino acids, which are organised in multiples as proteins. The interactions of the amino acids which construct the protein control the rigid, folded structure of the protein, forcing it to adopt a characteristic 3D shape that is key to its function. \n \n Myosin is a globular head connected to a long tail by a flexible hinge region. The flexing of this hinge provides the energy for muscle contraction. Myosin exists alongside another protein called actin, which is relatively rigid. During muscle contraction, the myosin hinge region goes through cycles of flexing and relaxation that moves the globular head in 10 nanometre steps against the actin; thousands of myosin molecules moving like this contract the muscle fibre. \n \n OK, it gets quite technical now, but I will try to keep it simple:\n \n Myosin's ability to do what is does rests on its ability to promote a certain reaction, a reaction between an adenosine triphosophate (ATP) molecule and water. This reaction (called hydrolysis) breaks ATP into two pieces and captures some of its energy to drive myosin's flex/relax cycle. Such a reaction involves the interaction of electrons and specifically the movement of a single proton - subatomic particles. \n \n How the reaction works is also quite technical, but again I will try to keep it simple (it is hard to explain without an illustration): When stimulated to do so by a nerve impulse the ATP molecule 'moves' (it has no choice due to its chemical nature) into the 'hinge' region of the myosin molecule. The electrons and protons in ATP attract certain charged regions in myosin, closing the hinge and altering the shape of the myosin molecule. This shape change breaks (due to well-understood chemical processes, founded on relative polarities) the interaction between myosin and actin. This moves the myosin relative to the actin.\n \n The shape change also moves a water molecule (already bonded to the myosin) 'onto' ATP which breaks a specific phosphate bond on ATP and bisects it into ADP and phosphate, which necessitates the 'firing' of a single proton out of the ATP molecule. The change in the polarity of the now 'broken' ATP molecule (due to the loss of the positively-charged proton) has two cascading effects; the ADP and phosphate are ejected from the hinge region, and myosin thus regains its original shape; able to bind to actin, moving the myosin again; repeated reactions of this type cause myosin to work as a molecular ratchet, moving your muscle fibres by moving the myosin relative to the actin.\n \n Still with me?\n \n OK, here's the BUT. BUT, due to quantum mechanical effects (which, as admitted by physicists, no one really understands), this does not always happen. When you move a muscle, the vast majority of actin/myosin/ATP systems behave this way, but some don't. Why? Well, the only way we can explain it at the present time is that there is only a certain probability that the various subatomic particles which are indicative of the charge of the molecules involved will do what they are 'supposed' to do. This is a very crappy way of putting it but it is the best I can do.\n \n OK, so what's my point? My point is twofold:\n \n 1) The mechanisms which underly the replication of DNA via messenger RNA hinge upon similar microscopic functions; a mistranscribed portion of the genetic code is due to a genuinely random quantum-mechanical effect which results in the enzmes involved not behaving as they 'should' simply because they 'just didn't'. Most do, some don't. So, WW's percieved problem with the 'random' nature of allele changes is actually irrelevant from the point of view of quantum mechanics. \n \n 2) Assertions that WW has made that biology is 'special' or somehow 'more than the sum of its parts' wrt chemisrty and physics is, from the point of view of the quantum mechanist, simply wrong. The theories of physics help explain the most basic interactions of matter in our universe. The theories of chemistry help explain more complex interactions, but sometimes we must recourse to physics to help explain inconsistencies. Same with biological inconsistencies. These inconsistencies always revolve around quantum-mechanical processes which are 'random' by nature. \n \n I hope this has all made sense, it is hard to explain the quantum-mechanical nature of the biological reactions which have been studied at this level of detail, without posting several pages of detailed technical information.\n \n Life and evolution are quantum-mechanical phenomena with classical consequences.",

   "\n I'm preparing a condensed response to the earlier posts too, but I thought you might want to review this part first:\n \n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n No, it does not show any such thing. It shows yeast cells introduced into an artificial environment to which they were maladapted. \n \n No, it shows yeast cells in which the specific limiting reproductive factor - of which there will always be one, in every possible environment - was known.\n\n \n **\n Your \"limiting factor\" is my \"maladaptation\", since according to your theory, any \"limiting factor\", (meaning \"limited reproduction\", aka, \"limited fitness\"), is \"Natural Selection\", as you employ it in debate. The difference being that in EAM the 'limiting factor/maladaptation' stimulates the organism to internally generate an adaptive response, while your RMNS defines the 'limiting factor/natural selection' as that which culls the 'less fortunate' organisms; (i.e., those that did not, thanks to a lucky accident, obtain an adaptive mutation from the fickle finger of fate). In the case of your artificial experiment, the apparatus helped, or was an actual part of your \"NS\", in that by continually 'flushing' the population, the lucky mutants, who were re-populating faster than the unlucky non-mutants, would necessarily end by being vastly more common within the artificial apparatus environment, at which point they would become, 'ex post facto', the 'fittest'. \n \n Simply pointing out that truly adaptive mutations often require many generations of chronic stimulus to acquire, simply because they require making a vital change to a complex information sequence, does not mean that they happen by chance. Bacteria take a long time to learn how to digest nylon or to resist a new antibiotic. Assuming that because such accomplishments take time, and are not produced in a magical 'poof' of spontaneous generation, does not even suggest random accident. As said so many times, the onus is on you to demonstrate that the mutation is as accidental as you say it was. If you cannot do that empirically, by actually identifying the randomly occuring mutagen responsible, then you must at least do it statistically. That is, in terms of probability, by showing mathematically, and not vaguely, that the sum of collective mutations, (using the standard mutation rate of yeasts generally, and not the enhanced rate of adaptive mutation experienced by micro-organisms under environmental stimuli, eg., stress), is lower than the mathematical sum arrived at by probalitity calculations from the extent of their genome versus accident at specified locations on it.\n \n I think that you will find that if you do the math, (I cannot, or I would), that the chance of one favourable mutation, let alone two consecutive adaptive mutations, happening by pure stochastic chance, would require more time than this solar system has been in existence. Thus reasonably removing pure chance from scientific consideration, as mathematically impossible.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n After a great number of maladapted generations the yeasts underwent adaptive mutations, twice, which increased their ability to survive thrive and reproduce, once by 50%, the second by 83%. Just as EAM predicts. \n \n No; just as RM+NS predicts and EAM is designed to accommodate. EAM hasn't actually predicted anything yet so far as I'm aware.\n\n \n **\n Since when has RMNS ever \"predicted\" an adaptive mutation? Did these experimenters \"predict\" that what actually did happen, would happen? I didn't read that, but if they did, please tell me on what regularity in stochastic, accidental, random, coincidental to organismic adaptedness genetic mutation, they based prediction? Or did they say, \"We just knew they'd get lucky, and they did!!\"? That's gambling on luck, not predicting on evidence.\n \n EAM would predict that in such a maladapted situation, micro-organisms would attempt, and eventually succeed, in refiguring themselves so as to become more adapted to their novel circumstances. That they would begin their efforts by adaptively speeding up their normal mutation rate, internally, and using biofeedback information from their digestive systems to narrow the biochemical search to a good-better-best heuristic search for a way to better metabolize the particular nutrients available to them. And that's exactly what they did. Not just in this instance, but in countless others.\n \n And that's an awful lot of regularity to attribute to sheer chance.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The only thing \"random\" mutation has going for it, opposed to prima facie induced mutation, is the number of generations between first exposure and mutation, and mutation and second mutation. There is no reason to believe that this temporal span arose from randomness and not the complexity of the mutation \n \n \n Mutation rates vary at different loci, but a typical rate is something like 1 in 10^6 or 1 in 10^11 cell divisions. Here we're looking at 1.8*10^14 cell divisions for the first adaptive mutation and 2.2*10^14 cell divisions for the second. You can probably add a zero to the mutation rate to factor in the chance of a first-generation mutant or its immediate offspring not surviving to reproduce.\n\n \n **\n So how do these great big numbers compare to the great big number arrived at from the probability of the specific mtation occuring accidentally, by pure chance, in the yeasts total number of genomic possibilities? The fact that the sum of all mutations, including repeats, is large, counts for nothing towards spontaneous generation unless it is significantly higher, statistically speaking, than the also large total number of mutations, including ineffectual repeats, required by probability theory to accomplish that particular mutation within the total genetic contents of that genotype.\n \n If your Great Big Number of total mutations (with repeats) is significantly lower than that required by probability theory for that particular mutation to occur by chance alone, then your random accident loses, and EAM's teleology wins. \n \n \n\n It's much more like RM+NS all over the place, given how long it took. RM+NS actually predicts that sort of span of time for novel adaptive mutations. EAM merely shrugs and apologises for them. It 'must have been a tough assignment'. \n\n \n **\n This assertion has no validity until you, or someone else with the educational expertise, actually does the probability math I described (as best I could, as a non-professional), above.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Does RM posit an actual phyical cause for those two mutations, beyond the metaphysical, \"They just 'happened', that's all.\"? \n \n There are several known possible causes.\n\n \n **\n Meaning there are several hypothetical causes, but no actual physical cause identified.

You don't care about statistical math, yet you presume to be able to clearly distinguish between randomly occurring and directed mutations?\n\n \n **\n Come on now! I don't presume to be able to do anything, except to reason logically and to be able to draw reasonable inferences from scientific observations of fact, as I am made aware of them. I have never claimed a degree in genetics or mathematics, or even statistics. Nor have I ever submitted to the presumption of some posters that without those particular academic credentials I, and others, have no right to an opinion on evolutionary biology. I have said again and again that I cannot follow the details and particulars of some arcane study in genetics, statistics, or probability theory, but why should I have to? I don't know how to ski-jump, and have neither any experience of it nor any ambition to learn, but I am well-aware of what it's about, and that is all I need to critique, as a spectator, any given ski-jumper's performance. The same goes for your genetics, statistics, and probability links.\n \n OTH, you who claim that expertise, and claim that that expertise enables you to make scientific assertions, are beholden to provide the supporting evidence from that expertise you claim.\n You have not done so in this instance. All you've done is show a great many generations and a great many mutations of some kind or other. You then claim that the two advantageous mutations arose by chance, without showing how many different mutations, (allowing for repeats either by subtracting them from total mutations realized, or adding them to total mutations required by probability), are required in order to establish a significantly high probability that the two adaptive mutations occurred by chance.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Meaning phage resistance is costly, and therefore constrained by the colony. \n \n According to your philosophy, sure. But the point is, we don't need the colony to be clever for it to exhibit this behaviour, so observing this behaviour is no evidence at all that the colony is clever.\n\n \n **\n Of course you require the colony to be 'clever', or at minimum, self-aware and self-organizing. Something no regular, inanimate bit of stuff, nor even simple mechanical systems, can do. Just try to get a bowl of vegetable soup to regulate and organize it's own contents, or even its own temperature, if you think the four forces of physics and the laws of thermodynamics are all it needs to do just that.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I really have very little use for \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\". \n \n Ignorance of statistical principles does not make them any less valid.\n\n \n **\n So far as I can tell, darwinists' constant appeals to the Magick of Great Big Numbers have nothing to do with statistical 'principles' of any kind. The 'principle' behind the Magic of Great Big Numbers is this--Everything and anything is possible. Nothing is impossible. That which appears impossible can be rendered not only possible, but inevitable, given a sufficiently huge number of opportunities to do so. \n \n \n\n If a particular mutation occurs at a particular locus, at random, once every 100,000,000 cell divisions, and the population consists of 1,000,000,000 bacteria reproducing once every 20 minutes or so, the expected number of bacteria appearing with that trait each generation is 10.\n\n \n **\n Are you talking any kind of bacteria, any kind of mutation, or are you specifically refering to LD43? If the latter, then as a revertant to an earlier form, it is not random and undirected, and nothing you say here counts.\n \n You have to show that it is a fact that every allele in the entire genotype of every 1 billion strong bacteria colony is mutated once, at random, in every 100 million cell divisions, before you can claim that any particular locus will mutate ten times per 20 minute generation throughout the entire colony. If only a few loci mutate that rapidly, and others remain constant, then we are not talking random chance.\n \n \n\n In a phage-free environment the malformed receptor is slightly detrimental to the bacterium,\n\n \n **\n How so?\n \n \n\n so it will remain in the minority purely based on differential reproductive rates.\n\n \n **\n Not unless you can directly link the 'malformation' to something that would depress its reproduction rate, and actually demonstrate that difference by empirical experiment.\n \n \n\n It's also possible for the mutation to be randomly reversed, again at a rate of the order of 1 in 100,000,000 or so, but when there aren't many bacteria with the mutation, that's obviously not going to happen very often.\n\n \n **\n As above, your assumptions are suspect.\n \n \n\n However, in the presence of phage, the mutants are the only survivors. They form a new colony of millions, then billions, and now the 1 in 100,000,000 revertant rate is no obstacle. When phage is removed the process reverses itself, with the revertants' superior fitness allowing them to displace the mutants.\n \n It does not require intelligence.\n\n \n **\n No it doesn't, when 'fitness' is nothing but a tautology. Try linking 'fitness' to metabolic efficiency and productivity wrt survival and well-being, instead of differential reproduction, in which the most numerous are the most numerous thanks to, 'superior fitness', and 'superior fitness' is a matter determined by whatever is possessed by the most numerous.\n \n In this case you have to empirically demonstrate that the 'malformation' _physically_ increases death rates, (and thus diminishes reproduction rates) for a solid biochemical, metabolic reason. Can you do that, or is that just another assumption on your part? I'm not saying that it is, I just want evidence showing that it isn't.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You darwinists posit three contrary principles-- \n \n If you call me 'you darwinists' again I shall get very upset. It's particularly galling when you follow up an insulting generalisation with an almost completely innaccurate summation of what 'us darwinists' actually think.\n\n \n \n **\n I'm sorry.

As collectively labeled 'natural selection', thanks to Charles Darwin.\n \n Give me a more accurate word for your group of fellow-thinkers then 'darwinist', and I'll use it. Don't try 'scientist', because there is no necessity to limit 'scientist' exclusively to those who believe in the above hypothesis, or believers exclusively to the working world of science.\n \n And if what I characterize as your thinking, above, is innacurate, please show me where and how. I am more thanwilling to adapt, given good reason, but with all due respect, your annoyance is not, in and of itself, sufficient reason.\n \n Best take another break.",

   "\n Quote:\n A/Beneficial mutations are created by spontaneous, anomalous accident, and then snuggle into the genome for thousands of generations against the time when their expression will provide, coincidentally, an adaptive benefit. \n \n Inaccurate. It may take many generations for a variant to encounter an environment to which it is adaptive, or it might, as in the case of the yeast experiment, occur within just such an environment. It might never happen - the lineage carrying a particular trait might die out before it ever gets the chance to be beneficial.\n\n \n **\n None of which makes any difference to the darwinian notion that genetic mutations capable of making a vital difference in an organism can and do (according to darwinism) remain unexpressed in an organism for from one on up to many, many generations, ( lest they be maladaptive and therefore excised by NS when expressed), only to spontaneously express themselves when and if their vital difference would be to the organism's adaptive advantage. Provided the lineage does not die out for some unrelated reason.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n In bacteria, beneficial mutations that have proven their adaptive benefit will be erased by ensuing mutations unless they are constantly re-introduced by even later accidental mutations, in ping-pong fashion, despite the odds against getting the mutation at all by random accident.\n \n \n \n \n Again, you're missing huge chunks out of this. Beneficial mutations (in the context of bacteria in a lab) means beneficial in the current environment. So long as they're beneficial, the relatively low revertant rate for a mutation will be overwhelmed by the differential reproductive rate. EG: revertant e-coli would instantly be killed by the phage they're steeped in, and thus not compete with the mutants.\n\n \n **\n Of course that which is adapted does better than that which is maladapted, as measured by the productivity of given traits to enhance the achievement of life goals; ie, survive, thrive, and (sometimes) reproduce.\n \n That's just a statement of the meaning of adaptation. It applies to any adaptive theory, including EAM.\n \n \n \n\n Once the phage is removed, the resistant mutation is no longer beneficial. Compared to the occasional revertants, the mutants are at a reproductive disadvantage, and will be gradually numerically displaced.\n\n \n **\n As mentioned earlier, you either have to demonstrate a clear physical/chemical reason why that mutation would so vitally impair the metabolic efficiency of a cell that it would die significantly sooner than any other cell, or you have to accept that self-organizing organisms follow the lamarckian dictum, 'use it or lose it', as an intelligent allocation of energy resources, and that includes the collectively intelligent eusocial organisms that are bacteria colonies.\n \n \n\n You say 'despite the odds', but the odds are well within the parameters of likelihood when you're talking about billions of cell divisions per hour.\n\n \n **\n So you say. But where are the hard numbers?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n C/ \"Natural Selection\", as an external agency, will erase any expressed trait in an organism that it can, prevented only by that trait's resistance to whatever local agent 'natural selection' stands for at that time. \n \n Er, no. It might impose constraints, or it might offer new opportunities that allow some to flourish to an even greater extent. Just like EAM: coincidental fitness.\n\n \n **\n There is no empirical evidence for any of this. You are just taking advantage of the inherent nebulousness of the term, 'natural selection', to give it credit for any and all outcomes. That's not science.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Meaning that phage resistance will not disappear simply because no phage [i.e., no natural selection], is present. Resistance has to be driven out by an entropic genetic accident that specifically targets a certain allele. Odds against that be damned, too. \n \n Wrong, wrong, wrong. Phage resistance abates numerically because it carries a relative reproductive penalty in the absence of phage.\n\n \n **\n That's just one more assertion that has no empirical evidence of a specific physical cause for this supposed \"reproductive penalty\".\n \n \n\n Quote:\n These three assertions of darwinism can't all be the case, speaking logically. \n \n Good job darwnism doesn't make those assertions then \n\n \n **\n Well, you certainly failed to show that it didn't. You even introduced another one--that natural selection can cause, or at least be used to 'explain', any outcome imaginable, positive or negative, as you please.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Yes, but where's the proof that those mutations are taking place by entropic accident only? \n \n Conformation of the observed results to statistical predictions based upon the assumption of random mutation. You know: you tentatively assume your hypothesis, make predictions based upon it, then compare the results with observations. The scientific method.\n\n \n **\n What \"statistical prediction\" are you talking about? What in the world do 'statistical predictions' have to do with the scientific method? All LD43 shows, (and does not indisputably show, at that), is that resistant cells arise in bacteria colonies, provided that the colonies are allowed to develop numerically to a certain size before the colonies are directly exposed to a fresh batch of phage. The assumption is that resistant cells will arise in a random pattern, by spontaneous generation. The only 'statistical prediction', (if we can call it that), is that after exposure to the phage, the colonies of surviving resistant bacteria will _look_randomly distributed, with the assumption that if the distribution of survivors looks random, then the cause of survival, a mutation specific to the phage, must have been randomly, spontaneously generated. The thought that it might be a developmental property of e. coli. that, after millions of years of repeated exposure to streptomycin, their eusocial organisms would have developed a way to resist these attacks by building resistance into some of their cells at all times, once they attained a certain number of cells. Since that possibility was unheard of in 1943, and for decades after, it was assumed that the statistical distribution that looked random, was random. But modern microbiology shows that this developmental property of e.coli colonies would produce the same _look_ if the same protocols were followed. No randomness involved. No spontaneous generation. Just intelligent organismic self-defense mechanisms.\n \n Your conclusions are based on the false assumption that _only_ spontaneous generation could account for the observed outcome. Today we know that other explanations are equally possible. Your conclusions are untenable.\n \n \n\n Right now, I'm not even trying to prove that all mutations occur at random. I'm just trying to get past this stubborn insistence of yours that random mutations cannot be adaptive. Whenever I challenge that, you dismiss my argument as 'metaphysical'. Well, if it's metaphysical reasoning to say that random mutation can produce adaptive mutations, it's equally metaphysical to assert the contrapositive.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it is. But my metaphysical objection does not fail because it is metaphysical, while allowing your metaphysical assertion to be accepted even though it's metaphysical. Scientific assertions, i.e., that entropic system failures in the 'organismic inheritance of successful form and behaviour' information system, the genome, can generate an increase in productivity in complex biosystems, need to be empirically demonstrated. If they cannot be empirically demonstrated, then they must be logically demontrated, that is, metaphysically demonstrated. You do not logically demonstrate the necessity of your postulate-- that since some mutations are random and destructive, (or at best, ineffectual), then some mutations must be random and adaptive. There is no logic to that.\n \n My objection is this-all random mutations are non-adaptive, because in a complex system there are too many interconnecting synergistic relationships working in concert to achieve the common aim of meeting production quotas, (in biosystems meaning successfully maintaining survival, well-being, and as necessary, reproduction). Such productive complexity cannot be improved by mechanical accident. Intelligent, intentional input is required. If you do not belive me, then throw a sabot into an early 19th century french loom, or introduce an unlooked for virus into a computerized information system, and see if your get more and finer cloth, or more accurate or faster data processing.\n \n You won't. Why not. Because in logic nothing can generate that which it does not have, without external input. Every accidental change in a productively operating complex system has to decrease its synergy, and thus its productivity, by definition. That which decreases productivity cannot increase it at the same time. Therefore accidental changes in complex systems cannot increase their productivity. That is, accidental genetic mutations cannot generate traits that increase productivity in the biosystem's, i.e., the organism's, effort to survive, thrive, and reproduce.\n \n \n\n So unless you've got a better rebuttal, I suggest we accept the possibility and move on.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!? Because my rebuttal to your metaphysical assertion is metaphysical, I'm suppoosed to just up and accept your metaphysical assertion? No way. I've given you my logical critique of your notion. It is now up to you to rebut my rebuttal. Until you do, your assertion remains unacceptable.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n - a billion resistant e-coli will still probably randomly throw up ten revertants every 20 minutes or so.\n\n \n **\n And the observation of this actually taking place is recorded where, exactly?\n \n \n\n And if the phage is removed, those handful of revertants will stop dying and begin to out-multiply their peers, and soon enough dominate the available resources once again. No intelligence or planning required.\n\n \n **\n And the actual physical cause for this has been identified as what, exactly?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Granted that phage resistance is in some way costly to maintain, that still does not explain why numbers should decrease over all, unless you can show\n that resistant cells do not survive long enough to reproduce maximally. But they do so when a phage is present, so why not when the phage is not present, if an externally acting agent is what is meant by 'natural selection'? Without phage there is no externally acting agent to 'select' between resistant and non-resistant cells. \n \n Like I said, wrong. The malformation reduces their reproductive efficiency - they consume resources more slowly and divide less often. That opens the door to the revertants.\n\n \n **\n You have any links or other material dealing with this purportedly diminished ability to 'consume resources'?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Same old tautology. Which cells are the fittest? The most numerous ones. Why are they the most numerous? Because they are the fittest. \n \n Strictly speaking, that's not a tautology. It would be if the only way to determine the fittest was by counting them, but it isn't: there's a clear and obvious physical reason why the resistant cells multiply better in the presence of phage. What you're describing is a truthful statement that just happens to not tell the whole story.\n\n \n \n **\n Then tell us \"the whole story\". Just what is the \"clear and obvious physical reason why the resistant cells\" do not continue to do very well after the pgage has disappeared? You say there is such a reason that somehow makes them seriously maladaped to a phage-free environment. I'd like to know the details behind that assertion.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No, but it could do with a large dollop of logical thinking. \n \n I quite agree; maybe then you'll stop getting it wrong all the time \n\n \n **\n Feel as free to point out as many logical errors in my thinking as you believe you find. I've done it for you many times, including the times that you attempted to find fault with my logic and I then had to show you where you went wrong in your analysis.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Another appeal to \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\". The belief that if the goat gets to butt the mountain 'enough' times, the mountain will crumble into dust. \n \n Who'd have thought it? The man with no interest in understanding statistics makes a really terrible analogy about their application \n\n \n **\n Who'd have thought it? The person who appeals to arcane knowledge as an argument from authority makes a snide remark about someone who doesn't buy into that con game. Sounds like electrolyte and crew just showed up.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n and that's exactly what the fluctuation test showed: first, that the number of cell division events prior to phage exposure was linked to the chances of there being resistant bacteria present when phage was applied, and second that the mutation occurred (if at all) at random times in growing colonies.\n \n No, it did not. Where are you getting this from?!?! \n \n Oh for crying out loud. Just brush up on your statistics and read the damn paper already. Do I really have to go through this again?\n\n \n **\n No, you do not have to do anything. this a voluntary debate. But if you wish your opinions to be taken seriously, you will make a serious attempt to clarify them. Your tone is suddenly as arrogant and disdainful as is the average darwin defender's, and I don't like it.\n \n \n\n 1. Large colony cultured from single, non-resistant bacterium. Several samples taken, all show similar numbers of surviving bacteria, indicating an even, very sparse distribution of resistant cells.\n 2. Same large colony, tiny samples (therefore very, very unlikely to contain a resistant cell to start with), cultured to the same size as samples in 1, then exposed to phage. Distribution of survivors completely different: several colonies show no survivors, one or two show very large numbers of survivors.\n\n \n **\n This is not the L&D'43 experiment I read. I repeat-where are you getting this stuff from?\n \n \n\n Darwinian prediction is in accordance with results of 1: large colony with very many cell divisions = evenly distributed random resistance.\n\n \n **\n Why67 in the world would anyone predict an even distribution, that is , a regularity in an effect, as a result of a random causation?!? Even distribution is a mechanical effect, or an intentional effect, not a random effect.\n \n \n\n Darwinian prediction also in accordance with results of 2: if mutation occurs at random during cell division and is subsequently inherited, then the number of resistant cells found will depend upon when and if that mutation occurs between the tiny sample being taken and the cultured colony being exposed to phage. No mutation (likely) = no survivors. Mutation relatively early in colony growth (less likely) = jackpot; lots of survivors.\n\n \n **\n Here you contradict your earlier assertion that the phage resistant 'malformation' normally kept phage resistant cell numbers pertually low because they were severely maladapted metabolically. That being the case there would be no great increase in their numbers no matter how much time passed after the supposed 'random mutation' and the pgage exposure.\n \n \n\n EAM prediction in both cases: none; whatever happens 'must have been for some reason'.\n\n \n **\n Sez u, deliberately ignoring everything I've said. EAM says that, as an inherited immune reaction developed over millions of years of dealing withis phage, e.coli. as keep a relatively few cells per full-sized colony 'on call', as it were, in case of attack. These few cells are produced developmentally and epigenetically during the development of any colony from as little as one, up to any number of cells, but will not appear before colony size reaches a minimum number of cells. Israeli research has stipulated those numbers, but I'd have to google to find them again. Therefore, EAM predicts that every e.coli. colony left unmolested by man or phage will contain a certain proportion of phage resistant cells, distributed more or less evenly throughout the colony. That when those phage resistant cells are pushed aside and a new colony is started from a 'seed' cell that does not, apparently, possess the resistance, that after it has cloned itself, and its clones have cloned themselves, successfully and a minimum number of cells exist, then some phage resistant cells will begin to appear here and there, until at 'full size', the fully developed colony will have a broad distribution of resistant cells among its numbers. Therefore EAM predicts that a/phage resistance will appear deliberately in every e.coli. colony over a certain size, and b/ the number and distribution of such resistant cells will depend upon the stage of development of the colony, the number of cells in the colony, how and when the samples are taken, and any other human interference in the natural development of the colony.\n \n Basically EAM predicts that if you take any ordinary e.coli colony and sample it to record the distribution that it and any number of other full-sized colonies show wrt phage imunity, and then grow another e.coli colony to the same size as the others tested, but from a starter cell of one phage susceptible cell, you'll still get the same distribution in the the full sized colony that results. And that ain't random.\n \n As for L&D'43, the EAM scenario explains their observations perfectly, but contradicts the assumptions they, and you, make about those observations.\n \n Break.",

In these comparisons, the locations of orthologous genes were examined among different genomes. Using orthologous genes for the comparisons guaranteed that differences revealed in physical location would reflect changes in genome structure after speciation. We found that dynamic rearrangements have so frequently occurred in eubacterial genomes as to break operon structures during evolution, even after the relatively recent divergence between E. coli and H. influenzae. Interestingly, in such eubacterial genomes of high plasticity, we could find several highly conservative regions with the longest conserved region comprising the S10, spc, and alpha operons. This suggests that such exceptional conservative regions have undergone strong structural constraints during evolution.\n \n at;\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9395406&dopt=Citation",

Different degrees of morphological and behavioural change were induced using two prey items commonly found in the diet of this species, allowing us to estimate the relative importance of each type of plasticity. The purpose of the experiment was twofold. First, earlier work had suggested that diet variability might be an important factor in the evolution of trophic morphological plasticity in sticklebacks. The present results extend this work by revealing the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity. The current experiment also qualitatively assessed the compatibility of the time scale of morphological change with that of the natural resource variability experienced by this species. The results indicate that diet-induced plasticity improves foraging efficiency continuously for up to 72 days of prey exposure. This is probably due in part to plasticity of the external trophic morphology but our results also suggest a complex interplay between morphology and behaviour. The time scale appears to be matched to that of natural diet variability although it is possible that some traits exhibit non-labile plasticity. Our discussion highlights the important distinction between conditions favouring the evolution of labile versus non-labile plasticity. The second objective of the experiment was to determine the relative importance of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Few studies have attempted to quantify the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity and no study to our knowledge has separated the effects of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Our experiment reveals that both behavioural and morphological plasticity are important and it also suggests a dichotomy between the two: behavioural plasticity predominately affects searching efficiency whereas morphological plasticity predominately affects handling efficiency.\"\n \n at--\n \n http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2483818",

In many river systems, migratory and resident forms of salmonids coexist, including anadromous (migrant) and resident brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis. In such populations, juvenile anadromous (migrant) brook trout, prior to migration, inhabit regions of higher current velocity than residents. Because it is more costly to occupy fast currents than slow currents, differences in morphology minimizing the effects of drag were expected between the two forms. As predicted, migrant brook trout were found to be more streamlined (narrower and shallower bodies) than resident brook trout, and these differences persisted into the marine life of the fish. Migrants also exhibited shorter pectoral fins, which facilitate pelagic swimming, indicating that migrants, prior to their migration to the sea, possess the appropriate morphology for swimming in open water habitats. The reported differences between migrants and residents were powerful enough to derive discriminant functions, using only five of the seven measured traits, allowing for accurate classification of brook trout as either migrants or residents with an overall correct classification rate of 87%.

   "**\n Excerpt--\n \n \"CONCLUSIONS \n \n Planets without living organisms have no unstable mixing conditions of gases and temperatures. The gas composition and the temperatures can be determined solely based on physical factors. A planet with living organisms deviates considerably from this scheme. The gas composition and temperature will vary in a manner that cannot be predicted exclusively by the laws of physics and chemistry. Planets with life will have an atmosphere whose temperature and gas-molecular composition is regulated by the totality of biological individuals and not by solar energy and the laws of physics and chemistry alone. \n \n The relation between organisms and matter is one of organisms structuring their non-biological environment according to biological principles. The relationship to other organisms is a communicative one: their mutual behavior underlies changeable rules (within the frame of natural laws), more precisely (semiotic) rules of sign use with which the biological individuals interact, i.e. coordinate and organize. The relationship of sign users and sign interpreters to the rules of sign use is not strict and immutable, but rather is changeable, alterable and renewable, although it can ensure relative stability.\n \n The organization of life depends on successful intra-, inter- and metaorganismic communication processes. Interestingly, rule governed sign mediated interactions are not only the basis for human communication and coordination but a true principle of life itself. As demonstrated, it is the main principle also in and between microbial as in higher eukaryotic organisms as well as between organisms of different organismic kingdoms. \n \n The structure of the genome itself is a linguistic one, more analog in eubacteria, more symbolic in archaebacteria and (higher) eukaryotes. It obeys syntactic, semantic and pragmatic rules. Interestingly the neodarwinistic paradigm of chance mutations and selection is refuted nowadays through research results which identify a higher order regulation code in the non-protein coding regions of genome architecture. This higher order regulation code is subject/object to environmental influences which become hereditable, with the effect that a different use of protein coding core components leads to different genetic organization.[bold mine-m.]\n \n A non-solipsistic and non-reductionistic understanding of the linguistically structured and communicatively organized living nature can thus provide the methodological basis for a biology as an understanding social science, one whose descriptions are based not on a third person pure observer perspective but rather on the perspective of performative participants of the planetary communicating community of living nature (Witzany 2005). \"\n \n **\n at;\n http://www.library.utoronto.ca/see/SEED/Vol5-1/Witzany.htm",

   "**\n If you have a problem comprehending any particular passage in anything I post, or any difficulty relating a particular passage to EAM theory, then quote the particular passage and clearly state why, IYO, it does not conform to EAM theory.\n \n\n \n I am more interested in hearing an explanation of why the comment-free excerpts you post DO conform to EAM.\n \n Let me rephrase that - it appears that anything can conform to the EAM assertion. Rather, I would like an explanation as for why EAM specifically should be inferred from or supported by the comment-free quotes and excerpts.\n \n Here is an example:\n \n \n \"Summary \n A fundamental precept of evolutionary biology is that natural selection acts on phenotypes determined by DNA sequence variation within natural populations. Recent advances in our understanding of gene regulation, however, have elucidated a spectrum of epigenetic molecular phenomena capable of altering the temporal, spatial, and abundance patterns of gene expression. These modifications may have morphological, physiological, and ecological consequences, and are heritable across generations, suggesting they are important in evolution. A corollary is that genetic variation per se is not always a prerequisite to evolutionary change. Here, we provide an introduction to epigenetic mechanisms in plants, and highlight some of the empirical studies illustrative of the possible connections between evolution and epigenetically mediated alterations in gene expression and morphology.\"\n \n \n How, precisely, does that indicate EAM as opposed to a new understadnnig of evolutionary processes? If your response will be that it conforms to EAM, so what? ANYTHING can be seen to conform to an idea with no substantive underpinnings.\n More quotes - often irrelevant or diversionary (see the thread in which you bring up HGT, it is replied to, and you respond with some un-commented on quotes abot plasticity) - and bland assertions are not convincing.\n \n\n \n \n \n I have no problem discussing genuine difficulties with genuine people, but phonies who just want to blow smoke by raising general, non-specific objections to things they are metaphysically prejudiced against, simply bore me.\n\n \n \n And you metaphysical prejudice against 'Darwinism' is somehow special in this realm?",

   "And if you are so dense that you cannot see for yourself how the passage you cite directly contradicts the RMNS hypothesis, nobody can help you.\n\n And we can discuss that in a different thread. If you remember much about this thread, you may remember this statement:\n \nHere we discuss EAM. We leave Darwinism / Modern Synthesis to one side - that means I don't try to describe how Darwinism explains the same observations, and you don't criticise Darwinism or contrast it with EAM. If EAM is a viable hypothesis then it should be able to stand on its own merit, and that means it should be explanatory and predictive with regard to observable facts. Leaving Darwinian evolution out of the discussion should also help to avoid confusion over terminology.\n\n If you insist that that passage supports EAM, I suppose no one can help you.",
