   "The question is: Does God exist? If he/she/it does exist would he/she/it condone the incalculable amount of slaughter that has and still is being perpetrated in the NAME OF RELIGION? \n Is it a conscionable god that slaughters millions Jews, gypsies and countless other unwanted undesirables (including INNOCENT babies and children of these unwanted undesirables)...or the unwanted Chinese, Vietnamese, Turks, etc. Etc. Etc. Let's not forget the millions of Catholics, Protestants and Muslim, in fact; has any race been spared from ending up in the HATE cycle of killing the unwanted that \"God\" does not want? Is God a cold hearted mass murderer just in the morning, or in evening? What are God's guidelines for killing off the sinners? Why does God need to revert to killing at all? Or does the messenger of God carry out all the murders? Who benefits from all the killing, God or the messengers?\n Could there have been a better God strategy? How about the all powerful and all seeing God simply visiting each and every sinner in town and command that they stop sinning... Let me tell you that if God talked to me just once I would never \"sin\" again. Why did only a few men in the last ten thousand years talk directly to god? Why can't everyone talk to God? \n It is time to be honest. Question what you have been duped into believing. Who knows, you may find that you can find a God like tranquility and peace within yourself without having to believe that God is running the show.",

So, I posed a question to him. I first asked him if his god is a loving and merciful god? He answered with an assertable, \"YES.\" Of course he is!\" I then said, \"OK, supposed I lived on an Island never visited by Christians or any religious group and lived my life in peace and never violated any of the commandments. When I died where would I go? His answer...you guessed it... \"The liquid fires of hell!! No matter what I said he would not budge.

And scary at the same time! POST NOTE: I told Richard (That is his name) that if I went to hell I am taking some chicken with me and will have a big BBQ.. And would invite him down for a bite. For some reason, at this point, he got up and left?? You figure? I posed the same question to another friend of mine who is not wacky as Richard is. She said that I would have the opportunity to accept jc at the time of the rapture. So, I asked. If I died hundreds or thousands of years ago and it may be hundreds or thousands more before the \"rapture\" where would my soul go? She didn't have an answer for me.

   "Kudos Kronus, excellent post. And very insightful.\n\n \n Thanks. Of course, the same reasoning works the other way as well. Just as we can't say how God \"ought\" to behave, being ineffable and all, we also can't say what he really wants. God's desires would be unknowable to us. So for anyone to claim that they know God's will is pretty ludicrous, and for anyone to assert that they follow the only \"true\" religion is to claim knowledge of the unknowable. The only thing we can say for certain is that if God exists and he wanted us to act a certain way we would know it without question, God being omnipotent and all. Since this general broadcast of certain knowledge hasn't happened we must assume that God, if he exists, doesn't have anything specific he wants us to do; there's no set of rituals or behaviors he insists we follow. We're on our own, and have to figure out our way through life as best we can. But if you believe that God is just, you can at least rest assured that you won't be punished for not guessing which, if any, religion to follow.",

Our legal system knows that it has released convicted killers from Prison and that they are walking among us. They know these criminals might recommit yet they can't arrest them until they do kill someone else. Aren't they responsible for the innocents death for letting the killer out of Prison in the first place ? And doesn't that make them evil too ? Of course it doesn't, because the Police aren't responsible for the sins of any man who is a free agent and responsible for his own action. And the same goes for God who gave us all FREE WILL.",

One thought that occurs to me is that God might care about people as a species, but not so much as individuals. A skinned knee might be horror to the skin cells in the knee, but not mean much of anything to the kid in question in the long run aside from a lesson to be more careful. Likewise the atrocities we visit upon ourselves might be necessary if we are to ever grow up as a culture.\n \n Another thought. Let's say God did stop the killing in his name.

   "Perhaps you didn't mean to say condone per se, but your logic is still flawed, and for the reasons I stated. You have this assumption that God, if he exists, ought to step in and do something, particularly about things done \"in his name\". Why are you making that assumption? What's your basis for it? You seem to think that an omnipotent, omniscient being should think and act like a human, which is a pretty outrageous assumption. Throw in \"acts in mysterious ways\" and it becomes impossible to predict how God \"ought\" to act. If you must ascribe human motives to God, here are a few possibilities to explain the behavior which you find inexplicable. He really believes in free will. He only really cares about the immortal soul, not the transient body. The only way that humanity as a whole will ever understand the divine will is to fight against those who misrepresent it. All of which is to say, who can say? Maybe God is treating us like a toddler and letting us skin our knees so that we can learn to walk more carefully; when you're talking about an omniscient being you really can't take your limited view of the universe and say that, because this being doesn't fit that view, they don't exist. Why God, if he exists, doesn't \"do\" something about suffering is an interesting and valid question, but it isn't proof that there is no God.\n\n \n I am not saying that he \"ought to step in\" per se and talk to anyone and everyone, what I am saying is that if he indeed does talk to a few, why not everyone. Here is my point, it seems to me that if God is loving and merciful, then what is God's reasoning that hundreds of millions of his tiny precious souls die senseless horrendous and often violent deaths? \"Free Will\", with devastating consequences is not an answer. Where does the \"toddler stage\" begin and end? Now tell me again how I am putting human characteristics on to an omnipotent God. How can you say that \"He\" believes in free will, is that not giving God human characteristics too. Let's face it, everyone relates god to human behavior because that is our only point of reference. \n \"Acts in mysterious ways\" is a blanket explanation to TRY to explain the \"WHY\" of an event that does not conform to the \"Loving and Merciful\" concept of God. Excuse my outrageous assumption, but I am sure that the parents, husbands, wives, and children of the devout Peruvian Christians who were killed during a special mass praising god, when a church collapsed during an earthquake. Do you really believe that the families are relying on the \"mysterious ways\" to explain \"Why\" their loved ones died? \"Mysterious Ways\" does not give the comfort of answering \"Why\" babies and children are pulverized. \n It is beyond comprehension that he is interested only in immortal souls and not the pain and suffering of \"his\" children. Sometimes the explanation put forth is we are paying for the sin committed by Adam & Eve. Oh please give me more to go on.",

Most Christians, in my experience, are Christian because their parents are. In other words, they were raised Christian and just sort of stuck with it.

You're supposed to outgrow Santa, but you're not \"supposed\" to outgrow your religion, so people don't.

We created that ourselves. Along with the fact that the god of this World seeks to destroy us and get us to take our focus off of our only Savior, the Living God. You are condemning yourself to being all alone on Earth in this life by rejecting the only light that exists within it. \n \n \n2.

He already knows what you will or will not do.\n \n \n The bible says that before I was born, God knew the number of hairs on my head. And before I was born He knew the length of my days on Earth. So obviously before I was even born, God knew of every victory, defeat, joy and sorrow I would experience in my life. Are you suggesting that because He is omniscient and omnipresent and knew of my life in advance then He should have denied me life ? \n \n Isn't the great joy of an expectant parent for their unborn child who rests in the womb to nurture it and see it grow and experience its full potential ? Why would you expect any less of our God who created us in His image and as reflections of him with His characteristics ?\n \n \n4 Has religion been a good thing for man or has it been the cause of so much carnage that we even see today? Etc, etc.\n\n \n Religion is the scourge of humanity. You'll get no argument from me on that fact. But now look at the life, teachings and example that Jesus gave and left for us and tell me that if the whole World lived according to His teachings and precepts that this wouldn't be a better World ? When atheists and unbelievers condemn Christianity for the Crusades, the Inquisition and the Dark Ages, and boast of the millions who have been killed in Christ's name; they fail to remember the Garden of Gesthemane the night before He was Crucified and that when the Temple Guards came to arrest Him how when Peter drew his sword and in attacking the guards to protect his Lord, he cut one of their ears off.\n \n Did Jesus encourage His attack, or did he tell him that whoever lives by violence will also die by it and to put up his sword. Then He proceeded to heal the ear of the man who was to lead Him first to His fixed and illegal trial, the scourging that would leave Him near death and finally the Crucifixion that He knew He must suffer in order to redeem the Humanity who's sins He came to die for. \n \n So why do so many look at the corrupt, brutal and hateful acts committed by so many men in Jesus Christs name through out History and blame Christianity as if Jesus Himself called for the crimes against humanity that have been committed in His name ? Does that seem fair or rational to you as a man of justice ?\n \n \nNo matter how hard I try I just logically cannot see an existence of a god....\n\n \n This too I can relate to as I couldn't logically see Him either once. But I groped out into the spiritual darkness of the World seeking absolute and eternal truth. And just as the bible promises, if we grope out into the darkness, He (God) will find us.

When I was about 15 I was having a terrible time at school, being short, fat, bespectacled and intelligent is not a good combination in an English school. In near desparation I prayed, and perhaps this is the crucial part, I prayed for those who were bullying me. God responded by giving me renewed strength, and giving support to my friends. Over the following years my faith has grown and I have begun to be aware of God during worship and prayer.\n \n Now, throughout my schooling I'd been a high flier, top of my class at primary school, close to top at secondary, 4 high grade A-Levels. I'd got an offer from Cambridge, requiring me to sit the STEP. I failed, dismally. So I went to my second choice, Lancaster, did well in my first year yet when I got to my second year I finished the year with a 3rd. Now, I'd never had any idea what I wanted to do when I graduated, but it was around this time I saw a notice in the maths department inviting second year undergraduates to participate in the Student Associate scheme - being paid to spend time in local secondary schools in the hope that some of us would choose to be teachers. I went along with the intention of restoring the health of my overdraft, but found I was getting on well with the kids and was able to explain maths to them. It happens that Lancaster, as well as the university, contains a prestigious teacher training college, and they offered me a place on condition I got a 2:2, which I duly received.\n \n My experience was not tongues of fire or a voice coming down out of heaven, but it was real nonetheless. Yes you can mock it or dismiss it as coincidence, but I know what happened to me. When I look back over the last few years I see God's hand in it everywhere, even through disappointments and doubt God has led me to new opportunities and new hope.",

I remained a Catholic for almost half of my adult life and did not hear the term \"born again evangelic Christians\" until a few short years ago.\n \n Any idea when this evengelical movement began?\n\n \n From what I gather, some trappings of it would have started in the 1800's and then burst with the advent of the current Pentecostal movement which started ~1900.\n Popularity of the term and belief surged in the 60's and 70's when that belief system went main stream and Charismatic practices became more acceptable.\n \n IIRC, there are passages in the bible to support this term, being ' \"born again\" of the Holy Spirit' for example.\n \n Most Christian faiths of old focused on the Christ and God with little emphasis on the Holy Spirity/ Ghost. This new movement almost focuses exclusively on the HS which they attribute nearly all of their experiential beliefs to. \n See, Jesus and God are pretty well defined but the H.S. isn't. Thus, you'll often see many huskters manipulate a congregations ignorance for personal benefit.\n \n As of late, this form of belief is extreamly popular with close to 1/2 a billion followers believing in one form or another of Pentecostalism. It's eroding traditional stongholds of Catholicism and Protestantism in many parts of the world, notably Africa, South American and Asia.\n \n Born Again can have 2 stages.\n Simple Born Again in Christ which is typical a water baptismal and then the Born Again by receiving the Holy Spirit. \n Both can happen at the same time but from seeing this practice and as stated in the bible, they don't have to be.\n \n Sorry for the long answer.",

   "_________________________________________________________________\n \n Archangel, I am curious. Seriously. No trick questions here. When did the \"born again\" Christian movement start? I am asking you because I am assuming that you did some research into the movement before you embraced it as your religion. Also, why do you have \"your unworthy servant\" under your I.D.? What is meant by these words?\n\n \n samiinh said it correctly in post 64 regarding when the born again movement I belong to started, and I have unworthy servant under my handle because I am unworthy of the free gift of salvation which I received because jesus, who was without any sin died so that I, a sinner could live a life that apart from Him I could never have lived as I do. And I live to humbly serve Him because He is worthy of all praise and glory. \n \n Now don't get me wrong, I was raised in a wealthy family with all of the best that this World offers. I went to good schools and was well liked, good looking and have never suffered any types of deprivations that many suffer from. Whether it be poverty, illness or disease. But compared to what I have in Christ, I realize that before knowing Him I was a child of the King of Kings who was a leper living in the slums of human depravity with no hope within myself of ever climbing out of it on my own.\n \n I know this is beyond your understanding and you see a grown man admitting such need in an invisible being as needy to the point of delusional. But that's only because you don't know what it truly means to be born again in the Spirit of the living God. To have Him dwell within you. That reality is beyond you to appreciate, comprehend or to understand on a personal level. So, as the bible clearly points out, we are literally from different Worlds. You, from this one, the Natural World. And born again believers from the Spiritual World of Gods Supernatural kingdom. That is why the things of the Spirit we describe for you are beyond your ability to comprehend. It isn't believers who are delusional, it's the natural man who is blind and incapable of seeing a whole World that exists around them.",

Therefore, I used the 1800's which I got in response to my question from another blogger. Since you are a servant of god I would welcome the correct, verifiable, born again movement date from you. If you can't come up with the date... ask god. Just a suggestion. If you do get an answer from him, I will denounce my lack of faith and will become an unworthy servant of god too.... In a flash. No kidding. This is his big chance. emoticon_smile \n \n In addition, I never did get an answer as to why you think satan (if he exists?) founded the evil? muslim religion. It is beyond me how you can say a religion is evil? I don't believe in god, but I would never say that a religion is evil! It is man who sometimes, in the name of religion, does evil things. Not the religion. Some examples: Killing an abortion doctor, being a suicide bomber, killing those of a different faith, or beheading in the name of religion. emoticon_xkill \n \n Now, on to your quotes... I must ask you again to read my posts! I know what the bible says! No mystery here. Jc said that (Well, maybe or maybe not?), but how do you assume that he was saying born again for the **second time? A catholic may (or would say), \"You are right in that he did say \"born again\", but he (jc) was referring to washing away original sin though baptism.\" Get it: Born again... an infant is baptized shortly after birth...THUS, \"born again.\" \n \n Let's take a look at this quote: \"Having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever\". I would read this to mean the corruptible seed (born of original sin), incorruptible, through the word of god (baptized... In the name of the father, I baptize you). \n \n **That is why I specifically stated that man is/was doing interpretations of the bible that suit his goals. A preacher decided he wanted to start a new movement..... And, he came up with the idea \"born again\". Not god, but a man. The result: The born again gang put words into god's mouth which he did not say. IE: Second time. :xbanghead Lastly, (FLASH) every time a catholic goes to church, he/she asks god to come into his heart. So his chances of getting into heaven are double? Born again through baptism and born again because he asks jc to come into his heart...emoticon_xangel",

How about the all powerful and all seeing God simply visiting each and every sinner in town and command that they stop sinning...

Yet the monsters head rises again and so we must address the lies and twists this creature wants to chain us with. If we as nation are forced to obey this Dragon called fundamentalism; our children will be drinking blood and casting out demons from foreign lands all their lives.\n \n Nothing is more terrible or sinful than a Dogmatic man thinking he is doing the will of a God.

   "WOW, the depth of the ignorance you spew truly boggles the mind brmly. emoticon_frazzled You are so lacking in any insight, it isn't even worth attempting to correct you. emoticon_wow\n\n \n Correct me?\n \n Paul corrected Peter, Peter after the death of Christ was teaching in error (in my opinion). \n \n When do errors begin and end? And how would you know?\n \n Faith is empty; it has no good works or deeds, other than the effect faith has on the individual. Never did. Its clear, good works offers no reward and we know that.\n \n Faith fails man all the time. People have faith they will see another winter. The faith is great, its so certain to them, they even plan trips. But failure happens.\n \n You should know, that good works for a reward has no meaning. Why do good works? In other words, If I seek to save my life by doing good works and its ineffective to God, what is effective? What is the motivation?\n \n Giving to get ten fold in return is a flaw (clearly so) because the works are empty. Why say you get ten fold when looking for that effect is an error?\n \n IF I am master to the word, than I am empty because my works are a slave to the word. Even Jesus was clear regarding this. Rebirth means what? \n \n You could test my knowledge of the bible and how insightful I am. But what happens if my knowledge is greater and you could lose. Would that mean my authority should be greater than yours? That I should be correcting you?\n \n Could it actually be true, that there are people out there with less knowledge even no knowledge of the bible and yet have greater love? Spirit? Even insight into the mind of God? And if so, how?\n \n Any good works for Religion is a failure, it an oxymoron if the works are found unworthy. Why do them?\n \n If you can't answer the why; then where is the error?",

   "I have a problem with the inaccuracies you mention on a debate forum. Thus, I take it up...on A debate forum.\n And your logic and analogy are incorrect. If one has a problem with a Chevy, they DO NOT take it up with the builder unless all else fails, they take it up with the dealer. In this case, you're a dealer and it's you who are posting here...not God. \n \n You can say that ultimatly you're a product of God...but, since I don't believe in a God and you have no proof of your comments beyond 'I believe'...it's really nonsensical of you to attempt to dodge criticism based on your comments. So, you have no 'facts'.\n\n \n Zardoz, I don't know if Jesus walked on water or out of his grave. How could I? I wasn't there.\n \n What is the worth of a man that follows Jesus because he walked on water? Or out of his grave? I don't know what Jesus did. How could I? I was not present. I also know, no one else knows. So what is the worth of anyone that sells something they did not witness? What I do know is what I read and I don't follow Jesus because he floated in a cloud. That is for weaker men. \n \n I can't prove to you Jesus was a man God. And I will not try. \n \n What I can do and will do is measure what Jesus said and find merit in it or not. If what he said has worth, no proof is needed. The words stand on their own.\n \n I find worth in Jesus. I could care less about miracles. Not even worthy of debate because I have no evidence in anyway. I find Jesus has great value because of what he taught.The things I can see and judge have been found to have worth to me. That I will share and in the statements the evidence is examinable. I can prove a statement true or false or find worth in it in many cases.\n \n You can examine a statement like: \"Honor your mother and father\"; determine the merits and failures in it. If you do honor your mother and father your chances of a next birthday are increased. Clearly there are merits to the statement.\n \n As far as Religion, Personally I can't think of anything that would draw man away from truth more. That is clearly a fact.",

   "What we do know is that when any religion gains total control over a region, massive negatives occur. Dark Ages, Wars of Conversion etc.\n \n Now, all faiths will lead to this logically. If your selling the truth and you feel an obligation to man. You're obligated to use all the means you have to convert. It's for them anyway. This is a very powerful force when you believe a God blesses or condemns a nation. If God judges nations, then you're obligated to overcome the negatives of your nation by any means, even if it does not start out that way. The problem is that the task never ends, if you convert a village, you know the state is flawed. Only converting the world will repair the issue and even then, you'll be forced to start over and begin an individual conversion. This means you need to convert a village.\n \n This path led to Witch trials and so on. The process is never enough as specially when your faith tells you man is flawed.",
