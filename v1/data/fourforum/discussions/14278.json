I see it as a slap in the face, since, as trebor pointed out, all the people involved in the attacks were devout mosque-attenders. \n \n The reactions I'm seeing here is also a testament to the extensive sheep-mentality prevalent in America. We were screaming for the blood of the iraqis because the mass media hyped us up to do so, directed by Bush's agenda. 10 years later we forgot what we were even mad about in the first place, because there's no media hype behind this. \n \n In all, I think its a very funny and ironic situation. Here we are condemning muslims for their \"bomb then occupy\" tactics, when in reality they couldn't have learned it from anybody better than the good ol U.S. of A.",
