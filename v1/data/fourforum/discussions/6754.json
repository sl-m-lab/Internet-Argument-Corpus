Yes, I took it as condescending, and wasn't specifically sure what you were agreeing with.\n\n \n First off, thank you for your conciliatory attitude. I come off strong sometimes and I do not usually intend to offend.\n \n The original sentiment expressed by Phoenix was resignation, which I do agree with in terms of the entire \"gay pride\" phenome.\n \n \n\n Gay people don't have equal rights, and they still don't see themselves refelcted daily in mainstream society, as heteroexuals do. The entire visibility is less for gay people compared to straight people. Straight people have no more need for events which celebrate who they are, than white people have that need.\n\n \n Agreed, and visibility is needed to get the message out. However, what I see is not \"getting the message out\", it is... reveling in skimpy outfits and outdoing each other with outrageous behavior. I would be ecstatic if gay people would be part of the community as normal people, but I genuinely fear that this sort of behavior and message of \"look at us, we are different\" will overwhelm and overpower the true message of \"we are just like you\". It disgusts and irritates me.\n \n \n\n As acceptance grows, there may be a need for less specifically gay events and groups.\n\n \n And this is part of what makes me angry, I do not believe that will happen judging by todays behavior. I understand these events for celebrating freedom from oppression, but there comes a point (and I think it's past this point) where such displays are counterproductive.\n \n \n\n Perhaps people will keep the parade around, because it is simply fun. Why be angry about it? Why not lighten up and enjoy life? No one says you must attend. How would you feel about social events that are not parades, such as pride picnics? In a world where people are assumed to be straight, people who are gay don't have the same opportunities to meet one another, either. This is another reality gay people face. There are many gay people who don't like bars or clubs.\n\n \n I object because they are so public. A gathering of like-minded individuals in a picnic would not bother me in the slightest. A public display proclaiming \"look at me look at me I'm gay\" strikes me as childish and grandstanding. The outfits disgust me, and the commercialization saddens me. If your message is \"I'm just like everyone else\" don't work on separating yourself. This is part of the reason some black groups and women groups have lost any sympathy I had for them, they work so hard to separate themselves yet complain when they're treated differently. This is the road I fear for those who are gay.\n \n I'm sorry if this didn't make sense, I'm slightly drunk.",
