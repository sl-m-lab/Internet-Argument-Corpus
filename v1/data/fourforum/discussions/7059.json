Typically gays in the media have always been potrayed as Negative or troubled or psycho sex maniacs, or weak and distressed and timid.\n\n \n I don't see how you can say that these days. Homosexuality is pretty much portrayed as mainstream in many of today's sitcoms and films.

But the motivation for having the parade would be prejudicial resentment, not an equivalent demonstration of self-respect and lack of shame. (It's that positive sense that the word Pride is used, though they conveniently like to think that it's the \"arrogant, boastful\" sense.) Straights aren't ashamed of being straight, and no one's trying to make them be, or ever has. Consequently, there's no deep-seated group need to assert that they are okay with themselves being heterosexual.

I don't have to watch the frigging thing, but obviously many like to. There's no lack of programming I can choose to watch without the likelihood of running into Robertson or his dangerously screwball opinions, so why should I resent the fact that he has a channel of his own? \n \n If having a channel with programming geared towards a minority culture or interest group stirs resentment and demands for equal time by those whose majority culture or interests have always been and continue to be thoroughly well-represented in the media, then I say the problem is with the people doing the resenting--who seriously need to get over it.",

If there is a problem with the mere existence of these channels by people, then there is an issue with homophobia on the part of those individuals.\n\n \n Integration into society depends more on society's acceptance than gay people being open with themselves. Separating gay programming will work counter to this goal, because it will no longer expose the public to gay people via mainstream programming. This, in turn, will make being gay something strange and unnatural to a whole new generation because they would never have been exposed to it. Out of sight out of mind, tonybrown74.\n \n If gay people fight for more and more positive representation in mainstream channels as well, this will likely cause resentment because gay people already have their own channel for such programs. This could and would be different than simple homophobia, and likely even those who are tolerant now would feel resentment toward this. It could and likely would be viewed as greedy and a case of \"wanting your cake and eating it too\".\n \n \n\n By this reasoning, your solution seems to be creating one big mega channel, since the creation of a cable station based on a niche market will always alienate someone.\n\n \n No, my solution would be one of two things: Have your channel and be happy with it, but realize that it will have an effect on the perception of gay people; or try for more and better integration into everyday society, which is accomplished better by coexistence rather than segregation.

It certainly says much more about them than the people who would enjoy such programming, and what it says is not pretty.\n \n\n \n I'll try to put it another way with something that everyone can understand: Porn.\n \n A porn store has gay porn to cater to gay men (women as well, but men consume the vast majority of porn so I will simplify it to simply men). A porn store has \"straight\" porn (which covers a wide variety of fetishes) to cater to straight men. The gay section is likely to be smaller and have less variety since the majority of people consuming porn are straight men.\n \n Now. You, as a gay man (or just an entrepreneur), open a separate gay porn store, intending to have more variety that the general porn store lacked. Gay men will likely visit the gay porn store, as intended, for their porn needs instead of the general porn store. Therefore, the likely result in the general porn store is that the gay section will get smaller or disappear entirely. The general porn store is not likely to expand his selection to compete because he has to balance his straight customers, who comprise the vast majority of his business, with attracting gay customers who likely won't visit his store anyway with his limited selection.\n \n He will more likely, imo, turn his energies and funds to keeping his straight customers happier than alienating them by expanding the gay porn collection. It is not that the straight customers have a moral issue with gay porn, but more gay porn means less straight porn.\n \n Now, if your goal is just to have a service to the gay community then there is no problem. If your goal is to have more representation in the general porn store, despite having the smaller gay porn store for your needs, you will cause resentment among the straight men who want straight porn. This is not because they hate gay men, but because gay men have their own store for such things and so the feeling would be that gay men want their cake and to eat it too. Figuratively speaking, of course. Needless to say, gay porn will become more taboo because it is not seen as often in the general porn store, so it is seen as less \"normal\" by the general porn shopper.\n \n This isn't a perfect analogy, but I believe the concepts are sound. Not everything is homophobia or racism.",

So I will keep my sports stations. But when other sports are on, I'll just go and segregate myself and watch Logo.\n \n \n \n Sports and sporting events have allways led to pain and stress in my life. I detest sports. Infact I would rather have a root canial without any novicaine or pain control then to watch any sporting event.\n\n \n Not a sports fan, but it doesn't other me one way or the other. I watch some, and not others. I'll watch the Superbowl for the camaderie (and commercials) instead of the actual sport.\n \n At the end of the day, when I step into my home, I'll watch whatever I'll watch (as you will too) and no one needs to know what that is. Just because there is a station that MAY have programming that would appeal to my demographic does not separate me from the rest of society. The fact that some would feel resentment towards people due to the existence of a station geared towards accurate and/or positive portrayals of a demographic, says a lot a about those individuals.\n \n Uncle Tomming has never won anyone respect.",
