   "So there I was, watching some baseball on TV. The San Francisco Giants were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers. The announcers started talking about the successes the Dodgers had had over the years.\n \n The camera panned to a stadium balcony which displayed the years the Dodgers had won the MLB pennant. Each placard had the words \"World Champions\" above the year. \n \n Arrrgh!! What the hell is wrong with Americans? Why do they have to call the winners of their national sports competitions the \"World Champions\"? Let's get one thing straight - they're NOT. Being the best in America makes you the American champions. You have to beat teams in an INTERNATIONAL competition to be the World Champions of something. Why do Americans think otherwise?\n \n Now sure, I've thought about just how good an American football or baseball team has to be to win their respective national competition. And sure, MAYBE it's 'safe to assume' that no national team from any other country would beat them; but... so what? In Australia we play Australian Rules Football, and it's a safe bet that no-one from any other country would beat the annual AFL Grand Final winners. But they're still just the Australian champions. It's not like they beat Paraguay or something! I guarantee if they called themselves the World Champions, the Australian public would laugh in their faces.\n \n Around the world, dozens of countries play each other in truly international contests, in which America is mostly conspicuously absent! There are TRUE World Cups in soccer, rugby (both types), and cricket. Does America feel so completely impotent and inadequate because they can't win on the real world stage? Is this why they have to somehow console themselves? Is that it? Are they just sad? Or are they cocky? Or are they insular?\n \n Are you an American? What do YOU think? Should the USA knock it off already?",

It's to be hoped that this international sporting contest can bring them closer together, and that it won't drive a wedge in their global relations.\n \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I think the green-eyed monster is rearing its ugly head here. The excessive vitriol is a dead give-away. Well, I guess I can do nothing but console you. It must certainly be horrid to have to watch, again and again, year after year, as those uppity yanks continue to dominate your poor, weak prospects. But I'm here to warn you to begin calming down now... for your worst nightmare is just around the corner.\n \n The US was never overly enamored with soccer (football to some). This began to change somewhat around 30 years ago with Pele'. Now, some of OUR better athletes are beginning to go into soccer. Just a few years ago, our men's team made it the Semi's of the WORLD Cup, losing to the eventual winner, Germany. Just last week we beat the team many consider #1, Spain...2 - NIL.\n \n Oh god! It is coming. If you think you hate us NOW, just wait until the US starts whipping you wankers in a sport we don't even really care about (but the one which you hold as a national treasure). There will be a great gnashing of teeth and ripping out of hair in frustration. We will even steal your song, \"We are the Champions\". Our alert level will have to be raised to Fuchsia once you Brits and EU peeps start strapping on Suicide Bombs in your utter frustration and hopelessness.\n \n I only say this because I care. Take your blood pressure meds now... 'cause its about to get MUCH worse for you!!!\n \n emoticon_xangel",
