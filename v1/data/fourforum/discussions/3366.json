   "Finally, the battle over the Ten Commandments monument in the Alabama Courthouse started by former Chief Justice Roy Moore is done. The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear the case, effectively ending it for good, and making Moore the loser in every stage of the process.\n \n http://entertainment.msn.com/news/article.aspx?news=169759&GT1=5472\n \n Unfortunately, he has one stage left--the political one. Many people, myself included, believe this was nothing more than an attempt to make a national name for himself in which to propel him to bigger and better things. \n \n Here's the bet: Nothing less than U.S. Senator, maybe higher. Any takers?",
