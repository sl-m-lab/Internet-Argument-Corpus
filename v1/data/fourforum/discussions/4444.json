Experiments with beakers and Bunsen burners can produce the same type gases that are produced in large facilities. An ounce or two of sarin gas could kill thousands of people, the delivery system being to break a flask in a rail tunnel.\n\n \n Large facilities are required to process large amounts of chemicals, turn them in to concetrations that are useful, add additives to slow down the breakdown cycle of WMD, and then package them in useful delivery systems. You can't do that in your kitchen. Not to mention large facilities are required to properly store the weapons before they can be either shipped to long term storage units and have sufficent emergency systems to deal with accidents. So unless you have a decent level chemical hazard system in your kitchen, it isn't going to work. A ounce of or two of Sarin to kill thousands of people would require those thousands of people to be cramed in a tiny room and sarin be sent through a closed venetation system. Obviously you know little or nothing about WMD. Delivery systems of gasses require a means to rapidly disperse them. A flash in a rail tunnel cannot do that. Sarin was used in Japaneses subway system and killed a paltry 200+. If a decent system, such as a aresol and decent explosive was used, the death toll have been thousands. There is a reason the usual delivery system for chemical weapons is artillery shells, not only because they give long distance, but because they can be set to explode and release the gas direct above or in the enemy position.

Satellite technology is not required to do that simple work. \n \n \n\n Your satellite technology dream evidently came from watching too much TV.\n \n\n \n is that all you have? \n \n \n\n I have a chemist friend who can verify what I say about quantities and sizes of plants necessary to kill thousands of people. You could do it in your own home. You could deliver it in a suitcase. You could be long gone before the release and nothing would be detectable prior to the release.\n\n \n Circumsantial evidence. Fallacy: argument via authority. All that is is rhetoric. \n \n \n\n Don't try to blow a smoke screen to cover up the FACT that Iraq had weapons to hide and Russia helped them do it.\n\n \n Apparently you think that you can make large amounts of WMDs without leaving a single trace. And people wonder why Bush voters are considered to be XXXXXX. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n\n Anthrax should be the least of our worries.\n\n \n You forget that Bush cited it as one of Saddam's WMD that was a gathering threat to America. Fallacy: selective observation. \n \n \n\n What actually appears is that you will inevitably come up with with some lame argument as to why something can't be done on a small scale to produce a large end result.\n\n \n You apparently don't have a single clue as to how WMD are made not to mention any history of WMD in general. \n \n \nHowever, I'm choosing to recognize that it is not infallible and that things can be done undercover without being traced. All you have to do is build something deep enough in the ground and it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to detect. I know this from experience.\n\n \n Again, extreme stupidity.

Deep construction requires huge amounts of manpower, machines and leaves a relatively large trail of workers, parts, money, and materials. \n You are choosing to ignore the trace elements point as well as other points of production. \n \n \nI also know that a closed system does not emit detectable traces of anything. A closed system is not that difficult to attain.\n\n \n And please tell me, how do you clean up the process of a closed system without leaving any trace? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n JPSartre12: Virtually every country has thousands of chemical suits for various reasons.

At least you'd get laughed at a bit less.\n\n \n [We have discovered dozens of WMD-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment  that Iraq concealed from the United Nations during the inspections that began in late 2002. The discovery of these deliberate concealment  efforts have come about both through the admissions of Iraqi scientists and officials concerning information they deliberately withheld and through physical evidence of equipment and activities that ISG has discovered that should have been declared to the UN.\n - 10/2/03 Iraqi Survey Group Interim Report (unclassified) - David Kay ]\n \n [With reagard to biological warfare activities, which has been one of our two initial areas of focus, ISG teams are uncovering significant information - including research and development of BW-applicable organisms, the involvement of Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) in possible BW activities, and deliberate concealment activities. All of this suggests Iraq after 1996 further compartmetalized  its program and focused on maintaining smaller, covert capabilities  that could be activated quickly to surge the production of BW agents.\n - 10/2/03 Iraqi Survey Group Interim Report (unclassified) - David Kay ]\n \n [It therefore seems highly probable that the destruction of bulk agent, including anthrax, stated by Iraq to be at Al Hakam in July/August 1991, did not occur. Based on all the available evidence, the strong presumption is that about 10,000 litres of anthrax was not destroyed and may still exist. As a liquid suspension, anthrax spores produced 15 years ago could still be viable today if properly stored. Iraq expermented with the drying of anthrax simulants and if anthrax had been dried, then it could be stored indefinitely. (-UNMOVIC Unresolved Disarmament Issues, Dr Hans Blix Executive Chairman - 3/06/03) ]\n \n [Since Iraq produced more botulinum toxin than other agents and it still possesses  the expertise and possibly the seed stock, material inputs (such as growth media), and equipment (fermenters),  then production at least at the scale of its per-1991 leval could be rapidly recommenced.

No. It is illogical to think that he had them prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom because as we have discovered, there are no production or storage facilities, nor have we found even a decent amount of troops with chemical weapons training, nor have we found delivery systems. Not to mention even before that, we have not found elements of production, nor have we picked up any accidents in production, which by the way occur in even the best trained, best funded weapons programs, including our own.

Seriously, the \"if he had them before he must have them now\" logic is getting old fast. \n \n \n\n What logic do you employ to make the leap of faith assertion that we should have known that he didn't have any?\n\n \n You still don't understand (and that is a fallacious argument you just made), I'm not arguing that we could have know entirely before, but that examining evidence post invasion, that we can make a good, fact based asseration that he did not have them. \n \n \n\n So, you're saying that he was bluffing when he said that he still had active weapons programs? Fine. Now, tell me how the world's intelligence community, which had admittedly **** poor intel in Iraq, would have known that he was bluffing?\n\n \n Apparently you still don't understand. The entire ME political system is based on bluffing, from military to oil production. Has it ever occured to you that the intelligence agencies could be wrong, not to mention the chief sources of intelligence came from Allawi and Chalabi, both who has huge gains from the toppling of Saddam? Seems like a biased source of information. If most, if not all intel that everyone used came from two major sources, of course they would have come to the same conclusion. \n \n \nWhat crystal ball or divining rod were they to have used to make the determination that SH was DEFINITELY not in possession of WMDs?\n\n \n You still don't understand (and that is a fallacious argument you just made), I'm not arguing that we could have know entirely before, but that examining evidence post invasion, that we can make a good, fact based asseration that he did not have them. (I already addressed that)\n \n \nI'm not attacking you as much as I am your methods and your apparent lack of understanding of SIMPLE LOGIC.\n\n \n Says the one who gives the huge dome for a tiny room senario. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nNo. I'd rather you realize that (by the simplest of logic) a large quantity is nothing more than a sum of small quantities...an underground factory could easily be built without your knowledge. You could be made to think it was a covered football stadium.\n\n \n And please tell me how they would have hid the paper trail, the labor trail and the money trail, not to mention please tell me how they would have hid such a field and stadium after the invasion. For one who talks about logic, you appear to have very little in your arsenal. \n \n \nPlease show me an example of where you have proved anything at all in this thread\n\n \n How can I use logic to prove anything to someone who refuses to accept logic? \n \n \nIt makes no difference what Bush thought Iraq had. It casts no light on the question of where or how Iraq got anything of what it had. It certainly casts no light on the question of where it all went.\n\n \n So now it makes no difference as to what bush stated? Apparently accountability and accuracy are two things you don't care much for in your leaders. That's frightening. Actually iraq got its specific strain of anthrax from us during the 80s. \n \n \nYou don't know that there haven't been any accidents. Unless you've determined that there is no place in Iraq that hasn't been discovered and inspected, you can't say that there were no small production facilities. It took us quite a while to find Saddam cowering in a hole.\n\n \n Please tell me how, on such a national scale, there hasn't been one report of a single accident, not to mention no findings of any traceable elements in any of the cities. Also, please tell me why we haven't found anyone outside of the main advisor board with expierence in the 90s of WMD production. Also, please tell me why we haven't found any people with tales of moving chemical weapons from kitchens across the country. Also, please tell me why we haven't found any evidences of accidents involving transporation of chemical weapons. Also, please tell me why we haven't found any network of this transportation of materials and weapons. Also, please tell me why we haven't found a facility capable to transfering small kitchen based WMD production final products to deliverable shells. Please, explain all of that. You currently have been avoiding all of it to suit your argument: Deliberate act of fraud, selective reading. \n \n \nAgain, your ignorance of engineering and construction capabilities is apparent. There are innocent looking domes and warehouses all over the world. Hiding what goes on under the roof is not difficult.\n\n \n Again, extreme stupidity. A dome of that size would have thousands of works, tens of machines, material leaving and comming and would leave a astronomically large trail that we could follow for years. Not to mention that if it was production wmd, that facility would be far to small to store them and there would constantly be a transportation network to bring in new materials and take out final products. As of today, that has not been discovered in any form. Explain. I may not have the best engineering and construction knowledge, but I sure know alot more about business and labor usage. Explain to me why we haven't found such a trail, nor have satellite survelliance for a decade has not picked up anything similar. \n \n \nYou haven't proven the first instance of stupidity, much less a repeat.\n\n \n Well, my definition of stupidity is obviously different then yours. \n \n \nHave you ever been to a covered football stadium? There are lots of them around the US. The interior can be reshaped for almost any event you can think of. We have tractor pulls, motocross, soccer, rock concerts, football, circuses...you name it. Anything you can fit under the dome can take place there.\n\n \n Now explain to me why we haven't found a paper trail of such dome. Also, where exactly did this stadium go after this invasion? Also, have we found any empty domes in iraq with nothing but a elevator inside them?\n \n Why must you go to outrgeous examples to prove what cannot be done with logic and reason? Also, your circular logic and inability to refute points is getting annoying. \n \n \nI don't recall mentioning a size (except large) but that doesn't matter. I could claim I was building an indoor soccer complex.\n\n \n Irrevelant. Traceble trail of labor, materials would exist. it's interesting how you refuse to comment on trails. \n \n \nI don't recall sizing the elevator shaft except to say that it was deep. Believe me, there are elevators that go down deep into the earth. All it takes is a hole, some guide rails and some cable.\n \n I did size the room at 10,000 square feet. That's really not a large room. 100 feet by 100 feet would do it. You could fit three such rooms under a single football field and not even be under the sidelines or endzones.\n\n \n Once again, extreme stupidity. A hole of that size require a huge amount of labor, which again is traceble. Then we have construction of a shaft that deep, which again requires a huge amount of labor. Then we have the machinery that must be required for such a dig, which leaves a trace. Not to mention that building a room to produce WMD requires a decent level of expertise, as well as ventelation, storage and testing, which is traceble. And then we have materials going in and out in a steady stream. And then we have the whole \"accident\" prone issue with chemical production. Why must you go to outrgeous examples to prove what cannot be done with logic and reason?\n \n \nBe more specific than \"large\". It's possible to have a complete chemical factory on ONE highway trailer truck.\n\n \n While that is possible, it's utterly retarded. One accident, and not only have you lost the facility, but you have released large quantities of chemical weapons and materials which can be tracked from litteraly space. Not to mention you'd likely kill a large amount of civilians, leaving a horrible emotion scar that would last in many people and be spread everywhere, and eventually we'd pick up on such a story. Let's think about it. When US chemicals, between raw and finished products are transported in truck on rail, they are encased in packaging that can withstand a direct hit from a locomotive going over 100 mph. There is a REASON for this. No XXXXX would actually put a ticking bomb in a truck and actually MOVE it. Not to mention that any production truck not moving would invaribly leak chemicals, and not moving it would saturate them enough so any decent detector could pick it up, therefore the truck MUST move. It's plausible, but not only extremely stupid, but extremely retarded. \n \n \nThat's not the point. We haven't found it for one of two reasons: A. We haven't looked in the right place yet. B. It doesn't exist.\n \n The possibility of its being built and going undetected is all I'm trying to convince you of. You're saying it's impossible...I'm saying you're wrong.\n\n \n I'm saying it is not likely because we haven't found anything that would support such a asseration, from paper trails, to labor trails, to stories of accidents, NOTHING. You are arging a senario with no evidence whatsoever. \n \n \nAge is relevant. Experience is relevant. My assertion is that you haven't been exposed to sufficient examples of large scale construction to realize that building things underground is not only simple to do but easy to hide from view. You haven't been exposed to projects built under the cloak of secrecy to realize that paper trails sometimes don't exist, even for large scale projects\n\n \n If we argue that way, then you yourself are applied to it, as you have shown little or no expierence. The problem with argument from authority is that often the person using it is, is using it fallaciously like you are. Paper trails may not exist, but labor does. So unless Saddam managed to kill off thousands of workers, their families, their friends, and everyone who knew them, you can't get rid of that. \n \n \nSpeaking of underground construction, did you know there's been a tunnel built under the English Channel between France and Great Britain? Did you know there are subway systems under large cities where trains carry thousands of people back and forth? Did you know there's a huge military command center built inside a mountain? Did you know there's a twenty story building with fifteen of the floors being underground?\n\n \n And every single one of those has huge paper and labor trails\n \n Thank you for admitting that large projects leave traceble elements, something we haven't found in Iraq. I always love it when my opponent states something that hurts their own argument.\n \n CCR1994 : All of that leads to the fact thqat iraq, like virtually every country has very basic ability to start a weapons production. It hardly proves that they did have them.",

If it was faulty intelligence, then significant amounts of WMDs having been present is a coincidence.\n\n \n According to bush and co, pretty much all the WMD intel we have recievecd since the first gulf war was false. Even the Bush administration has quite beating the \"WMD\" drum. They simply were not there. They did not exist. Our government has admitted it. There are some silly Americans out there that refuse to admit the fact, despite the fact that our own government has dropped that particular line.

The SCALE of the military deployment is immense, but I don't think they have quite the magic we should expect given their budget ;)\n\n \n Pointed in the right place at the right time is incorrect. When we take sattelite photos, we do not \"zoom in\" on a certain area. The photos taken are of such high resolution that we take pictures of several hundred square miles at a time then \"zoom in\" on the section of the massive, huge photo that we want. It takes a few seconds to focus the camera, set up your shot, and then take the picture and transmit it. The entire middle east is covered several times a day, (as is europe, asia, russia, most of N America). The images are scanned by computer for pre-programmed items of interest. I find it nigh impossible to believe that with all this, especially in light of the fact that Iraq has been an area of extreme interest for the US fro the last decade or more, to believe that he had all this going on without our knowledge. It is simply not possible. \n \n When I was in the service, you could request sattelite intel in many different forms. One of which was overall troop strenght for an entire nation or region. While the manpower estimates were obviously just that, estimates, they would give you a printout of how many of what kind of plane they had, jeeps, APCs, tanks, etc.... These were all generated by computer count fo the items from sat photos.\n \n Additionally, the possibility of a \"secret\" undreground bunker is absurd. There is simply no such thing. We have privatly owned mining sattelites that are able to detect thermal anomolies hundreds of feet underground, and our military stuff is MUCH, MUCH better than that. Suring Gulf I, the sat photos of Iraqs underground bunkers were able to pinpoint power generation sources, ventialtion shafts and layouts (which is how we managed to know where the optimum place to put the bunker busters was), and in many cases you could actually pick out personell if they were closer than 50 ft to the surface.\n \n This is just another delusional excuse made by those who lobbied do hard for the existance of WMD's, despite the fact that all logic dictated otherwise. Sure it makes them look foolish, but it seems that they prefer to look foolish rather than admit that they were wrong to begin with.\n \n We can count whales underwater from space........but we didn't notice the thousands of dumptrucks carrying hundreds of thousands, or even millions of cubic yards of dirt coming out of the new soccer stadium project?

Those who have held steadfastly to that particular belief, despite the fact teat even their patron saint has rejected it publicly, are lost causes.

Build a fence (concrete retaining wall) 8' tall, 100' x 100' inside dimensions and the dirt will stay in a compact square. If you don't want to expense the wall, slope the dirt 45deg at the edges and let it cover 108' x 108' at the base, leaving a 92' x 92' plateau at the 8' level.

   "An expansion on the commonplace practice of satellite mapping used by counties for property assessment values I commented on in an another post:\n \n The vendor (satellite user) uploads county property maps, listing each piece of property as a particular parcel number from parcels hundreds of thousands of acres in size right down to each American Dream 60' x 90' lot. The initial subscription includes a satellite pass that images the entire state. Uploaded parcel numbers are then merged into the overall image, which includes all buildings on each parcel, right down to the doghouse.\n \n The next contracted pass is one year later. Software then determines, by parcel, if any topographical changes have transpired; new buildings, roads (including unimproved [dirt]) swimming pools, sheds, lawns (water usage control legislation is in place and they are in color), dog houses and etc. It sorts changes by parcel number and produces a database of changes. All construction and landscaping permits, muni, county, state and federal, are identified by parcel numbers and matched against the satellite imagery report. The appropriate civil employee is provided a list of changes for his/her area of responsibility and investigates those changes to ensure the proper fees have been collected and zoning laws obaserved. That system is ten years old and results are delivered in 48 hours.\n \n This is a simple, common civil application. If someone wants to believe military satellite software applications are lagging behind that technology, easily utilized on a daily basis, when most civilian technology of that scope is a result of contracts let for development within our virtually unlimited military R&D programs, please pardon me for not conceding to that opinion. \n \n Iraq has received an inordinate amount of attention by every military and civilian entity with interests there for years.

All they had to do was mate the purchased chemicals to a delivery system.\n \n I keep forgetting though, some of you won't believe something unless it happens right before your own eyes. Reports of this and reports of that don't really mean anything until they all come together.\n \n When US satellites detect mass movement of tractor-trailers from Iraq into Syria at the same time other reports come from intelligence saying the Russians are helping dismantle and hide the weapons they provided to Iraq, it means absolutely nothing to the immovable skeptic.\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/3/2/230625.shtml\n \n Charles R. Smith\n Thursday, March 3, 2005 \n Moscow Moved Weapons to Syria and Lebanon \n According to a former top Bush administration official, Russian special forces teams moved weapons of mass destruction out of Iraq to Syria.\n \n \"I am absolutely sure that Russian Spetsnatz units moved WMD out of Iraq before the war,\" stated John Shaw, the former deputy undersecretary for international technology security.\n \n According to Shaw, Russian units hid Saddam's arsenal inside Syria and in Lebanon's Bekka valley. \n \n \"While in Iraq I uncovered detailed information that Spetsnatz units shredded records and moved all WMD and specified advanced munitions out of Iraq to Syria and Lebanon,\" stated Shaw during an exclusive interview. \n \"I received information from several sources naming the exact Russian units, what they took and where they took both WMD materials and conventional explosives. Moscow made a 2001 agreement with Saddam Hussein to clear up all Russian involvement in WMD systems in Iraq,\" stated Shaw. \n \n Shaw's assertions match the information provided by U.S. military forces that satellite surveillance showed extensive large-vehicle traffic crossing the Syrian border prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n \n Moscow Paranoid About WMD \n \n Shaw's information also backs allegations by a wide variety of sources of Russia's direct involvement in Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. One U.N. bioterrorism expert announced that Russia has been Iraq's \"main supplier of the materials and know-how to weaponize anthrax, botulism and smallpox.\" \n \n Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Robert Goldberg cited former U.N. weapons inspector Richard Spertzel, who stated that Moscow supplied Baghdad with fermentation equipment to produce biotoxins. \n \n According to Spertzel, the Russians on the U.N. inspection team in Iraq were \"paranoid\" about his efforts to uncover smallpox production. \n \n Goldberg noted that no country has \"done more to rebuild\" Saddam's chemical and biological weapons programs or \"been more aggressive in helping hide the truth\" than Russia. \n \n It is a fact that Saddam Hussein rose to power backed by Russian weapons and Russian money. Saddam was in debt to Moscow for over $8 billion for the arms he purchased from Russia when he was captured by U.S. forces.\n \n The primary Iraqi chemical weapons were VX nerve gas and mustard gas, a blistering agent, both obtained from Russia. \n \n According to the book \"Russian Military Power,\" published in 1982, \"It is known that the Soviets maintain stocks of CW (chemical weapons) agents.\" \n \n The two primary Russian chemical weapons in the 1982 Soviet inventory were the nerve agent \"VX\" and \"blistering agents - developments of mustard gas used so effectively in World War I.\" \n \n Russian Chemical Weapons in Iraq\n \n Iraq did most of its WMD killing using Russian-made MiG and Sukhoi aircraft equipped with chemical sprayers. In addition, Saddam used French-made artillery and helicopters to dump gas on Iranian troops and Iraqi Kurds. \n Iraq obtained Russian delivery systems and the same inventory of Russian-made chemical weapons at the same time. Iraqi SU-22 Fitter attack jets were armed with Warsaw Pact-designed bombs filled with chemical weapons. Iraq used these Russian jet fighters to drop chemical weapons on Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq war. \n \n Iraq tried to use these SU-22 jets during the 1991 Gulf War, but they were detected and destroyed on the ground before they could launch a deadly chemical attack. \n Other Russian weapons found with chemical weapons include the FROG-7 missile, 122 mm rockets, 152 mm artillery and the M-1937 82 mm mortars. All the Iraqi artillery missiles, rockets, shells and mortar rounds filled with chemical weapons are of Russian design.\n \n Iraqi forces were trained by Russians in the use of chemical weapons and equipped by Russia with anti-chemical suits. The Iraqi armed forces were trained, equipped and supplied with the proper logistics to perform chemical warfare by Russia. \n \n Lebanon and Syria \n \n The arming of Iraq with such weapons has a direct impact on events today in the Middle East. The presence of former Iraqi WMD systems in Lebanon raises serious questions surrounding the Feb. 14 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Many blame Syria for Hariri's murder. \n However, the possibility that Hariri discovered the location of the Iraqi WMD systems inside his country lends some credible backing to a Syrian assassination effort to silence him. \n \n In addition, the sudden sale of advanced missile and other weapons to Damascus by Moscow also supports the allegation that Syria is hiding something for Russia. \n \n Russian weapons makers have previously insisted on hard, cold cash payments for their missiles, especially after the fall of Saddam and the collapse of credit deals done with Baghdad. More importantly, the Syrian economy is in bad shape, making it difficult for Damascus to come up with the required money for advanced Russian weapons. \n Instead, it now appears that Moscow has extended both very good terms and no down payment required to Syria for an extensive purchase of advanced missiles and weapons. This is in contrast to weapons sales to other \"good\" Russian customers such as China, which can afford to pay up front for weapon systems. \n \n CIA Failed \n \n There is no question that the Russian effort to remove Iraqi WMD systems was the most successful intelligence operation of the 21st century. The Russians were able to move hundreds of tons of chemical, biological and nuclear materials without being discovered by CIA satellites or NSA radio listening posts.\n \n \"There is a clear sense on how effective they were,\" noted Shaw. \n \n \"The fact that the CIA did not know shows just how successful the Russian operation was,\" he concluded.",

He cannot be talking about all of it, as it is impossible to fit thousands of tons of weapons into a 2 car garage, even the densest material out there, thousands of tons would will a huge house.\n\n \n Here's part of David Kay's Intel Commitee testimony. It sheds some light on the difficulty of the task.\n \n \n\n STATEMENT BY DAVID KAY ON THE INTERIM PROGRESS REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE IRAQ SURVEY GROUP (ISG)\n BEFORE THE\n HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE,\n THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, SUBCOMMITTEE ON DEFENSE, AND THE\n SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n \n October 2, 2003\n \n Why are we having such difficulty in finding weapons or in reaching a confident conclusion that they do not exist or that they once existed but have been removed? Our search efforts are being hindered by six principal factors:\n \n 1. From birth all of Iraq's WMD activities were highly compartmentalized within a regime that ruled and kept its secrets through fear and terror and with deception and denial built into each program;\n \n 2. Deliberate dispersal and destruction of material and documentation related to weapons programs began pre-conflict and ran trans-to-post conflict;\n \n 3. Post-OIF looting destroyed or dispersed important and easily collectable material and forensic evidence concerning Iraq's WMD program. As the report covers in detail, significant elements of this looting were carried out in a systematic and deliberate manner, with the clear aim of concealing pre-OIF activities of Saddam's regime;\n \n 4. Some WMD personnel crossed borders in the pre/trans conflict period and may have taken evidence and even weapons-related materials with them;\n \n 5. Any actual WMD weapons or material is likely to be small in relation to the total conventional armaments footprint and difficult to near impossible to identify with normal search procedures. It is important to keep in mind that even the bulkiest materials we are searching for, in the quantities we would expect to find, can be concealed in spaces not much larger than a two car garage;\n \n 6. The environment in Iraq remains far from permissive for our activities, with many Iraqis that we talk to reporting threats and overt acts of intimidation and our own personnel being the subject of threats and attacks. In September alone we have had three attacks on ISG facilities or teams: The ISG base in Irbil was bombed and four staff injured, two very seriously; a two person team had their vehicle blocked by gunmen and only escaped by firing back through their own windshield; and on Wednesday, 24 September, the ISG Headquarters in Baghdad again was subject to mortar attack.\n \n What have we found and what have we not found in the first 3 months of our work?\n \n We have discovered dozens of WMD-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations during the inspections that began in late 2002. The discovery of these deliberate concealment efforts have come about both through the admissions of Iraqi scientists and officials concerning information they deliberately withheld and through physical evidence of equipment and activities that ISG has discovered that should have been declared to the UN. Let me just give you a few examples of these concealment efforts, some of which I will elaborate on later:\n \n * A clandestine network of laboratories and safehouses within the Iraqi Intelligence Service that contained equipment subject to UN monitoring and suitable for continuing CBW research.\n \n * A prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human testing of BW agents, that Iraqi officials working to prepare for UN inspections were explicitly ordered not to declare to the UN.\n \n * Reference strains of biological organisms concealed in a scientist's home, one of which can be used to produce biological weapons.\n \n * New research on BW-applicable agents, Brucella and Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), and continuing work on ricin and aflatoxin were not declared to the UN.\n \n * Documents and equipment, hidden in scientists' homes, that would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment by centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS).\n \n * A line of UAVs not fully declared at an undeclared production facility and an admission that they had tested one of their declared UAVs out to a range of 500 km, 350 km beyond the permissible limit.\n \n * Continuing covert capability to manufacture fuel propellant useful only for prohibited SCUD variant missiles, a capability that was maintained at least until the end of 2001 and that cooperating Iraqi scientists have said they were told to conceal from the UN.\n \n * Plans and advanced design work for new long-range missiles with ranges up to at least 1000 km - well beyond the 150 km range limit imposed by the UN. Missiles of a 1000 km range would have allowed Iraq to threaten targets through out the Middle East, including Ankara, Cairo, and Abu Dhabi.\n \n * Clandestine attempts between late-1999 and 2002 to obtain from North Korea technology related to 1,300 km range ballistic missiles --probably the No Dong -- 300 km range anti-ship cruise missiles, and other prohibited military equipment.\n \n In addition to the discovery of extensive concealment efforts, we have been faced with a systematic sanitization of documentary and computer evidence in a wide range of offices, laboratories, and companies suspected of WMD work. The pattern of these efforts to erase evidence - hard drives destroyed, specific files burned, equipment cleaned of all traces of use - are ones of deliberate, rather than random, acts. For example,\n \n * On 10 July 2003 an ISG team exploited the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) Headquarters in Baghdad. The basement of the main building contained an archive of documents situated on well-organized rows of metal shelving. The basement suffered no fire damage despite the total destruction of the upper floors from coalition air strikes. Upon arrival the exploitation team encountered small piles of ash where individual documents or binders of documents were intentionally destroyed. Computer hard drives had been deliberately destroyed. Computers would have had financial value to a random looter; their destruction, rather than removal for resale or reuse, indicates a targeted effort to prevent Coalition forces from gaining access to their contents.\n \n * All IIS laboratories visited by IIS exploitation teams have been clearly sanitized, including removal of much equipment, shredding and burning of documents, and even the removal of nameplates from office doors.\n \n * Although much of the deliberate destruction and sanitization of documents and records probably occurred during the height of OIF combat operations, indications of significant continuing destruction efforts have been found after the end of major combat operations, including entry in May 2003 of the locked gated vaults of the Ba'ath party intelligence building in Baghdad and highly selective destruction of computer hard drives and data storage equipment along with the burning of a small number of specific binders that appear to have contained financial and intelligence records, and in July 2003 a site exploitation team at the Abu Ghurayb Prison found one pile of the smoldering ashes from documents that was still warm to the touch.\n http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/speeches/2003/david_kay_10022003.html\n",

   "I do believe I said we haven't found it for one of two reasons a)We haven't looked in the right place b) It's been moved out of the country. Go back in this thread and see if that's not so. Talk about a circular argument! Jesus!\n\n \n Yet you refused to comment on why we haven't found anything in a country we control, we have 150,000 troops, plus several thousands mercenaries, that we can scan from space with specialized tools, and have roving chemical detectors that go across the entire country. You continually refuse to explain why those have failed to find them. \n \n You haven't refuted anything. \n \n \n\n Also, you are leaning on the false logic  that if we haven't found something, it cannot have ever existed.\n\n \n Well, if logic dictates that one needs the means, the know how and the money, and if one lacks some of those, then they cannot produce them. your false logic dictates that one can make something without the materials, plants or manpower. Also, it dictates that in the face of no evidence, that there must be something because you want it to be there. Not to mention your logic dismiss every refutation of why we haven't found anything. \n \n \nI repeat: Either..<< a)We haven't looked in the right place or ..<<b)It has been moved out of the country.\n\n \n Circular logic. Moving things requires having them. Having them requires making them and storing them. As of today we haven't found the labor, the vast materials, any trails of material or money, or any construction, such as your ridiculous hole in the ground under a dome that wouldn't have gone noticed in a decade of high intesnity US surveillance. emoticon_rolleyes Why must you go to ridiculous senarios to explain what you cannot with logic and science? \n \n \n\n The definition of obvious is obvious to 99.9% of the people on the forum.\n\n \n Well, let's consider your logic: that one can move what he does not have. it is quite clear your defintions differ from everyone's elses. \n \n \nYou seem to be singularly obtuse. Your effort here is to distract the argument from the main thrust which has become to convince you only of possibilities for attainment and storage of multiple small packages of deadly chemicals.\n\n \n Let's consider how much we are talking about. Bush cited THOUSANDS OF TONS of the stuff. Do you know how much a ton is? Do you know what kind of facility you need to produce that much? Not to mention store it? Your argument would fit with a small country making a few hundred tons of chemicals, not Iraq which was accused of THOUSANDS of tons. \n \n \n\n You haven't refuted the trailer truck. All you've done is to say it would take a huge plant to make the weapons. This is patently absurd.\n\n \n Obviously you didn't read the trailer truck part. I specifically noted how utterly retarded it would be do use it. Specifically noting that long term use in one place would leave traces outside, and any movement of such vehicle over time would invariably lead to a accident in a populated zone, releasing chemicals we could detect and leaving a huge horror story that would immeditely be reported. \n \n \n\n How many times must I say this? We haven't found it because either we haven't looked in the right place or it has been moved out of the country.\n \n\n \n Yet you refused to comment on why we haven't found anything in a country we control, we have 150,000 troops, plus several thousands mercenaries, that we can scan from space with specialized tools, and have roving chemical detectors that go across the entire country. You continually refuse to explain why those have failed to find them. \n \n \n\n Not to say that he had even ten plants, (because you will later say, \"prove it\") but IF Saddam had ten small plants each making only a quart of deadly chemicals (in liquid form) every week, he could make 520 quarts in one year. That's enough to kill hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n \n 524 quarts is 1/2 a ton. Bush claimed they had THOUSANDS of tons. To produce a 1000 tons, that would require 2000 years of production. To produce 100 tons a year would require a million quarts. That would require 19,230 plants. (1000000 qt = 31999999 onces = 999.9 tons)\n Once again, your claim of small scale, small number of plants is wrong. To produce large amounts of WMD with small scale requires small scale on a national level. You seem to be inclined to ignore what Bush claimed while supporting it at the same time\n \n \n\n Even if he had no production plants, he could have bought it already made.\n \n\n \n True, but that would require a huge transporation and storage network: both which are completely unaccounted for. \n \n \n\n You claim about the need for a plant to have to run thousands of years is laughable.\n\n \n If we used your math, to produce a 1000 tons, that would require 2000 years of production. The math shows that if we used your tiny mode with Bush's claims, there would be a need to run production for thousands of years. If Iraq had 10,000 tons, that would require 20,000 years of production. If Iraq had 100,000 tons of the stuff, that would require production for 200,000 years. \n \n \n\n You figured that one out properly. He wasn't talking about all of it...just enough to kill hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n \n You mean like the amount virtually every country has? \n \n \n\n Duo, you need to take heed of something Daewoo claims to believe.\n\n \n You need to realize you're argument is ridiculous. \n \n \n\n This has been your argument for some time now. \"we haven't found it, therefore it never was.\"\n\n \n Replace it with everything needed for a large scale weapons production program.",

Specifically noting that long term use in one place would leave traces outside, and any movement of such vehicle over time would invariably lead to a accident in a populated zone, releasing chemicals we could detect and leaving a huge horror story that would immeditely be reported. \nYes, I pointed out your false logic already in which you made some lame comment akin to \"who would do such a thing\". Whether it would be a \"retarded\" thing to do or not has no bearing on the possibility of its happening.\n \n \n \n\n Yet you refused to comment on why we haven't found anything in a country we control, we have 150,000 troops, plus several thousands mercenaries, that we can scan from space with specialized tools, and have roving chemical detectors that go across the entire country.

Neither is as dense as you.\n \n \n \n\n True, but that would require a huge transporation and storage network: both which are completely unaccounted for. \nYou're regurgitating things that have already been disproven. One truck can easily carry an 80,000 pound load. It happens daily.\n \n \n \n \n\n If we used your math, to produce a 1000 tons, that would require 2000 years of production.

You deny that without reason.\n \n I have claimed that underground construction can go on undetected. You deny that without reason. \n \n I have claimed that large quantities are nothing more than small quantities added together.

He didn't have to make them. All he had to do was hide them (in any number of places, small or large) until time to kill people, or until the time came that he should move them out of the country....as he did with the help of the Russians.\n \n Rant all you want, you cannot disprove any of that.",

   "Jim, doesn't the Bush administration say they made a mistake about WMDS? Also how can you be sure that solid evidence supporting or disputing your claims will eventually be found?\nI'm not sure of the exact wording of the Bush retraction. I think they claimed to agree that WMDs were not there immediately prior to the invasion, but their plan to invade moved forward nonetheless. I don't know what they said about the Russian help in moving them. (Maybe they knew beyond all doubt that the Russians had helped Iraq move them to Syria, but also knew we couldn't invade Syria.) I don't think Bush has ever said that WMDs were never there.\n \n We all know that the government does not reveal everything to us. I believe the Nixon tapes were sealed for years, some papers concerning Kennedy's assassination were sealed for years, and other instances have been hidden from \"public\" view (even though we ARE the government according to law).\n \n Read the linked article and I believe you will find a place where this knowledgeable author says he has no doubt whatsoever that the moving took place.\n \n I think the Bush haters have embellished the whole thing to conclude that he lied from the beginning about WMDs and that Saddam never had any at all.\n \n I'm not claiming that they are still there. I'm not claiming that there is an underground production site. All I'm claiming is that these things are possibilities that could go undetected for a long time.\n \n I don't know that solid evidence will ever be found. However, the truth has a way of coming out...eventually. I just hope it's not in the form of using the weapons.\n \n I do believe WMDs (chemical/biological) were there at one time. I don't know that Iraq had to produce them themselves (they could have purchased them already made).\n \n Arguing about the lack of our noticing trace elements from production is a distraction. The original post had nothing to do with who made the weapons, where they were made, where or how they were stored. It concerned the Russians helping the Iraqis move \"something\" into Syria and Lebanon. I firmly believe (though I personally have no proof) that the Russians did help the Iraqis move \"something\". I believe that \"something\" is likely WMDs in chemical/biological form (possibly stamped \"Made in Russia\").\n \n The digressions about construction techniques and what can go undetected under ANY ROOF (not just a domed stadium) were distractions from the OP topic. I was trying to convince you-know-who that things can go undetected simply by going underground and that underground construction is not difficult at all. There still could be things buried in Iraq that we will NEVER find.\n \n (Recently, a tunnel nearly a quarter of a mile long was discovered between a Texas farm and a Mexican building. According to you-know-who's logic, we should have seen thousands of workers and thousands of dump trucks at least on one end of the tunnel, and we should be able to find a paper trail. (LOL) It may be hard to fathom, but such a tunnel could actually be built without a single dump truck. It wouldn't take much imagination to see how an underground room could have been constructed somewhere in the middle of the tunnel.)",

The means of removing all traces of production and storage, not to mention hiding huge volumes of labor, materials, money and transporation. \n\n Right here:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n \n \nComming from the one's who logic dictates that one can move what they do not have, that the sloppiest regime can do what the most efficent, well funded cannot, that with the best scanning out there, that the sloppiest regime outfoxed one of th emost efficent governments out there, I find that all too rich.\nI think that was in post # 120.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n I've been laughing at your dome senario for quite some time, as well as the rest of your claims. \nBuy yourself a ticket to a domed stadium event. Go sit in the top row and imagine someone digging in the middle of the field and piling the dirt up inside the dome. As I said earlier, a small child should have no trouble visualizing this.\n \n \n \n\n Well, seeing how you keep ignoring 70-90% of my posts, I don't really have much to use eh?\nI guarantee that you have neglected to respond to more of my requests than I have yours.

I'm not convinced of the 100,000 figure. Even if it's correct, I don't know how many were combat enemies or civilians. I'm sure there're some of each.\n \n If you're referring to the Lancet study, it's not been confirmed.\n \n http://www.iraqbodycount.net/press/\n \n \n \n This site says 16389 min to 18670 max civilians. \n \n There is no way of telling how many people would have died had we not done what we did.\n \n It's also difficult to say who died from combat and who died from natural causes and diseases.\n \n \n Finally, we reject any attempt, by pro-war governments and others, to minimise the seriousness of deaths so far recorded by comparing them to higher figures, be they of deaths under Saddam's regime, or in other much larger-scale wars. Amnesty International, which criticized and drew attention to the brutality of the Saddam Hussein regime long before the governments which launched the 2003 attack on Iraq, estimated that violent deaths attributable to Saddam's government numbered at most in the hundreds during the years immediately leading up to 2003. Those wishing to make the \"more lives ultimately saved\" argument will need to make their comparisons with the number of civilians likely to have been killed had Saddam Hussein's reign continued into 2003-2004, not in comparison to the number of deaths for which he was responsible in the 1980s and early 1990s, or to casualty figures during WWII.",
