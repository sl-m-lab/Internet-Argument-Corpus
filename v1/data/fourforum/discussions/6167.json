Anybody have anyone they have used before?\n\n \n I'm most familiar with Nevada, no state income taxes, which does offer 24hr service, but the resident agent (required in most states) has to physically pick filings up from the state office after registration:\n \n http://secretaryofstate.biz/comm_rec/crforms/llc_index.htm\n \n Do a google on Nevada incorporation and there are a kajillion companies specializing in cheap, fast incorporation. I've always done my own (it's all online) and never had any real urgency. Getting the federal ID is an additional step and without that business bank accounts can't be opened. 24hrs for all will be a challenge.",
