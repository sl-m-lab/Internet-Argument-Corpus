   "DALLAS (AP) - A shootout outside a north Dallas bank has left at least two people wounded and customers and employees locked in the bank's vault.\n \n The shooting happened just before 11 a.m. outside the United Texas Bank. The bank is located on the first floor of the Four Forest high-rise office building, near the intersection of U.S. 75 and Interstate 635 at 12221 Merit.\n \n A Dallas Police spokesman says that it was a targeted shooting and not a random act. Two men, father and son, were the gunman's victims. Both have been taken to a hospital and are in stable condition. The gunman was shot in an altercation with police. His condition is not known at this time.\n \n A witness tells KRLD-AM of Dallas that a bank customer went outside, then came back inside and said, \"You'd better lock your doors.\" Another witness reported seeing a man sitting in a chair with blood all over his chest.\n\n BREAKING NEWS: SHOOTING IN DALLAS OFFICE TOWER - CTnow\n \n Ah, the good old gun-crazy US of A.",

   "I'd just like to make a couple points here. 1) being that more than 99% of gun ownership in the US is legitimate. They're obtained, owned (and operated) legally by law-abiding citizens who in no way deserve to have that right stipped from them. 2) of all crimes committed, crimes committed by those licensed to (concealed) carry: 0.02%. Those who are licensed to carry are among the most law-abiding citizens in the country. Why would you want to disarm those people and eliminate their most effective means of self protection from those who illegally obtain weapons (criminals)?\n \n The point remains, and WILL remain that - if guns are banned, the law-abiding will theoretically turn theirs in, while the criminals will not. Why? Because they're criminals. Now those who remain armed, the criminal element, have free reign over the law-abiding without fear of Mr. or Mrs. Smith using a gun for self-protection. ...Meanwhile, SCOTUS has declared that it's not the job of the police to protect Mr. and Mrs. Smith. So that leaves self-protection to the individual, does it not? So... my own protection is left in my own hands, but you want to take from my hands the most effective tools I can use to protect myself and my family? The same tools that the criminals are using? I'm sorry (not really) but I'm not one who says \"BAAAH\". I say \"WOOF\".\n \n The police are the good guys, right? Well, so is the vast majority of the public. Wouldn't you want MORE armed \"good guys\"? I sure do. I want armed good guys to outnumber armed bad guys by as much as possible. THAT, folks, is how to tackle the criminal element. Give them the fear that if they decide to commit violence, chances are great that they would recieve more violence than they could give.\n \n There's also the point that with more people carrying, and gun laws being loosened, violent crime is dropping, even with times getting tougher. It's working.\n \n Lastly, I'd like to see some arguments from anti's after doing some serious reading here: \n \n w w w . t h e a r m e d c i t i z e n . c o m",

It sums up the very common sense logic for preserving and encouraging the law abiding citizen to keep and bear arms in our society. Unfortunately for you, the leftist anti rights opposition will either ignore your post completely or ignore the logic of it as they post another story of some whack job who abuses our freedom and kills someone with a gun. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH, they will never consider our right and responsibility to defend ourselves and our families since we all know the police are only a responsive force rather than a defensive or preventative force. \n \n I wonder why these same opponents of self defense don't cry foul and insist that automobiles be banned every time some irresponsible person drives drunk and kills another car full of people on the open road? After all, I believe more people are murdered from drunk driving than from gun murders in the USA each year.",
