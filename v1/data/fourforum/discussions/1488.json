   "The thing with extreme left and right-wing thinkers, is that they are often trouble.\n Look at Communism, especially the USSR; how many people died in the purges and starvation.\n Look at Fascism, ie Hitler, and look how many people dies because of his nationalistic views. Left wingers and right wingers are never going to appeal to everyone. Left wingers want equal status, so working classes like them, but no-one likes to be equal to someone else. There will always be thick people and clever people, so you need different school to supply their needs. Right-wingers are nationalists, so the natives will like them, but then a massive clamp down on immigrants and immigration follows.",
