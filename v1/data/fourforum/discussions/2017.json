   "Do you think Clarke's statements before the current committee, his previous statements and statements in his new book are consistent?\n\n \n I haven't read the book, but I see no reason not to believe him. I love to hear people attack his credibility by pointing out him statement while he was working for the administration. He says that he was asked to highlight the positives, while ignoring the negatives. To this, critics seem suprised and appalled that someone working for an administration would put spin on things to make the administration seem like they are doing a good job. Is there anyone in the world, no matter how naive they are, who really believes that every spokesmen for every administration does not do this????\n I actually find it kind of scary that people who support the adminstration are so convinced that the administration can do no wrong, that they immidiately dismiss anyone who says anything against them even if they were once part of that administration, and they are highly credible.",

Whether he is or not will only be know with time, if then. He appears to genuinely believe that the Bush administration did not heed warnings he felt he gave before 9/11.\n \n But did anyone see the interview that Condoleezza Rice gave on CNN the other morning. I am an admirer of Rice and think she has done a pretty good job of advising the president based on what she says on TV. However during the interview she talked rapidly and in a high-pitched voice and her eyes blinked often, sometimes several times in a row. I was extremely surprised at her demeanor during the interview. My wife even said something along the same line before I could say something to her. Remember in the first Gulf War when Saddam was on TV and the analysis by physiologist said he was scared because his eyes were blinking so much. I immediately wondered what Rice was scared of during the interview.",
