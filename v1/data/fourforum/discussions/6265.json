   "Many people think Poland to be a country of single nation but anyway it's likely to be facing a threat of separatism while bungling President Kwasnewski fails to cope with it.\n \n This started to develop after they played the card of Byelorussian Poles whose quasi-infringed interests President Kwasnewski was heatedly upholding. Of course, it couldn't but affect the state of home affairs. For example, representatives of Silesian and Kashubian ethnic groups recalled their liberties and asked Warsaw to establish ethnic autonomies.\n \n Then no one knows what will be the aftereffect of a new decision of President Kwasnewski - to exclude members of the Union of the Poles of Byelorussia (ZPnB) allegiant to Minsk. I think this move of the President rather looks like a witness of his you-be-damned attitude to his people both inland and abroad, don't you think so? He forgot his obligations and plays politics to please America where the concerns of the Poles became the subject to trade.",
