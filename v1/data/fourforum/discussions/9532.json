   "From this thread, in the creation / evolution forum;\n \n \nAlso, JPSartre12, your inbox is full and I can't reply to your PM. Suffice it to say, I'm fine with your selection of judges and I'll see you (and Marc9000) on Monday. \n\n \n I also agreed with his selection of judges, and PM'd him about it. In his PM that suggested the judges, he indicated that we could start Monday. Monday is waning away and he isn't yet here to start the thread - he's probably busy - I don't see why I shouldn't start it off. The details are few. If I'm jumping the gun, extra time can be worked out for peeling to respond to this, my first post. \n \n Resolved: Evolution is atheistic.\n \n I'm arguing for the affirmative, with peeling arguing for the negative. It's a generally worded resolution that I believe I can show in a general way. A 5/4 post structure, with me beginning and ending the debate. 72 hours maximum between posts, with a 48 hour stopped clock on the weekends. There will be three judges - JPSartre12 will judge as well as moderate, the other two judges will be Daewoo, and SpicyGirl. As in all past judged debates, their decisions are final and respected. Also, as in recent past judged debates, I'm assuming that our final posts (my fifth - his fourth) should consist mostly of a recap of why we believe we won, with little if any new arguments put fourth. \n \n So I'll new get started with a thanks to the three officials, and my opponent. I always enjoy these, win or lose. :) \n \n __________________________________________\n \n Evolution, like several other subjects, is somewhat synonymous with the person that made it popular, that sparked its' development. When we think of the origins of aviation, we think of the Wright Brothers. When we think of the origins of the telephone, we think of Alexander Graham Bell. When we think of the origins of the automobile in the U.S. many of us think of Henry Ford. And when we think of the origins of evolution, we think of Charles Darwin. While these were all brilliant men, it must be acknowledged that they were also in the right place at the right time. They pioneered something that the public was ready for; air travel, improved communications, transportation for the masses, and a thoughtful alternative to religion. But all of the above things have made enormous progress and change since their famous founders work was done. We can't closely associate the Wright Brothers with the details of todays' 747's, we can't credit Henry Ford with todays' automobiles electronics, we can't associate Alexander Graham Bell with many details of todays cell phones, and likewise, we can't closely associate Charles Darwin with evolutionary thought and application as it is happening today. In all of these cases, many other lesser known, often equally as brilliant men, shaped them into something that their originators would barely recognize. From Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins, and hundreds in between, evolution has gone a long way from mere biological change over time, its made it all the way to \"an all embracing concept\", in the words of Sir Julian Huxley, in 1959. \n \n While evolution is still considered an innocent science by many, and atheism is a basic worldview, a simple belief that there is no God, it's easy to see that both are controversial, both seek naturalism, and they philosophically reinforce each other. A few more things that make proponents of each difficult to distinguish between would be;\n \n *They both equally oppose exploration of the concept of Intelligent Design\n \n *They both equally seek and promote purposelessness in origins\n \n *They both have equal disdain for creationists and creationism\n \n *They often share the exact same views concerning other controversial sciences, such as astrology, cosmology, geology, etc. \n \n These things and more cause them to reinforce each other whenever they are confronted with a conflict, and they do it well. Yet at certain times, those who specialize in only one attempt to distance themselves from the other! Here are examples;\n \n www.talkorigins.org is strictly a \"mainstream scientific\", evolutionist website, it claims no affiliation with atheism in any way. Lets look at a few of their comments about atheism;\n \n \nThere is nothing wrong with being an atheist if you want to be an atheist. That some people disapprove only shows that there is something wrong with religious bigots. \n \n Due mainly to its being rife with intellectual dishonesty, creationism also drives some people to atheism. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA602_1.html\n \n These statements, particularly the words I highlighted, hardly show the neutrality (both religious and emotional) that mainstream science claims to adhere too. Now at a close by page, lets see how they change their tune when it may seem like they're getting too close to atheism;\n \n \nMany, perhaps most, evolutionists are not atheists.\n \n Evolution does not require a God, but it does not rule one out either. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA602.html\n \n Then this one, close by at http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA602_1.html\n \n \nNaturalistic explanations of origins are not necessary for atheism. Nobody in the world can explain the origin of everything anyway. Leaving one more thing unexplained does not much matter. \n\n \n Now, moving to the other side of the coin, the \"about\" websites have pages by one Austin Cline, a promoter of atheism and humanism. He holds Arts degrees and directs various councils and alliances, but seems to have no scientific credentials. Lets look at his thoughts on evolution;\n \n \nThe principle behind evolution is pretty simple: species adapt to their surroundings and those who reproduce the most are those who pass more genes on to the next generation. The behaviors and genes of the best reproducers are what determine the behaviors and genes of future generations. What makes one group reproduce more is not necessarily what is best for living itself, though.\n \n Many people believe that evolution has basically stopped in modern humans - in particular, because modern medicine and technology are saving people who would have died before and, therefore, are preventing the unfit from being eliminated. This is based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution.\n \n Evolutionary theory is threatening to many people - they assume that if evolution is true, then this undermines people's ability to value themselves and their accomplishments. In reality, evolution should probably help us to be thankful and happy for what we have achieved because we have managed to accomplish so much with so little. \n\n \n http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutevolution/Evolution_vs_Creationism_Conflict_Between_Science_and_Religion.htm\n \n We see how Mr. Cline makes positive, assertive statements about evolution. Then on another page, he trys to distance atheism from evolution, like this;\n \n \n\"Atheism isn't a belief system of any sort, much less a religion that is being promoted. Atheism isn't even a belief, but were we to grant that it is a belief a single belief can't qualify as a belief system. Evolution isn't a part of atheism and neither is atheism a part of evolution - or, if it is, it is no more part of evolution than it is a part of plate tectonics and relativity. Evolution is no more a \"pillar\" of atheism than it is a \"pillar\" of any other aspect of science. \n\n \n http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutevolution/Evolution_vs_Creationism_Conflict_Between_Science_and_Religion.htm\n \n If a person, or a group has a worldview AND a science that compliment each other so well, as their websites constantly show, why do they sometimes seek to separate them? It's a key question, one that's important for my opponent to address. It's easy to see atheists like Clines' support of evolution, and it's easy to see talkorigins (or most evolutionists) disdain for religion. Evolution and atheism are both controversial, and they both work together, and strengthen each other. It's easy to see that Mr. Cline and those at talkorigins believe in both very strongly. Why is it that the ones who believe in both very strongly are the ones who are the most adamant about separating them? It makes no sense, except in the light of politics. Neither position can advance - make less controversial - its position if it doesn't sometimes work with the other position, yet it can't be exposed as clearly working with the other position! They have to walk a fine, yet crooked line, by being inconsistant according to the challange / conflict they're dealing with at the time. A large part of the inconsistancy is a broadening / narrowing of the definition of the word \"evolution\" - hence the controversy about definitions that led up to this debate. The general rule seems to be to narrow (or retreat to) the definition of only to \"biological change over time\" in a direct discussion like this one, yet if it's a presentation to a larger, more passive audience that may not be a format for challanges and questions, then the definition can be broadened to include change over time in cosmology, geology, human behavior - the entire metaphysical or ideological picture that has been built on or around evolution. \n \n From page 174 of his book \"Finding Darwin's God\", Kenneth Miller, an evolutionist, puts it this way;\n \n \nBut unlike mitosis, protein synthesis, or signal transduction, evolution almost begs for extrapolation. The success of the natural sciences have led one analyst after another to extend Darwinian thinking into a series of distinctly nonbiological enterprises, even into the study of religion. \n\n \n I agree, and I believe I can show what one analyst after another has done with Darwinian thinking, by simply calling it \"evolution\", (the complete package of evolution with its facts and theories and all the rest of it) and using it as a tool to promote the political ideology of organized atheism in today's western culture - thoroughly enough to prove the resolution in a general way. \n \n How this debate goes may depend on how involved we get with word definitions, so I'll end my first post here and allow my opponent to have some influence in that regard.",

   "I'd like to add my thanks to marc's for the judges' time and kind interest in adjudicating this debate. Game on!\n \n --------------------------------------------------------\n \n My opponent hopes here to convince you of a very specific resolution, 'evolution is atheistic', by contriving a 'general sense' in which the resolution can be read as true. \n \n However, although some interpretive latitude is permissible, one should bear in mind at all times that marc's resolution is a challenge directed toward those who claim that evolution is not atheistic - and such people are invariably making a statement about 'biological evolution' and 'a belief in the non-existence of god' respectively. It accomplishes nothing for him to show that some cultures may be evolving to be less religious, because in that sense evolution is just a word for 'gradually changing' - in which case marc would have to prove that the words 'gradually' and 'changing' are also atheistic, and after that the words 'slowly' and 'becoming'. It is also the case that many cultures are and have in the past evolved to become more or differently religious - notably most Christian countries. Christianity itself has gradually changed - evolved and even speciated - over time. Should evolution be deemed uniquely Christian on that basis? \n \n Most usages of the word 'evolution', and even terms like 'mutation' and 'speciation', when applied analogously to non-biological systems, are plainly value-neutral with respect to religion and atheism; they are words encapsulating kinds of change, nothing more. Marc's case must therefore rest on a single foundation: that there is something inherently atheistic about the fact or theory of biological evolution.\n \n I will therefore focus my rebuttal of this resolution upon showing that it is false in any sense applicable to a discussion of biological evolution or the belief in the non-existence of god. However, I will not simply hide behind raw dictionary definitions: I will instead show that atheism is a prerequisite for neither the inference of biological evolution from observation nor the subsequent formulation of the Theory of Evolution, and that far from evolution serving any real or imagined atheistic 'cause', it is the misguided tilting at evolution's windmill by special-interest groups (organised or otherwise), epitomised by marc's own hostility, that permits any significant atheistic mileage to be derived from the controversy - and indeed inspires the peeved retorts he has quoted in an attempt to support his own position.\n \n It should be borne in mind at all times that my rebuttal of this resolution is based purely upon its inaccuracy, and does not constitute tacit acknowledgement that atheism is in any way 'bad' or that association with atheism is inherently distasteful.\n \n Atheism and the Scientific Method\n \n \nWhile evolution is still considered an innocent science by many, and atheism is a basic worldview, a simple belief that there is no God, it's easy to see that both are controversial, both seek naturalism, and they philosophically reinforce each other.\n\n \n Marc takes the sturdiness of his foundations absolutely for granted and makes no attempt to prove this 'philosophical alignment'. This is based upon his implicit assumption of a link between atheism and pursuit of the scientific method. The assumption goes roughly thus: \"Since the theory of evolution is arrived at by the scientific method, and the scientific method excludes the possibility of the supernatural, the scientific method and therefore the ToE are atheistic.\"\n \n The first crack in this initially sound-seeming argument is that one could replace 'evolution' with 'gravitation', or indeed any number of other useful, practical, 'innocent' scientific tools, and reach the same conclusion. The theory of gravitation excludes any number of supernatural explanations for why things might fall, yet marc raises no objection; he does not advocate the teaching of 'intelligent descent' in schools as an alternative to physics. Why? What makes one aaplication of the scientific method 'innocent' and another not?\n \n The obvious answer, that gravitational theory isn't saying anything about god, is actually incorrect: the precursors of today's gravitational theory were once every bit as controversial as marc likes to think evolution is today, because it contradicted the theologically derived belief that celestial motion would occur in perfect circles with the Earth at the centre of creation. It's particularly pertinent to this discussion that today's gravitational and cosmological theories are far more complex, beautiful, exciting and deeply hypersymmetric than our earlier, simplistic notions of what constitutes perfection or 'how god would do things'.\n \n That's worth thinking about for a moment longer. Our initial beliefs regarding celestial motion were derived from our own, limited, human assumption of what would be 'the most impressive', and we scorned scientists who actually looked outside their own heads and found that the universe worked otherwise. Effectively, we were saying to those scientists \"My god would never do such sloppy work!\" Imagine how embarrassed you would feel if that was just your boss you were talking about and he was standing behind you the whole time, especially if what you perceived as sloppiness was actually ingenuity beyond your ability to comprehend.\n \n The lesson to be learned here is subtle - and, from marc's perspective, devastating: we are inevitably enlightened more by dilligent study of the one thing god, if he exists, certainly did make (the universe) than from clinging to any preconceived notions we might have about what is 'most impressive' and trying to force the universe to conform. The scientific method does not exclude god; how could it, if he created the very thing science studies in such detail? Marc is confusing atheism with naturalism - the latter being perfectly compatible with the notion of a god as the origin of natural law.\n \n This, then, is why the scientific method is not inherently atheistic, and why many scientists are happily religious: in excluding the supernatural or magical the scientific method saves us from making an XXX of ourselves in the sight of god. It places our utter and unreserved trust in the fact that god would not use the universe to lie to us, and thus protects us from the sin of cleaving to imagined magical forces or theories merely because they are palatable to our ego.\n \n Evolution and Atheism\n \n So if all scientific theories ultimately say something about god (and are viewed by religious scientists as our best hope for discovering the truth about his works), why is marc singling out evolution as being atheistic?\n \n Well, first we have to distinguish between the fact and theory of evolution. The fact of evolution is written in the genes of every living creature and in the distribution of fossils within geological layers throughout the earth's crust, the ages of which are confirmable via multiple independent methods. Absolutely every scrap of evidence the universe has to give about the history of life on earth points to common descent and speciation over billions of years. Let me reiterate: that is not the theory of evolution. The theory is an attempt to deduce and verify mechanisms by which evolution has proceeded.\n \n Typically, creationists try to make the case that evolution uniquely makes god out to be somehow less than he is (billions of years of creation as opposed to a few days), or denigrates him by handing his creative power over to 'chance and chaos', or that it seeks to exclude him entirely.\n \n The first criticism is of the observed fact of evolution, and stems mainly from confused thinking, easily dealt with by adjusting one's perspective - ironically enough to the one most creationists' own religion advocates. According to the bible, god exists outside of time; to such an entity the whole universe of time and space would be visible at once as a magnificent four-dimensional sculpture. How much 'time' did that sculpture take to create? None at all, if you're talking about our time, the time integral to the sculpture itself. Our observation that human life is constrained to a slice beginning billions of years 'up' that sculpture is therefore no more an indictment of god's powers than our observation that human life is also constrained to within a few miles of the surface of a single sphere of rock and water - and no more in doubt, either. Time and space are both just dimensions, after all.\n \n Furthermore, the overwhelming evidence that god did not create a universe-sculpture in which life was present in its current form from the very 'bottom' is no indication that he could not had he so wished. Analgously, the well-established height of Everest does not preclude god's ability to have created a still taller mountain; he simply chose not to. It is intuitively obvious that the universe would not be a 'better' or 'more perfect' creation if Everest was a bit taller than it actually is - why then should the universe be deemed a 'worse' or 'less perfect' creation based on the timing and method by which life reached its current state?\n \n The second criticism, this time of the theory, stems from a lack of understanding - possibly due to lack of study - of the theory itself. The ToE is not a story of pure chance and chaos any more than an individual human life is a story of pure chance and chaos. It is a story of order overmastering chaos, harnessing it's power to create variation and (gently or robustly) selecting from it forms of - to a remarkable degree - ever greater sophistication and intelligence. Evolution can be viewed as a testament to one of god's more profound and subtle achievements in creating the laws that govern this universe. Compare that to the picture painted by marc's interpretation of Christianity: a world not even ten thousand years old and already rotting and collapsing after 'the fall': talk about shoddy workmanship!\n \n The last and most regularly levelled accusation, that evolution seeks to exclude god entirely, was most likely inspired by the unfortunate title of Darwin's infamous book 'The origin of species' - a close second to 'the pursuit of happiness' in the running for the crown of 'term most likely to be misunderstood by laymen'. What should be remembered is that the title refers to the origin of the plurality of species: why and how they diverge. It does not speak to the ultimate origin of life, the universe and everything - a distinction all too often overlooked when Origins is described as the 'Atheist's Bible'. Nor has any refinement of the theory since then encroached on ultimate origins. Upon the ineffable question of 'why does anything bother existing at all?' evolution, like all science, is rightly silent.\n \n So is there any reason to deem evolution, fact or theory, as atheistic? Compare its derivation with the theory of gravitation discussed earlier: scientists investigating the natural world found it increasingly impossible to reconcile what they were seeing with conventionally accepted creation stories. What should they choose to believe? A book, written, translated and interpreted by humans, or the world itself, created directly by god?\n \n And the naturalistic theory developed to explain the undeniable fact of evolution - is that atheistic? Consider the alternative: we ignore natural law (god's creation) and invent our own magical explanation with no idea of its accuracy. And for why? Hubris, perhaps, or the unsubstantiated belief that god prefers us to come up with arbitrary magical explanations than carefully deduced naturalistic ones?\n \n Whatever marc's motivation in making this claim, he does not speak for the majority of religious people. Evolution is a threat to him, yes: it's a threat to the graven image of his own personal interpretation of scripture. But it is not the assault on faith itself that he would like us to believe.\n \n The Perception and Politics of Evolution\n \n Having established that there is nothing inherently atheistic about scientifically drawing inferences from observations of god's creation, we find ourselves in rather murkier political waters, and it is here that marc hopes to score some emotive points in his favour:\n \n \nA few more things that make [proponents of atheism and proponents of evolution] difficult to distinguish between would be;\n \n *They both equally oppose exploration of the concept of Intelligent Design\n \n *They both equally seek and promote purposelessness in origins\n \n *They both have equal disdain for creationists and creationism\n \n *They often share the exact same views concerning other controversial sciences, such as astrology, cosmology, geology, etc.\n\n \n Taking each of his points in turn:\n \n They both equally oppose exploration of the concept of Intelligent Design\n \n What you will actually find is that the vast majority of scientists, be they religiously inclined or not, oppose - not the philosophical exploration of the concept of ID, but it being taught as a science when it does not meet the criteria for being one. I say 'philosophical' because it has never been explained to anyone's satisfaction precisely what scientific exploration of ID would entail, given that the founding hypothesis of ID is that there is no natural explanation to be found. If you begin a treasure-hunt with the assumption that there is no treasure, where do you dig first?\n \n There is at least one large and well-funded institute for creation research, and it has so far produced nothing of any scientific value whatsoever. I'll return to the whys and wherefores of this momentarily.\n \n They both equally seek and promote purposelessness in origins\n \n This is factually incorrect. Marc is describing the nihilist philosophy. A theistic evolutionist might describe the purpose of all life and evolution as a greatly extended version of our own individual journeys to find god - which, if true, has to count as the greatest pilgrimage of - literally - all time. An atheist evolutionist might say that life and intelligence defines and serves its own purpose.\n \n In either case, how can a universe where life is evidently assembling itself into more sophisticated and intelligent forms be deemed less purposeful than one that is decaying from initial perfection?\n \n They both have equal disdain for creationists and creationism\n \n Again, it is the vast majority of scientists of all faiths and none, as well as many respected religious scholars, who denounce Creationism and ID as counterproductive in the fields of both science and religion.\n \n The reason for this is quite straightforward: Creationism, and especially its latest incarnation as I.D, is a fraud. It is not an attempt to do science; it is a misguided and potentially catastrophic P.R. exercise. Those behind the I.D. movement look at science and religion and see that one has a lot of very bright looking people with lab coats, shiny equipment and letters after their name, who have the irritating habit of churning out ideas and inventions that cure diseases and otherwise benefit society, while the other, regardless of its spiritual virtues, is stuck with a rather old-fashioned and stodgy public image. I.D. is a conscious and deliberately disingenuous attempt to redress that balance in the public eye: it doesn't matter that the Institute for Creation Research has never published anything of any value, or that its core hypothesis actively precludes, you know, research. The majority of the public never read peer-reviewed journals anyway. What matters is that now both sides exhibit lab coats, letters after their names and big, shiny laboratories, and that the I.D'ers can make political capital out of every entirely lawful ruling that excludes them from places they have not earned the right to be, namely science classrooms.\n \n The creationism movement is something quite seperate from the simple, personal choice to believe that god created the world in one manner or another, and is as demeaning to those of faith as it is to the practice of science - and especially to those of faith who practice science.\n \n They often share the exact same views concerning other controversial sciences, such as astrology, cosmology, geology, etc\n \n Once again, marc has no evidence to suggest that those 'exact same views' aren't shared by pretty much all scientists, of all faiths and none.\n \n Moving on to marc's carefully-chosen quotes:\n \n \nYet at certain times, those who specialize in only one attempt to distance themselves from the other! Here are examples;\n \n There is nothing wrong with being an atheist if you want to be an atheist. That some people disapprove only shows that there is something wrong with religious bigots.\n \n Due mainly to its being rife with intellectual dishonesty, creationism also drives some people to atheism.\n \n\n \n Look at the first line; what does it actually say? It says there's nothing wrong with being an atheist, and that those who disapprove are religious bigots. It doesn't say that all religious people are bigots. It is, in fact, simply speaking the truth: intolerance is intolerance, be it for another faith or for someone with none.\n \n The second line also speaks candidly: I.D is a poorly-disguised thin end of the wedge for introducing Christianity to the science classroom. It has no meaningful scientific agenda and yet purports to be a scientific movement - it is a sham. And when those taken in by Creationism see the fraud exposed, their broader faith can be irreperably damaged. Creationism does nobody any favours.\n \n \nNow at a close by page, lets see how they change their tune when it may seem like they're getting too close to atheism;\n\n \n An alternative explanation is that they were never that close to atheism in the first place. They could simply be impartial and honest. I believe that marc is seeing what he wants to see: atheists ashamed of themselves and dissembling so as not to invite the scorn they deserve. What I see is people in the same predicament I find myself here: certain religious groups wrongly declare that 'Evolution is atheistic' with the silent rider: 'and that's a bad thing.' The contributors to that website, like myself, are trying to set both records straight: evolution is not atheistic, and atheism is not a bad thing.\n \n \nWe see how Mr. Cline makes positive, assertive statements about evolution. Then on another page, he trys to distance atheism from evolution, like this;\n\n \n Here we are looking straight at evidence contradicting marc's assumptions. Mr Cline is an atheist, but understands perfectly well that evolution exists as something entirely seperate from questions of faith or a creator god. Why else would he say what he does? He's an atheist and humanist, writing to promote the virtues of his philosophy - he doesn't see it as something to be ashamed of or keep hidden or separate. One doesn't lightly toss aside evidence that genuinely supports one's own philosophy, so the obvious reason for him saying evolution is not a prop for atheism is that it really isn't. \n \n Were Answer in Genesis to discover the bones of Adam and Eve tomorrow, or conclusive proof of a young earth, or any other evidences of biblical creation, do you think they - out of sheer delight in being devious - would refrain from cramming it down the throats of anyone in range as confirmation of their beliefs? Or would they be handing out a free bible to all readers?\n \n The Great Atheist Conspiracy Theory - evolution as atheism's own 'wedge strategy', complete with universal adherence to a Fight Club style code of silence, is nothing more than a fantasy, one whose tenuous credibility is further undermined by the comparatively crude and obvious machinations of the I.D / Creationist movement, who can't even manage to keep their 'secret' Christian agenda off the front page of their website. Is marc seriously suggesting that atheists have all the good devious conspirators?\n \n Marc himself acknowledges that 'evolution' has many shades of meaning, from the biologically specific 'change in allele frequencies over time' to more general terms describing gradual change in any system. In this next extract, Kenneth Miller is talking about evolution as the general principle of variation and selection leading to improved fitness:\n \n \nFrom page 174 of his book \"Finding Darwin's God\", Kenneth Miller, an evolutionist, puts it this way;\n \n But unlike mitosis, protein synthesis, or signal transduction, evolution almost begs for extrapolation. The success of the natural sciences have led one analyst after another to extend Darwinian thinking into a series of distinctly nonbiological enterprises, even into the study of religion.\n\n \n In today's world where the principles of evolution are routinely and intelligently leveraged by human beings, a world of microprocessors refined by mutation and selection, it's easy to forget that prior to Darwin, the generally accepted philosophical position was that selection could only eliminate the unfit. Philosophers had never even considered the possibility that variation and selection could result in adaptive change. \n \n Where have we heard this story before?\n \n The success of Darwinism as an explanatory and predictive theory validated the principle, and opened our eyes to other examples of 'evolution' that had been going on all around us, all the time - just like the earth had been going round the sun all the time we believed the reverse to be true, and before that when we thought it was a ball of fire and the earth was flat, and before that when we didn't really give it much thought at all.\n \n This is the diaspora of 'evolutionary' theories marc wants us to percieve as an atheist conspiracy: our scientific awakening to a principle inherent within natural law, as ubiquitous as gravity. We would have been intellectually derelict not to test its application elsewhere.\n \n \nI agree, and I believe I can show what one analyst after another has done with Darwinian thinking, by simply calling it \"evolution\", (the complete package of evolution with its facts and theories and all the rest of it) and using it as a tool to promote the political ideology of organized atheism in today's western culture - thoroughly enough to prove the resolution in a general way. \n\n \n The reality is rather more mundane. Richard Dawkins may have said that evolution allows one to be an intellectually satisfied atheist, but the broader truth is that it allows many more people, scientists or otherwise, to be intellectually satisfied believers, too. The evidence in support of biological evolution isn't only visible to atheists; they don't have special sunglasses or something. Millions of people all around the world have successfully made peace with their faith and their intellect while denying neither: they believe in a god who makes sense and who doesn't use rocks, genes and stars to lie to them.\n \n And that's what will, in the end, be marc's undoing in this debate. He can knock himself out painting conspiracy theories, but at the end of the day he's going to have to face up to the fact that millions upon millions of devout believers around the world - including at least one Pope - simply don't have a problem with evolution. \n \n Is the Pope an atheist? No, marc: he's a catholic.",

No, marc: he's a Catholic \n\n \n Here is a brief, general outline of the Catholic position;\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/adam_eve_and_evolution.asp\n \n This one sentence sums up its relevance to this debate the best I think;\n \n \nThe Catholic Church has always taught that \"no real disagreement can exist between the theologian and the scientist provided each keeps within his own limits. \n\n \n If evolutionists proclaim or imply that the book of Genesis is an allegory, or that Adam and Eve were not real people of history, this link clearly shows that the Catholic church believes that THAT version of evolution has not kept \"within its own limits\". The Catholic church's desire to NOT FIGHT evolution is not even close to being a full acceptance of evolution. The Catholic church has plenty of experience with political battles, and they are not pleasant ones. \n \n http://www.religionnews.com/weblogs/religionblog/2005/07/galileos-ghost-haunts-catholics-on.html\n \n From the mess with Galileo centuries ago, to more current messes with abortion and birth control, the Catholics are haunted with political battles, and the best way to keep atheists from bankrupting and destroying them is to stay out of them, even if it means co-operation with honeyed \"Clergy Letter Projects\" and other vaguely worded public relations statements, to ward off atheist attacks. It's simply dishonest for atheists to imply that Catholics reject the book of Genesis. \n **\n \n Now, the basic outline of my first post went like this;\n \n \n (Kenneth Miller)........evolution almost begs for extrapolation. The success of the natural sciences have led one analyst after another to extend Darwinian thinking into a series of distinctly nonbiological enterprises, even into the study of religion. \n\n \n \noriginally posted by marc9000 I agree, and I believe I can show what one analyst after another has done with Darwinian thinking, by simply calling it \"evolution\", (the complete package of evolution with its facts and theories and all the rest of it) and using it as a tool to promote the political ideology of organized atheism in today's western culture - thoroughly enough to prove the resolution in a general way. \n\n \n Your reply was predictable, as this line of my first post stated;\n \n \n originally posted by marc9000 ....the general rule seems to be to narrow (or retreat to) biological change over time, in a direct discussion like this one.....\n\n \n and your reply;\n \nThe reality is rather more mundane. Richard Dawkins may have said that evolution allows one to be an intellectually satisfied atheist, but the broader truth is that it allows many more people, scientists or otherwise, to be intellectually satisfied believers, too. The evidence in support of biological evolution isn't only visible to atheists; they don't have special sunglasses or something. Millions of people all around the world have successfully made peace with their faith and their intellect while denying neither: they believe in a god who makes sense and who doesn't use rocks, genes and stars to lie to them. \n\n \n So your claim is that Dawkins claim is true, that evolution strengthens the resolve of atheists, and can also strengthen the resolve of believers? Evolution strengthens each opposing belief to conflict with each other in increasing amounts? Deeper explorations of evolution proportionately create deeper divides between atheists and theistic evolutionists? Biological evolution, in its most narrowly defined scientific form, contains evidence that some people (atheists/Dawkins) can observe and use to ridicule religion, write books about Blind Watchmakers, etc., while others (theistic evolutionists/Miller) use that exact same evidence to write books about \"Finding Darwins God\", to claim a religious experience more meaningful, more profound, than Bible studying religious people have ever experienced before? They both can't be right, it must always be kept in mind that one of these groups is 100% wrong about what evolution is telling them concerning origins, and the other is 100% right. As they continue to divide, do you believe the time will come when you become uncomfortable, as an atheist, to masquerade as a theistic evolutionist, as you are doing in this debate? \n \n \nMarc takes the sturdiness of his foundations absolutely for granted and makes no attempt to prove this 'philosophical alignment'. This is based upon his implicit assumption of a link between atheism and pursuit of the scientific method. The assumption goes roughly thus: \"Since the theory of evolution is arrived at by the scientific method, and the scientific method excludes the possibility of the supernatural, the scientific method and therefore the ToE are atheistic.\"\n \n The first crack in this initially sound-seeming argument is that one could replace 'evolution' with 'gravitation', or indeed any number of other useful, practical, 'innocent' scientific tools, and reach the same conclusion. The theory of gravitation excludes any number of supernatural explanations for why things might fall, yet marc raises no objection; he does not advocate the teaching of 'intelligent descent' in schools as an alternative to physics. Why? What makes one aaplication of the scientific method 'innocent' and another not? \n\n \n Because studies of gravitation, or other scientific tools, seldom if ever cause people of different worldviews to become increasingly hostile towards one another. Have you noticed gravitation, or other useful practical scientific tools being at the center of high profile court cases involving human behavior? Let's look at another paragraph from atheist Austin Cline;\n \n \nEvolution is perhaps the only area of science which has been transformed into a legal issue on which courts around the country have had to render decisions. No one initiates lawsuits over the teaching of gravity, physics, chemistry, or any other part of the science curriculum. It's also highly unlikely to find heated legislative debates over the status of such topics in public schools, and that makes evolution relatively unusual. \n\n \n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/evo/blevo_law.htm\n \n Right away, we can see a difference between evolution and gravitation. We can now see a difference between evolution and all other forms of science. Mr. Cline labels evolution \"relatively unusual\" in this case, a soft phrase to lead him down his vague, unsupported implication that it is only creationists who drag it into court. You can read those following paragraphs of his and let me know if you'd like to discuss exactly where the lawsuits originate and how they've generally played out, but the first paragraph does the best job of answering your question. I think it would be more accurate if the words \"relatively unusual\" were replaced with the one word \"different\". Courts are not scientific places, they are about human behavior. If evolution represents nothing but naturalism in the courts, and atheism considers nothing but naturalism in its human behavior conflicts in the courts, does atheism have an ally in evolution? \n \n \nThe obvious answer, that gravitational theory isn't saying anything about god, is actually incorrect: the precursors of today's gravitational theory were once every bit as controversial as marc likes to think evolution is today, because it contradicted the theologically derived belief that celestial motion would occur in perfect circles with the Earth at the centre of creation. It's particularly pertinent to this discussion that today's gravitational and cosmological theories are far more complex, beautiful, exciting and deeply hypersymmetric than our earlier, simplistic notions of what constitutes perfection or 'how god would do things'.\n \n That's worth thinking about for a moment longer. Our initial beliefs regarding celestial motion were derived from our own, limited, human assumption of what would be 'the most impressive', and we scorned scientists who actually looked outside their own heads and found that the universe worked otherwise. Effectively, we were saying to those scientists \"My god would never do such sloppy work!\" Imagine how embarrassed you would feel if that was just your boss you were talking about and he was standing behind you the whole time, especially if what you perceived as sloppiness was actually ingenuity beyond your ability to comprehend. \n\n \n What you're doing is ridiculing the beliefs of yesterday, particularly the reluctance to accept exploration of the new idea of origins for godless evolution, and showing complete confidence in todays theories, even though they constantly fail to provide evidence of origins for godless evolution. There is actually little difference in the thinking of evolutionists/atheist of today, vs the theologians of yesterday, when their beliefs are challenged. It's simply a support of the status quo, a hostility towards a challenge to ones own feeling of invincibility. It's human nature. Your example of; \"My god would never do such sloppy work\" is comparable to Richard Dawkins reference to religious people as being \"ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that)\" Human emotion hasn't evolved in the slightest since our most basic beliefs about celestial motion. \n \n \nThe lesson to be learned here is subtle - and, from marc's perspective, devastating: we are inevitably enlightened more by dilligent study of the one thing god, if he exists, certainly did make (the universe) than from clinging to any preconceived notions we might have about what is 'most impressive' and trying to force the universe to conform. The scientific method does not exclude god; how could it, if he created the very thing science studies in such detail? Marc is confusing atheism with naturalism - the latter being perfectly compatible with the notion of a god as the origin of natural law.\n \n This, then, is why the scientific method is not inherently atheistic, and why many scientists are happily religious: in excluding the supernatural or magical the scientific method saves us from making an XXX of ourselves in the sight of god. It places our utter and unreserved trust in the fact that god would not use the universe to lie to us, and thus protects us from the sin of cleaving to imagined magical forces or theories merely because they are palatable to our ego.\n\n \n This seems to be a key point throughout your entire post, that science has ways of KNOWING what happened in the past - millions or billions of years ago. The fact is, history is available only for the past few thousand years. The beginning of written records dates back to somewhere between 2200 and 3500 BC. in Egypt. No one can possibly KNOW what happened before there were people to observe and record what happened. Darwin knew this, but highly influential extrapolators like Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett have taken evolutionist speculations to a plateau of invincibility. It is dogma that is shared by both evolutionists and atheists, as they stand shoulder to shoulder to shout down traditional religion. Their hostility (and yours) is at a different level than most religious people, who would honestly like to be able to live in harmony with science, by having thoughtful comparisons to both worldviews when they conflict. Whatever names you choose to call Intelligent Design, it simply is not a thought police. We see thought police in todays evolution \"Bulldogs\", whether they claim to support evolution or atheism. Public school curriculum battles are proof of it. \n \n \nSo if all scientific theories ultimately say something about god (and are viewed by religious scientists as our best hope for discovering the truth about his works), why is marc singling out evolution as being atheistic?\n \n Well, first we have to distinguish between the fact and theory of evolution. The fact of evolution is written in the genes of every living creature and in the distribution of fossils within geological layers throughout the earth's crust, the ages of which are confirmable via multiple independent methods. Absolutely every scrap of evidence the universe has to give about the history of life on earth points to common descent and speciation over billions of years. \n\n \n Here you have started with evolutionary biology, and made a seamless extrapolation into geology, paleontology, and astronomy. (I meant to use the word \"astronomy\", not \"astrology\" in my opening post by the way :xbanghead ) \n \n \nLet me reiterate: that is not the theory of evolution. The theory is an attempt to deduce and verify mechanisms by which evolution has proceeded. \n\n \n And things that are NOT the theory of evolution are also used to deduce and verify mechanisms by which evolution has proceeded.  We may be close to a breakthrough here. Evolution, often with the help of atheism, moves into countless other areas, both scientific and non scientific , empirical and non empirical, philosophical and humanist, as it attempts to \"deduce and verify\" and it can often be almost undetectable. Here's another example from a recent thread in the creation/evolution forum here;\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=9468\n \n \n Post #1 Let's just see how this argument would go:\n \n Biological evolution is stated as the change in allele frequencies\n Atheism is a disbelief and strong rejection of a belief in a higher power\n \n Can anyone make a argument that biological evolution is atheistic? \n\n \n \n Post #2 ......There is no way of knowing whether God helps to sort the genes in a population, or whether a Designer makes certain mutations happen in a non-random manner.....\n [snip]\n .......I can, with certainty, say that what we know about evolution does falsify the Genesis account of creation and the flood story because there never was a world wide flood, the sequences described in Genesis contradict those found in the fossil record (such as the creation of flowering plants before fish), and it took longer than 6 days for all this to occur. So eveolution is inconsistent with certain beliefs about God.....\n\n \n Post #1 was only about biological evolution. Post #2 touched on biology, and quickly moved on to geology and paleontology, in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion. Poster #1's response in post #4 made no reference to it - I'm sure he didn't even notice it. Judges, would you have noticed it had I not pointed it out? Even ~I~ wouldn't have noticed it had I not been preparing for this debate. \n \n \nMarc himself acknowledges that 'evolution' has many shades of meaning, from the biologically specific 'change in allele frequencies over time' to more general terms describing gradual change in any system. \n\n \n THERE'S THE BREAKTHROUGH - If you'll glance around 4forums, particularly this thread, you'll see that \"marc himself\" (without your help) has been trying to convince evolutionists and atheists alike of that fact for many months now, and have been getting the exact same type of grief about it from many evolutionists and atheists as they attempted to shout me down. Evolutionists and atheists alike have been emotional, and dishonest, to the same degree in this regard. This shows that one very significant \"shade\" of evolution, is atheism. According to many famous extrapolators, \"Bulldogs\", it's far more than just a shade. Are you now willing to admit that the \"fine, yet crooked line\", described in my opening post, of definitions that atheists and evolutionists constantly walk, is true, and is no longer an issue in this debate? \n \n \nThe last and most regularly levelled accusation, that evolution seeks to exclude god entirely, was most likely inspired by the unfortunate title of Darwin's infamous book 'The origin of species' - a close second to 'the pursuit of happiness' in the running for the crown of 'term most likely to be misunderstood by laymen'. What should be remembered is that the title refers to the origin of the plurality of species: why and how they diverge. It does not speak to the ultimate origin of life, the universe and everything - a distinction all too often overlooked when Origins is described as the 'Atheist's Bible'. Nor has any refinement of the theory since then encroached on ultimate origins. \n\n \n I agree the title is unfortunate. We can use other words to describe it; WRONG immediately comes to mind. Or maybe just MISLEADING. Either way, we can't blame laymen for misunderstanding it. It was titled that way for a reason, and the reason certainly wasn't to demean itself. The title of a book doesn't change or cheapen the content of a book, but what a title does is get the attention of a potential reader, and that is ultimately the goal of any book, attention and sales. So by saying \"ORIGIN of Species\", it implies that it addresses origins, WITHOUT GOD. An eye catcher for atheists! The \"talkorigins\" webgroups title is unfortunate, wrong, misleading in the same exact way. It works very well - Origin of Species is still on the shelves of libraries and bookstores all over the U.S., and atheists constantly use talkorigins to make their points. \n \n \nUpon the ineffable question of 'why does anything bother existing at all?' evolution, like all science, is rightly silent. \n\n \n Not in the courts. It speaks loudly in the courts. It says it doesn't matter. If it feels good, do it. We are nothing but animals. If biological evolution says that woman is dead, pull the plug. If biological evolution says that baby isn't yet alive, abort it. Militant atheism says exactly the same thing. \n \n \noriginally post by marc9000 They both equally seek and promote purposelessness in origins. \n\n \n \nThis is factually incorrect. Marc is describing the nihilist philosophy. A theistic evolutionist might describe the purpose of all life and evolution as a greatly extended version of our own individual journeys to find god - which, if true, has to count as the greatest pilgrimage of - literally - all time. An atheist evolutionist might say that life and intelligence defines and serves its own purpose. \n\n \n No, it is correct - they both seek a comparable, individual purpose. A theistic evolutionists desire to \"find God\" would be an individual, changeable purpose to suit his or her own personal pleasure - an ability to define God however they wish. An atheists desire to define life as a purpose would equally suit their own personal pleasure - an ability to disregard God however they wish. These are private, changeable purposes, not comparable to an overall, collective purpose defined by a higher power, and unchangeable. \n Let's look at nihilism;\n \n http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/nihilism.htm\n \n The differing beliefs concerning personal, set-by-human purpose vs collective, set-by-God purpose can quickly divide those beliefs concerning politics and philosophy - their views concerning the baselessness of values, destruction of values, \"epistemological\" (human knowledge) failures, loyalties, etc. While the purpose of creation as described by Judeo-Christianity, with it's collective purpose, would have the other view. Todays political battles make it obvious - how often do we hear references to the \"religious left\" or the \"liberal right\"? It's always the religious right or the liberal left. There are a few exceptions to the general rule of course, but not enough to be significant. Individual human purpose vs a higher collective purpose causes human division. Still another example of evolutionists and atheists being in lockstep. \n \n \n \n originally post by marc9000 They both have equal disdain for creationists and creationism. \n\n \n \n \nAgain, it is the vast majority of scientists of all faiths and none, as well as many respected religious scholars, who denounce Creationism and ID as counterproductive in the fields of both science and religion. \n\n \n ~One~ of Catholicism's \"leading liberals\", who was \"stripped of his licence to teach theology\" translates into \"respected religious scholars?? Even so, it's just another example of Catholic desire to stay out of political battles that I outlined above. \n \n \nThe reason for this is quite straightforward: Creationism, and especially its latest incarnation as I.D, is a fraud. It is not an attempt to do science; it is a misguided and potentially catastrophic P.R. exercise. Those behind the I.D. movement look at science and religion and see that one has a lot of very bright looking people with lab coats, shiny equipment and letters after their name, who have the irritating habit of churning out ideas and inventions that cure diseases and otherwise benefit society, while the other, regardless of its spiritual virtues, is stuck with a rather old-fashioned and stodgy public image. I.D. is a conscious and deliberately disingenuous attempt to redress that balance in the public eye: it doesn't matter that the Institute for Creation Research has never published anything of any value, or that its core hypothesis actively precludes, you know, research. The majority of the public never read peer-reviewed journals anyway. What matters is that now both sides exhibit lab coats, letters after their names and big, shiny laboratories, and that the I.D'ers can make political capital out of every entirely lawful ruling that excludes them from places they have not earned the right to be, namely science classrooms. \n\n \n That is what evolutionists say, and that is what atheists say. The emotional talking points are identical. \"I.D. tries to block the curing of disease. I.D. never publishes anything of any value, it never researches. It likes to play dress up with lab coats\" - on and on. Atheists and evolutionists alike attempt to portray upon I.D. what they fear the public may see in themselves, that evolution has itself become a project in theology by atheists. I.D. is a young movement, inspired by modern scientific methods and discoveries - discoveries that are sometimes very troubling to philosophical, atheistic evolutionary theories. Evolution has not been able to put a nick in the brick wall (origins) that atheists have faced for a long time. It's not changing, and philosophy and blockage of alternative explorations can't mask it. This origins problem is so persistent that only atheism can proclaim that there is no possible way to encounter empirical evidence of design in nature. Evolution, if it were true science, would not philosophically rule exploration out. Yet it does, just like atheism. \n \n \nThere is at least one large and well-funded institute for creation research, and it has so far produced nothing of any scientific value whatsoever. \n\n \n There is more than only one.\n \n http://www.iscid.org/\n \n The international Society for Complexity, Information and Design is also a representative for the concept of Intelligent design. It lists over 50 research fellows, including full-fledged senior faculty from schools like Oxford University in England, Princeton University in the U.S., the University of Sydney in Australia, the University of Auckland in New Zealand, Hanyang University in Korea, Helsinki University of Technology in Finland, and the State University of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt, Germany. These people cover the complete range of the natural sciences. One of them, Fritz Schaefer, the inventor of computational quantum chemistry, has been considered for the Nobel prize 5 times. I could go on, but suffice it to say this work cannot, and has not, been completely ignored by the scientific community. Atheists and evolutionists will continue to shout it down somewhat successfully, but true science has not yet come to terms with several of its discoveries, most notably the work of Michael Behe. \n \n Could you please provide me with one or more links that show similar details to the theological beliefs of theistic evolution? I don't believe you're going to be able to do it - there seems to be as many variations of theistic evolution as there are theistic evolutionists. You've shown us that atheists like yourself can easily join them at will. I'd like to find out, for starters, if there are two distinct divisions of theistic evolution; one that believes in the actual historical existence of Adam and Eve, and one that does not. \n \n If you can't provide some kind of documented, worldwide organization for theistic evolution as I have for Intelligent Design, if it is nothing more than a vague, murky hangout for the uninterested (Catholics), the uninformed (unchurched believers), and atheists (yourself) then simple logic tells us it may be a fraud. \n \n I have italicized several questions in this post - I think it's important that you address them. Hopefully, we are beyond definitions distractions now.",

   "Your opening post consists of 3429 words, less references and quotes. My opening post that you are rebutting consisted of 1376 words, including references. You directly quoted only 239 words of my post, and disregarded 937 of my words.\n\n \n Your post consisted of 955 words excluding quotations. You used 264 to say that evolution has had a lot of work put into it since its discovery (no argument there), and another 294 to summarise and reiterate the points I responded to in detail. MS Word tells me I directly quoted 259 of the remaining 397, in which you made - and failed to substantiate - claims as to the supposed inherent atheistic bias of evolution, and then went on to derive a global atheist conspiracy, apparently based on TalkOrigins and a man called Cline denying that evolution was inherently atheistic. \n \n It would not, therefore, be unfair to describe your opening post as 'disappointingly light on content'. Given the fact that you have been waiting for months for someone to take up your debate challenge, I can only assume this is a strategy intended to keep your powder dry until I have no posts left with which to formulate a rebuttal.\n \n \nIf you used 3429 words to respond to 239 of mine, you're not debating, you're ranting. <snip<Mr. Huxley was actually a pussycat compared to the evolution bulldogs of today, who seek to shout down traditional religion rather than actually debate it.\n\n \n Not at all; with so little to rebut I simply chose to spend my time dealing with an assumption you clearly felt it beneath you to substantiate.\n \n \nI'll also have to take a look at theistic evolution, which you as an admitted atheist this recent thread ~ post #3 have cloaked yourself with.\n\n \n Come now, marc, my personal philosophical standpoint is not exactly a state secret, and I explicitly said that I was opposing this resolution on the grounds that it was incorrect, and not because atheism was anything to avoid being associated with. Should I have worn my standard-issue atheist T-shirt to avoid confusion?\n \n I simply brought up the relevant point that the vast majority of scientists of all religions have no trouble reconciling evolution with their faith. Since you have had this fact slung at you in every thread in which this debate has been mooted, it beggars belief that you did not expect it to arise. This feigned surprise and intimations of skulduggerey afoot are, like the character-assassination of evolutionists and atheists in your first post, an attempt to score emotive points.\n \n Moving on regardless:\n \n \n...the increasingly popular implication that Catholics believe evolution trumps the book of Genesis. That is where I'll start;\n \n Here is a brief, general outline of the Catholic position;\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/adam_eve_and_evolution.asp\n \n This one sentence sums up its relevance to this debate the best I think;\n \n The Catholic Church has always taught that \"no real disagreement can exist between the theologian and the scientist provided each keeps within his own limits.\n\n \n Let's put that one sentence in some sort of context. Also from that page:\n \n \nConcerning cosmological evolution, the Church has infallibly defined that the universe was specially created out of nothing.<snip<\n \n The Church does not have an official position on whether the stars, nebulae, and planets we see today were created at that time or whether they developed over time (for example, in the aftermath of the Big Bang that modern cosmologists discuss).\n \n Concerning biological evolution, the Church does not have an official position on whether various life forms developed over the course of time. However, it says that, if they did develop, then they did so under the impetus and guidance of God, and their ultimate creation must be ascribed to him.\n\n \n Given that evolution describes a process guided by natural law, this clearly counts as 'the impetus and guidance of God' in a universe of his creation and design.\n \n \nConcerning human evolution, the Church has a more definite teaching. It allows for the possibility that man's body developed from previous biological forms, under God's guidance, but it insists on the special creation of his soul.\n\n \n The Catholic church is being as good as its word: it is delineating its spiritual territory and clearly and explicitly accommodating not just evolution but cosmology as being compatible with the Catholic faith.\n \n Marc is correct in likening this situation to the 'mess with Galileo' I referred to in my last post, except that here the mess is being avoided by thoughtful, careful assessment of both the scientific evidence and what the bible actually has to say on the subject of creation. The conclusion reached is that evolution is not incompatible with Catholicism. The care taken to avoid endorsing evolution in the process is scrupulous and understandable: it would not be appropriate for the church to throw its weight behind a scientific theory any more than it would be right to oppose it on unscientific grounds.\n \n \nIf evolutionists proclaim or imply that the book of Genesis is an allegory, or that Adam and Eve were not real people of history, this link clearly shows that the Catholic church believes that THAT version of evolution has not kept \"within its own limits\".\n\n \n I don't personally think that inference is as 'clear' as marc claims, but that's really beside the point. We are not here to decide whether there exist atheists who might say such things or Catholics who might disagree with them. It is incumbent upon Marc to show that evolution itself is inherently atheistic, and the Catholic church's statement on the subject is that it is not even incompatible with their faith, let alone the existence of god.\n \n One irony is that in making the following statement, slyly phrased as a rebuttal of a claim I never made, marc inadvertantly closed the door on what was potentially his strongest avenue of attack:\n \n \nIt's simply dishonest for atheists to imply that Catholics reject the book of Genesis.\n\n \n My whole argument is that evolution and religion can coexist; why on earth would I want to imply that evolution has led Catholics to reject Genesis? If anyone should be angling to make that claim it is marc!\n \n The most revealing words here, however, are more of marc's own:\n \n \n The Catholic church has plenty of experience with political battles, and they are not pleasant ones. <snip< From the mess with Galileo centuries ago, to more current messes with abortion and birth control, the Catholics are haunted with political battles, and the best way to keep atheists from bankrupting and destroying them is to stay out of them, even if it means co-operation with honeyed \"Clergy Letter Projects\" and other vaguely worded public relations statements, to ward off atheist attacks.\n\n \n Two things leap out of the screen at me when reading this. The first is the recurring theme that anybody who disagrees with marc automatically forfeits the right to be credited with the default human quota of integrity, honesty, or intelligence. Hence the Catholic church could not possibly have reached their decision after careful investigation, deliberation, prayer and much soul-searching. No; they must have dishonestly capitulated for the sake of a quiet life - just like every theistic evolutionist must be stupid or a liar, and everyone who says evolution is not atheistic must be part of a global conspiracy.\n \n The second is something conspicuous by its absence. Nowhere does marc attach any significance to, or even acknowledge, the fact that in its disagreement with Galileo the church was wrong. Most people would imagine that would have had at least some bearing on the final outcome, yes? But no: here it's a purely political issue; only who won or lost matters to marc, not why. \n \n The Catholic church lost - and lost face - because they were wrong. They tried to deny and conceal the truth, on the presumption that contradicting the church was the same as denying god. So if, as marc says, their statement re. evolution is based on painful lessons learned in the past, that's a pretty good indication that they believe themselves to be facing a similar situation: they understand that the evidence supporting evolution is practically unassailable and it would be not only counterproductive but wrong to make a stand against it - not just because they would lose, but because if something about god's creation is true, it cannot be inherently atheistic.\n \n \nSo your claim is that Dawkins claim is true, that evolution strengthens the resolve of atheists, and can also strengthen the resolve of believers? Evolution strengthens each opposing belief to conflict with each other in increasing amounts? Deeper explorations of evolution proportionately create deeper divides between atheists and theistic evolutionists?\n\n \n Hardly. My analogy of choice would be food: pizza enables an atheist to be a well-fed atheist, just as it enables a believer to be a well-fed believer, because pizza itself is value-neutral with respect to their philosophies. Without evolution, atheists and theists alike would starve for lack of a satisfactory explanation - natural or supernatural - for the evidence surrounding them, should they choose to seek one.\n \n \nThey <atheists and theistic evolutionists< both can't be right, it must always be kept in mind that one of these groups is 100% wrong about what evolution is telling them concerning origins, and the other is 100% right.\n\n \n Untrue. Evolution is telling them exactly the same factual things about part of the journey life has taken. One's spiritual interpretation of that journey, and of ultimate origins and natural law, is up to the individual and remains a personal matter.\n \n \nAs they continue to divide, do you believe the time will come when you become uncomfortable, as an atheist, to masquerade as a theistic evolutionist, as you are doing in this debate?\n\n \n It's gratifying to be proved correct so quickly. I'm disagreeing with marc, so naturally I'm 'masquerading'; I'm lying; I'm being dishonest; I have a hidden agenda. As I suspected, marc's entire first post was nothing more than a setup for character assassination. Tell me, marc, which end of the multi-million-long queue of people who have to be dishonest and conniving in order for you to be right do you want me to join?\n \n The truth is, I have neither concealed my personal beliefs, nor made any attempt to describe myself as a theistic evolutionist. I have merely done my best to put their case forward alongside my own.\n \n \n<evolution is being singled out< Because studies of gravitation, or other scientific tools, seldom if ever cause people of different worldviews to become increasingly hostile towards one another.\n\n \n We're not here to decide whether evolution ticks you off because it contradicts the beliefs you hold; we're here to decide whether a theory's contradiction of your personal beliefs makes it atheistic.\n \n \nHave you noticed gravitation, or other useful practical scientific tools being at the center of high profile court cases involving human behavior?\n\n \n No. Religion has rarely made theological pronouncements about matters relating to those areas of scientific endeavour. That doesn't mean there's anything scientifically or philosophically unusual about the study of evolution; rather it's an area amenable to naturalistic investigation that certain minority interpretations of certain religions have chosen in advance to have strong views about.\n \n \nRight away, we can see a difference between evolution and gravitation. We can now see a difference between evolution and all other forms of science.\n\n \n Not in the slightest. The method followed is the same, the rigorous requirements for evidence, repeatability and peer-review are the same. What you are claiming is akin to saying that drops of rain that land where you're standing are fundamentally different to the rest because they get you wet.\n \n \nIf evolution represents nothing but naturalism in the courts, and atheism considers nothing but naturalism in its human behavior conflicts in the courts, does atheism have an ally in evolution? \n\n \n That's a pretty muddled question. 'atheism considers nothing but naturalism in its human behaviour conflicts in the courts'? What does that even mean?\n \n The courts regularly rule in favour of religion in those cases where the free practice of religion is perceived to be infringed, and agonise endlessly over troublesome practices like the religious ingestion of proscribed substances. The cases to which you refer, whether aggressive or defensive, without exception relate to attempts by creationists to insert religious material into science textbooks and classrooms in violation of your country's constitution.\n \n Had atheists asked that the law be changed so that all bibles must contain a disclaimer stating that Genesis is a controversial version of events and should not be taken literally, and had their case upheld, your accusations would have some merit. Has that ever happened? Has anyone even brought such a case to court?\n \n \nWhat you're doing <in mentioning theological geocentricity< is ridiculing the beliefs of yesterday, particularly the reluctance to accept exploration of the new idea of origins for godless evolution, and showing complete confidence in todays theories, even though they constantly fail to provide evidence of origins for godless evolution.\n\n \n Earlier, marc stated that evolution has not caused Catholics to abandon Genesis. To that he has now added that it has not made any headway towards proving godless origins - another statement I wholeheartedly endorse.\n \n By marc's own admission, then, the facts and theories of evolution do not materially support atheism. He therefore has no logical grounds upon which to prosecute his resolution that evolution is atheistic.\n \n \nThere is actually little difference in the thinking of evolutionists/atheist of today, vs the theologians of yesterday, when their beliefs are challenged. It's simply a support of the status quo, a hostility towards a challenge to ones own feeling of invincibility. It's human nature.\n\n \n Then it is a failing to which we are both prone in equal measure. That's why we are engaged in debate: to make our cases.\n \n \nThis seems to be a key point throughout your entire post, that science has ways of KNOWING what happened in the past - millions or billions of years ago. The fact is, history is available only for the past few thousand years. The beginning of written records dates back to somewhere between 2200 and 3500 BC. in Egypt. No one can possibly KNOW what happened before there were people to observe and record what happened.\n\n \n Marc's distinction between kinds of historical evidence is a false one. The veracity of written history is subject to the same critical analysis as all other forms: can it be corroborated? Can it be independently verified? Can we find evidence of the places and events described?\n \n Certainly, written history enables us to know things that would not otherwise be preserved, but it is not true that it is the only way to know anything about the past or that it is even the most reliable record in some areas, dependent as it is upon the disposition and understanding of the author or patron. The evidence indicating an evolutionary history is widespread and robust, existing within every living cell as well as within geological layers dated by several independent methods and the biogeographical distribution of species. It is arguably among the most well-corroborated of all historical facts.\n \n \nDarwin knew this, but highly influential extrapolators like Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett have taken evolutionist speculations to a plateau of invincibility. It is dogma that is shared by both evolutionists and atheists, as they stand shoulder to shoulder to shout down traditional religion. Their hostility (and yours) is at a different level than most religious people, who would honestly like to be able to live in harmony with science, by having thoughtful comparisons to both worldviews when they conflict.\n\n \n And where are the religious people who accept evolution standing in this cosy little fascist picture of yours? Are they standing shoulder to shoulder with the atheists too to 'shout down traditional religion'? Oh no, I forgot: they're all really atheists in disguise.\n \n It doesn't make any sense, marc; it really doesn't. You don't represent any 'silent majority' who want to see creationism taught as a science, because the majority understand that religion is not about science and cannot be touched by it.\n \n But, of course, there are yet more layers to this conspiracy theory, and here it gets truly wacked-out:\n \n \nHere you have started with evolutionary biology, and made a seamless extrapolation into geology, paleontology, and astronomy. (I meant to use the word \"astronomy\", not \"astrology\" in my opening post by the way :xbanghead )\n\n \n What I've done is shown that facts corroborating an evolutionary history are to be found wherever and however we study nature. For evolution to have occurred we need deep time - is there geological and cosmological evidence of deep time? Yes. Evolution predicts morphologically and chronologically intermediate fossils - do we find paleontological evidence of them? Yes.\n \n Why do I get the horrible feeling marc's about to try to twist the existence of corroborative evidence into a reason not to accept evolution?\n \n \nAnd things that are NOT the theory of evolution are also used to deduce and verify mechanisms by which evolution has proceeded.  We may be close to a breakthrough here. Evolution, often with the help of atheism, moves into countless other areas, both scientific and non scientific , empirical and non empirical, philosophical and humanist, as it attempts to \"deduce and verify\" and it can often be almost undetectable.\n\n \n There we go. I really oughtn't to be surprised.\n \n Imagine for a moment that evolution was entirely incompatible with the discoveries of all other scientific disciplines. Imagine we found no evidence of deep time, no fossils, no shared genes (genes were unknown in Darwin's time and are not necessary to formulate a theory of evolution). Can you imagine the field day marc would have with all that?\n \n In actual fact, pretty much all the sciences have yielded corroborative evidence for evolution. Nor is evolution the only theory making predictions that span disciplines - quantum theory is another. \n \n So what does marc do? Accept this evidence? Hell no! Marc does what he always does when evidence doesn't agree with him: adds a few more million people to the running total of liars and cheats required to make him right. In marc's world, we didn't find transitional fossils because they were in the ground, we found them because evolution said they'd be there. We didn't find geological evidence of deep time because it's true, we found it because it was politically expedient for evolution-peddling atheists - ignoring of course the fact that deep time was well-established prior to evolution.\n \n Next we move on to an analysis of a discussion here on these forums. Once again, marc asks us to see a calculated web of deceit being spun:\n \n \nBiological evolution is stated as the change in allele frequencies\n Atheism is a disbelief and strong rejection of a belief in a higher power\n \n Can anyone make a argument that biological evolution is atheistic?\n\n \n Biological evolution is a strict enunciation of what we mean when we talk about populations changing genetically over time; it defines one way we measure the progress of evolution. \n \n The response included these lines:\n \n \nI can, with certainty, say that what we know about evolution does falsify the Genesis account of creation and the flood story because there never was a world wide flood, the sequences described in Genesis contradict those found in the fossil record (such as the creation of flowering plants before fish), and it took longer than 6 days for all this to occur. So eveolution is inconsistent with certain beliefs about God even though it is not inconsistent with the existence of God.\n\n \n With apologies to Walking-Fish, that's just sloppy wording. A more correct way of saying the same thing would be:\n \n \"I can, with certainty, say the same multi-disciplinary facts that confirm an evolutionary history do falsify an over-literal interpretation of the Genesis account of creation.\"\n \n Personally, I don't find 'what we know about evolution' to be a particularly sinister shorthand for that, given the general informality of the discussion. Also, it's clear from context that walking-fish is actually being generous: rather than stick to the strict sub-definition of biological evolution, he's exploring the evidence indicating an evolutionary past to see if there's anything there that could be considered atheistic.\n \n The original poster later responds:\n \n \nWell I'm sure you guys can figure out the point here:\n \n The absence of those who claim evolution is atheistic from this thread shows just how strong their positions really are when directly challenged. I personally like taking absurd comments and forcing them into public light and watching them wither away.\n\n \n In other words, not only is the strict definition of biological evolution not atheistic, nor are any of its corrolaries or supporting historical evidence.\n \n \nTHERE'S THE BREAKTHROUGH - If you'll glance around 4forums, particularly this thread, you'll see that \"marc himself\" (without your help) has been trying to convince evolutionists and atheists alike of that fact for many months now, and have been getting the exact same type of grief about it from many evolutionists and atheists as they attempted to shout me down.\n\n \n Calm down, marc, please; you'll have someone's eye out. \n \n The 'shades' I described can be found at www.dictionary.com, where several meanings of the word 'evolution' are defined. Many of them are variations (shades) on a theme: change over time, although there are a few concerning mechanisms I didn't think were relevant.\n \n What; did you think I meant something else?\n \n \nEvolutionists and atheists alike have been emotional, and dishonest, to the same degree in this regard. This shows that one very significant \"shade\" of evolution, is atheism.\n\n \n Someone angrily denying accusations that evolution is atheistic proves that it is? Are you the same guy who 'saved' the living heck out of that village in Vietnam?\n \n \nAccording to many famous extrapolators, \"Bulldogs\", it's far more than just a shade. Are you now willing to admit that the \"fine, yet crooked line\", described in my opening post, of definitions that atheists and evolutionists constantly walk, is true, and is no longer an issue in this debate? \n\n \n Oh my, no. Why on earth would I do that, when you've made such a resounding hash of trying to prove it?\n \n Absurdly tenuous semantic conflations do not a conspiracy prove. I finish browsing dictionary.com and say the word evolution has several meanings - bam! I'm admitting an atheist conspiracy. Someone asks if biological evolution is atheistic, and someone else replies that some of the evidence that supports the inference of historical evolution might conflict with particular beliefs about god - bam! They're part of an atheist conspiracy too - an extremely remedial one where walking-fish doesn't just say \"no, absolutely not; evolution is not in any way atheistic.\" but instead tries to give the idea the benefit of the doubt.\n \n When I set out my stall in my first post, I described the scope of the discussion as I saw it: matters pertaining to biological evolution. That means biological evolution itself, evolutionary history and the evidence supporting it, and the Theory of evolution (mechanisms explaining changing allele frequecies). You know, the things an evolutionist means when he talks about 'evolution'. You're clearly not interested in even discussing anything within that scope, let alone actually trying to show it might be atheistic.\n \n Yes, when someone says 'evolution' it aids understanding if they can clarify exactly what they mean. \n \n \nI agree the title is unfortunate. We can use other words to describe it; WRONG immediately comes to mind. Or maybe just MISLEADING. Either way, we can't blame laymen for misunderstanding it.\n\n \n I mentioned 'The pursuit of happiness'. Hands up those who thought that meant chasing or seeking happiness? I've got my hand up, by the way. Here pursuit actually means occupation or pastime, as in 'trivial pursuits'. The primary meaning of words, and what people understand when they read them, changes over time and from culture to culture. Over a hundred years ago, in scientific circles, Origin was a strictly correct scientific title referring to the manner in which a single species could diverge. You may not like it, but it's true.\n \n \nSo by saying \"ORIGIN of Species\", it implies that it addresses origins, WITHOUT GOD.\n\n \n You see what you want to see, marc; I can't help you there. \n \n \nAn eye catcher for atheists! The \"talkorigins\" webgroups title is unfortunate, wrong, misleading in the same exact way. It works very well - Origin of Species is still on the shelves of libraries and bookstores all over the U.S., and atheists constantly use talkorigins to make their points. \n\n \n From what I've read, it's evolutionists who use the site to make their points. Oh, sorry, I forgot again: evolutionists are all atheistis, even those who believe in god and go to church.\n \n \n<evolution is< Not <silent< in the courts. It speaks loudly in the courts. It says it doesn't matter. If it feels good, do it. We are nothing but animals. If biological evolution says that woman is dead, pull the plug. If biological evolution says that baby isn't yet alive, abort it. Militant atheism says exactly the same thing.\n\n \n Taking these one at a time:\n \n If it feels good, do it.\n \n Evolution doesn't say any such thing. This is yet another strawman, probably based on a misunderstanding of another book title: 'The Selfish Gene'. Genes are selfish in the sense that it's inherently impossible for a gene to be selected for if it brings about its own demise in the gene pool. Therefore all you will tend to see at a genetic level are genes that are good at getting themselves repicated.\n \n However, it is wrong to claim that evolution extrapolates this to advocate selfish behaviour at the organismic level. The most successful behaviour for ensuring genes are passed on is often highly unselfish: caring for our children, treating others with respect so that they will return the favour; heroic self-sacrifice for the good of the community.\n \n We are nothing but animals\n \n We are, however, very intellectually and morally advanced animals, and the animals closest to us on that particular ladder also exhibit behviours we recognise as 'moral' and even 'altruistic'. Recognising evolution (either biological or societal/cultural) at work doesn't strip us of the need to behave like humans; our collective success is inextricably entwined with our moral sense.\n \n If biological evolution says that woman is dead, pull the plug\n \n Careful, marc; you're lashing out at random and your prejudice is showing.\n \n If biological evolution says that baby isn't yet alive, abort it\n \n Biological evolution says we have to abort babies?\n \n I appreciate that abortion is an emotive topic, but it's got bugger all to do with evolution. Either you believe a tiny cluster of cells is a child with a soul, or you don't; no amount of evolutionary theory is going to help you decide that one way or another.\n \n \nNo, it is correct <to say that evolution and atheism deny purpose< - they both seek a comparable, individual purpose. A theistic evolutionists desire to \"find God\" would be an individual, changeable purpose to suit his or her own personal pleasure - an ability to define God however they wish.\n\n \n So accepting that god created us by a slightly circuitous route means none of his commandments and injunctions apply? I think a fair few Christian and Muslim evolutionists would take violent exception to that, marc. Ah, no, hang on, angry denial means you're right, doesn't it? Sorry; carry on.\n \n \nAn atheists desire to define life as a purpose would equally suit their own personal pleasure - an ability to disregard God however they wish. These are private, changeable purposes, not comparable to an overall, collective purpose defined by a higher power, and unchangeable.\n\n \n Trouble is, there are at least three overall, collective, partly contradictory 'collective purposes' all claiming to have been defined by a higher power, and unchangeable. There's nothing to distinguish yours as the correct one, or to suggest that they're actually any better than those atheists define for themselves - google 'atheist morality' and see for yourself.\n \n \nLet's look at nihilism;\n \n http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/nihilism.htm\n\n \n My, what a cheery bunch! To be honest, though, this is all veering way off topic. I have included my reasoning in an appendix at the bottom, to demonstrate why. \n \n The facts regarding evolution are these:\n \n 1. Many people believe in god, adhere to whatever their scripture happens to be, and accept evolution all at the same time.\n \n 2. Evolution only speaks to how, not why, life attained its current form.\n \n 3. Evolution does not seek to explain the ultimate origins of life or the universe at all, let alone in a godless way.\n \n \nTodays political battles make it obvious - how often do we hear references to the \"religious left\" or the \"liberal right\"? It's always the religious right or the liberal left. There are a few exceptions to the general rule of course, but not enough to be significant. Individual human purpose vs a higher collective purpose causes human division. Still another example of evolutionists and atheists being in lockstep.\n\n \n We hear about the 'religious right' because that refers to religiously inspired or motivated authoritarian behaviour. We hear about the 'liberal left' for two reasons: one because we're probably watching Fox News and to them, 'liberal' is a four-letter word they like to bandy about, and two, because liberals of all faiths and none oppose what those particular authoritarians are trying to do in the name of religion.\n \n Even if that does, when you squint just the right way, look like individual purpose vs higher collective purpose, you still haven't done anything to show that evolution has anything whatsoever to say on the subject or would in any way define a person's side or participation in that conflict.\n \n \n~One~ of Catholicism's \"leading liberals\", who was \"stripped of his licence to teach theology\" translates into \"respected religious scholars?? Even so, it's just another example of Catholic desire to stay out of political battles that I outlined above.\n\n \n Yes, I remember passing the Catholics church as I made my way down the line of liars and deceivers :) \n \n \nThat is what evolutionists say, and that is what atheists say.\n\n \n No, marc, this is what scientists of all religions say. It's getting monotonous and a bit irritating, having to keep pointing out all the times you say evolutionists and atheists do something and fail to mention that lots of religious people also do that same thing.\n \n \nThe emotional talking points are identical. \"I.D. tries to block the curing of disease. I.D. never publishes anything of any value, it never researches. It likes to play dress up with lab coats\" - on and on. Atheists and evolutionists alike attempt to portray upon I.D. what they fear the public may see in themselves, that evolution has itself become a project in theology by atheists.\n\n \n And what about the religious scientists who say the same thing, hmm? What demons to they assuage?\n \n \nI.D. is a young movement, inspired by modern scientific methods and discoveries - discoveries that are sometimes very troubling to philosophical, atheistic evolutionary theories.\n\n \n I have yet to be made aware of one. Care to elaborate?\n \n \nEvolution has not been able to put a nick in the brick wall (origins) that atheists have faced for a long time.\n\n \n Thanks for reiterating that - a few readers might have forgotten that you'd thrown the debate away earlier by announcing that evolution did not serve any atheistic cause.\n \n \nIt's not changing, and philosophy and blockage of alternative explorations can't mask it. This origins problem is so persistent that only atheism can proclaim that there is no possible way to encounter empirical evidence of design in nature. Evolution, if it were true science, would not philosophically rule exploration out. Yet it does, just like atheism.\n\n \n The 'origins problem' is beyond the scope of evolution, and you don't get to arbitrarily decide otherwise. You're here to prove evolution is atheistic, remember? \n \n The study of abiogenesis, on the other hand, is an attempt to see if naturalistic mechanisms can take us back further than first 'life'. It may ultimately fail or it may succeed. Either way, we will be more reliably informed than we could ever be by the ID hypothesis, which simply asserts that life was designed, case closed, stop looking.\n \n \nThe international Society for Complexity, Information and Design is also a representative for the concept of Intelligent design. <snip< Atheists and evolutionists will continue to shout it down somewhat successfully, but true science has not yet come to terms with several of its discoveries, most notably the work of Michael Behe.\n\n \n I think I'll let that speak for itself. \n \n Personally, I've read some of Behe's stuff and one would have to be extremely ignorant of biochemistry and biogenetics - more ignorant than me, even - to have any trouble refuting it. I have fond memories of one of the first threads I encountered here on 4forums, concerning Behe's claim that the gross structural similarity of front and hind limbs of creatures, despite them being used for different purposes, was evidence of design. Turns out the same genes define much of both, with the shape of the limb being epigenetically refined during development, and their similarity was actually much better evidence of their evolution from limbs that did have identical functions in earlier species.\n \n \nCould you please provide me with one or more links that show similar details to the theological beliefs of theistic evolution? I don't believe you're going to be able to do it\n\n \n Well, since theology and evolution are unrelated it's a personal choice as to how one reconciles the two; it varies according to the religion in question and the sophistication of the individual's understanding of evolution. This page http://www.theistic-evolution.com/index.html is representative, though. \n \n \nYou've shown us that atheists like yourself can easily join them at will.\n\n \n Ah, and I was beginning to think you didn't care any more.\n \n For the record, my personal philosophy is not on trial, and I have never dissembled or sought to pretend it was other than it is.\n \n \nI'd like to find out, for starters, if there are two distinct divisions of theistic evolution; one that believes in the actual historical existence of Adam and Eve, and one that does not. \n\n \n As I said, I should imagine there are quite a lot of variations given that the two disciplines are in fact unrelated.\n \n \nIf you can't provide some kind of documented, worldwide organization for theistic evolution as I have for Intelligent Design, if it is nothing more than a vague, murky hangout for the uninterested (Catholics), the uninformed (unchurched believers), and atheists (yourself) then simple logic tells us it may be a fraud.\n\n \n I wouldn't dream of trying to compete with your skills at constructing conspiracy theories :)\n \n In my first post I referred to theistic evolutionists, a general term for those who accept evolution without it impinging on their faith. I did not imply the existence of any kind of organised movement, and nor is one necessary. One does not tend to get organised movements in the absence of a perceived problem, and the whole point about theistic evolutionists are that they don't perceive one. \n \n But let's not overlook the towering arrogance of your final, dismissive words:\n \n The uninformed (unchurched believers) - once again, you define atheism as anything other then your personal beliefs. \"Do you believe in god? Yes? Do you believe in all the same things I believe? NO?!? Then you're no better than a stinking atheist and your opinion doesn't count!\"\n \n The uninterested (Catholics) - Oh my, you just don't know when to quit insulting people, do you? \"Do you believe in god? Yes? Jesus and the bible? Yes? Hmm. Do you accept evolution? YES?!? Then you're no better than a stinking atheist and your opinion doesn't count!\"\n \n \n Appendix: Nihilism's irrelevance\n \n \nThe differing beliefs concerning personal, set-by-human purpose vs collective, set-by-God purpose can quickly divide those beliefs concerning politics and philosophy - their views concerning the baselessness of values, destruction of values, \"epistemological\" (human knowledge) failures, loyalties, etc. While the purpose of creation as described by Judeo-Christianity, with it's collective purpose, would have the other view.\n\n \n I disagree. Take this quote from the same page:\n \n \nInevitably, nihilism will expose all cherished beliefs and sacrosanct truths as symptoms of a defective Western mythos. This collapse of meaning, relevance, and purpose will be the most destructive force in history, constituting a total assault on reality and nothing less than the greatest crisis of humanity\n\n \n In other words, in Nietzsche's opinion it is the ultimate vacuity of the purpose offered by all institutions, including Judeo-Christianity, that sets us up for this fall. That is at least part of the epistemological failure of which he speaks: you might describe your purpose as set-by-god, but you cannot ultimately justify that with anything other than blind faith. That's not a criticism, just an unfortunate truth - we'd all like to be more certain than we are about things from time to time :) Even the prospect of eternal heavenly reward doesn't stand up to much critical scrutiny.\n \n One could argue that by scientifically identifying the practical, objective, success-related basis of our morality, we are answering some important questions about 'why' those things matter in a manner independent of one's belief in an external arbiter, thus removing a weak point - but that really goes far beyond the discussion in hand.\n \n Why? Because evolution says how, not why, life came to adopt the forms we see today. It impacts not at all on personal belief in spiritual purpose, and demonstrably does not prevent plenty of people from believing in the same one as you.",

   "Your post consisted of 955 words excluding quotations. You used 264 to say that evolution has had a lot of work put into it since its discovery (no argument there), and another 294 to summarise and reiterate the points I responded to in detail. MS Word tells me I directly quoted 259 of the remaining 397, in which you made - and failed to substantiate - claims as to the supposed inherent atheistic bias of evolution, and then went on to derive a global atheist conspiracy, apparently based on TalkOrigins and a man called Cline denying that evolution was inherently atheistic. \n\n \n This all gets confusing - when you say \"points I responded to\", I'm not sure if you're referring to my first or second post. I didn't double check and re check what MS word told me - I'm not going to make an issue of 239 vs 259 words. But I believe my point stands about your 3400 (+or-) words. \n \n \nIt would not, therefore, be unfair to describe your opening post as 'disappointingly light on content'. Given the fact that you have been waiting for months for someone to take up your debate challenge, I can only assume this is a strategy intended to keep your powder dry until I have no posts left with which to formulate a rebuttal. \n\n \n My opening post was an outline of my position, not a trick. I didn't think it would be long for things to get long and detailed, but you'll hopefully notice that I'm not straying from those basics, other than to address the additional areas that you have introduced. I'll go paragraph by paragraph in this one - shouldn't be \"light\" this time. We are in the heart of the debate now, hopefully another long one or two, and then we'll be able to condense our basic positions as we head towards the finish line. :) \n \n \n \nCome now, marc, my personal philosophical standpoint is not exactly a state secret, and I explicitly said that I was opposing this resolution on the grounds that it was incorrect, and not because atheism was anything to avoid being associated with. Should I have worn my standard-issue atheist T-shirt to avoid confusion? \n\n \n From your first post;\n \n \n......marc's interpretation of Christianity: a world not even ten thousand years old.....\n\n \n You mis-labeled me as believing in a young earth - nowhere in this thread or anywhere on these forums have I ever stated that. There is disagreement among creationists on whether or not the earth is less than 10,000 years old. Genesis doesn't directly say. I don't have a firm opinion on it - its irrelevant to this debate. What's relevant is the identical views that evolutionists and atheists have for creation. I felt it was relevant to make clear that you represent both views - that you NEED them both to make your argument. \n \n \nI simply brought up the relevant point that the vast majority of scientists of all religions have no trouble reconciling evolution with their faith. Since you have had this fact slung at you in every thread in which this debate has been mooted, it beggars belief that you did not expect it to arise. This feigned surprise and intimations of skulduggerey afoot are, like the character-assassination of evolutionists and atheists in your first post, an attempt to score emotive points. \n\n \n I knew it would arise, it's a general claim (made by atheists) that's never backed up. Whenever money is involved (scientists paychecks) it only makes sense to corroborate what one special interest group \"reconciles\", with other sources. William Provine puts logic into words very nicely on it;\n \n \nI suspect there is a lot of intellectual dishonesty on this issue. Consider the following fantasy: the National Academy of Sciences publishes a position paper on science and religion stating that modern science leads directly to atheism. What would happen to its funding? To any federal funding of science? Every member of the Congress of the United States of America, even the two current members who are unaffiliated with any organized religion, profess to be deeply religious. I suspect that scientific leaders tread very warily on the issue of the religious implications of science for fear of jeopardizing the funding for scientific research. And I think that many scientist feel some sympathy with the need for moral education and recognize the role that religion plays in this endeavor. These rationalizations are politic but intellectually dishonest. Evolutionary Progress (1988) p. 69 \n\n \n http://bevets.com/equotesp5.htm#wprovine\n \n Concerning \"character assassination\", your opinions of representatives of I.D. clearly show that it goes both ways. \n \n \nGiven that evolution describes a process guided by natural law, this clearly counts as 'the impetus and guidance of God' in a universe of his creation and design. \n \n The Catholic church is being as good as its word: it is delineating its spiritual territory and clearly and explicitly accommodating not just evolution but cosmology as being compatible with the Catholic faith.\n \n Marc is correct in likening this situation to the 'mess with Galileo' I referred to in my last post, except that here the mess is being avoided by thoughtful, careful assessment of both the scientific evidence and what the bible actually has to say on the subject of creation. The conclusion reached is that evolution is not incompatible with Catholicism. The care taken to avoid endorsing evolution in the process is scrupulous and understandable: it would not be appropriate for the church to throw its weight behind a scientific theory any more than it would be right to oppose it on unscientific grounds. \n\n \n If the Catholic church doesn't \"throw its weight\" behind evolution, then it's inappropriate for atheists to imply that Catholics disagree strongly with creation. The constant \"Catholics aren't atheists\" line that's thrown at creationists implies it. \n \n \n \nI don't personally think that inference is as 'clear' as marc claims, but that's really beside the point. We are not here to decide whether there exist atheists who might say such things or Catholics who might disagree with them. It is incumbent upon Marc to show that evolution itself is inherently atheistic, and the Catholic church's statement on the subject is that it is not even incompatible with their faith, let alone the existence of god.\n \n One irony is that in making the following statement, slyly phrased as a rebuttal of a claim I never made, marc inadvertantly closed the door on what was potentially his strongest avenue of attack:\n \n \n \n My whole argument is that evolution and religion can coexist; why on earth would I want to imply that evolution has led Catholics to reject Genesis? If anyone should be angling to make that claim it is marc! \n\n \n The debate is between you as an atheist evolutionist, and me as a protestant creationist. Your bringing up the subject of Catholicism indicates that you are trying to make it appear like their views are closer to yours than to mine - the opposite is actually true. Your exact statement;\n \n \n Is the Pope an atheist? No marc, he's a Catholic\n\n \n This is your attempt to make it appear that Catholics agree with you more than they agree with me. It's a needling tactic, an attempt to frustrate. \n \n \n \nThe most revealing words here, however, are more of marc's own:\n \n Two things leap out of the screen at me when reading this. The first is the recurring theme that anybody who disagrees with marc automatically forfeits the right to be credited with the default human quota of integrity, honesty, or intelligence. Hence the Catholic church could not possibly have reached their decision after careful investigation, deliberation, prayer and much soul-searching. No; they must have dishonestly capitulated for the sake of a quiet life - just like every theistic evolutionist must be stupid or a liar, and everyone who says evolution is not atheistic must be part of a global conspiracy.\n \n The second is something conspicuous by its absence. Nowhere does marc attach any significance to, or even acknowledge, the fact that in its disagreement with Galileo the church was wrong. Most people would imagine that would have had at least some bearing on the final outcome, yes? But no: here it's a purely political issue; only who won or lost matters to marc, not why. \n \n The Catholic church lost - and lost face - because they were wrong. They tried to deny and conceal the truth, on the presumption that contradicting the church was the same as denying god. So if, as marc says, their statement re. evolution is based on painful lessons learned in the past, that's a pretty good indication that they believe themselves to be facing a similar situation: they understand that the evidence supporting evolution is practically unassailable and it would be not only counterproductive but wrong to make a stand against it - not just because they would lose, but because if something about god's creation is true, it cannot be inherently atheistic.\n\n \n In some other cases however, the Catholics did not lose. \n \n http://www.dosafl.com/index.php?page=leadership/talks/bishopvg_1006\n \n \nWe now turn our attention to the two Paul's--both of whom made world headlines in 1968. The first Paul is a citizen of the City of Man. His name is Paul Ehrlich, an entomologist, specializing in butterflies. In 1968 he was catapulted onto the world stage with his bestselling book, \"The Population Bomb.\" In that book, he made some dire predictions about the future of humanity--followed in succeeding years with equally dire predictions. \n \n I would like to cite some of those predictions, and then compare them with the actuality: \n \n \u0095 1968 - \"The battle to feed humanity is over. In the 1970s the world will undergo famines...hundreds of millions of people (including Americans) are going to starve to death...\" Fact - Food production worldwide is well ahead of population growth, and obesity now kills 300,000 Americans a year. \n \n \u0095 1969 - \"Smog disasters\" in 1973 might kill 200,000 people in New York and Los Angeles. Fact - The air in New York and L.A. is cleaner now than it has been in decades. \n \n \u0095 1969 - \"If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.\" Fact - Six years beyond that deadline, England continues to thrive. \n \n \u0095 1976 - \"Before 1985, mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity...in which the accessible supplies of many key minerals will be facing depletion.\" Fact - There are no key minerals facing depletion. Almost all of them, along with raw materials in general, are far cheaper now, relative to the Consumer Price Index. \n\n \n In this case, scientists LOST. Did they \"save face\"? Not included in this link is the fact that in 1968, 2600 scientists published a petition in the NY Times and other national newspapers urging Catholics to withhold contributions from collection plates, to protest the Pope's position on birth control, in spite of scientific predictions of a nearing population explosion. They've denied and concealed the truth about their population explosion scare, and they have been more successful in denial and conceal than the Catholic church. Why? - because they have two things that Catholics don't'; a largely anti Catholic news media, and taxpayer money to help them deny and conceal. They've shouted that contradicting scientific predictions is denying the best source of truth. A lot of evolutionary extrapolation is as flimsy as over-population predictions of the 1960's. It's simply not as unassailable as atheism wants it to be. \n \n \n \nHardly. My analogy of choice would be food: pizza enables an atheist to be a well-fed atheist, just as it enables a believer to be a well-fed believer, because pizza itself is value-neutral with respect to their philosophies. Without evolution, atheists and theists alike would starve for lack of a satisfactory explanation - natural or supernatural - for the evidence surrounding them, should they choose to seek one. \n\n \n But Dawkins did not use examples of his own bodily nutrition to make the claim that there is no God. (Blind Watchmaker) Evolutionists don't use it when they claim a superior knowledge of God over Bible-studying creationists. Your analogy doesn't hold up. \n \n \nUntrue. Evolution is telling them exactly the same factual things about part of the journey life has taken. One's spiritual interpretation of that journey, and of ultimate origins and natural law, is up to the individual and remains a personal matter. \n\n \n It hasn't remained a personal matter, as these quotes show;\n \n William Provine;\n \nOf course, it is still possible to believe in both modern evolutionary biology and a purposive force, even the Judeo-Christian God. One can suppose that God started the whole universe or works through the laws of nature (or both). There is no contradiction between this or similar views of God and natural selection. But this view of God is also worthless. Called Deism in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and considered equivalent to atheism then, it is no different now. A God or purposive force that merely starts the universe or works thought the laws of nature has nothing to do with human morals, answers no prayers, gives no life everlasting, in fact does nothing whatsoever that is detectable. In other words, religion is compatible with modern evolutionary biology (and indeed all of modern science) if the religion is effectively indistinguishable from atheism. Academe January 1987 pp.51-52 \u0086\n \n My observation is that the great majority of modern evolutionary biologists now are atheists or something very close to that. Yet prominent atheistic or agnostic scientists publicly deny that there is any conflict between science and religion. Rather than simple intellectual dishonesty, this position is pragmatic. In the United States, elected members of Congress all proclaim to be religious; many scientists believe that funding for science might suffer if the atheistic implications of modern science were widely understood. \n\n \n http://bevets.com/equotesp5.htm#wprovine\n \n I won't c/p it all, but theres more there if you want to read it. Here's one from Dennett;\n \n \nIn the Conclusion, on page 136, Jones says \"Repeatedly in this trial, Plaintiffs' scientific experts testified that the theory of evolution represents good science, is overwhelmingly accepted by the scientific community, and that it in no way conflicts with, nor does it deny, the existence of a divine creator [emphasis added].\" I have not read the scientific experts' testimony, and I wonder if Judge Jones has slightly distorted what they said. If they said that the theory of evolution in no way conflicts with the existence of a divine creator, then I must say that I find that claim to be disingenuous. The theory of evolution demolishes the best reason anyone has ever suggested for believing in a divine creator. This does not demonstrate that there is no divine creator, of course, but only shows that if there is one, it (He?) needn't have bothered to create anything, since natural selection would have taken care of all that. Would the good judge similarly agree that when a defense team in a murder trial shows that the victim died of natural causes, that this in no way conflicts with the state's contention that the death in question had an author, the accused? What's the difference? ~ Daniel Dennett \n\n \n http://bevets.com/evolution.htm#atheism\n \n It's more than just a personal matter when prominent atheists say these things very publically. \n \n \n \nIt's gratifying to be proved correct so quickly. I'm disagreeing with marc, so naturally I'm 'masquerading'; I'm lying; I'm being dishonest; I have a hidden agenda. As I suspected, marc's entire first post was nothing more than a setup for character assassination. Tell me, marc, which end of the multi-million-long queue of people who have to be dishonest and conniving in order for you to be right do you want me to join?\n \n The truth is, I have neither concealed my personal beliefs, nor made any attempt to describe myself as a theistic evolutionist. I have merely done my best to put their case forward alongside my own. \n\n \n I believe you, but you really are representing both positions, claiming them to be different, yet unable to show differences. \n \n \nWe're not here to decide whether evolution ticks you off because it contradicts the beliefs you hold; we're here to decide whether a theory's contradiction of your personal beliefs makes it atheistic. \n\n \n But we are here to decide if creationism (an involved God) and traditional politics that go along with it ticks off evolutionists and atheists to a comparable degree, considering all the political issues they agree on, including character assassination of I.D., character assassination of creationists, separation of church & state, individual not collective purpose of life, etc. \n \n \n \n \nNo. Religion has rarely made theological pronouncements about matters relating to those areas of scientific endeavour. That doesn't mean there's anything scientifically or philosophically unusual about the study of evolution; rather it's an area amenable to naturalistic investigation that certain minority interpretations of certain religions have chosen in advance to have strong views about. \n\n \n Yet scientific endeavors quite often make theological pronouncements relating to areas of religion. With Tiktaalik roseae for example - it offers a story of origins very comparable to the book of Genesis. Other evolutionary endeavors provide a privileged place at the top for humans. They inspire humans to action, on the basis of evolutionary principles. They oppose other solutions to questions of social behavior and morality. And they point to a brighter future if all is done as it should be done, in accordance with evolutionary theory. And atheism loves it! Austin Cline can say all he wants about evolution not being a pillar of atheism, but evidence to the contrary is spoken by many of Darwins bulldogs. \n \n \nNot in the slightest. The method followed is the same, the rigorous requirements for evidence, repeatability and peer-review are the same. What you are claiming is akin to saying that drops of rain that land where you're standing are fundamentally different to the rest because they get you wet. \n\n \n Drops of rain are the same no matter where they land. A dispute over gravitation will involve science, while most disputes over evolution involve human behavior. \n \n \nThat's a pretty muddled question. 'atheism considers nothing but naturalism in its human behaviour conflicts in the courts'? What does that even mean? \n\n \n It means what it says - atheism believes in no higher power, so it stops at naturalism when making decisions. So does evolution!\n \n \nThe courts regularly rule in favour of religion in those cases where the free practice of religion is perceived to be infringed, and agonise endlessly over troublesome practices like the religious ingestion of proscribed substances. The cases to which you refer, whether aggressive or defensive, without exception relate to attempts by creationists to insert religious material into science textbooks and classrooms in violation of your country's constitution. \n\n \n Without exception? Even when atheists use \"separation of church & state\" to attempt to destroy religious tradition in the U.S.? There is a difference in what the Constitution actually says, and what the courts have done to it in the last 60 years. I know I know - you don't agree. Atheists don't agree, and evolutionists don't agree. \n \n \nHad atheists asked that the law be changed so that all bibles must contain a disclaimer stating that Genesis is a controversial version of events and should not be taken literally, and had their case upheld, your accusations would have some merit. Has that ever happened? Has anyone even brought such a case to court? \n\n \n No, because Bibles are not mandatory study at public schools at taxpayer expense. \n \n \nEarlier, marc stated that evolution has not caused Catholics to abandon Genesis. To that he has now added that it has not made any headway towards proving godless origins - another statement I wholeheartedly endorse. \n\n \n It has not made any factual headway, but it has made plenty of IMPLIED headway. As my earlier quotes of William Provine and Daniel Dennett showed, prominent evolution Bulldogs agree with me.\n \n \nBy marc's own admission, then, the facts and theories of evolution do not materially support atheism. He therefore has no logical grounds upon which to prosecute his resolution that evolution is atheistic.\n\n \n My logical ground is that theories and philosophies of evolution strongly IMPLY atheism. Extrapolation and implication. \n \n \nMarc's distinction between kinds of historical evidence is a false one. The veracity of written history is subject to the same critical analysis as all other forms: can it be corroborated? Can it be independently verified? Can we find evidence of the places and events described?\n \n Certainly, written history enables us to know things that would not otherwise be preserved, but it is not true that it is the only way to know anything about the past or that it is even the most reliable record in some areas, dependent as it is upon the disposition and understanding of the author or patron. The evidence indicating an evolutionary history is widespread and robust, existing within every living cell as well as within geological layers dated by several independent methods and the biogeographical distribution of species. It is arguably among the most well-corroborated of all historical facts. \n\n \n Arguably is right. All this corroboration has taken place over a very short period of time, compared to all of written history. The disposition of methodological naturalists of only a few generations only pursue very narrow avenues of exploration, often with pre-determined results as a motivator. \n \n \nAnd where are the religious people who accept evolution standing in this cosy little fascist picture of yours? \n\n \n I don't know - other than your imagination. You never provide examples of their existence. Maybe they don't take enough interest to see that atheists constantly proclaim that evolution disproves the book of Genesis. Maybe they're Buddhists, Confucianists, Taoists, Hindus and animasts, Marxists or Nazis, you know \"religious people\" who don't believe in the Judeo Christian God, who accept evolution as easily as atheists. You've tried to portray Catholics as Genesis rejecting evolutionists, but I've exposed that for what it is. \n \n \nIt doesn't make any sense, marc; it really doesn't. You don't represent any 'silent majority' who want to see creationism taught as a science, because the majority understand that religion is not about science and cannot be touched by it.\n\n \n No, at least \"half the population\" doesn't understand it. \n \n William Provine;\n \nWe are now presented with the specter of atheistic evolutionists and liberal theologians whose understanding of evolutionary process is demonstrable nonsense, joining together with the ACLU and the highest courts in the land to lambast creationists, who are caught in an increasing bind. Evolutionary biology, as taught in public schools, shows no evidence of a purposive force of any kind. This is deeply disturbing to creationists. Yet in court, scientists proclaim that nothing in evolutionary biology is incompatible with reasonable religion. A view also supported by liberal theologians and religious leaders of many persuasions, Not only are creationists unable to have their \"creation science\" taught in schools, they cannot even convince the court system that evolution is in any significant way antithetical to religion; thus the courts are effectively branding their religious views as terribly misguided. No wonder creationists (somewhere near half of the population!) are frustrated with the system and want equal time for their own views, or at least to be spared bludgeoning with evolution. \n \n \n http://bevets.com/equotesp5.htm#wprovine\n \n \nBut, of course, there are yet more layers to this conspiracy theory, and here it gets truly wacked-out:\n \n What I've done is shown that facts corroborating an evolutionary history are to be found wherever and however we study nature. For evolution to have occurred we need deep time - is there geological and cosmological evidence of deep time? Yes. Evolution predicts morphologically and chronologically intermediate fossils - do we find paleontological evidence of them? Yes.\n \n Why do I get the horrible feeling marc's about to try to twist the existence of corroborative evidence into a reason not to accept evolution? \n\n \n You're calling me wacked out, because I have exposed the phoniness of the definition fiasco. You're now forced to admit that evolution means \"deep time\", paleontology, geology, several other non exact sciences. In addition to the possibility of pre-determined conclusions, there is the problem of omission of details, deliberate or not. \n \n \nThere we go. I really oughtn't to be surprised.\n \n Imagine for a moment that evolution was entirely incompatible with the discoveries of all other scientific disciplines. Imagine we found no evidence of deep time, no fossils, no shared genes (genes were unknown in Darwin's time and are not necessary to formulate a theory of evolution). Can you imagine the field day marc would have with all that?\n \n In actual fact, pretty much all the sciences have yielded corroborative evidence for evolution. Nor is evolution the only theory making predictions that span disciplines - quantum theory is another. \n \n So what does marc do? Accept this evidence? Hell no! Marc does what he always does when evidence doesn't agree with him: adds a few more million people to the running total of liars and cheats required to make him right. In marc's world, we didn't find transitional fossils because they were in the ground, we found them because evolution said they'd be there. We didn't find geological evidence of deep time because it's true, we found it because it was politically expedient for evolution-peddling atheists - ignoring of course the fact that deep time was well-established prior to evolution.\n \n Next we move on to an analysis of a discussion here on these forums. Once again, marc asks us to see a calculated web of deceit being spun:\n \n \n \n Biological evolution is a strict enunciation of what we mean when we talk about populations changing genetically over time; it defines one way we measure the progress of evolution. \n \n The response included these lines:\n \n \n \n With apologies to Walking-Fish, that's just sloppy wording. A more correct way of saying the same thing would be:\n \n \"I can, with certainty, say the same multi-disciplinary facts that confirm an evolutionary history do falsify an over-literal interpretation of the Genesis account of creation.\"\n \n Personally, I don't find 'what we know about evolution' to be a particularly sinister shorthand for that, given the general informality of the discussion. Also, it's clear from context that walking-fish is actually being generous: rather than stick to the strict sub-definition of biological evolution, he's exploring the evidence indicating an evolutionary past to see if there's anything there that could be considered atheistic.\n \n The original poster later responds:\n \n In other words, not only is the strict definition of biological evolution not atheistic, nor are any of its corrolaries or supporting historical evidence. \n\n \n That would be true if all the corrolaries, all the supporting sciences never missed anything - never had any philosophy or pre-determined conclusions involved with them. \n \n \n Post #4 / THERE'S THE BREAKTHROUGH - If you'll glance around 4forums, particularly this thread, you'll see that \"marc himself\" (without your help) has been trying to convince evolutionists and atheists alike of that fact for many months now, and have been getting the exact same type of grief about it from many evolutionists and atheists as they attempted to shout me down. \n\n \n \nCalm down, marc, please; you'll have someone's eye out. \n\n \n I was merely being emphatic - I wanted to make sure the reader is clear on the definition breakthrough. I'm wondering if all those others agree with you NOW. They certainly didn't then, did they? \n \n \nThe 'shades' I described can be found at www.dictionary.com, where several meanings of the word 'evolution' are defined. Many of them are variations (shades) on a theme: change over time, although there are a few concerning mechanisms I didn't think were relevant.\n \n What; did you think I meant something else? \n\n \n No no no - several meanings is FINE!! :) \n \n \nSomeone angrily denying accusations that evolution is atheistic proves that it is? Are you the same guy who 'saved' the living heck out of that village in Vietnam? \n\n \n When coupled with dishonesty, like the insistence that evolution only has one very narrow definition, it can be a strong indicator. \n \n \nOh my, no. Why on earth would I do that, when you've made such a resounding hash of trying to prove it? \n\n \n Or maybe you wouldn't want to do it because my resounding hash did more than just try? Or maybe you'd like to just drop it in case you need to revert back to defining evolution very narrowly later in this debate? We'll see. \n \n \nAbsurdly tenuous semantic conflations do not a conspiracy prove. I finish browsing dictionary.com and say the word evolution has several meanings - bam! I'm admitting an atheist conspiracy. Someone asks if biological evolution is atheistic, and someone else replies that some of the evidence that supports the inference of historical evolution might conflict with particular beliefs about god - bam! They're part of an atheist conspiracy too - an extremely remedial one where walking-fish doesn't just say \"no, absolutely not; evolution is not in any way atheistic.\" but instead tries to give the idea the benefit of the doubt.\n \n When I set out my stall in my first post, I described the scope of the discussion as I saw it: matters pertaining to biological evolution. That means biological evolution itself, evolutionary history and the evidence supporting it, and the Theory of evolution (mechanisms explaining changing allele frequecies). You know, the things an evolutionist means when he talks about 'evolution'. You're clearly not interested in even discussing anything within that scope, let alone actually trying to show it might be atheistic. \n\n \n Evolutionists and atheists often don't keep it in that scope, they go into a philosophical scope, and that's what I'm interested in discussing. \n \n \nYes, when someone says 'evolution' it aids understanding if they can clarify exactly what they mean. \n\n \n Dawkins aids it by talking about blind watchmakers; Provine aids it by talking about intellectual dishonesty, and pragmatism; Dennett aids it by talking about what evolution \"demolishes\".\n \n \nI mentioned 'The pursuit of happiness'. Hands up those who thought that meant chasing or seeking happiness? I've got my hand up, by the way. Here pursuit actually means occupation or pastime, as in 'trivial pursuits'. The primary meaning of words, and what people understand when they read them, changes over time and from culture to culture. Over a hundred years ago, in scientific circles, Origin was a strictly correct scientific title referring to the manner in which a single species could diverge. You may not like it, but it's true. \n\n \n I don't agree that the word \"origins\" or the phrase \"origin of species\" would have a different meaning from 150 years ago to now. \n \n Answering your post paragraph by paragraph, so as not to be light on content, will cause me to have to go past 50,000 words, this sites limit. I will post this much now, then continue in a new post. ",

   "You see what you want to see, marc; I can't help you there. \n\n \n I see it in Origin of Species, and I see it in talkorigins. 160 years apart, same word - same love of evolution and desire for attention. Logic tells me the word hasn't changed. \n \n \nFrom what I've read, it's evolutionists who use the site to make their points. Oh, sorry, I forgot again: evolutionists are all atheistis, even those who believe in god and go to church. \n\n \n From what I've read, and as much as I've read at 4forums, it's atheists. They've never described their theistic evolution church to me. \n \n \nTaking these one at a time:\n \n If it feels good, do it.\n \n Evolution doesn't say any such thing. This is yet another strawman, probably based on a misunderstanding of another book title: 'The Selfish Gene'. Genes are selfish in the sense that it's inherently impossible for a gene to be selected for if it brings about its own demise in the gene pool. Therefore all you will tend to see at a genetic level are genes that are good at getting themselves repicated. \n\n \n No, it's based on my brand new understanding of all the definitions evolution has, all those things used to deduce and verify. All those \"shades\". \n \n \nHowever, it is wrong to claim that evolution extrapolates this to advocate selfish behaviour at the organismic level. The most successful behaviour for ensuring genes are passed on is often highly unselfish: caring for our children, treating others with respect so that they will return the favour; heroic self-sacrifice for the good of the community.\n \n We are nothing but animals\n \n We are, however, very intellectually and morally advanced animals, and the animals closest to us on that particular ladder also exhibit behviours we recognise as 'moral' and even 'altruistic'. Recognising evolution (either biological or societal/cultural) at work doesn't strip us of the need to behave like humans; our collective success is inextricably entwined with our moral sense.\n \n If biological evolution says that woman is dead, pull the plug\n \n Careful, marc; you're lashing out at random and your prejudice is showing.\n \n If biological evolution says that baby isn't yet alive, abort it\n \n Biological evolution says we have to abort babies?\n \n I appreciate that abortion is an emotive topic, but it's got bugger all to do with evolution. Either you believe a tiny cluster of cells is a child with a soul, or you don't; no amount of evolutionary theory is going to help you decide that one way or another. \n\n \n I disagree, if that were true there wouldn't be high profile court cases with conflicts just like that. They are high profile because they have an audience of people who aren't sure. \n \n \nSo accepting that god created us by a slightly circuitous route means none of his commandments and injunctions apply? I think a fair few Christian and Muslim evolutionists would take violent exception to that, marc. Ah, no, hang on, angry denial means you're right, doesn't it? Sorry; carry on. \n\n \n Instead of angry denial, how about a common sense link, from yet another atheist?\n \n http://www.positiveatheism.org/india/s1990a01.htm\n \n \nAnd if some of the Bible is manifestly wrong, why should any of the rest of it be accepted automatically? \n\n \n Or this one, from Darwin;\n \n \nThus disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted even for a second that my conclusion was correct. I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all of my friends, will be everlasting punished. \n\n \n http://bevets.com/evolutionobjections.htm\n \n \n \nTrouble is, there are at least three overall, collective, partly contradictory 'collective purposes' all claiming to have been defined by a higher power, and unchangeable. There's nothing to distinguish yours as the correct one, or to suggest that they're actually any better than those atheists define for themselves - google 'atheist morality' and see for yourself.\n\n \n I don't think anyone claims to know Gods complete purpose. I googled 'atheist morality', and found this at the very first link;\n \n \nHuman beings are society animals; we are tribal, fundamentally speaking, and it is this which forms the basis of human morality. \n\n \n Looks like an evolutionary court decision to me. \n \n \n \nMy, what a cheery bunch! To be honest, though, this is all veering way off topic. \n\n \n I agree, but you were the one who brought it up. \n \n \nThe facts regarding evolution are these:\n \n 1. Many people believe in god, adhere to whatever their scripture happens to be, and accept evolution all at the same time.\n \n 2. Evolution only speaks to how, not why, life attained its current form.\n \n 3. Evolution does not seek to explain the ultimate origins of life or the universe at all, let alone in a godless way. \n\n \n 1) Where do you get the figure \"many millions\"? Am I allowed to say that many millions agree with the logic of Provine, Dennett, and Crick? How about Michael Ruse;\n \n \nEvolution is promoted by its practitioners as more than mere science. Evolution is promulgated as an ideology, a secular religion-a full-fledged alternative to Christianity, with meaning and morality. I am an ardent evolutionist and an ex-Christian, but I must admit that in this one complaint-and Mr [sic] Gish is but one of many to make it-the literalists are absolutely right. Evolution is a religion. This was true of evolution in the beginning, and it is true of evolution still today.\n \n '... Evolution therefore came into being as a kind of secular ideology, an explicit substitute for Christianity.' \n\n \n http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/4139\n \n 2) and 3) Narrow definitions again?\n \n \nWe hear about the 'religious right' because that refers to religiously inspired or motivated authoritarian behaviour. We hear about the 'liberal left' for two reasons: one because we're probably watching Fox News and to them, 'liberal' is a four-letter word they like to bandy about, and two, because liberals of all faiths and none oppose what those particular authoritarians are trying to do in the name of religion. \n\n \n Evolutionists and atheists seem to have the same disdain for Fox News, and bring it up out of the clear blue. Am I allowed to say that millions more people watch Fox News than CNN? \n \n \nEven if that does, when you squint just the right way, look like individual purpose vs higher collective purpose, you still haven't done anything to show that evolution has anything whatsoever to say on the subject or would in any way define a person's side or participation in that conflict. \n\n \n In this post I have. \n \n \nNo, marc, this is what scientists of all religions say. It's getting monotonous and a bit irritating, having to keep pointing out all the times you say evolutionists and atheists do something and fail to mention that lots of religious people also do that same thing. \n\n \n It's equally monotonous that you keep saying that and never back it up. Can you show me a legitimate Judeo Christian website that claims I.D. is a fraud, that can back it up with logic and not emotion? \n \n \nAnd what about the religious scientists who say the same thing, hmm? What demons to they assuage? \n\n \n Politics and money. \n \n \nI have yet to be made aware of one. Care to elaborate? \n\n \n You have, you just forgot - you assassinated his character below. The irreducible complexity guy. It's more than just a theory, it's a logical method of thinking that makes evolutionists and atheists angry. \n \n \n \nThanks for reiterating that - a few readers might have forgotten that you'd thrown the debate away earlier by announcing that evolution did not serve any atheistic cause. \n\n \n Facts of evolution don't, it's the theories and implications that do. \n \n \nThe 'origins problem' is beyond the scope of evolution, and you don't get to arbitrarily decide otherwise. You're here to prove evolution is atheistic, remember? \n\n \n There you go, narrowly defining 'evolution' again. Ruse, Crick, Provine, and Dennett don't agree with you. \n \n \n \nThe study of abiogenesis, on the other hand, is an attempt to see if naturalistic mechanisms can take us back further than first 'life'. It may ultimately fail or it may succeed. Either way, we will be more reliably informed than we could ever be by the ID hypothesis, which simply asserts that life was designed, case closed, stop looking. \n\n \n So abiogenesis is suddenly NOT beyond the scope of evolution now? In one paragraph it's \"the origins problem is beyond the scope of evolution, case closed, stop looking, then in the next paragraph evolution can take us back further than the first life? \"Further back than the first life\" doesn't involve the scope of origins?\n \n \n \nI think I'll let that speak for itself. \n \n Personally, I've read some of Behe's stuff and one would have to be extremely ignorant of biochemistry and biogenetics - more ignorant than me, even - to have any trouble refuting it. I have fond memories of one of the first threads I encountered here on 4forums, concerning Behe's claim that the gross structural similarity of front and hind limbs of creatures, despite them being used for different purposes, was evidence of design. Turns out the same genes define much of both, with the shape of the limb being epigenetically refined during development, and their similarity was actually much better evidence of their evolution from limbs that did have identical functions in earlier species. \n\n \n That's strange - his specialty is biochemistry. He's really not called names for that nearly as often as he is for what troubles evolutionists the most - irreducible complexity and the thought it inspires in those who are not wedded to evolution. But a tremendous amount of time and effort have been expended to shout him down. I can't say I've heard them all, but I've heard many of them. His work is shouted down a whole lot more than it is actually engaged in. \n \n \nWell, since theology and evolution are unrelated it's a personal choice as to how one reconciles the two; it varies according to the religion in question and the sophistication of the individual's understanding of evolution. This page http://www.theistic-evolution.com/index.html is representative, though. \n\n \n The sophistication of the individuals understanding of Theology is also very relevant. This is an essay by one person, and his understanding of theology and human nature. When he says this;\n \n \nFundamentalist Christians will claim that if you say that the first part of Genesis is non-literal, then you'll say that the entire Bible is non-literal (like the proverbial camel's nose poking in under the edge of the tent). That's wrong. It is logical mistake to assert that if you take a position in one direction you will inevitably go all the way to that extreme.\n\n \n As we saw before;\n \n \nAnd if some of the Bible is manifestly wrong, why should any of the rest of it be accepted automatically? \n\n \n Honest atheists say exactly what fundamentalists say about that. Common sense knowledge of human behavior, as well as the Christian knowledge of the powers of sinful temptation, bears it out. Theistic evolution reasoning is not solid, not solid enough for informed theistic evolutionists to not question it. I'm not saying ALL theistic evolutionists are not honest, I'm saying they're uninformed and uninterested. It's not a crime to be uninformed and uninterested in something. I'm afraid many of them have been duped into taking a position without thinking much about it.\n \n \nAs I said, I should imagine there are quite a lot of variations given that the two disciplines are in fact unrelated. \n\n \n They're not unrelated if the actual historical existence of Adam and Eve is a related question. If \"fundamentalists\" believe Adam and Eve really existed, and atheists believe they did not exist, theistic evolutionists would HAVE to take a position with one or the other. They can't discard it (as I do with \"the age of the earth\") because the age of the earth is not nearly as relevant to Christian basics, as Adam and Eve are to Christian basics. Adam and Jesus are LINKED in the Bible - the age of the earth is a non-issue in the Bible. \n \n \nI wouldn't dream of trying to compete with your skills at constructing conspiracy theories :)\n \n In my first post I referred to theistic evolutionists, a general term for those who accept evolution without it impinging on their faith. I did not imply the existence of any kind of organised movement, and nor is one necessary. One does not tend to get organised movements in the absence of a perceived problem, and the whole point about theistic evolutionists are that they don't perceive one. \n\n \n If they don't perceive one, isn't it strange that they take exception to creationism as much as they do? If they don't perceive one, are they in agreement with an evolutionist website called \"No Answers in Genesis\"?\n \n http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/default.htm\n \n If they don't perceive one, they're not concerned that atheists endorse and agree with them in almost every way. That's not what a VERY BASIC reading of the Bible tells them. \n \n Richard Dawkins tells them;\n \n Nearly all peoples have developed their own creation myth, and the Genesis story is just the one that happened to have been adopted by one particular tribe of Middle Eastern herders. It has no more special status than the belief of a particular West African tribe that the world was created from the excrement of ants. \n\n \n They don't perceive one, if an evolutionary biologist compares Genesis to the excrement of ants?\n \n \n \nBut let's not overlook the towering arrogance of your final, dismissive words:\n \n The uninformed (unchurched believers) - once again, you define atheism as anything other then your personal beliefs. \"Do you believe in god? Yes? Do you believe in all the same things I believe? NO?!? Then you're no better than a stinking atheist and your opinion doesn't count!\"\n \n The uninterested (Catholics) - Oh my, you just don't know when to quit insulting people, do you? \"Do you believe in god? Yes? Jesus and the bible? Yes? Hmm. Do you accept evolution? YES?!? Then you're no better than a stinking atheist and your opinion doesn't count!\" \n\n \n I don't say that to them. I would respectfully ask them questions. I have on 4forums. They vacate the discussion every time. If they provide tremendous aid to atheism, they should be subject to questions. \n \n \n \nAppendix: Nihilism's irrelevance\n \n I disagree. Take this quote from the same page:\n \n \n \n In other words, in Nietzsche's opinion it is the ultimate vacuity of the purpose offered by all institutions, including Judeo-Christianity, that sets us up for this fall. That is at least part of the epistemological failure of which he speaks: you might describe your purpose as set-by-god, but you cannot ultimately justify that with anything other than blind faith. That's not a criticism, just an unfortunate truth - we'd all like to be more certain than we are about things from time to time :) Even the prospect of eternal heavenly reward doesn't stand up to much critical scrutiny. \n\n \n I don't believe he was including Judeo-Christianity because he referred to COLLAPSE of meaning, relevance, and purpose, big things in Judeo Christianity. A collapse of Judeo-Christianity, yes, it makes more sense. \n \n \nOne could argue that by scientifically identifying the practical, objective, success-related basis of our morality, we are answering some important questions about 'why' those things matter in a manner independent of one's belief in an external arbiter, thus removing a weak point - but that really goes far beyond the discussion in hand. \n\n \n \nWhy? Because evolution says how, not why, life came to adopt the forms we see today. It impacts not at all on personal belief in spiritual purpose, and demonstrably does not prevent plenty of people from believing in the same one as you.\n\n \n If they aren't organized and can't answer questions, it's not demonstrated. It really does impact personal belief, my above quotes from Crick, Dawkins, Provine, Ruse etc prove it.",

   "We are in the heart of the debate now, hopefully another long one or two, and then we'll be able to condense our basic positions as we head towards the finish line.\n\n \n I think now would be a good time to bring things into some kind of focus, so I'll refrain from line-by-line quotation and response.\n \n One thing that's become clear is that what you think you need to do to prove that evolution is atheistic, and what I think you need to do don't overlap much :)\n \n Take some of the statements you've made regarding evolution:\n \n \nFacts of evolution don't <support any atheistic cause<\n\n \nshowing complete confidence in todays theories, even though they constantly fail to provide evidence of origins for godless evolution.\n\n \n and regarding atheism:\n \n \nMaybe they don't take enough interest to see that atheists constantly proclaim that evolution disproves the book of Genesis. Maybe they're Buddhists, Confucianists, Taoists, Hindus and animasts, Marxists or Nazis, you know \"religious people\" who don't believe in the Judeo Christian God, who accept evolution as easily as atheists.\n\n \nthe uninterested (Catholics), the uninformed (unchurched believers), and atheists (yourself)\n\n \n It's apparent that the 'general sense' in which you're trying to prove your resolution is one in which the evidence indicating an evolutionary history of life isn't atheistic, the Theory of Evolution makes no statement about origins, and the definition of 'atheist' is fudged to include anyone, regardless of their spiritual beliefs, who doesn't think evolution is atheistic.\n \n I personally think that's an unfair and meaningless sense in which to prove this resolution. If you wanted to argue that common descent contradicts your personal beliefs and the collision of the two causes conflict, or that atheists find evolution easier to accept, you should have made those your resolutions instead.\n \n Even then, the truth of the former is as much to do with your beliefs as anything else, while the latter has more to do with the absence, in the less fervently religious, of rigid and emotional preconceptions about what we ought to have found when investigating the history of life, than any philosophical inferences we can draw from what we did find.\n \n You have pressed ahead regardless, and in an attempt to blur the distinction between evolution and atheism you have advanced a number of hypotheses on several fronts.\n \n First, in support of an atheist conspiracy of which evolution is a tool:\n \n 1.a Evolution has 'permeated' other scientific disciplines.\n \n 1.b Evolutionists say evolution is not atheistic in order to disguise their true atheist motives.\n \n 1.c Evolutionists change the meaning of evolution to suit the argument they're trying to make.\n \n 1.d Evolutionists 'shout down' valid alternative explanations for the observations evolution explains.\n \n Together these represent an emotionally charged version of the less sinister picture William Provine paints in his critiques.\n \n Second, in support of evolution being philosophically aligned with atheistic principles:\n \n 2.a Evolution excludes a meaningful god (William Provine again being the most eloquent and outspoken of your quoted sources)\n \n 2.b Evolution philosophically promotes individualism at the expense of common or higher goals.\n \n And third, in support of your attempted redefinition of atheism:\n \n 3.a Spiritual beliefs other than literal Judeo-Christian creation don't count as a belief in god.\n \n 3.b Any spiritual belief that accommodates evolution is effectively atheism.\n \n 3.c The official Catholic statement regarding evolution and cosmology does not mean what I say it does.\n \n There's obviously a degree of overlap, especially between 2 and 3, but I'll deal with that as I go along.\n \n The Global Atheist Movement\n \n Few would disagree that the discovery of the evolutionary history of life has posed challenges for those whose spirituality has been strongly tied to a particular interpretation of creative events. One can also understand the temptation to view that discovery, and the body of work devoted to its study, as a deliberate assault on their faith.\n \n However, one should not forget that, at its core, evolution is a discovery. The facts indicating common descent - within the realm of genetics and biogeography alone - are compelling. It is the failure of said creative version of events to adequately explain these facts, and not the existence of a 'competing' naturalistic theory, that inspires the crisis of faith you perceive, and your understandable but misguided desire to first demonise and then shoot the messenger.\n \n You allege, for instance, that evolution has 'permeated' science (1.a), and quote people mentioning genetic, paleontological, geological and cosmological supporting evidence for common descent. But in much the same sense, DNA, ballistics, CCTV, phone tracking and forensics are all disciplines unconnected with committing a murder, but may all yield evidence that supports the conclusion of one having been committed. Many scientific disciplines yield evidence congruent with - not just common descent in general, but biological evolution specifically. That is not evolution 'permeating' science; that is the predictions derived from common descent and biological evolution being rigorously tested against empirical data.\n \n The out-of-context ambiguity of the word 'evolution' (1.c), though regrettable, is not indicative of dishonesty. I said right at the start that I would not hide behind a strict 'biological evolution' definition - indeed, your first response was to complain about how broad a topic I was undertaking to analyse! \n \n The scientific method, common descent, biological evolution, phenotypic change over time, the Modern Synthesis - these are the things being discussed and taught as 'evolution', and evolutionists rightly point out that these are not atheistic. Your claim that they are being dishonest (1.b) is both rude and unsubstantiated: when asked why they would do this you say 'because they're atheists!', and when asked how you know they're atheists, you say 'because they're dishonest about evolution being atheistic!'. Your 'supporting' quote showed an evolutionist deliberately giving your resolution the benefit of the doubt by expanding, unprompted, the scope of a discussion about biological evolution to include evidence for common descent. According to your conspiracy theory, he ought to have clammed up tight and presented a united front, refusing to discuss anything beyond strict biological evolution in the context of atheism.\n \n I will deal with your complaints about speculations as to the evolutionary value of morals momentarily. Before that we come to I.D. or 'Creation Science', the widespread denunciation of which you claim is further evidence of an atheistic driving force (1.d). I disagree.\n \n The first and most important point to understand is that I.D. is not an alternative to the theory of evolution. The ToE explains biogeographical and genetic evidence of common descent, in particular features like shared pseudogenes, and atavisms like whale legs and the human tail (whose expression in adults is due to the occasional failure to re-absorb features all members of the species temporarily grow in the womb). \n \n ID, on the other hand, concerns itself with making statements about systems which have not yet submitted to evolutionary theory, typically along the lines of 'this or that is irreducibly complex'. Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it does have its limitations.\n \n First, it doesn't actually stop the ToE from being a perfectly good explanation for the biological phenomena it has accounted for. I.D. cannot explain shared pseudogenes, atavisms, biogeographical patterns or poor 'designs' in some species (eg the inverted and eminently detachable mammalian retina) when better ones occur elsewhere (eg in cephalopods).\n \n Second, a system being irreducibly complex (the removal of a single part is catastrophic) says almost nothing about whether or not there is an evolutionary pathway leading to that system. All it does tell us is that the last evolutionary step taken was not the addition of one part to the others. It could instead have been a modification to one of those parts that changed the function of the system, the removal of a part, or the amalgamation of two seperately functional systems.\n \n This second point is one reason why I.D. is frowned upon by the vast majority of scientists: Behe et al act as if irreducible complexity is evidence against evolution, when logically it is nothing of the sort. And since Behe et al know perfectly well that other scientists are aware of this but the general public are not, it follows that they are conducting a PR exercise rather than presenting a genuine competing theory. Behe's paucity of peer-reviewed papers over the last eight years (count them: one) adds weight to this assessment.\n \n The 'Philosophy' of Evolution\n \n In this debate you have claimed that evolution promotes individualism and moral decay; 'if it feels good, do it' (2.b). Nothing could be further from the truth.\n \n What does a selfish organism look like? Better grab a microscope: it's a bacterium (and not even all of them, either). Selfish and avaricious consumption of resources will get you precisely that far and no further. As soon as you look at multicellular life, you're looking at systems in which cellular individualism has been entirely subsumed within a higher communal goal. Your cells come and go without complaint, but you, the organism, go on.\n \n So at a higher level what, if anything, does 'evolution' have to say about human morality and society? Well, we can certainly observe a similar pattern of societal development: intelligence in all species is closely associated with complex societies, and in human society individualism (every family or small group being self-sufficient, producing their own food etc) has given way to specialisation and interdependence, with the good of the community being balanced against individual needs. In case you're wondering: no, I'm not giving genes the credit for all this. Genes can help or hinder individuals, and will thrive or abate accordingly, but what defines 'helpful' is natural law. What I am doing is pointing out an apparently universal principle: that selflessness and working together towards a communal goal is rewarded - ultimately with enlightenment, no less. How is that contrary to the teachings of religion?\n \n I'm not saying this to promote evolution as an alternative to spirituality; I'm saying this to demonstrate that a thorough understanding of evolution, far from being incompatible with belief in a higher purpose, actively promotes and underpins the value of such a belief. It is therefore not philosophically aligned with nihilism - unless of course you think being a bacterium is better than being human...?\n \n What kind of god does Evolution leave us with?\n \n William Provine echoes your opinion (or possibly the other way around) that a god who works through evolution isn't worth believing in (2.a and 3.b). Apart from being stunningly arrogant, this strikes me as obviously false for two reasons.\n \n First, we cannot possibly say that the process of evolution has not been carefully guided. Even if mutations are and always have been random, have the selective pressures imposed by the environment been purely naturalistic in origin? I certainly can't say one way or the other. Nor can we ignore the role of intelligent sexual selection: if god speaks within our hearts and minds, or orchestrates the events believers regularly attribute to his will, this too shapes our biological development.\n \n Second, even if we go to the apparently 'atheistic' extreme of saying we evolved our current forms without god's moment-by-moment guidance, that does not preclude him from having taken a growing interest in us, investing us with souls and the morality that has served us so well. We are what we are; if in our current form we are worthy of god's interest that remains true however we came to be.\n \n Provine's assessments, though eloquent, strike me as ill-conceived and presumptuous, designed more to stiffen the resolve of the like-minded than to convince the undecided or opposed. One is prompted to wonder if, beside the Faustian nihilist and the others, there is a name for those who needlessly accelerate the destruction of the values they hold dear out of lust for a glorious, all-or-nothing battle, even if it is one they cannot win and tragically unnecessary besides. \n \n Provine's brilliant analogy - brilliant for promoting the death-or-glory feud he seems bent upon - is a courtroom: he invites us to consider whether the evolutionist defence's claim of death by natural causes is 'perfectly compatible' with the religious prosecution's claim of murder.\n \n I ask you to consider the following amendment to that analogy: the Christian prosecution alleging murder, the atheist defence claiming natural causes, and evolutionists as an expert witness on the stand saying: \"Look, if this was murder, it was with the lead pipe in the ballroom, not the revolver in the study.\" Now it just so happens that the prosecution has been alleging all along that the murder was committed with the revolver, so they're not best pleased with this bit of testimony. But at the end of the day, the prosecution can claim he was bashed over the head; the defence can claim he bashed his own head on the mantlepiece, and everyone can get back to disagreeing with each other just as before.\n \n As predicted, we have segued into a discussion of what 'counts' as atheism. Your contention is that any beliefs that don't rely upon the literal truth of Genesis are 'as good as' atheistic (3.a). I've already disproved this from a philosophical perspective, but there's a more fundamental problem with what you're asking us to accept: there's no such thing as a literal interpretation of Genesis. How do we have 'evening and morning' without a sun? Why are both the sun and moon described as 'great lights' when only one actually is? Why do the sequence of creative events, and god's stated disposition towards Adam and Eve vary so considerably between Gen1 and Gen2? Did Cain (and everyone else, for that matter) really marry their sisters?\n \n Genesis demands a certain amount of interpretive leeway. There may be 'official' interpretations handed down by various churches, but there is no one self-evident version. Which brings me, finally, to the statement by the Catholic church, and whether it means what I claim it does.\n \n You say that it does not mean Catholics deny creation - and once again, I thank you heartily for excluding that possibility. It would do my argument no favours at all if they had, which makes your oft-repeated strawman claim that I've been trying to imply anything of the sort look doubly ridiculous.\n \n What the Catholic church's statement shows is that they believe evolution is irrelevant to the truth of creation, the special nature of human life, the existence of souls, our spiritual purpose and so forth. And as I have shown here, they are entirely correct.\n \n As a postscript, you have asked for further evidence of a 'theistic evolutionist' movement, when all I actually said was that individuals have made their peace with both faith and science in this regard. However, one can detect the first stirrings of organised and considered response to the damage the I.D/Creationism controversy is doing to everyone:\n \n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Evolution/index.html\n \n And here, a list of prominent Evangelical Christian evolutionists. I'll leave you with the following telling quotes from Christian scientists struggling to undo the damage Creationism has done to their religion:\n \n \n\"In my field, biology, because of the creationists the standard assumption is that anyone who has faith has gone soft in the head. When scientists like me admit they are believers, the reaction from colleagues is 'How did this guy get tenure?'\" (Gregg Easterbrook, \"Science and God: A Warming Trend?\" Science, Vol. 277, No. 5328, Aug. 15 1997, p. 890-893)\n\n \n And from here: \n \n \nWe [evangelicals] remain inordinately susceptible to enervating apocalyptic speculation <this means you, Mr Provine<, and we produce and comsume oceans of bathetic End Times literature while sponsoring only a trickle of serious geopolitical analysis... And far too many of us still make the intellectually suicidal mistake of thinking that promoting 'creation science' is the best way to resist naturalistic philosophies of science. When it comes to the life of the mind, in other words, we evangelicals continue to have our problems...\n\n \n \n\"Evangelical scientists were among the first in America to adopt and later to promote an evolutionary outlook... The Fundamentalists who arrived in the 1920s more closely resembled stepchildren than children of this family.\" [David N. Livingstone, Darwin's Forgotten Defenders: The Encounter Between Evangelical Theology and Evolutionary Thought (Grand Rapids, Mich.: W. B. Eerdmans, 1987)]\n",

   "I think now would be a good time to bring things into some kind of focus, so I'll refrain from line-by-line quotation and response.\n \n One thing that's become clear is that what you think you need to do to prove that evolution is atheistic, and what I think you need to do don't overlap much :) \n\n \n I agree, it's up to the reader to decide. But I've shown, and will continue to show, that there's NO DISTICNTIVE LINE WHATSOEVER that separates a few of the most basic facts about evolution, to the most far-fetched, atheistic speculations about evolution. \n \n \n \nIt's apparent that the 'general sense' in which you're trying to prove your resolution is one in which the evidence indicating an evolutionary history of life isn't atheistic, the Theory of Evolution makes no statement about origins, and the definition of 'atheist' is fudged to include anyone, regardless of their spiritual beliefs, who doesn't think evolution is atheistic. \n\n \n The word \"evidence\" is every bit as vague and broad as the word \"evolution\" - what is concluded as evidence for some is not accepted as evidence by others. Some evolutionists claim that origins are important for evolution, and that speculative study about naturalistic origins is part of evolution. \n \n talkorigins;\n \n 6) Evolutionary theory was not proposed to account for the origins of living beings, only the process of change once life exists. However, many have thought that the theory of evolution logically requires a beginning of life, which is true. Of those, many have thought that a natural account of the origin of life is necessary, and some have proposed models which have borne up or not as research proceeds. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/spontaneous-generation.html\n \n Later in this post, I'm going to compare a common evolutionary origins claim, and a concept of Intelligent Design, and we'll see if there's a clear distinction in which one is more empirical, testable, scientific. \n \n What you're calling \"fudging\" is simply my realistic placement of one of two basic belief systems into one of two political positions, where they almost always actually fit. The neutral middle ground that's implied by theistic evolution just isn't there. If it was, there would be far more conflicts between atheism and theistic evolution than there actually are. Theistic evolutionists often claim that God would not lie to us through nature. But Christianity prominently includes a supernatural force that does lie; Satan. I've never seen theistic evolutionists address his existence. \n \n \n \nI personally think that's an unfair and meaningless sense in which to prove this resolution. If you wanted to argue that common descent contradicts your personal beliefs and the collision of the two causes conflict, or that atheists find evolution easier to accept, you should have made those your resolutions instead. \n\n \n It took a long time to establish a resolution, and to establish you as an opponent. You helped determine what the resolution was. \"Common descent\"?? I've never used that term here - the following is the only place I remember you using it in this entire debate, until now;\n \n \norigninally posted by peeling Absolutely every scrap of evidence the universe has to give about the history of life on earth points to common descent and speciation over billions of years. Let me reiterate: that is not the theory of evolution. The theory is an attempt to deduce and verify mechanisms by which evolution has proceeded. \n\n \n In that, your first post, you tell me common descent is not evolution, now in this post, you use the term 8 times. emoticon_confused \"Evolution\" is the word in the resolution. Nothing unfair or meaningless, and we're not done yet. \n \n \n \nEven then, the truth of the former is as much to do with your beliefs as anything else, while the latter has more to do with the absence, in the less fervently religious, of rigid and emotional preconceptions about what we ought to have found when investigating the history of life, than any philosophical inferences we can draw from what we did find.\n \n You have pressed ahead regardless, and in an attempt to blur the distinction between evolution and atheism you have advanced a number of hypotheses on several fronts. \n\n \n I don't have to blur the distinction - evolutionists and atheists do that for me just fine. :) \n \n \nFirst, in support of an atheist conspiracy of which evolution is a tool:\n \n 1.a Evolution has 'permeated' other scientific disciplines.\n \n 1.b Evolutionists say evolution is not atheistic in order to disguise their true atheist motives.\n \n 1.c Evolutionists change the meaning of evolution to suit the argument they're trying to make.\n \n 1.d Evolutionists 'shout down' valid alternative explanations for the observations evolution explains.\n \n Together these represent an emotionally charged version of the less sinister picture William Provine paints in his critiques. \n\n \n They're not emotionally charged when I'm factually showing them, and they're equally sinister as the picture Provine, Dennett, Crick, Ruse, and many other evolution bulldogs combine to paint. I guess I shouldn't call Michael Ruse a bulldog, he's an atheist, and I find him to be far more honest and straightforward than Kenneth Miller, a Christian. \n \n You've used the word \"conspiracy\" many times throughout this debate. In recent times, it's a word that has actually become pretty useless, unless it's used for mocking purposes. Several years ago, Hillary Clinton attempted to use it properly in her \"vast right wing conspiracy\" comment, and all it did was get her mocked. I'm sure she regretted using it. It's such a popular word for mocking that atheists have included it in one of their favorite 3 letter designations, \"E.A.C.\" For \"evil atheist conspiracy\". It doesn't matter if it's creationist vs. evolutionist, Christian vs. atheist, conservative vs. liberal or Republican vs. Democrat, if any of them call into question the general flow of societal events that may result from the \"progress\" - the \"modernism\" that's advocated from the evolutionist, the atheist, the liberal, or the Democrat, then they are mocked by implication that they fear an evil atheist conspiracy that is far too ridiculous to actually exist. When prayer was outlawed in public schools in the 1960's, many Christians were wondering what was going to be next - a removal of the Ten Commandments from the public square maybe, or an outlawing of nativity scenes at Christmas, a removal of the words \"under God\" from our pledge of allegiance? They're then mocked about the \"evil atheist conspiracy\", when in fact the GENERAL SOCIETAL FLOW OF EVENTS that they actually feared really do take place more often than not. It may not have been a conspiracy, but it happened, to the delight of the perpetrators of the original restriction. It's similar to the early 70's smoking restriction on \"airline flights of 2 hours or less\". There was probably no conspiracy to outlaw smoking in entire cities 30 years later, or ticket truck drivers for \"smoking in the workplace\". But it was a natural flow of events. The slippery slope is very real. \n \n \nSecond, in support of evolution being philosophically aligned with atheistic principles:\n \n 2.a Evolution excludes a meaningful god (William Provine again being the most eloquent and outspoken of your quoted sources)\n \n 2.b Evolution philosophically promotes individualism at the expense of common or higher goals.\n \n And third, in support of your attempted redefinition of atheism:\n \n 3.a Spiritual beliefs other than literal Judeo-Christian creation don't count as a belief in god.\n \n 3.b Any spiritual belief that accommodates evolution is effectively atheism.\n \n 3.c The official Catholic statement regarding evolution and cosmology does not mean what I say it does.\n \n There's obviously a degree of overlap, especially between 2 and 3, but I'll deal with that as I go along.\n \n The Global Atheist Movement\n \n Few would disagree that the discovery of the evolutionary history of life has posed challenges for those whose spirituality has been strongly tied to a particular interpretation of creative events. One can also understand the temptation to view that discovery, and the body of work devoted to its study, as a deliberate assault on their faith.\n \n However, one should not forget that, at its core, evolution is a discovery. The facts indicating common descent - within the realm of genetics and biogeography alone - are compelling. It is the failure of said creative version of events to adequately explain these facts, and not the existence of a 'competing' naturalistic theory, that inspires the crisis of faith you perceive, and your understandable but misguided desire to first demonise and then shoot the messenger. \n\n \n Because there is often no way to tell where the facts stop and the speculation starts - no way to tell who are the honest messengers. According to the link I referenced before, is it a fact that there are \"No Answers In Genesis\"? Is Dawkins book \"The Blind Watchmaker\" nothing but fact? \n \n \n \nYou allege, for instance, that evolution has 'permeated' science (1.a), and quote people mentioning genetic, paleontological, geological and cosmological supporting evidence for common descent. But in much the same sense, DNA, ballistics, CCTV, phone tracking and forensics are all disciplines unconnected with committing a murder, but may all yield evidence that supports the conclusion of one having been committed. Many scientific disciplines yield evidence congruent with - not just common descent in general, but biological evolution specifically. That is not evolution 'permeating' science; that is the predictions derived from common descent and biological evolution being rigorously tested against empirical data.\n \n The out-of-context ambiguity of the word 'evolution' (1.c), though regrettable, is not indicative of dishonesty. I said right at the start that I would not hide behind a strict 'biological evolution' definition - indeed, your first response was to complain about how broad a topic I was undertaking to analyse! \n \n The scientific method, common descent, biological evolution, phenotypic change over time, the Modern Synthesis - these are the things being discussed and taught as 'evolution', and evolutionists rightly point out that these are not atheistic. Your claim that they are being dishonest (1.b) is both rude and unsubstantiated: when asked why they would do this you say 'because they're atheists!', and when asked how you know they're atheists, you say 'because they're dishonest about evolution being atheistic!'. Your 'supporting' quote showed an evolutionist deliberately giving your resolution the benefit of the doubt by expanding, unprompted, the scope of a discussion about biological evolution to include evidence for common descent. According to your conspiracy theory, he ought to have clammed up tight and presented a united front, refusing to discuss anything beyond strict biological evolution in the context of atheism. \n\n \n I'm not sure which of the two you are talking about, but either of them would have clammed up tight if he would have seen what he was doing! Evolution makes such a seamless, unnoticable transition into other subjects that even evolutionists themselves sometimes don't notice it. Poster number one was very adamant about the importance of a strict, narrow definition of evolution prior to any discussion. \n \n \nI will deal with your complaints about speculations as to the evolutionary value of morals momentarily. Before that we come to I.D. or 'Creation Science', the widespread denunciation of which you claim is further evidence of an atheistic driving force (1.d). I disagree.\n \n The first and most important point to understand is that I.D. is not an alternative to the theory of evolution. The ToE explains biogeographical and genetic evidence of common descent, in particular features like shared pseudogenes, and atavisms like whale legs and the human tail (whose expression in adults is due to the occasional failure to re-absorb features all members of the species temporarily grow in the womb). \n \n ID, on the other hand, concerns itself with making statements about systems which have not yet submitted to evolutionary theory, typically along the lines of 'this or that is irreducibly complex'. Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it does have its limitations.\n \n First, it doesn't actually stop the ToE from being a perfectly good explanation for the biological phenomena it has accounted for. I.D. cannot explain shared pseudogenes, atavisms, biogeographical patterns or poor 'designs' in some species (eg the inverted and eminently detachable mammalian retina) when better ones occur elsewhere (eg in cephalopods).\n \n Second, a system being irreducibly complex (the removal of a single part is catastrophic) says almost nothing about whether or not there is an evolutionary pathway leading to that system. All it does tell us is that the last evolutionary step taken was not the addition of one part to the others. It could instead have been a modification to one of those parts that changed the function of the system, the removal of a part, or the amalgamation of two seperately functional systems.\n \n This second point is one reason why I.D. is frowned upon by the vast majority of scientists: Behe et al act as if irreducible complexity is evidence against evolution, when logically it is nothing of the sort. And since Behe et al know perfectly well that other scientists are aware of this but the general public are not, it follows that they are conducting a PR exercise rather than presenting a genuine competing theory. Behe's paucity of peer-reviewed papers over the last eight years (count them: one) adds weight to this assessment. \n\n \n As I promised above, here is a comparison between an I.D. theory, and a scientific naturalistic origin theory. From talkorigins;\n \n \nThere is a great deal about abiogenesis that is unknown, but investigating the unknown is what science is for. Speculation is part of the process. As long as the speculations can be tested, they are scientific. Much scientific work has been done in testing different hypotheses relating to abiogenesis, \n\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB050.html\n \n and, (same as above);\n \n \n 1.Evolutionary theory was not proposed to account for the origins of living beings, only the process of change once life exists. However, many have thought that the theory of evolution logically requires a beginning of life, which is true. Of those, many have thought that a natural account of the origin of life is necessary, and some have proposed models which have borne up or not as research proceeds. \n\n \n Clearly, abiogenesis (a spontaneous generation of life from non living chemicals) has \"borne up\". Let's compare that, an evolutionary speculation, with an I.D. speculation, and see if one clearly looks more scientific and logical than the other. \n \n For abiogenesis;\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\n \n There has been so much speculation for thousands of years that life could have possibly spontaneously generated from non life that no real attempt by Wikipedia is made to assign its origins to any one person. It mentions that Aristotle (from a few hundred years B.C.) knew that dirty hay generated mice, etc. Laughable by todays scientific standards, but not laughable at all by the hopes of atheists to find naturalistic origins. \n Now lets look at an ID concept called Universal probablility bound. The thought process behind it is not complicated. Scientifically, we know that known resources (elementary particles) throughout the universe come in limited supplies - we can assign a number to them, and since evolutionists tell us that the universe is between 10 and 20 billion years old, we can assign numbers to that - in seconds - if we want to. Then we can assign numbers to the time it takes for the physical properties of matter to make transitions from one physical state to another. Then, as the following link says, we can determine \"A degree of improbability below which a specified event of that probability cannot reasonably be attributed to chance regardless of whatever probabilitistic resources from the known universe are factored in.\" \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_probability_bound\n \n This is not bow-down-at-the-alter religion, it's as scientific, if not more scientific, than atheistic dreams of proving abiogenesis. They are at least comparable, yet they're not compared. Logic and reason don't determine that they're not compared, politics and atheist emotion are what determines that they're not compared. The first thing we notice is that our friends as Wikipedia put them in different realms by doing to Universal Probability Bound what is always done with Irreducible Complexity, it immediately focuses on ONE MAN. Dembski with UPB, and Behe with I.C. That opens the door for atheists and evolutionists to assassinate the character of one man, rather than looking very closely at the subject. \n \n They are both speculation. Their testability, logic, etc. are comparable. Why is one considered science and the other not? Abiogenesis favors evolution and therefore atheism, UPB threatens evolution and therefore atheism. Is that the reason? \n \n \n \nThe 'Philosophy' of Evolution\n \n In this debate you have claimed that evolution promotes individualism and moral decay; 'if it feels good, do it' (2.b). Nothing could be further from the truth.\n \n What does a selfish organism look like? Better grab a microscope: it's a bacterium (and not even all of them, either). Selfish and avaricious consumption of resources will get you precisely that far and no further. As soon as you look at multicellular life, you're looking at systems in which cellular individualism has been entirely subsumed within a higher communal goal. Your cells come and go without complaint, but you, the organism, go on.\n \n So at a higher level what, if anything, does 'evolution' have to say about human morality and society? Well, we can certainly observe a similar pattern of societal development: intelligence in all species is closely associated with complex societies, and in human society individualism (every family or small group being self-sufficient, producing their own food etc) has given way to specialisation and interdependence, with the good of the community being balanced against individual needs. In case you're wondering: no, I'm not giving genes the credit for all this. Genes can help or hinder individuals, and will thrive or abate accordingly, but what defines 'helpful' is natural law. What I am doing is pointing out an apparently universal principle: that selflessness and working together towards a communal goal is rewarded - ultimately with enlightenment, no less. How is that contrary to the teachings of religion? \n\n \n Your implication in how it comes about is what is contrary. You're crediting \"natural law\" - purposelessness, in bringing it about, when socially, (the good of the community) it's intelligence that brings it about - humans building and improving on each others inventions. It often has nothing to do with science.\n \n \nI'm not saying this to promote evolution as an alternative to spirituality; I'm saying this to demonstrate that a thorough understanding of evolution, far from being incompatible with belief in a higher purpose, actively promotes and underpins the value of such a belief. It is therefore not philosophically aligned with nihilism - unless of course you think being a bacterium is better than being human...?\n \n What kind of god does Evolution leave us with?\n \n William Provine echoes your opinion (or possibly the other way around) that a god who works through evolution isn't worth believing in (2.a and 3.b). Apart from being stunningly arrogant, this strikes me as obviously false for two reasons.\n \n First, we cannot possibly say that the process of evolution has not been carefully guided. Even if mutations are and always have been random, have the selective pressures imposed by the environment been purely naturalistic in origin? I certainly can't say one way or the other. \n\n \n But many evolutionist bulldogs can and do - Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan, Edward O. Wilson, Stephen Jay Gould, many others. And saying that, implying that, is the one thing that makes them all well known and wealthy because millions of itching ears want to hear them say it. Something about evolution is always just around the corner in newspaper articles, television programs, magazines and books - evolution is constantly in the public eye, and the public takes notice. Not because the public is fascinated with microscopes, because the public is fascinated with evolutions impact on religion and politics. Common sense tell us that todays younger professionals have less positive interest in culture and values than generations past, and they're certainly not interested in using their science to express and promote values. But some of them like the idea of using science to get away from values. \n \n \nNor can we ignore the role of intelligent sexual selection: if god speaks within our hearts and minds, or orchestrates the events believers regularly attribute to his will, this too shapes our biological development.\n \n Second, even if we go to the apparently 'atheistic' extreme of saying we evolved our current forms without god's moment-by-moment guidance, that does not preclude him from having taken a growing interest in us, investing us with souls and the morality that has served us so well. We are what we are; if in our current form we are worthy of god's interest that remains true however we came to be.\n \n Provine's assessments, though eloquent, strike me as ill-conceived and presumptuous, designed more to stiffen the resolve of the like-minded than to convince the undecided or opposed. One is prompted to wonder if, beside the Faustian nihilist and the others, there is a name for those who needlessly accelerate the destruction of the values they hold dear out of lust for a glorious, all-or-nothing battle, even if it is one they cannot win and tragically unnecessary besides. \n\n \n Kind of reminds you of our creation/evolution forum here, doesn't it? :) \n \n \nProvine's brilliant analogy - brilliant for promoting the death-or-glory feud he seems bent upon - is a courtroom: he invites us to consider whether the evolutionist defence's claim of death by natural causes is 'perfectly compatible' with the religious prosecution's claim of murder. \n\n \n When it comes to the death and glory feud, there's no question that it's a two position feud, fueled by both sides. Provine, Dennett, Crick, Ruse, - all atheists. We have the website \"No Answers In Genesis\" that I referenced before, books and speaking engagements by Richard Dawkins, the overpopulation scare of the 1960's that I referenced before. I'm sure you can name a comparable number of feud perpetrators from the creationist side. It's not about science as much as it is about a crisis of faith. Evolutionists and atheists, who believe the universe is always increasing in organized complexity, generally have the mindset that we humans can improve our lot and bring about a heaven on earth. Creationists, who believe that the universe is running down, moving further and further away from the perfection God created in the beginning, are generally against massive government backed programs for societal change, and suggest a focus on individual responsibility, such as an adherence to the Ten Commandments. \n \n \n \nI ask you to consider the following amendment to that analogy: the Christian prosecution alleging murder, the atheist defence claiming natural causes, and evolutionists as an expert witness on the stand saying: \"Look, if this was murder, it was with the lead pipe in the ballroom, not the revolver in the study.\" Now it just so happens that the prosecution has been alleging all along that the murder was committed with the revolver, so they're not best pleased with this bit of testimony. But at the end of the day, the prosecution can claim he was bashed over the head; the defence can claim he bashed his own head on the mantlepiece, and everyone can get back to disagreeing with each other just as before.\n \n As predicted, we have segued into a discussion of what 'counts' as atheism. Your contention is that any beliefs that don't rely upon the literal truth of Genesis are 'as good as' atheistic (3.a).\n\n \n They almost always are politically, as I showed above. If order and complexity are increasing naturally, big government is in order. Those who have a financial interest in evolution, (teachers, college professors, researchers) make more money if government is bigger, as they are almost always paid somewhat indirectly by others, including others who may not like their theories. \n \n Also, Wikipedia biographies on Carl Sagan, Edward O. Wilson, others, show big government views on things like global warming, saving rainforests, population growth, etc. \n \n \n \n I've already disproved this from a philosophical perspective, but there's a more fundamental problem with what you're asking us to accept: there's no such thing as a literal interpretation of Genesis. How do we have 'evening and morning' without a sun? Why are both the sun and moon described as 'great lights' when only one actually is? Why do the sequence of creative events, and god's stated disposition towards Adam and Eve vary so considerably between Gen1 and Gen2? Did Cain (and everyone else, for that matter) really marry their sisters?\n \n Genesis demands a certain amount of interpretive leeway. There may be 'official' interpretations handed down by various churches, but there is no one self-evident version. Which brings me, finally, to the statement by the Catholic church, and whether it means what I claim it does.\n \n You say that it does not mean Catholics deny creation - and once again, I thank you heartily for excluding that possibility. It would do my argument no favours at all if they had, which makes your oft-repeated strawman claim that I've been trying to imply anything of the sort look doubly ridiculous. \n\n \n What makes it so confusing is the vast difference there is, in evolutionist talking points, between creation and creationism. Creation is fine with you - creationism is the big villain. Creationism believes in perfect order in the beginning, with a \"running down\" universe, the belief that Gods omnipotence, personality, nature of love, purposiveness, grace, and several other things, are as the Bible describes them. Plain old theistic evolution creation is not a threat - God really didn't, (and subsequently doesn't) have much to do, and in addition to not necessarily having the attributes above, (omnipotence, etc) it puts him in a subordinate realm - not much interference in the ruling realm of science. God remains in the picture for public relations purposes. The \"scientific fact\" vs. \"personal faith\" distinction reassures the public of evolutionists great respect for religion, at the same time reducing it to a \"personal\" belief that need not be taken seriously in the public arena. Then evolutionists and atheists can win their court battles. \n \n \nWhat the Catholic church's statement shows is that they believe evolution is irrelevant to the truth of creation, the special nature of human life, the existence of souls, our spiritual purpose and so forth. And as I have shown here, they are entirely correct. \n\n \n Yes, it fits exactly with what I said above. They're correct if they stay out of atheists way in the public arena. I've already covered in past posts the political reasons for why they do that. \n \n \nAs a postscript, you have asked for further evidence of a 'theistic evolutionist' movement, when all I actually said was that individuals have made their peace with both faith and science in this regard. However, one can detect the first stirrings of organised and considered response to the damage the I.D/Creationism controversy is doing to everyone:\n \n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Evolution/index.html\n \n And here, a list of prominent Evangelical Christian evolutionists. I'll leave you with the following telling quotes from Christian scientists struggling to undo the damage Creationism has done to their religion: \n\n \n Creationism is doing the damage? Dawkins, Sagan, Wilson, Gould, Provine, Dennett, Crick, Ruse, the ACLU etc. are not? I suppose it depends on the opinion of the damage analyst - which side he thinks is instigating the death and glory feud. Which side has the most public exposure - says the most attention getting things - files the most lawsuits - has the most to lose financially etc. \n \n \"How did this guy get tenure?\" That's an interesting question - seems that personal beliefs really do matter to some academic elites who are in charge of granting tenure. \n \n \n \nAnd from here:\n\n \n These statements are more political than they are about science or truth. \n \n You now have one more post, as has been normal in these recent debates, it's supposed to be a recap of why you believe you won. I've introduced some more substance in this post, even though it was mainly a response to yours. But I'll not cry foul no matter how you decide to finish up - if you want to make it a two part post, one to respond to what I've said in this post, and another to recap, that's fine with me. I'll try to keep my last one nothing but a recap.",

   "This being my last post, I'm going to mostly recap why I believe I deserve to win the debate. I'd also like to thank marc for cutting me the slack to respond to his previous post - I'll include such responses where appropriate.\n \n \n \n I believe this resolution should be rejected for three simple reasons:\n \n * I have shown empirically that it is false.\n \n * I have shown logically that it is false.\n \n * My opponents arguments have rarely strayed into the territory delineated by the wording of the resolution, and have, moreover, been less than persuasive.\n \n Empirical evidence that evolution is not atheistic abounds. I have provided links to Christian websites - both scientific and personal - explicitly accepting common descent*, biological evolution and the Theory of Evolution. The Catholic church made an official statement to the effect that neither common descent nor biological evolution contradicts Catholicism, and that all that is necessary to accommodate the ToE is for one to see the hand of god at work in the process. Even the ringside debate right here on 4Forums shows Christians wanting to put up their hands and be counted as accepting evolution. My opponent's contention that such evidence should be discounted has lurched from accusations of widespread dishonesty to intimations of ignorance or apathy, and amounts to the demand that we define the only true belief in god to be one that excludes evolution.\n \n I have also gone to considerable lengths to demonstrate the logical fallacies of asserting that evolution is atheistic. My opponent claims that evolution and atheism (actually nihilism as he described it) are 'philosophically aligned'. I thoroughly rebutted this by showing that evolution unambiguously confirms the universal truth of the lessons many religions teach: that selflessness, cooperation and concern for one's fellows are the path to enlightenment. His response, as he expeditiously retreats from his earlier claim, is:\n \nYou're crediting \"natural law\" - purposelessness, in bringing it about\n\n This is a hopeless mishmash of concepts. Natural law in a god-created universe is a manifestation of god's will; twisting that to mean 'purposelessness' is a denial of marc's own beliefs. Nor did I actually attribute these human traits to natural law - I merely showed that they are reflected in it. Evolution is scientific evidence that, on every level and for whatever reason, this universe rewards behaviour we recognise as moral. If my opponent still wants to insist that is 'philosophically aligned' with atheism, then from a purely personal perspective I extend my gratitude.\n \n On the other side of the debate, my opponent has avoided discussing evolution itself wherever possible, and instead concentrated on the ongoing political battle in which it is used as a football. I was over-hasty in describing his theory as one of 'conspiracy', and I apologise. Nevertheless, in the absence of a conspiracy, where do common descent, biological evolution and the Theory of Evolution fit into the picture?\n \n The answer, as with any politically charged issue, is 'wherever the participants depict it as fitting'. Politics, as my opponent himself declared, is not about science or truth. Rather, it is about perception and the influence leveraged thereby, and we should not judge the truth of this resolution by the pronouncements of the politically enmeshed.\n \n Prominent atheists like Richard Dawkins depict evolution as supporting their beliefs, but in reality they're trading on the same superficial disparity between Genesis and evolution as my opponent; making political capital out of the failure of one interpretation of a creation story to accord with the facts, and over-egging the significance of the success of naturalistic theories. Dawkins and others have an axe to grind, no doubt about that - all the more reason to closely scrutinise any claims he makes.\n \n Christian Fundamentalists depict evolution as atheistic, misrepresenting, just as my opponent has done, the philosophical implications of common descent and/or biological evolution every bit as often as they misrepresent the evidence from which we draw our inferences. Regardless of their individual motives, it is clear this gives them airtime and elevates their concerns to the level of national debate. Most importantly it puts emotional spin on questions people might otherwise consider dispassionately: why isn't the modern dogma of Christian Fundamentalism congruent with observable facts - some of which have been in circulation for around twice as long as Fundamentalism itself?\n \n Meanwhile, the scientists actually studying evolution say it isn't atheistic, when they say anything at all - and though their public articulation of that opinion is most likely politically motivated as marc suggests, the fact that this denial spans scientists of all faiths and none leaves us with little reason to suspect the substance of it is dishonest. After all, although we might reasonably suspect a scientist of dishonest denial in order to keep their job and their funding in a political climate unfavourable to atheism, it beggars belief to suppose they would do so to keep a job conducting research that they genuinely believe conflicts with their religion.\n \n The volume of words devoted to it notwithstanding, evolution's political significance is, in the final analysis, irrelevant to the resolution in hand. We're here to cut through the political machinations and decide whether or not evolution is in fact atheistic.\n \n Marc's other accusations of dishonesty and deviousness have held little water either. To my rebuttal of claims that evolution has 'permeated' science there has been no response at all. One must presume that the distinction between permeating and being rigorously tested has been made to everyone's satisfaction.\n \n In an earlier post he also quoted a discussion here on 4Forums as evidence of evolutionists conservatively redefining 'evolution' in the face of accusations of atheism. When I pointed out that they were actively correcting one another and expanding upon the strict definition of biological evolution in order to give the idea the benefit of the doubt, the Doppler-shifted response was:\n \nI'm not sure which of the two you are talking about, but either of them would have clammed up tight if he would have seen what he was doing!\n\n \n Would have. Am I alone in hearing the unspoken subtext: \"Because, you know, they're all the same, these evolutionists; you can't trust them. Who cares what they said anyway? We all know what they really meant.\"\n \n It is my belief that the resolution here proposed is nothing more nor less than a request that we ratify that prejudice, and that we declare my opponent's personal spiritual beliefs to be the only ones of value to boot.\n \n I do not believe my opponent has earned a judgement satisfying those requests.\n \n And on that note, I conclude my arguments.\n \n There is only one remaining point upon which my opponent and I are in active disagreement: the scientific validity of the work done in the name of the various religiously-funded Creation Science organisations. I address his most recent points below for the sake of completeness, but as this is once again peripheral to the resolution in hand, I do so in the form of an appendix.\n \n Thank you for your time and kind attention.\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n *A little confusion has crept in over my usage of the term 'common descent':\n \n \n[/I...common descent and speciation over billions of years. Let me reiterate: that is not the theory of evolution.[/I]\n \n In that, your first post, you tell me common descent is not evolution, now in this post, you use the term 8 times. \"Evolution\" is the word in the resolution.\n\n \n As is clear from the quoted text, I said that common descent is not the Theory of Evolution. Common descent is the inferred fact that all modern species, via a branching tree of speciation, share a common ancestor. The Theory of Evolution describes mechanisms by which that could have occurred. Common descent does not rely on any particular explanatory theory.\n \n As I've said twice before, I'm deliberately not trying to restrict a discussion of 'evolution' to biological evolution or the ToE. I simply took to using 'common descent' in my last post because it was less unwieldy than using 'the inferred fact of an evolutionary history of life' all the time. I apologise if that caused any confusion.\n \n Appendix: The Universal Probability Bound\n \n My detailed explanation of Irreducible Complexity's scientific shortcomings apparently having proved insurmountable, we have latterly been asked to consider instead an Intelligent Design concept called the Universal Probability Bound:\n \nA degree of improbability below which a specified event of that probability cannot reasonably be attributed to chance regardless of whatever probabilitistic resources from the known universe are factored in.\n\n This superficially reasonable mathematical 'constant' is intended by the author to be used in conjunction with other mathematical tools for detecting design, namely the \"explanatory filter/design inference\" (EF/DI) described in his book 'The Design Revolution'. \n \n The basic premise is as follows: first, if one can show that the odds of an event occurring by chance are below the Universal Probability Bound (UPB) constant, the only reasonable conclusion is that it did not occur by chance. Second, Dembski claims to use this constant to reliably detect design (or what he calls 'specified complexity') in an experimentally verifiable fashion. \n \n Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? To the untrained ear it certainly sounds like science is being done here, every bit as valid as evolution. And, just as with Irreducible Complexity, that's the whole point of the exercise: devising something that sounds like science to the untrained ear. Allow me to explain:\n \n If you're looking for evidence of design, and claim to have a reliable method for detecting it, it's ok if you get the occasional false negative (failing to detect design where design has occurred). That doesn't undermine the significance of the times you do detect design.\n \n However, it's not ok to get false positives - erroneously detecting design. That calls into question the validity of your other results. One's priority, then, must be to actively demonstrate that this does not occur.\n \n With that in mind, let's examine the claims Dembski has for his method:\n \nin every instance where specified complexity is present and where the underlying causal story is known (i.e., where we are not just dealing with circumstantial evidence, but where, as it were, the video camera is running and any putative designer would be caught red-handed), it turns out design is present as well.\n\n From this unblemished record of success he inductively infers that his method works in general.\n \n Except that when Dembski says 'in every instance', he means 'in four instances'. And in two of those, according to his own UPB constant, specified complexity (design) was not actually detected (the odds of those events occurring by chance were well within the UPB). Two of the four instances were fictional, while in a third (the flagellum of E.Coli), he didn't actually perform the full rigorous specification of complexity and we most certainly don't have the equivalent of a video camera capturing a designer at work.\n \n 'In every instance', then, actually turns out to mean 'in no instance'. In fact, in the eight years following Dembski's publication of the UPB and his 'reliable method for detecting design' - years in which he wrote five books and edited five more - he failed to publish one single example of his methods detecting specified complexity in a real-world situation where design could be independently verified. His 'inductive generalisation' is entirely without foundation.\n \n As we've already noted, though, it's not false negatives that are the issue, it's false positives that are the undoing of a supposedly 'reliable' method of detecting design. The sort of thing we might expect to generate false positives are situations where complexity is known to arise in the absence of design, like snowflakes.\n \n So has Dembski, or anyone else from a Creationist institute, published the results of applying his method to such a situation, and shown that it does not yield false positives? No. This is not all that surprising, since Dembski's method assumes that chance and design are the only options and is easily confused by the partial determinism of snowflake formation. \n \n More saliently, Dembski's measurement of specified complexity makes no attempt to factor in the possibility of a system evolving from a closely similar one with a lower 'specified complexity', and infers design based on the chance of a system appearing fully-formed. Since evolution is precisely the theory UPB claims to refute, this is a catastrophic omission.\n \n \nWikipedia put them in different realms by doing to Universal Probability Bound what is always done with Irreducible Complexity, it immediately focuses on ONE MAN. Dembski with UPB, and Behe with I.C. That opens the door for atheists and evolutionists to assassinate the character of one man, rather than looking very closely at the subject.\n\n \n On the contrary, scientists look very closely at the subject and write exhaustively detailed rebuttal papers explaining why the science is flawed. What reflects on the character of the people concerned is that they habitually eschew the peer review process to which mainstream scientists submit in favour of appealing directly to the public, undeservedly exploiting the public's trust in scientific pronouncements that hundreds of years of that same peer-review process has helped to build up.",

   "Whenever the topic of this debate comes up, be it many places on the internet, or any number of quick-witted live talk exchanges in the media, there are three major, yet shallow points of contention by evolutionists that are seldom moved beyond, and those are; 1) evolution has a very narrow definition; 2) creationists fear a conspiracy that isn't there, and 3) the mere existence of theistic evolution proves that theism and evolution can't possibly conflict. I've used the length, and two person format of this debate to completely expose the shallowness of those three things. \n \n 1) In my first post, I outlined how evolution and atheism relate to each other in a clear way, yet how they sometimes vaguely try to avoid each other. My opponents basic response was;\n \n \nThe first crack in this initially sound-seeming argument is that one could replace 'evolution' with 'gravitation', or indeed any number of other useful, practical, 'innocent' scientific tools, and reach the same conclusion. \n\n \n This is where evolution is defined as nothing more than a change in allele frequencies over time, as innocent as any other nuts-and-bolts branch of science. Once I showed how evolution is so different from the hard sciences in how it is used in the courts and how it combines with other, often speculative subjects, it led to this statement by my opponent;\n \n \nMarc himself acknowledges that 'evolution' has many shades of meaning, from the biologically specific 'change in allele frequencies over time' to more general terms describing gradual change in any system. \n\n \n At that point, this debate achieved new depth that brief discussions of this topic never achieve. In the following post where I laid that all bare, my opponent displayed some anger. He moved on from the anger fairly quickly, but was unable to undo the damage that was done to his position. From his recap;\n \n \nThe volume of words devoted to it notwithstanding, evolution's political significance is, in the final analysis, irrelevant to the resolution in hand. We're here to cut through the political machinations and decide whether or not evolution is in fact atheistic. \n\n \n The resolution is a very general one. In non-dictatorial, open societies, who determines what the final analysis is concerning a general subject, particularly when funding, education, morals, human behavior etc. are directly concerned? Political machinations have a far wider degree of perception in these general subjects than does one special interest group - the scientific community. \n \n \n \n 2) From his recap;\n \n \n I was over-hasty in describing his theory as one of 'conspiracy', and I apologise. \n\n \n \n The word \"conspiracy\" is also as above, it comes up in usual, brief discussions of this topic, and often ends there. My opponent used the word in all 3 of his posts, 7 or 8 times total, (it was a significant part of his argument) then apologized for it in his fourth post. My paragraph about a general societal flow of events is what exposed it for what it was. The scientific community is a business, as well as being a special interest. It's a dog eat dog world - there are countless examples of tricky advertising and gimmicks that businesses or any special interest will use to improve itself at the expense of others. It's not a conspiracy when a business uses politics to prevent a competing business from establishing itself nearby, just like it's not a conspiracy when the scientific community tries to avoid being scrutinized by the general public, as they do by placing \"peer review\" so far above direct appeals to the public. \n \n 3) Probably the most involved of my opponents rebuttals was his appeal to theistic evolution. I showed its vagueness by pointing out that it has no organization. Theistic evolution would have to show a comparable amount of enthusiasm and study for theism as it does for evolution, and it does not. My opponent couldn't show a regional, let alone a worldwide consensus for theistic evolution, as I did for Intelligent Design. Theistic evolution fails as a bridge between creation and evolution for many reasons - I showed two of them, and my opponent didn't address either one. They were; the distinction between theisms position of a fully formed first man and woman, Adam and Eve, to the evolutionist / atheist position of uncertainty in the transition from animal to man. The second is the obvious lack of political support from theistic evolutionists concerning the Ten Commandments. \n \n Whenever the evolutionist/atheist community attempts to counter the claim that evolution is atheistic, the above are the three most common claims, and this debate completely exposed them for what they are - shallow and unconvincing\n \n In the latter part of the debate, I requested my opponents explanation on a comparison between two speculative hypothesis' - Universal Probability Bound, and abiogenesis. He didn't address the comparison - he claimed \"peer review\" disposes of UPB, and didn't address abiogenesis. The peer review process analyzes two speculative things in two entirely different ways. New ideas and thinking outside the box tend to clash with peer review. It could be more accurately referred to as \"evolutionist review\". It tends to keep things within the established paradigm, (evolution) while filtering anything that may upset an establishment - more than ever before today, considering how much politics (academic funding) is involved. Past important revolutions in science by-passed the peer review process entirely and appeared in books - it can and has happened successfully when the public doesn't have information withheld from it. Copernicus's \"De Revolutionibus, Galileo's \"On Two World Systems\", and Newton's \"Principia\" are cases in point. Another one that didn't get peer review was a book called \"On The Origin Of Species\" by Charles Darwin. Evolution didn't get its start by peer review, yet it needs to keep its position by peer review. Political machinations really do have something to do with evolution. \n \n Evolution is fundamentally godless - atheism is fundamentally godless. A powerful special interest has declared that evolution is not atheistic for political reasons, my opponent represented them well. But rather than the often emotional, unstructured and limited exchanges that this topic often inspires, I used the length and structure of this debate to expose the three main shallow claims described above - I've shown how many prominent people have expanded, and continue to expand, evolution beyond its scientific bounds, and I've shown the motivation they've had for doing it. In the minds of the general public in the western world, evolution is atheistic, and I believe I've proved it. Thanks to all who took the time to read.",

   "First, I would like to thank both Marc9000 and Peeling for this interesting, albeit, extensive debate. (I printed out the entire debate and it took 114 pages of paper.)\n Now to the critique.\n \n Marc9000 had a difficult task right from the start. Proving that \"Evolution is Atheistic\" was an ambitious undertaking.\n In Marc9000's first post, he first attempted to establish that evolution isn't just a narrow biological. \"From Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins, and hundreds in between, evolution has gone a long way from mere biological change over time, its made it all the way to \"an all embracing concept\", in the words of Sir Julian Huxley, in 1959.\"\n \n Marc9000 then uses a series of quotes from Talkorigins.org, which he cynically calls \"a \"mainstream scientific\", evolutionist website\" and then proceeds to take selected passages out of context and misinterprets them.\n \n He followed that with quotes from atheism.com by Austin Cline, who he holds up as an expert on atheism on one hand and comments on his lack of scientific background in the next breath. I found this particular tact very troubling. At times, I wasn't sure if he was arguing the affirmative or the negative.\n None-the-less, Marc9000's own reference stated \"Evolution is no more a \"pillar\" of atheism than it is a \"pillar\" of any other aspect of science. \"\n \n In his last reference, Marc9000 attempted to tie \"evolution\" to more than strict biological systems with the following reference from Kenneth Miller's book \"Finding Darwin's God\". \n \"But unlike mitosis, protein synthesis, or signal transduction, evolution almost begs for extrapolation. The success of the natural sciences have led one analyst after another to extend Darwinian thinking into a series of distinctly nonbiological enterprises, even into the study of religion. \" \n \n In Peeling's first post, Peeling attempted to argue the expansive definition of evolution that Marc9000 wanted to employ was so expansive that it couldn't support its own weight. Therefore, Peeling argued that when people claim that evolution is not atheistic, they are really focusing on biological evolution and not the more expansive use of the term evolution. \n 'Most usages of the word 'evolution', and even terms like 'mutation' and 'speciation', when applied analogously to non-biological systems, are plainly value-neutral with respect to religion and atheism; they are words encapsulating kinds of change, nothing more. Marc's case must therefore rest on a single foundation: that there is something inherently atheistic about the fact or theory of biological evolution.\"\n \n Peeling then shifts the debate from evolution to the scientific method.\n \"Marc takes the sturdiness of his foundations absolutely for granted and makes no attempt to prove this 'philosophical alignment'. This is based upon his implicit assumption of a link between atheism and pursuit of the scientific method. The assumption goes roughly thus: \"Since the theory of evolution is arrived at by the scientific method, and the scientific method excludes the possibility of the supernatural, the scientific method and therefore the ToE are atheistic.\" \n \n Peeling then goes on to use the analogy of gravity to show that there is nothing inherently sinister in the scientific method.\n \n Peeling then proceeds to change the debate to atheism vs scientific method. Slick tactic.\n \n He ends his first post with\n \"He can knock himself out painting conspiracy theories, but at the end of the day he's going to have to face up to the fact that millions upon millions of devout believers around the world - including at least one Pope - simply don't have a problem with evolution. \n \n Is the Pope an atheist? No, marc: he's a catholic.\"\n \n From there on, Marc9000 has a very hard time defending his thesis and it began to show in the opening of his second post in which Marc9000 takes a couple of shots at Peeling. \n \n Then, in an attempt to counter Peeling's assertion about the Pope and other theologists with a link to catholic.com and a quote found there. Unfortunately, most of the site speaks about the agreements within the Church on the majority of evolution with only Adam and Eve being an area of disagreement.\n \n Marc9000 then goes off on a tangent about how evolution is the basis for many lawsuits, but other branches of science aren't.\n ..............\n (Since I found that my comments were approaching the length of the debate itself, I'll condense the rest of my comments into the following:\n Marc9000 held an untennable position that was easily countered by Peeling.\n There was some digression into personal comments, but I found them not to be overly distracting.\n Marc9000 made an emotional appeal that was thin on provable detail.\n Peeling, on the other hand, used both science and Marc9000's own references to counter Marc's assertions in an effective and often playful way. \n \n In the end, I would have to say that Peeling quite handedly outpointed Marc9000 and won the debate.\n \n As a judge, I found the length of the responses to be somewhat excessive. I would, for the future, try to establish word limits for posts and encourage the participants to debate shorter, more concise points. At times, the debate meandered off into unfocused areas that were tangent to the resolution at best. This had a tendency to dilute the salient points that were made. Sometimes, the trees got lost for the forest. \n \n I will wait to hear from my fellow judges and then we will declare a winner.\n \n Thanks again for an interesting read.",

   "This was an interesting debate to judge. \n \n Marc started out relatively strong with a good opening. I liked the way he characterized evolutionary theory right from the start as \"a thoughtful alternative to religion\". It is a well worded opening, and it has a good impact. Peeling correctly points out a logical fallacy in the opening in stating:\n \n \nMarc takes the sturdiness of his foundations absolutely for granted and makes no attempt to prove this 'philosophical alignment'. This is based upon his implicit assumption of a link between atheism and pursuit of the scientific method. The assumption goes roughly thus: \"Since the theory of evolution is arrived at by the scientific method, and the scientific method excludes the possibility of the supernatural, the scientific method and therefore the ToE are atheistic.\"\n\n \n He is correct. Mark has technically committed a logical fallacy there. However, the way I read marcs post, that is simply an opening statement where marc is essentially outlining his argument. While this would likely cost marc some points if this was the national colligate debate finals, I would not think that was fair, either, so I deduct no points for it here, however, also to be fair, I do think that giving peeling credit for identifying the fallacy is appropriate.\n \n I am a little confused about marc strategy following. He introduces Talkorigins as a source and uses some snippets from there to bolster his argument. The first quote is fairly effective. The next two would have been good rebuttals for peeling to use, but have no point in Marcs post but to poison his own well. HE came up with an outstanding post from talkorigins that complied with his point, then immediately provided 2 more that counter it. It seems that he is almost suggesting some kind of conspiracy at talkorigins to portray evolution in a non atheistic light with this statement:\n \n \nThese statements, particularly the words I highlighted, hardly show the neutrality (both religious and emotional) that mainstream science claims to adhere too. Now at a close by page, lets see how they change their tune when it may seem like they're getting too close to atheism;\n\n \n He fails to explain the conspiracy, as he fails to explain why he feels the 2 follow up examples are less reliable as indicators than the first post that he included. His dealing with Austin Cline is likewise problematic. He uses a quote that contradicts his position, then he attempts to use those posts that directly contradict his position as proof of his position. He does finally explain a little of the conspiracy that he implied earlier, but presents no evidence of it.\n \n So, at the end of the first post, Marc has essentially presented quite a bit of evidence in peelings favor and introduced the potential for a conspiracy. The evidence presented in opposition to his own position is problematic, but the introduction of what essentially boils down to a conspiracy theory is not a bad ploy. If his opponent had chased that red herring, Marc would have been in an extremely strong position. \n \n On to peelings first post.\n \n Peeling starts out weak. While well written, the opening is largely the construction and knocking down of a straw man, all in the space of a couple of paragraphs. As an opening, it is weak. \n \n Peeling makes up for the weak opening in the next section. Making a direct line, logical correlation between science and god is difficult, and peeling does it brilliantly. For the most part, that section and the one entitled \"Evolution and Athiesm\" are strong. Peeling lays out the definition of Evolution that he intends to use for this debate and does a pretty good job of introducing the concepts he intends to use.\n \n I think that peeling makes a tactical error in attacking Marcs closing points from the previous post. In the section about \"equal distain...\" peeling attacks creationism which, as far as I can tell, is largely unrelated to this debate. There is nothing here to suggest that any discussion of creationism and its merits are relevant. The topic of this debate is soley whether or not evolution is atheistic. Mac threw out a red herring and peeling went after it. \n \n Besides that, peeling presents a logical rebuttal to the majority of Marcs points.\n \n In his next post, Marc opens by pointing out that peelings first post did not directly answer his. There are no points to be given here either way, but that was peelings opening post. It is not expected to be a strict rebuttal. Rather it is peelings opportunity to lay out HIS argument with the added responsibility of a rebuttal. Overall the composition of peelings first post is fairly typical for the second presenter in a debate. Again, no points anywhere there, just an observation.\n \n Marc goes on to attempt to debunk peelings ascertation that the pope believes in evolution. His rebuttal is problematic, however, in that by reading his link it is fairly clear that the catholic church allows for various different understandings when it come to the book of Genesis. It even quotes The Catechism:\n \n \nThe Catechism explains that \"Scripture presents the work of the Creator symbolically as a succession of six days of divine 'work,' concluded by the 'rest' of the seventh day\" (CCC 337), but \"nothing exists that does not owe its existence to God the Creator. The world began when God's word drew it out of nothingness; all existent beings, all of nature, and all human history is rooted in this primordial event, the very genesis by which the world was constituted and time begun\" (CCC 338). \n\n \n Marc has once again poisoned his own well. \n \n I am going to digress for a moment here and point out that this is a problem that comes up with internet debate since, unlike a verbal debate where you can selectively quote and nobody is the wiser, in an internet debate where you must link your source, that becomes more diffcult. In the past I have deducted points for using sources that contradict your view. I think that in the future (including now) I am going to go easy on that simply due to the unique situations that arise in internet debates. HOWEVER, if somebody deliberately quotes contradictory material as marc did in his opening post, or broadly referances an article as he does here, then the quoted portion or the entire article MUST be considered. When marc says:\n \n \nIf evolutionists proclaim or imply that the book of Genesis is an allegory, or that Adam and Eve were not real people of history, this link clearly shows that the Catholic church believes that THAT version of evolution has not kept \"within its own limits\".\n\n \n He has essentially entered the entire article as a reference...essentially invited the judges to read the entire thing and draw their own conclusions. In such cases sources that undermine the participants own argument must be counted against them.\n \n The rest of the post is primarily a series of attacks that contain few or no facts, and little or no logic. Again, Marc seems to be widening the conspiracy theory web a bit. Since peeling has not followed that, it does not make sense to continue to widen the net. All in all, it was a wasted post. We still have not seen any evidence that evolution is atheistic from marc that is not immediately refuted by marc.\n \n Peelings next post starts out on a personal level. Not surprising since marcs last post was primarily personal in nature. Both participants were straying from the debate at that point. Peeling does come back to rebut some of marcs points. The rebuttal of the link to the catholic churchs position was good, but not difficult since as has already been pointed out, the article primarily served as a rebuttal to marcs position, and he had already extended his reference from a small section of the article that may have supported him to the whole thing. \n \n Where peeling does gain significant points is here:\n \n \nTwo things leap out of the screen at me when reading this. The first is the recurring theme that anybody who disagrees with marc automatically forfeits the right to be credited with the default human quota of integrity, honesty, or intelligence. Hence the Catholic church could not possibly have reached their decision after careful investigation, deliberation, prayer and much soul-searching. No; they must have dishonestly capitulated for the sake of a quiet life - just like every theistic evolutionist must be stupid or a liar, and everyone who says evolution is not atheistic must be part of a global conspiracy.\n\n \n This is a logical fallacy marc has been using that you somewhat properly identified. It is commonly referred to as a \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. While I personally feel it was a tactical error to expose it so early on, the points remain the same. If peelig had allowed marc to continue along those lines and exposed the fallacy in the closing, it would have essentially wiped out much or marcs argument. \n \n There is another major point made here:\n \n \nEarlier, marc stated that evolution has not caused Catholics to abandon Genesis. To that he has now added that it has not made any headway towards proving godless origins - another statement I wholeheartedly endorse.\n \n By marc's own admission, then, the facts and theories of evolution do not materially support atheism. He therefore has no logical grounds upon which to prosecute his resolution that evolution is atheistic\n\n \n That is going to be extremely difficult for marc to recover from. \n \n His response essentially amounts to a capitulation of the debate:\n \n \nMy logical ground is that theories and philosophies of evolution strongly IMPLY atheism. Extrapolation and implication.\n\n \n I am forced to shorten my reply here. The resolution is \"Evolution is atheistic\". If the resolution was \"evolution implies atheism\", marc might be in a position to continue, but it is not, and marc never recovers from this.\n \n Marc never presents any evidence at all that evolution is atheistic, while peeling presents quite a bit of evidence and linear logic showing that evolution is not necessarily atheistic. By taking a position that includes theistic evolution, he does an excellent job of showing that not only is evolution not atheistic, but that it is possible for evolutionary theory to actually compliment religious dogma. \n \n Ultimately marcs position would have been the more difficult of the two since from a practical standpoint all peeling had to do was show that there do exist individuals who believe in both god and evolution. I did keep this in mind while reviewing the debate. However, debate is an exercise in logic, and marcs constant use of sources that contradict his position is a serious problem. I could not tell if he was trying to develop the \"conspiracy theory\" angle more fully or not, but if he was, it was ineffective.\n \n Peeling is the clear winner of this debate.",
