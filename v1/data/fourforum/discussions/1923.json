   "Kerry Praises Terrorist Leader Arafat as 'Role Model'\n \n John Kerry called terrorist leader Yasser Arafat a \"role model\" and a \"statesman\" in a 1997 book \"that Kerry cites as proof of his own foresight about foreign policy,\" the New York Post's Deborah Orin revealed today. \n \n Kerry's latest flip-flop: He \"expressed the opposite view eight days ago, when he told Jewish leaders in New York that he shares President Bush's belief that Arafat must be isolated because he's not a 'partner for peace' - much less a statesman.\"\n \n In his book \"The New War,\" which like his scandalous 1971 book, \"The New Soldier,\" is out of print, Kerry claimed: \"Terrorist organizations with specific political agendas may be encouraged and emboldened by Yasser Arafat's transformation from outlaw to statesman.\" \n \n He added that terrorists \"whose only object is to disrupt society require no such 'role models'\" as Arafat.\n \n The Post noted, \"Kerry's remarks came as he was dismissing noted historian Paul Johnson as out of date for saying the Palestinian Liberation Organization is 'the quintessential terrorist movement' but has achieved nothing for its people.\"\n \n What a novel way to secure the Democrats' all-important Jewish bloc of voters and donors. Too bad he didn't learn from Hillary Clinton's disastrous embrace of Mrs. Arafat.\n \n Yet another flip-flop: Kerry told Arab American Institute in July that Israel's security fence was \"provocative\" and a barrier to peace. But he told Jewish leaders last week that the fence was \"necessary to the security of Israel.\" \n \n And still another waffle to add to Kerry's supersized stack: Jim Zogby, a member of Democratic National Committee who backs Kerry, says Kerry's aides told him the Massachusetts Democrat objected to the location of the fence.",

   "Comments like the above Kerry praises Arafat, show in general how many of the Bush supporters like to forget about certain historical facts and in general are hypocrites. How easily they forget about Cheney (or is it Rummy) shaking hands with Saddam just a year after the gassing of the Kursds, calling him a friend of the USA. \n \n To scorn one political leader for past comments about foreign political leaders, while forgiving others for similar acts, indicates to me a weak mind.",

Thats like someone saying, \"Saddam is not a good man\" and a paper quoting saying the person sad Saddam is \"a good man\".\nI agree somewhat with your assessment of this distorted quote by the Repubs. To say that \"we dont need a role model such as this\" is not to say that the subject person is thought of as a role model. It means \"we don't consider this person to be a worthy role model\".\n \n However, I think the originally quoted statement does say that Yasser has changed from an outlaw to a statesman. This is also untrue. He's still an outlaw and a terrorist leader.\n \n The Repubs, in quoting Kerry said, that they (the terrorists) require no such role models. This is after referring to Yasser as a statesman that is no longer an outlaw...meaning that the terrorists want no such 'role model'. I infer that the quoted statement actually does praise Yasser as a statesman who is now interpretted as fueling terrorism by his supposed change from outlaw to statesman (a role model that they don't want).\n \n So it's not really that far out of line to say the Kerry thinks Arafat's a statesman and a role model that the terrorists don't want.\n \n \n \n ...and Yasser is a really ugly bastard. (He reminds me of Michael Moore.)",
