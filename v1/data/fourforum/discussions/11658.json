I've sent it to all my fence-walking friends. It is really strange that the arguments from the supporters of the Democrats seem to ignore the FACTS and exhibit categorical denial by invoking the overused and inaccurate \"Bush's failed economic policy\" talking point. They refuse to admit that Lyndon Johnson privatized Fannie Mae, that Carter made loans to the unqualified plentiful and that Clinton made it even easier to get them. They refuse to admit that Bush indeed saw a problem in the early 2000s or that McCain and Bush both tried to add regulations in the mid-2000s only to be defeated by the Democrat's partisan NO votes.\n \n You talk about making bad decisions and still blaming those who wanted to fix it earlier? The Democrats take the cake here in denial of responsibility.\n \n As smart as Bill Clinton is, I'm betting he knew in 1999 that his relaxing of credit qualifications would cause a big economic problem before the next president got out of office. He's not in a position to have to worry about a financial crisis or depression...he's on our payroll and protected by our secret service until he dies.",

   "This is what I was waiting for-a concise explanation that cut through the partisan BS. Thanks Daewoo. Would you be interested in writing a post describing the pros/cons of the bailout proposal?\n\n \n Pros:\n \n I have figured out a way to get my piece of that $700 billion.\n \n Cons:\n \n This one is the long one.\n \n First, you have to understand a couple of things about exactly what can realistically be expected from the bailout and the assumptions that are being made about it. \n \n The bailout eventually amounts to buying MBS, credit card, and auto loan backed bonds from financial institutions (though that has been widened to \"anybody\"). What they are selling the public is that once the banks clear this off their books, everything will be OK. There are a few problems with this.\n \n First, in about 95% of cases, those bonds make up part of the institutions capital reserve requirement. If we buy them up at the \"deeply discounted\" prices that Paulson has said we will buy them at, banks will not be able to meet their capital reserve requirements so they will have to raise capital. Basically the hope is that we buy those securities, foreign investors are no longer fearful about what is on banks books, so foreigners line up around the block to invest in US banks, which are insolvent, going into a recession if not a depression. It would have to be either the Asians or the Arabs. Nobody else has that kind of money. The Asians have already said \"Are you on crack...no way\", so it woudl be up to the Arabs, who do not actually like us that much, to take on an investment so insanely risky that you may as well stack the money, pour gas on it, throw matches at it, and bet somebody that it will not burn.\n \n IMO Bernanke gave us a more honest look at what we will be paying for these when he testified in front of congress. He was extolling the virtues of buying at near the \"hold to maturity\" price. What is the hold to maturity price? No idea. It is a nonsensical phrase that Bernanke apparently made up. It sounds to me like it is awfully close to face value, but I dont know because since he apparently invented the term he has to define it. The one thing we DO know about this mythical price is that it is apparently MUCH higher than the market price for these. The up side to this is that it solves all of the banks problems (for now). The down side is that the US taxpayer has just paid book value for a bunch of securities that are defaulting at a 20+ % rate and that rate is expected to rise to as much as 65%.\n \n What the cons really boil down to is that if we do the bailout we end up issuing hundreds of billions in new treasuries that are essentially backed by toxic paper that is so dirty some of this stuff is selling as low as 3 cents on the dollar. The Asians and Arabs both have said they are not buying that, so it is questionable whether we can even finance the bailout. \n \n There are a couple of outside issues that rear their ugly heads in this whole thing as well. First, we have the derivatives market. IMO we will not see any problems from straight credit default swaps since most of them are only triggered in the event of an outright default. That still leaves trillions in derivatives that WOULD be triggered in a substantial material revaluation. This is a lot of what AIG down. They kept having to set money aside for downgraded securities as well as paying out claims on some of them. Most companies have only actually written down 10-15% of the value on those securities based on mark to myth accounting. If they actually end up selling them for less, we will see failure in the derivatives market that will make the recent problems look like nothing.",

When Greenspan crashed interest rates to 1% Volker recognized that the only capital market in the country that could take that kind of capital infustion was the real estate market.

The next MAJOR sector failures are going to be pension funds. You can just about bank on it. \n \n There was no accounting for risk AT ALL, and it was not just home loans. Credit cards and vehicle loans were the same. Take the balances, securitize them, sell them off.\n \n This is a BIG part of the reason that the bailout is destined to fail. Regardless of what else happens, we are going to see a tightening of credit in the future, and 60 fo the 8 cylinders our economy runs on have been fueled by cheap and easy credit. \n \n I was reading an article the other day where people were whining about how hard it is to get credit now. They had some examples. A 42 year old freelance writer whose husband had lost his job was wining because she went to lowes and filled out a credit app for a card and needed a $5000 limit to do some home maintenance and she only got a $1000 limit.

A 60 yr old unemployed man should not EVER be able to pick up a loan to pay living expenses unless he can put up some serious collateral. An undocumented day laborer who makes $8 and hour should not EVER be able to borrow $300,000 to buy a house.

Second, I absolutely AM an authority on these things. Check my past posts. Third, genius, how in the hell do you suppose I \"prove\" that loan quality regulations do not exist for entities that are not federally insured? Here is the proof:\n \n www.findlaw.com\n \n There you go. Go through and read every federal law and you will see that it is NOT there. \n \n I can make it a little easier, though, since I am an authority on these matters I know that it was just THIS YEAR that they started applying deceptive lending practice regulation on non federally insured loans, so we will search for that instead.\n \n Here we go. Note the date:\n \n http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/15/business/fi-fed15\n \n \nThe central thrust of the new rules is to restore sound underwriting practices, such as requiring lenders to verify that borrowers actually have the income and assets to make their loan payments.\n\n \n \nThe new rules take effect Oct. 1 and will apply to all mortgage lenders, brokers, servicers and banks, not just those already regulated by the central bank.\n\n \n \nAmong other measures, the new rules bar misleading advertising practices, including using the word \"fixed\" to describe the terms of a mortgage whose rate or payments will change over the course of the loan. The rules also require mortgage ads in a foreign language to make all important disclosures in that language.\n\n \n Federally insured banks have been required to do things like verify income for 30+ years. \n \n If that is not good enough, then www.findlaw.com it is. Let us know when you are done reading through every federal law. \n \n Also, on an interesting note (just happened to be in the same article):\n \n \nThe sale came a day after the Bush administration said it would seek congressional approval to temporarily boost the Treasury Department's lines of credit for Freddie Mac and fellow mortgage finance company Fannie Mae, and to take the rare step of investing in their stocks if necessary. The Fed also said it would extend loans to the companies.\n \n The moves were designed to give Fannie and Freddie the cash they needed to buy mortgages issued by lenders and resell them to investors. Last week, shares of both companies lost almost half their value amid sudden concerns that the companies wouldn't have enough capital to withstand the mortgage downturn.\n\n \n Gee, waddya know...they tried to boost freddie an fannies activities in order to stabilize the failing market.",

Here's an excerpt from the end of the article. \n Color-Blind Markets?\n \n INDEED, some mortgage lenders now believe that low- and moderate-income borrowers are one of the growth markets of the 1990s. If left alone to devise methods of reaching this market, they will do so in a color-blind manner without sacrificing credit standards and without redistributing costs by charging other borrowers more for their mortgages. The alternative can already be seen at work at banks and thrifts struggling to improve their lending to minorities. The Consumer Bankers Association reports that 69 per cent of banks in its affordable-housing survey subsidize their minority-outreach programs, usually by offering lower interest rates, but also by incurring higher operating costs to administer the loans. Among banks that subsidize, 76 per cent of the subsidies come from bank profits, while the remaining subsidies come from government programs and non-profit organizations. The Clinton Administration's heavy-handed, raceconscious approach threatens to forcibly expand this small subsidy foothold.\n \n The crackdown is, therefore, not a boon but a roadblock to racial progress. If it succeeds in driving banks to make bad loans in order to improve their minority-approval rates, this will eventually lead to more foreclosures in troubled inner-city communities. It will also reduce the available capital to credit-worthy borrowers, forcing more Americans to settle for a less attractive home than they had expected. Some whites who formerly would have qualified at the margins for a mortgage will be denied their chance at the American dream. And mortgage rates will rise for everyone to cover the losses from bad loans.\n \n The Clinton method will achieve faster, but short-lived, results for minority rejection rates. And in the process it will heighten racial divisions in our society. As in every other field in which quotas have been tried, they will hurt the people they are trying to help--and everyone else, too.\n And HERE'S the part Carters Community Reinvestment Act played in preparing the way for Clinton.",

   "Sounds like it. \n \n The further you get into how this stuff is structured, the more insane it gets. You look at the prospectus for some of this stuff and it is not even clear what the underlying assets ARE, and this was selling as investment grade paper. The next MAJOR sector failures are going to be pension funds. You can just about bank on it. \n \n There was no accounting for risk AT ALL, and it was not just home loans. Credit cards and vehicle loans were the same. Take the balances, securitize them, sell them off.\n \n This is a BIG part of the reason that the bailout is destined to fail. Regardless of what else happens, we are going to see a tightening of credit in the future, and 60 fo the 8 cylinders our economy runs on have been fueled by cheap and easy credit. \n \n I was reading an article the other day where people were whining about how hard it is to get credit now. They had some examples. A 42 year old freelance writer whose husband had lost his job was wining because she went to lowes and filled out a credit app for a card and needed a $5000 limit to do some home maintenance and she only got a $1000 limit. She complained and they raised it to $2000. A 60 yr old unemployed man had to sell his coin collection at a pawn shop because he could not get a loan to cover his living expenses. \n \n BAd new.....a 42 yr old without a steady income and an unemployed husband should not EVER be able to walk in, fill out a form, and pick up an unsecured $5000 line of credit. A 60 yr old unemployed man should not EVER be able to pick up a loan to pay living expenses unless he can put up some serious collateral. An undocumented day laborer who makes $8 and hour should not EVER be able to borrow $300,000 to buy a house. These people were borrowing, though, and they were spending it, and it was boosting our economy in a MAJOR way. Now that party is over and we are going to see some MAJOR economic contraction.\nThe same applies to the giving of loans to unqualified borrowers. A man should not be able to walk in and receive a mortgage that cannot be paid back. This is what Carter's CRA provided a basis for. This is what Bill Clinton's modification enabled further. In order to treat the \"less fortunate\" more \"fairly\" we have to give them loans even though they are clearly NOT QUALIFIED.\n \n As I said, we'd be better off had we just given them the homes and paid the mortgages ourselves, letting the government own the homes.\n \n Making the loans hard to get (i.e. requiring QUALIFICATION of the borrower) is exactly what Carter and Clinton did away with. The fact that the bogus loans were then traded on the market is not their fault, but the seed was planted when the requirements were reduced beyond a reasonable level.",

(See full text of Act and current regulations.[1]) The act prohibits financial institutions from targeting only wealthier neighborhoods with their services, a practice known as \"redlining.\" The purpose of the CRA is to ensure that under-served populations can obtain credit, including home ownership opportunities and commercial loans to small businesses. The Act was passed in 1977 and has been subjected to important regulatory revisions since then.\n \n \n Perhaps you (daewoo) should complain to Wikipedia that they have it all wrong.

First of all, their very existence is contrary to their stated goal. If you want affordable housing the LAST thing you want is easy credit.

More important than the actual CRA is the philosophy behind it. Many politicians got this idea stuck in their head that housing is now a right. This caused legislation like the CRA but doesn't mean it hurt the financial market. If you remember, the CRA was for low income areas and only for banks that are FDIC insured. As Daewoo has pointed out, most foreclosures are with mortgage companies (like John D Wades Mortgages as opposed to Wachovia). Furthermore, AIG is not going bankrupt because someone is foreclosing on a $80,000 hut in west baltimore. Look at it this way. A cheap TV cannot go down in value that much because it has not luxury value to it. A 55\" LCD TV can go way down in value because the mark up is so high and it is more of a luxury. So bringing this back to the housing market, look at the foreclosures in your area. Generally they are newer homes that had an overinflated value or \"luxury value\". These range from your McMansions to nice looking townhomes. These were never in those \"red lined\" areas protected by the CRA. There has to be something more that caused this.\n \n That something is really a combination of bad business practices, idiotic government intervention, and XXXXXX who bought homes. Mortgage companies tried to make a quick buck and lent mortgages like they were going out of style. The government cut rates to make homes affordable but all that did was make them more expensive and over their true value. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had the bright idea to back these mortgages. XXXXXX decided that their $50,000 a year pay would be enough to cover a $350,000 house with a 2/1 ARM or no money down loan. \n \n So it was a failure on all levels. The CRA didn't contribute directly, in my opinion, but does show the thinking at the time (and continued for 20yrs) which is that everyone should have a home. It was a greedy, spoiled attitude and now we should pay the price. \n \n \nI can imagine there have been many Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac executives that knew the system was flawed. Since many of them were siphoning off huge salaries and bonuses, they managed to look the other way...Barney Frank's boyfriend being one of them. Franklin Raines is the king of them.\nMy uncle was an exec at Fannie Mae in 1990 and predicted that in 15yrs a housing bubble would burst. Sadly he was wrong as it was 17 years later. \n \n \nIf the executives knew something was inherently wrong with the system, why did they let Bill Clinton make it worse in 1999?\nI'm not convinced GLB Act had a negative effect. Deregulation is always a good thing because the government doesn't know how to run anything.\n \n \nI do not blame Jimmy and Billy for creating greed and corruption. Both have been with us since before 2600 BC. Jimmy and Billy merely made it easier to steal from the system...in their quest for votes from the poor, oppressed people who could not afford to buy a home. It's the Democratic way.\nTrue liberal economics is scary but lets not forget Bush Jr and Reagan who probably helped contribute. In fact, Bush Jr might be a reason for the next collapse (deficit bubble haha). In the end, the presidents were minor compared to the overall thinking in congress and, to much bigger extent, the thinking of the market.\n \n \nWe have no choice but to wait and see what Obama and the Democrats will do when they take over control of the country's goals.

Rest assured though, Obama and his cronies will be filthy rich by the time the real bottom gets here.\nI'm actually afraid things will get better when Obama takes office. Remember, people are short term thinkers. How can an economy improve in the short term? Send lots of money you don't have! It Obama goes on a shopping spree we will see everyone cheer the turn around and once Obama is gone he won't worry about the long term effects of his actions.",

House Republicans have been clamoring for Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to get to the bottom of just how Fannie and Freddie turned into such a colossal mess, but he has been reluctant to engage. \n Waxman is stalling because he realizes that an investigation into the failed mortgage giants would seriously damage the Democrats. It was the Democrats who relaxed lending restrictions at both institutions, it was Democrats who for seven years repelled every Republican attempt to avert the coming disaster, and it was the Democrats' relaxed lending restrictions that led to the collapse of the housing market and the ensuing economic crisis. But Waxman found a way out of this political pickle: simply postpone the Fannie and Freddie hearings until after the election. After all, they don't want the public to know tidbits such as the fact that Barack Obama was the second largest recipient of political money from Fannie Mae, and that a number of sitting Demo representatives and senators were complicit in creating the financial crisis they now blame on the Republicans. Still, it is unlikely that inconvenient truths would be discovered by a Waxman hearing in any event. \n \n",

   "Which party? Whose connections?\n \nSeptember 22, 2008\n Loan Titans Paid McCain Adviser Nearly $2 Million\n By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and CHARLES DUHIGG\n Senator John McCain's campaign manager was paid more than $30,000 a month for five years as president of an advocacy group set up by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to defend them against stricter regulations, current and former officials say.\n \n Mr. McCain, the Republican candidate for president, has recently begun campaigning as a critic of the two companies and the lobbying army that helped them evade greater regulation as they began buying riskier mortgages with implicit federal backing. He and his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, have donors and advisers who are tied to the companies.\n \n But last week the McCain campaign stepped up a running battle of guilt by association when it began broadcasting commercials trying to link Mr. Obama directly to the government bailout of the mortgage giants this month by charging that he takes advice from Fannie Mae's former chief executive, Franklin Raines, an assertion both Mr. Raines and the Obama campaign dispute.\n \n Incensed by the advertisements, several current and former executives of the companies came forward to discuss the role that Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's campaign manager and longtime adviser, played in helping Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac beat back regulatory challenges when he served as president of their advocacy group, ,,, \"The value that he brought to the relationship was the closeness to Senator McCain and the possibility that Senator McCain was going to run for president again,\" said Robert McCarson, a former spokesman for Fannie Mae, who said that while he worked there from 2000 to 2002, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together paid Mr. Davis's firm $35,000 a month. Mr. Davis \"didn't really do anything,\" Mr. McCarson, a Democrat, said....\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/us/politics/22mccain.html",

   "Which party? Whose connections?\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/us/politics/22mccain.html\nDear, dear! What a blind party supporter you are. If you bother to read your entire link you will see that the Democrats needed a Republican to take some of the blame for failure of the system.\n \n There is no puzzle associated with your failure to post this part of the article.\n \n \n\n In an interview Sunday night with CNBC and The New York Times, Mr. McCain noted that Mr. Davis was no longer working on behalf of the mortgage giants. He said Mr. Davis \"has had nothing to do with it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.\"\n \n Asked about the reports of Mr. Davis's role, a spokesman for Mr. McCain said that during the time when Mr. Davis ran the Homeownership Alliance, the senator had backed legislation to increase oversight of the mortgage companies' accounting and executive compensation. The legislation, however, did not seek to change their anomalous structure as private companies with federal support.\n \n The spokesman, Tucker Bounds, also noted that the Homeownership Alliance included nonprofit organizations like Habitat for Humanity and the Urban League. \"It's not controversial to promote homeownership and minority homeownership,\" Mr. Bounds said. More than a half-dozen current and former executives, however, said the Homeownership Alliance was set up mainly to defend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by promoting their role in the housing market, and the two companies paid almost the entire cost of the group's operations.\n \n \"They were financed largely, possibly exclusively, by Fannie and Freddie,\" said William R. Maloni, a Democrat who is a former head of industry relations for Fannie Mae. \"We thought it would be helpful to have someone who was a broadly recognized Republican to be the face of the organization, and that person became Rick Davis.\" Mr. Maloni added, \"Rick, for that purpose, turned out to be quite good.\" (Several executives said Mr. Davis's compensation was not unusual for the companies' well-connected consultants.)\n \n The federal bailout of the two mortgage giants has become an emblem of what critics say is the outdated or inadequate regulatory system that allowed the financial system to slide into crisis this summer. \n \n At the time that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recruited Mr. Davis to run the Homeownership Alliance in 2000, they were under new pressure from private industry rivals and deregulation-minded Republicans who argued that the two companies' federal sponsorship gave them an unfair advantage and put taxpayers at risk. Critics of the companies had formed their own Washington-based advocacy group, FM Watch. They were pushing for regulations that would deter the companies from expanding into new areas, including riskier and more profitable mortgages. \n \n Mr. Davis had recently returned to his lobbying firm from running Mr. McCain's unexpectedly strong 2000 Republican primary campaign, which elevated Mr. McCain's profile as a legislator and Mr. Davis's as a lobbyist.\n \n \"You can say what you want about free-market distortions, but people like the system because it gets them into houses cheap,\" Mr. Davis said to Institutional Investor magazine in 2000, adding that he would run the advocacy group out of his Alexandria, Va., lobbying firm.\n \n The organization also hired Public Strategies, a communications firm that included former Bush adviser Mark McKinnon. Mr. Davis wrote letters and gave speeches for the group. In April 2001, he sent out a press release headlined, \"It's Tax Day - Do You Know Where Your Deductions Are? For Most Americans, They're in Your Home.\" \n \n But by the end of 2005, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were recovering from accounting problems and re-examining costs, former executives said. The companies decided the Homeownership Alliance had outlived its usefulness, and it disappeared.\n \n",

   "All government funds come from taxes, loans or sales of government owned property.\n\n \n Aside from the obvious fact that nationalizing banks is a horrible idea, if we spend 100 billion (or worse, 700 billion) on buying banks than you have to raise the money. We will take the 700 billion since that is the magic number these days with bailouts. This is about 25 percent of our budget. You either raise taxes by a large margin or have to cut all of the defense budget or all of SSA or all of Health and Human Services or about 10-25 other departments by 100%. \n \n See Page 41 and let me know which ones you plan on cutting if you do not wish to raise taxes: http://gao.gov/financial/fy2007/finstatement.pdf\n \n If you want to get money from loaning than basically you support issuing debt to pay for debt. This is partially the reason we are in this mess now. I can't imagine you really would use this option...only our Congress is that #####ic.\n \n Sales of government property....hey I support this! I bet Iran would pay some good money for our tanks and planes. Let's sell the Stealths to Russia. The white house might go for a few million. Hmmmm, too bad our total assets are only worth 700 billion. Granted this is minus depreciation but I figure we have to keep a few buildings to approve the purchasing of a few banks.\n \n Frankly the idea is horrible. It hasn't worked in the modern day history of this world and I doubt this will change.",
