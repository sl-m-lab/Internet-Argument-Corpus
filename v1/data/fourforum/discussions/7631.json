Seems to me they navigated us through perilous times when a misstep could have resulted in nuclear war. Seeing as how we're still here and the Soviet Union collapsed I'd say they did just fine in that regards.\n \n Sometimes the big stick is the answer, sometimes the carrot. Most of the time it's a combination of the two. A succesful leader must be able to use both. Always going toe to toe is a recipe for disaster, just as much as refusing to take a stand would be. You have to take each situation as it comes, and react to it accordingly.",

   "Isolationism served the US well for many years.\n \n Then Wilson decided to make the world (Europe) safe for Democracy, installing one in Germany, which then elected Hitler.\n \n FDR made Europe safe for Democracy (again) by siding with Russia against Germany, handing over Eastern Europe to the Communist Party and sparking the Cold War, which threatened to destroy much of human civilisation.\n \n Later presidents backed dictators and government around the world to fight a proxy war against communism (To make the world safe for Democracy, again), resulting in the problems we now face in the Middle East, Africa and South America, with Islamic hatred of the west and terrorism.\n \n To combat this, and make the world safe for Democracy, Bush has begun a crusade to clean up the middle east.\n \n This can only lead to one thing - more war, more problems and more war, while the American people suffer further the burdens of oppressive governance, taxation and inflation.\n \n It's all well and good to harp about \"appeasers\" who didn't clean the mess up, but it was foreign intervention in the name of Democracy that created the mess in the first place - and \"cleaning it up\", whenever the \"tough\" men arrived, has always resulted in problems just as bad as those before it.\n \n Maybe it's time to say hey, it's not our business to clean up the world, and maybe bombs, guns and sanctions aren't the tools to do it with.\n \n Just sit back, shut the hell up, and serve as a good example, as served the US well up until it decided Europe needed to become democratic in the first place. You may say since the US has caused these problems, it's its \"responsibility\" to fix them. It can't fix them, it doesn't have the tools to fix them. It's its responsibility to live with those problems now, wait for them to wear themselves out, and not screw things up more trying to bomb, interrogate, threaten and inflate its way out of trouble.",

Is it appeasement to do the right thing, even when your enemy wants you to, or is that just doing the right thing? \n \n For example, our closest allies in the ME are Israel and Saudi Arabia. AQ would like us to pull support from those two countries. Saudi Arbia is the most totalitarian country on the planet. Obviously supporting totalitarian regimes is against our principals as Americans. If we stopped supporting Saudi Arabia, would that really be appeasement?\n \n Israel is occupying Palesine in violation of international law and multiple UN resolutions. They have killed hundreds of thousands of Palestenian Civilians. They are also the only nation the US supports that codifies racism. Since Israel obvioulsy operates 180 degrees frmo US principals, would dropping them on their racist, genocidal butts really be appeasement?",
