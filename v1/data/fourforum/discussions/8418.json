Other possible prices are mostly ignored, consumers want to buy, not do maths practice. What you need to keep in mind is that the actual rounding only occurs after you are making the actual purchase. So you could buy 9 items worth $1.19, be charged 9 * $1.19 = $10.71 and actually end up paying $10.70, 10 cents saving compared to an item priced $1.20. I'm too much of a cash kind of guy to say with 100% certainty if electronical transactions are rounded or not, but I think it is not.\n \n I hope that clarifies, sorry for the confusion, I got lost in my own story earlier.
