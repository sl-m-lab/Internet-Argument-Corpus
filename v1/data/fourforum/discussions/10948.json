   "I had this sent to me at my school. I've cleaned it up a bit and changed some wording...\n AREN'T YOU ALL SICK OF THOSE HIGH PAID TEACHERS??\n \n Their hefty salaries are driving up taxes, and they only work nine or ten months a year! It's time we put things in perspective and pay them for what they do... baby-sit! We can get that for less than minimum wage. That is right. I would give them $3.00 dollars an hour and only the hours they worked, not any of that silly planning time. That would be $19.50 a day (7:45 AM to 4:00 PM with 45 min. off for lunch). Each parent should pay $19.50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children. Now, how many do they teach in a day... maybe 30? So that's 19.5 X 30 = $585.00 a day.\n \n However, remember they only work 180 days a year! I am not going to pay them for any vacations. Let's see ... . . that's $585 x 180 = $105,300 per year.\n \n (Hold on! My calculator must be malfunctioning...)\n \n What about those special teachers and the ones with master's degrees? Well, we could pay them minimum wage just to be fair, round it off to $7.00 an hour. That would be $7 times 6-1/2 hours times 30 children times 180 days = $245,700.00 per year.\n \n Wait a minute, there is something wrong here!\n \n \n ... There sure is, duh!\n \n (Average teacher salary $50,000/180 days = $277per day/30 students = $9.23/6.5 hours = $1.42 per hour per student.) Very inexpensive baby-sitter and they even educate your kids! Crazy!Nevermind that I happen to average 7:30 to 6:00pm on weekdays and 4-5 hours over most weekends at about one-third of that \"average\" salary for 190 contract days. Or that most teachers spend significant portions of that \"vacation time\" at workshops and training sessions, many of which are paid for from their own pockets. (This is the equivalent of your CEO/boss requiring you to attend a banquet in order to keep your job but refusing to pay for travel, room, registration, or meals.) Should I subtract my $1200 training program fee? How about the $1200 for next year?",

   "Here's a bit I wrote not too long ago. It needs, work, but I'll put it here because it's on topic.\n There are only two jobs on the planet that are held by people who aren't appointed by citizens but still face the wrath of the everyday Joe and Jane. Despite having no background of the job, despite knowing nothing about the effort that goes into doing the job, the average person feels that he or she knows exactly what is being done wrong and why that job holder should be fired.\n \n The first job of which I speak is that of the professional sports athlete. Average Joe Monday morning quarterbacks and the like trade their reasons for how much better said Joe could have done if only he'd been in the player's place. Sports commentators critique performances, sportswriters compare stats and share opinions on why whoever should go, and coaches yell and scream for each mistake. Fans of opposing teams hate the athlete's guts with all their hearts, just for being on the wrong team. Nobody really sees the hard work that goes into physical training, practice, and studying film. Poor, poor athletes.\n But let's face it: athletes are also revered as heroes. They receive seven- or eight-digit annual salaries. They perform only for people who want to see them do their job. For being good at their jobs, they get recognition and endorsement deals on top of their insanely huge salaries. Why? For playing a game. So for millions and millions of dollars, they can deal with some naysayers.\n \n What is this other job, you ask? The other job is that of a teacher.\n \n Teachers perform every day around children who come to school while sick, who spread their germs around and infect entire small populations at a time, but the teacher gets a mere one sick day per month.\n Teachers are doomed to bad reviews: Those students who don't learn feel stupid. Those students who have to try hard just to keep up feel stupid. Those students who have things explained to them in a clear and simple way, such that the solution seems in hindsight to be incredibly obvious, feel stupid for not figuring it out themselves first.\n Teachers spend countless hours before and after \"work hours\" to do the things that need to get done. And it's expected. There are no rewards for being dedicated. There may be overtime, but there's no overtime pay.\n Teachers perform day in and day out in front of an audience composed of people who would rather be anywhere but school. There are no ushers to calm or remove the unruly. They tolerate despicable behavior from the spectators but have not the slightest margin of error themselves. There are no cheering crowds, no spirit squads, and no songs, bands, or music for encouragement. And the teacher has to be the scorekeeper, too.\n Teachers are usually completely ignored until those scores are released, then face the belligerent parents of students who just didn't earn as good a grade as they had hoped. Parents are somehow experts at knowing what grade their children should have gotten, even if the parent has never seen the inside of the classroom, has never seen a test score, and didn't even know what the course was about until seeing the report card.\n \n Why do teachers do it? It's not a fun game. The only seven-digit salaries include the digits after the decimal point. There are no adoring fans. There are no endorsement deals. There is no fortune or fame. There is animosity, unjustified criticism, endless work, endless training, endless performance analysis, endless protocol changes, endless adaptation, and an endless supply of red tape and beauracracy.\n \n So why? Why be a teacher?\n \n We simply find personal satisfaction in bettering your child.\n \n So, if you want to come in ranting and raving about how terrible a teacher is, and especially if your child isn't doing well due to the fact that he or she is a lazy, unmotivated, spoiled little brat because you've completely failed to police his or her upbringing as a parent should, then unless you've brought along a multi-million dollar paycheck, you can just keep your mouth shut.\n (For what it's worth, I've received relatively little vile from parents this year, even though I make my class damn challenging.)",

Have done all the work on logic, reasoning and critical thinking and will be meeting with the teachers in a week to chew their arses out for some failures.\n Ever try to explain how a black-hole works to a 10 year old?\n How about marvel in glee when they, on their own, can spot a hypocrit?\n Or, laugh as karma punishes the wicked?\n Or, create a decent piece of propaganda?\n \n Standard education typically caters to the common denominator and forces all into a cookie cutter mold.

Coming up with some standardized tests to establish merit pay will just cause more of the same and will take away from real instructional time.\n\n Oh, I agree that the current mandates for education sux. NCLB is bunk.\n Learning how to take a test is not learning nor even acquiring knowledge.\n \n \nWell, that wasn't really how I interpreted the email. I interpreted the email as saying that it's hellaciously inexpensive despite the fact that it can be extremely beneficial. That is, there is no reason to make blanket complaints about teacher pay. Some cases, sure. I have my own objections to some salaries in my own district. But these are the exceptions, not the rule.\n\n TBH, I wouldn't become a teacher.\n Pay sux. Degradation of the respect for the profession and even the person of a teacher has increased over time. They're prohibited from enforcing reasonable discipline. It's now either zero tolerance, you're expelled or, we can't do anything as it'll be construed as abuse.\n \n \nAt least in my state, the law disallows this.

Oh, and then there's that whole legal problem...\n\n Slow is an objective observation. Remember, this is cookie cuttering them all into one pattern. Not a succession of patterns.\n Plus, history and many rags to riches stories have consisted of the determined individual who refuses to be shoe-horned into a form dictated by their circumstances and disposition.\n My youngest daughter is about a half year 'slow'. But, has more determination than my most gifted all-A daughter and in all likelihood will be the most successful in the end. My eldest son is very artistically gifted and charismatic...but a looser slacker. Hopefully, his choice in life as it stands is one that will bring him personal happiness without jeopardizing the wellbeing of any kids he brings into the world. My all-A daughter typically wears blinders and has smoke blown up her backside by her current teachers. She refuses to listen to experience and advice. Hopefully, she'll find a niche to be successful in.\n \n \nNo eating in my classroom.\n\n But, but...teacher, I need to eat it because of [insert random lame excuse].\n \n \nDo you think that these techniques are unique to advanced classes?\n\n Do you think they'll work on unmotivated kids? It just sounds like typical teacher response 'I'm good, my kids are good, all the teachers I know are good...union talk.' \n Initially, I'd say your a very knowledgable person. You do post on forums, discuss and present a good case for yourself when I do follow your posts. So, your kids probbly get a decent class.\n \n \nTwo, not counting short-term substitution. Why does this matter?\n\n As a reference to experience in diversity.\n Understanding that there are some awsome teachers out there who are properly supported, motivated and compensated with decent students...and then there's the opposite. Like in Houston TX. where some schools have police and judges on grounds to deal with the criminal student body. Or that some locations are impoverished. I recall not standing the local middle school as a ghetto. It was poorly maintained and depressing. How could anyone want to go there to learn? My oldest went there a year. No one else went. Fortunatly we were creative enough to get our kids into private education...which can be an entirely different (and just as problematic) can of worms.\n \n \nTo an extent, I agree. But it's not like my techniques are new and revolutionary. I think it's quite humorous that you've accused teachers of pigeonholing students into cookie-cutter shapes when (1) you seem to do so yourself to a certain degree and (2) you've done the same to teachers.\n\n As mentioned above. I'm willing to shoe horn them into differing levels of cookie cutter molds...not make everyone the same with standardizing testing. I'm sure there still exists differing levels of education standards in public schools. From remedial classes to advanced ones.\n I didn't recall I was pidgeon holeing teachers though.\n \n \nYour school doesn't have an online grade report system implemented? Most schools nowadays are going this route.\n\n I haven't been informed of anything. Over the past few years, this elementary school is going ghetto. From the average representative school for the community (suburbanites) to an influx of students from local projects and more importantly a school administration from that mentality too.\n Focusing on silly issues like 'security' and bullism when there never was an extensive problem with those in the past. \n The old grandfatherly principal retired and was replaced twice by young, MLK-inner city wannabes.\n Fortunatly, it's my kids last year in that school so I don't trouble myself with this.\n \n \nThis is another thing that becomes evidence with an online system.\n\n Seems like the local school is dropping more and more behind the times. This is my 4th kid attending the same school. These problems would not have happened in the past. Unfortunatly, he also has new teachers who aren't familiar with me and the family as involved (but not helicopter) parents.\n \n \nFor what it's worth, we don't have time to set off an alarm every time a paper isn't turned in. My god, if I had to send an email for every missing or incomplete paper, I wouldn't have time to do any instruction. They're kids, for crying out loud.\n Here's something that some schools do: give your son a calendar/planner. Have him write the assignment for each class daily, and -- if possible -- have the teacher initial it to confirm (or just when there's no assignment). That way you can check the planner and see whether there is work that needs to be done.\n\n I understand that and don't demand special treatment.\n He does have a planner that I check daily.\n The issue is...it's not being filled out.\n The last time he had anything reliable was back in Nov. the last time I saw anythign written in it at all was mid-Jan. A month ago.\n When I noticed this, I talked to the son who stated he was shirking his work.\n I immediatly contacted the teachers and went into detail what goes on on my end.\n When he goes to school, he has his work done and with him. When he returns from school the next day, it's still in his bag. Repeatedly this happens. And he get's 0's for not turning it in. Once he's out of my sight and in school, I can't remind him to remove the work and turn it in.\n After a few weeks, his grades become affected. At that point is when they are obligated to contact me with concerns. Which they haven't done. He's suffering in science and has been all year. I have heard nothing from the science teacher at all.\n \n \nSpecial needs classes? But these aren't the students you think should be damned to the Burger-Flippin' diploma plan?\n Is your son still in the special needs program? Is there an IEP? a resource teacher?\n\n Yep.\n It goes with the tutoring issue.\n He has some autism spectrum attributes and a borderline OCD on drawing in class. Most people can't understand such things...too busy trying to cookie cutter everone into one mold.\n While he's failing in science, he's actually quite good at it.\n The problem is staying on task with what th teacher is working on.\n And, when you're into black holes and stellar mechanics or how diseases work nd the teacher is teaching the boring old 'water cycle'...interest wanes considerably.\n The son is getting assistance with math...and he has an A in that class.\n It's a small matter on the minimal level of assistance needed to keep him on task...or to remind him of the simple things like putting your name on your work.\n The main issue it seems is they wanted to try to get him acclimated to a standard class where more responsiblity is placed on the students shoulders and he's not cutting it and it wasn't noticed by them.\n His past special needs teacher has left the school to go to another and his main teacher is a new guy (young and cool)...\n \n If he needs to be put back with the 'tard. Fine. He shouldn't slow down a main class room and the special needs teacher would be more adept at dealing with him. Smaller class so he's not over looked. And, in that setting, he's not as distracted and doesn't need as much attention.\n \n \n I don't send him to school to 'learn'. That's the easy stuff I can handle on my own. But, I don't send him to fail either.\n \n \n I'd say the biggest problem is with this lame focusing on testing.\n My wife did well on testing when she was in school. Forgot everything minutes after the test was done.\n I learnt the fine art of BSing on a test. Competed academically too...winning trophies in math of all things.\n All I want for him is to get to be social and learn to blend in and be 'normal'. So that if he has too, he can do it for a living.\n \n In case his BMX bike career never pans out.\n Or being a herpatoligist isn't in high demand.\n \n \n I could solve all the worlds problems if I were selected as ruler.\n Well, either that...or leave everything in a pile of ash. But, my campaign speeches won't focus on that possiblity.\n Nope, vague references to change and hope is all that should be needed.",
