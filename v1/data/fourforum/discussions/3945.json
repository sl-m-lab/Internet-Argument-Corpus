   "We have delegated Polish powers of main intermediary for reconciling differences in Ukraine. And I consider it's a political mistake of Germany, because up to now Poles can't forgive Germany the consequences of the WWII, not speaking about their entry in EU. Remember, despite the weakness of Polish economy their hopes of equal partnership were not justified. The highest unemployment rate among EU member-countries and their constant position of the youngest brother there was bothered Poles, beginning from the USSR times. And that's the point. The policy of Berlin and Paris provokes outspoken displeasure of Poland. And it certainly tries to have revenge. If we read German and French press, we will see that it has reduce its aggressive tone concerning to Kuchma and Russians lately. It's clear that it is their attempt to atone for their offence and to win them over to their side. The appearance of geographic maps where Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine are represented as a united state became a bad sign. The story of a severe defeat to the Teutonic Knights at the battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410 comes to my mind, when united armies of the Polish-Lithuanian Union crushed the strength of the Teutonic Order once and for all. And after the victory of Polish prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Yuschenko in Ukraine their new Union may become a fatal one for Germany and EU once more. The voices of new member-countries in the Council of Europe under the aegis of Warsaw have already stifled the voice of old Europe. Polish candidate Yuschenko keeps saying Ukrainian entry into EU all the time. And that certainly suits Poles down to the ground, because the number of representatives of any country in European Parliament depends on the quantity of its residents. Ukraine, with its 52 millions people and territory which is proportionate to France, of course, will weigh down the scale in favour of Polish interests. And from the very beginning of this process the passive position of Germany concerning to Ukraine was its bad mistake. I guess we ought to take a strong line, aimed at division of Polish and Ukrainian interests and directed to reserving Ukraine in geopolitical space of Russia. Thus, we'll be able to avoid various kinds of danger, connected with re-orientation of young Europe against us.",

Can you condense one or two of your ideas/arguments into points that can be debated here ?",
