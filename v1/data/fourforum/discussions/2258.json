   "What I am saying is that if Mr. slgaine wants to talk about the war hero John kerry and critisize a national guardsmember as not laying it on the line in his eyes. Where does Mr. Slgaine stand in the pecking order when he thinks any \"munky\" can \"sign on the line\" when obviously he has never even done so himself.\n \n \n Thats my point....\n\n \n That's not a point.

   "I agree with your right to criticize anything (except the government if you could have voted, but didn't) within your realm of knowledge. However, the Rev is right about not unjustly characterizing service in the National Guard or any other part of the military as being less than honorable.\n \n There are people who do their duty at home who are just as important as those carrying the rifles. Even Rosie the Riveter deserves credit for stepping into the jobs vacated by fighting men in WWII. The code-breakers certainly deserve a lot of credit. The people who make munitions are important. The people who make uniforms and MREs are important.\n \n Just because Kerry carried a gun and drove a boat doesn't mean he's more important than someone who flew fighter jets in the National Guard.\n\n \n I agree for the most part. HOWEVER, I think your record while enlisted, regardless of what branch, is also of major importance.\n \n I don't want to get into this pointless XXXXXXX contest beyond that.\n \n Waxy",
