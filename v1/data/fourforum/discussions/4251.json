   "Hello,\n \n I cannot believe the innocence I have seen here, Hmm I wonder how many have tried Just putting a Pre-written programme in a CNC and let it got. Chances are that far from getting a perfect part you will have a smash up on the machine CNC's don't think and they don't forgive, one little thing wrong and they carry on regardless what's in the tools way. This is my job and far from being easy to make a proper reciever is a complicated component. I made parts at one firm for the Browing 1919 Machine gun, at another firm we made some of the parts for the SA80 Bullpup which the British Army is equipped. Now I make parts for Electro magnets for the science and medical industries.\n \n As for rifling a barrel, well no hobby lathe that I am aware of would run the spindle slow enough or the saddle with a fast enough feed to produce the correct pitch. I have ben told that it's possible to adapt a lathe but you don't use the power to do so only hand cranks and I don't know what they do to adapt it. It would be interesting to se one, I would imagine it would look a right \"heath robinson affair\".\n \n Now as for the comment on using smoth bores in the American Civil war..... well the most commonly used Musket was the Enfielf Pattern which was a .577 rifled Musket, the American made Springfield Musket was a .58 cal rifled musket.\n \n Yes in India and the Northern area around the Kyber pass and I suppose in Southern Pakistan, they make copies of guns, some work some don't but not many are safe to use I would imagine. I think you will find that in India itself it's very hard to legally own a gun but it does not stop the illicit trade. Gun crime in the UK has skyrocketed since the banning of Handguns, this ride in armed crime seems to be linked with the rise in Immigration from Eastern Europe. We will not include the Yardie types as they were involved in armed crime before the ban so they have just continued with they life of crime The break up of the Soviet Union has increased the problem a no one seems to be in control of the massive stocks of small arms stored in these states.\n \n I get in impression that some feel that perhaps we should control the sale of Machine Tools as ........ shock Horror they might be used to make a gun. Just how would you go about regulating such a useless law? \n \n How would you find out who has such tools? heck my father has soe machines which are over 70 yeras old, a friend who has a business has some Victorian drop Forge presses!\n \n I have two blue prints of muzzle loading pistols which my father brought back in the 1960's. He never got around to making them, and I doubt I will either, Why go th the bother when I can buy a replicar to hang on the wall if I so wish cheaper than I can make one for after buying the metal and wood then spending hours making it. I have better things to do with my time. I might just have then framed and hang them on the wall. He was a modeller, making steam enginesat home and he made pumps for atomic power stations during the day, Oh they also made some parts of the Type 21 Torpedo for the Royal Navy. \n Best Regards.

They're saying that it is not ridiculously easy and simple to manufacture your own gun as some people on this board would lead you to believe.\n\n \n Sorry. He is wrong. I own a company that specialises in prototyping. I make weapons on the side as an interesting hobby (we make them in the shop, too, on contract). \n \n First, he obviosly did not follow the link rook provided. Rook apparently is not up on CNC terminology, as what is provided at CNCgunsmithing.com is not pre-written CNC code, but IGES files, which you load into your software and use to create your CNC code. Any idiot can do it. \n \n Second, he is incorrect about the barreling thing. First, very few people make their own barrels. They are too cheap to order. Second, you can build a ECM machine using a handful of bar stock, 2 old printers, a high current car battery charger, and the windshiled washer pump out of a toyota (I suppose that any windshield washer pump will do, I just happened to have a toyota pump when I built mine to prove it could be done). The barrels the machine turns out after proper adjustment are MUCH, MUCH better than what you buy off the shelf.\n \n Third, he is misleading regarding the complexity of most recievers. Handgun frames are simple. Ak recievers are incredibly simple. he is correct earliewr in the thread when he says that an AK reciever is just bent sheetmetal with parts welded or riverted in.\n \n I am sorry, he is simply wrong. In fact, I think I will go over there and explain in deatail exactly how wrong he is.",

   "of course! guns are easy to manufacture, for a number of reasons: one, there are incredible ammounts of information on how to make them if you simply look around. two, they don't need to be as *PERFECT* as you'd think: it simply helps. for example, you don't *NEED* to rifle the inside of a gun barrel- but the gun will be worthless for any target over 25 yards, and its arguable that it will be worthwhile to shoot at anything that far. three, guns serve a practical purpose in many places: where i live, for example, hunting is standard (for food as much as for trophies), and gun-building is seen as something to do before the season opens (with or without licenses, everything from bolt-action fifty-caliber rifles to full-auto SKS, Vepr and G3 copies). nobody really reports it, either, unless the guy doing it is found to be some whacko anti-choice nut who wants to blow up planned parenthood or something similar.\n \n and fourth, where do you think the *NEW* guns come from? the school science fair? nasa? the moon? in many cases, its simply people who have a basic understanding of how guns work saying to themselves 'you know? this doesn't need to be this way... i bet if i changed this this this and this, it would work better, shoot more accurately, and not jam up as much.' i can say from personal experience that that's how it works, because i've designed several guns based on ones that i own or have fired and field stripped and understand how they work. thats the story behind the british sten- it was a bit of plumbing pipe, some sheet steel, and a spring- all ammounting to about fifteen dollars to create (during world war 2 they had old grannies making them in their living rooms over tea instead of knitting or some such activity). it wasn't very accurate, it wasn't incredibly reliable- but it was cheap, and it would shoot. so the british used it extensively.\n \n \nYes in India and the Northern area around the Kyber pass and I suppose in Southern Pakistan, they make copies of guns, some work some don't but not many are safe to use I would imagine. I think you will find that in India itself it's very hard to legally own a gun but it does not stop the illicit trade.

We will not include the Yardie types as they were involved in armed crime before the ban so they have just continued with they life of crime The break up of the Soviet Union has increased the problem a no one seems to be in control of the massive stocks of small arms stored in these states.\n\n \n yes, this is true. there is actually an entire city devoted to making guns- everything from .22lr pistols to .50cal machine guns, as well as ammunition, belts, magazines, and accessories. does this sound strange? well, look in the bible. you see the city of damascus? the entire city was devoted to making swords: if you're a knive buff, this should strike a chord (its the basis for the name of 'damascene' steel)- so this shouldn't be hard to believe. and while i don't think that this should happen- as a future armed professional, i'm wary about the idea of tangos toting that kind of firepower- i don't necessarily think its a bad thing. experience is a cruel but very effective teacher. i was fortunate enough to learn at a young age how to deal with guns ('leave them the **** alone, or else', and then 'its always loaded until you see the breach open and theres no round in the chamber', and so on). the kids there learn to respect fire arms, even if they don't exactly learn how to do anything but make them (aiming is a lost art, most shooters in the middle east are religious- the 'spray and pray' variety).",

   "I think this is a point where an anti-gunners says \"oops\".\n\n \n To be fair to VOR, I can see why they would be excited about the post. It is from somebody who claims to be a machinest and has been employed in the industry. It does seem to be a valid source (as opposed to most sources used by anti-gunners, VOR included, who use sources that have been unquestionably discredited....dishonesty if ever it existed).\n \n I think the guy who made the post has a rather high opinion of himself and his skills (something not uncommon). At the end of the day, what makes guns so incredibly easy to manufacture is the fact that tolerances are rather loose on most of them. Industry standard for most firearms is roughly +/- .1 that is a pretty loose tolerance, and easily achieved in the home shop.\n \n Sheet metal firearm recievers are generally little more than sheat metal boxes, easily bent in a brake, or using 2 stout pieces fo stock and a vice. The only real exception to this is the Uzi, which has a complex front end that is difficult to reproduce. Of course, there have been plenty of uzi knockoffs/clones that have done away with the facy bit at the front end alltogether. I have one in my collection that uses all uzi internals and the lower reciever, but has an entirely square body like a MAC.....it was produced for a short time in Russia as a weapon for special forces, full auot, but closed bolt with an integral silencer.",

You don't film the act of killing a soldier and have him randomly toss a very, very expensive piece in the dust or river. \n\n \n I know that the price I was quoted was reasonable for the unit, it was just more than I wanted to spend. I bought a 15th century venetian sidesword with matching pistols instead. The entire set cost about half what he wanted for that mp/40, and is a much more interesting conversation piece. That said, the MP/40 would have been the better investment, since the sword/pistol set has only doubled in value, and the MP/40 has quadrupled in value since then.\n \n \nI've also fired an MP40 and they do the intended job very well regardless of appearance.

Ironic when the MP5 series is now the 'king' of sub guns, technically eons from being plain jane and worth far less than an MP40.\n\n \n I do believe my favorite SMG is the Uzi. The MP5 is interesting, but more complicated than it needs to be and not nearly as controllable as the uzi due to its relatively light weight. I am a little old fashioned in some regards.....i still count moving parts when trying to estimate the reliability of a gun, and the Uzi has the MP5 badly beaten in that arena. As an added bonus, when you run out of ammo, you can club the opponent with your uzi, since it has a lot of heft to it.\n \n I own a Mac and a Greasegun. Neither comes close. I did get the chance to fire a swedish K several years ago at a shoot in neveda. I can understand why combat vets liked them, they are so simple that breaking one would be difficult. IMHO, they have the same problem as the MP5, and the MAC, for that matter, they are just too light to keep consistently on target when firing full auto. They seem to be a weapon that is designed to consistently put large numbers of bullets in the air at the same time in a mostly accurate manner. They are pretty light, which would make it handy to carry through the jungle, and they were very cheap, which I am sure appealed to the government (the swedish K cost only about $5 each to produce).\n \n I have also shot the S&W m/76, which is an adaptation of the K, and it is also an excellent wepon, though I have heard it is less reliable than the K. I am currently working on a semi auto build of a Finnish Soumi, upon which both the K and the MP-40 were based.",
