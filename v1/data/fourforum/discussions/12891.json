   "What Should Blaming Shootings on Conservative Talkers be Called?\n \n I vote for B.S.\n \n There is a seed change coming, and I think it is coming soon! Never before have I ever seen such disgust with our government. All Federal Government, not just one political party either. \n \n Yesterday I was watching the Glen Beck show and he read a letter as asked, if this represents you go and sign the accompanying petition. Well the server carrying the petition was immediately shut down, and was continually shut down every time I tried to get into it to sign it. Even this morning. I finally got in and I got this message.   An open letter to our nations leadership\nThis petition, An Open Letter to our Nation's Leadership, is so popular that it is overwhelming our servers, and we have had to temporarily close it. We hope to re-open it soon. Please check back.\n\n \n Now I know the left will likely dismiss this as crackpots, and who cares, but that would be very foolish. This is your wake up call! Here is a short start of this letter, and if you like it, you can click on the link, find the letter and read the rest. It is located at the bottom of the list of the category Headlines.\n \n   The Letter \nI'm a home grown American citizen, 53, registered Democrat all my life. Before the last presidential election I registered as a Republican because I no longer felt the Democratic Party represents my views or works to pursue issues important to me. Now I no longer feel the Republican Party represents my views or works to pursue issues important to me. The fact is I no longer feel any political party or representative in Washington represents my views or works to pursue the issues important to me. There must be someone. Please tell me who you are. Please stand up and tell me that you are there and that you're willing to fight for our Constitution as it was written. Please stand up now. You might ask yourself what my views and issues are that I would horribly feel so disenfranchised by both major political parties. What kind of nut job am I? Will you please tell me?\n \n Well, these are briefly my views and issues for which I seek representation:\n \n One, illegal immigration. I want you to stop coddling illegal immigrants and secure our borders. Close the underground tunnels. Stop the violence and the trafficking in drugs and people. No amnesty, not again. Been there, done that, no resolution. P.S., I'm not a racist. This isn't to be confused with legal immigration.\n \n \n Two, the TARP bill, I want it repealed and I want no further funding supplied to it. We told you no, but you did it anyway. I want the remaining unfunded 95% repealed. Freeze, repeal.\n \n Three: Czars, I want the circumvention of our checks and balances stopped immediately. Fire the czars. No more czars. Government officials answer to the process, not to the president. Stop trampling on our Constitution and honor it.\n \n Four, cap and trade. The debate on global warming is not over. There is more to say.\n \n Five, universal healthcare. I will not be rushed into another expensive decision. Don't you dare try to pass this in the middle of the night and then go on break. Slow down!\n \n Six, growing government control. I want states rights and sovereignty fully restored. I want less government in my life, not more. Shrink it down. Mind your own business. You have enough to take care of with your real obligations. Why don't you start there.\n \n Seven, ACORN. I do not want ACORN and its affiliates in charge of our 2010 census. I want them investigated. I also do not want mandatory escrow fees contributed to them every time on every real estate deal that closes. Stop the funding to ACORN and its affiliates pending impartial audits and investigations. I do not trust them with taking the census over with our taxpayer money. I don't trust them with our taxpayer money. Face up to the allegations against them and get it resolved before taxpayers get any more involved with them. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, hello. Stop protecting your political buddies. You work for us, the people. Investigate. \n\n Go read the rest and if it represents your views, click on the An open letter to our nations leadership link, when it becomes available, and sign the petition. I know it is not much, but it is a start! Maybe we will get their attention, and maybe they will change so we don't have to vote them out! emoticon_smile",

   "Sea change, not seed.\n\n Thanks for pointing that out in a civil way! I appreciate that. \n \n \n The toxic spewings of the collective have a corrosive effect on society generally, validating and empowering in their own minds the estranged and paranoid.\n\n Oh! Now that is what I am more accustomed to from you. emoticon_smile\n \n What you fail to understand is that this is what the First Amendment was designed for! Public discourse. But let me ask you a question. Do you feel the same way when people on the left do the same thing on issues you agree with? Or is that the proper use of the First Amendment, while when we do it, that is just considered anarchy. \n \n What I posted was a 2nd wake up call! And I will tell you that most people feel that way. That letter takes a shot at ALL parties. America does not belong to the Political Parties, it belongs to us! \n \n Most of us are not revolutionaries. No, in fact, we are very law-abiding and Loyal Americans to the core! But one thing the politicians need to recognize, is that we WILL vote you out of office. \n \n The first wake up call was the Tea Party protests. But hey this is a free country. You are free to ignore the warnings, but if you do, then you can look for another job! \n \n The Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land. All that the American People ask is that everyone obey The Law! What in the World is so hard to understand about that?",

That was called the Shot that was heard around the World. It is therefore natural that our Founders would want to make sure that this never happened again.\n \n Much of what our Founders said about this can be read here.   What the Framers said about our Second Amendment -- Rights to Keep and Bear Arms \n \n \nYou folks are fond of pointing out that criminals would be the only people with guns if they were made illegal but I think you should add gun enthusiasts too.\n\n Here is what 2 Supreme Court rulings said about that question.   U.S. Supreme Court U S v. CRUIKSHANK, 92 U.S. 542 (1875) \n The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. \n\n \n   U.S. Supreme Court \n PRESSER v. STATE OF ILLINOIS, 116 U.S. 252 (1886) \n It was so held by this court in the case of U. S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 , 553, in which the chief justice, in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 'is not a right granted by the constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. \n\n Leading the Constitution Society to conclude this. Link   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n \n So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?\n \n But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!",

Go after the criminal misuse, stop trying to harass us and pretending that both are the same.\n \n No matter how you try and argue it, child pornography isn't protected by the First Amendment as an example of free expression. Just as killing and harming others isn't protected by the Second Amendment. You can get rid of the bad elements without doing anything to infringe on the rights of the law-abiding.\n \n \nWould you give up your guns if the government made it illegal?\n\n \n No I wouldn't. Some would comply, but I believe the vast majority of the people would refuse. We know full well that any sort of confiscation scheme isn't possible, especially in the economic climate of today.\n \n There's also nothing the government can do about the guns they have no records on. The Winchester Model 6 rifle used in the museum guard shooting is too old to be traced, and millions of guns just like that exist, and the government can't find them.\n \n \nYou folks are fond of pointing out that criminals would be the only people with guns if they were made illegal but I think you should add gun enthusiasts too.\n\n \n Outlawing firearms ownership in such a blanket manner would make criminals out of those who passed the measure into law.

Since when is self defense a hobby? The Pennsyvania Constitution makes it a lot clearer than the US one. Right to Bear Arms \n Section 21. \n The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned. Now perhaps you in all of your leftist wisdom can point out exactly where it says \"hobby.\" Your major problem is you don't have the power to define the situation. There fore what ever fantasy you deem to label reality is simply not valid.\n \n Cars kill a lot more people than firearms do and I don't see them being made illegal any time soon. By the way your strawman is burning. \n \n Your question is a nonsense one and thus has no validity. For that to happen it would take a constitutional amendment which is hard to do. In the event that one was passed I believe quite a few states would simply disolve the union.\n \n Either you have english as a second language or you simply have no grasp of the meaning of words. One does not have to own guns to be a gun enthusiasts. Perhaps you meant that gun owning enthusiasts would become criminals too.\n \n Since you managed to wander off topic I'll add to the wandering. I was listening to the Hons man on the radio. His topic was the treatment of John Hinckley Jr. Its seems the liberal weenies at the alleged psych hospital or where ever he is supposed to be confined are a bit lax. Part of his treatment appears to be freedom to roam about and mingle with society. The Dukakus release type thing. In these expedititons in freedom John boy has had sex with a bi polar wopman and one in some sort of relationship plus dates 2 others. His nutjob ravings have been rereleased on cd. They want a drivers license for him and more free time at his mother's home unsupervised. Not bad for shooting a US president and Jim Brady. My question is where are the Brady bunch on this? Instead of going after the innocent and law abiding how about keeping a menace off the streets? /B]",

However, it seems to me that when we treat them with the exact same treatment as they treat us, they cry foul! Is it a False claim of trying to claim aggrieved status? I think so, but I don't want to take the chance that Accipiter actually feels that way.\n \n So now Accipiter has an opening![/\n Perhaps you are right,maybe we should all give him and his boyz a big group hug\n and say were sorry for thinking as we do.Personally I feel like such an XXX.\n Another opening?(lol).",

   "Nato asserts that American shootings are the result of deranged individuals. I merely point out that given the frequency of such events, America must have more deranged individuals wandering its streets than most countries.\n\n \n Oh, the United States has its problems, and if you feel you must consider them, then lets do so.\n \n Our history is pretty unique considering other countries history and make up. Good and bad. In my opinion, our biggest mistake was to allow the institution of slavery. That set us up as nation of people with grudges, and even long after its demise, it seemed to have set up, an us against them mentality between both Blacks and Whites. Add in to this mix, all of the religious hatred contained in the world today. The funny thing is that the very thing that makes us great, being a melting pot of every culture, creates a lot of our problems. All of this seems to set up institutions of Hate and racism, that is boiling over as frustrations and pressures that living creates. \n \n In many other countries, what is happening here would be called terrorism, but probably for political motivation we call them shootings, so we can demonize guns and gun owners. So lets also take a look at terrorist acts against Americans. Here are just the first two.   Terrorist Attacks\n (within the United States or against Americans abroad) \n1920 \n Sept. 16, New York City: TNT bomb planted in unattended horse-drawn wagon exploded on Wall Street opposite House of \n Morgan, killing 35 people and injuring hundreds more. Bolshevist or anarchist terrorists believed responsible, but crime never solved. \n 1975 \n Jan. 24, New York City: bomb set off in historic Fraunces Tavern killed 4 and injured more than 50 people. Puerto Rican nationalist group (FALN) claimed responsibility, and police tied 13 other bombings to the group.\n \n \n Or lets consider this.   U.S.-Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations \n The U.S. State Department has designated these groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). The table includes a description of each terrorist group, its goals and targets, estimated strength in numbers, year established, and its suspected activities.\n \n The chart is a total depiction of just how ugly we humans can be.\n \n But I suspect that is not what you actually want to spotlight. Is it? \n \n Our Justice department has taken a good look at this problem of just school shootings. Here is a quick look. More info can be found by going to the linked report. \n   Preventing School Shootings -- A Summary of a U.S. Secret Service Safe School Initiative Report \n There is no one reason why school shootings occur, and no one type of student who becomes a shooter. This article dispels the myths and stereotypes about school shooters. \n \n Children who attack can be any age and from any ethnic group, race, or family situation. Contrary to assumptions that some of our youth &#8220;just snap&#8221;&#8212;they don&#8217;t. They plan.\n \n The National Institute of Justice has joined forces with the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Education to assess ways to prevent school shootings. The Secret Service has a long tradition of protecting our Nation&#8217;s leaders by identifying, assessing, and managing persons who might pose a threat of targeted violence Targeted violence is a term developed by the Secret Service to refer to any incident of violence where a known (or knowable) attacker selects a particular target prior to the act of violence. Because of the Secret Service&#8217;s expertise in the study and prevention of targeted violence, the Secretary of Education asked the agency to conduct a similar operational study of school shootings. \n \n The findings clearly emphasize the importance of paying attention and listening to America&#8217;s young people. More than a handful of adults, parents, teachers, school administrators and counselors, coaches, and law enforcement&#8212;can make an important contribution to and play a key role in preventing violence on school grounds. Young people who need help often do not keep it a secret. They may exhibit obvious warning signs either through behavior or remarks, such as voicing problems or grievances, complaining about persecution or bullying, or showing signs of depression or desperation.\n\n So although it does not actually suit your purpose to do so, taking about Gun Control fixes none of the underlying problems, that even if all guns were banned, we would eventually have to consider and fix, in order to be called Civilized!\n \n As a friend of mine was fond of saying. If you want to fix the actual problem, just think of what you would do if this were happening and yet all guns were banned in America, then do that! For that is the actual and correct answer anyway!\n \n But alas, I sincerely doubt that you care about the actual causes of violence, you just want to use the effects of our problems in order to get guns banned! emoticon_smile",
