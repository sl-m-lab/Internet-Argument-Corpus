   "Should parents be notified if their child seeks an abortion?\n \n I say no, because I believe that if someone is 14 or above they are capable of making that decision on their own, and they can always get their parents\n involved if they want. Also, if a teen really doesn't want her parents to know she's pregnant, she will get an abortion legal or not. This will lead to a lot of dead teenage girls, which we don't want.\n \n Also, parents have the power to force their daughter to not have an abortion, when maybe she wants one. Maybe she is planning for a future, and wants to go to college and get a good job and life, and per parents tell her that she has to keep the baby. She can always seek help at a planned parenthood clinic (counseling), and they do not have the power to force her not to have an abortion.\n \n What if her parents are abusive, and she knows will beat her if they find out she is pregnant? In my opinion, the decision on who should be involved and who should not be involved best be left up to the one pregnant.",

   "I have mixed feelings about this. Most teens are fairly immature. Though facing a pregnancy can shock many into a more mature point of view, most teens could still have major problems reasoning out a decision on abortion. For those parents that are supportive of their children and open-minded enough to reason out the pros and cons of their decision with their daughter, then parental notification could be a good thing. Unfortunately, too many parents would simply use notification to automatically stop their daughter from getting an abortion (or, in many cases, force her to have one) despite the daughter's desires and concerns - thus causing lifelong problems for her. Unfortunately, there is no litmus test of good parenting - no way to set up a law that is conditional on the parent being good.",

If a minor seeking an abortion doesn't want her parents notified for fear of abuse then the proper authorities should be notified.

My original post is talking about 14 year olds, but I am now talking about 16 and 17 year olds.\n \n \nYour assumption that the parents are less mature than the child is equally as ludicrous as your claim that a 14 year old is mature enough to make this decision before she is old enough to sign ANY LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT, and that includes 15, 16 and 17 year olds. They are still below the age of consent so the issue should be moot.\n\n \n I don't see how the issue is moot at all. In fact, consent laws are ineffective, and I stand by my claim that some parents act very immature when dealing with this situation. You make sweeping and unsupported generalizations based on physical qualities.\n \n \nBut unfortunately, in this day and age when parents are becoming more like caretakers rather than moral guides, it is only a matter of time before they lose all authority over their child's decisions to the State.\n\n \n Edmund, you still haven't come out of that wardrobe.",

I am more talking about the parents forcing a girl to have or not have an abortion against her wishes, or a girl, fearful of her parents, will seek an illegal abortion.\n \n \nNo, my argument is that generally teenage girls lack the capacity. And we make laws based on the general, carving out exceptions where necessary. It makes no since to legislate toward the exception rather than the general rule.\n\n \n Fine, but in the case of Prop. 4, it wasn't enough. Prop. 4 was a dishonest ploy by the pro-lifers to limit the number of abortions. To seek an exception was complicated, difficult, and time consuming. Many of these exceptions would take so long that by the time an exception was granted, it was too late to abort. I'd be willing to talk about making exceptions, however they should be simpler and not require the minor to give up her parents in order to get one.

You have a Constitutional right in this country, to walk through the doors of a hospital and request treatment -- whether you're under eighteen or over eighteen. Especially if you're a victim of incest or rape.\n\n \n Children don't, not without parental consent. The reason is because one time a hospital did emergency surgery on a child and when he died, his liberal, lawsuit mad parents sued them for millions of dollars. So now, no one will touch a minor without parental consent. And incest or rape have never been an issue of this debate. Why do you assume that parents wouldn't approve of abortion under those circumstances? That assumption hasn't been proven anywhere. \n \n \nThe parental notification argument, on behalf of the far religious right, has nothing to do with minors getting adult guidance, because there's only one objective here, for them. Stopping people from having abortions altogether.\n\n \n Parental notification is NOT a far religious right issue at all. That is a red herring attack against what you don't understand. This is a bi partisan law which is intended to protect hospitals from law suits and also to protect parents rights over their children's healthcare needs and decisions. \n \n And regarding the bolded, does your prejudice know no bounds at all? Does the parental consent law state that parents have a say in the issue of aborting a minors baby ONLY IF THEY CHOOSE AGAINST ABORTING IT? Of course not.

It's no justification for the changing the laws or taking away the right to decide for others.\n\n \n Nobody on my side is attempting to change the law. It sounds like you want to change the law in favor of allowing minor children to make adult medical decisions, and nullify the authority of parents to advise and protect the children they bore and are otherwise legally, by law, responsible for protecting. And regarding your concern about poor personal choices, my daughters never got pregnant out of wedlock because we raised them to respect their bodies. They had and have self images that prevent them from seeking approval and acceptance from men by using sex to hold on to them. That's called personal dignity and self respect.

   "Needless to say.. we're hearing the needless to hear.\n \n \nWhen I was young, I used to be a rightwinger.\n\n \n We don't know you to test the veracity of the statement... given you're wiley disposition in some of these posts, there may not be evidence for evolution, but you sure reinforce the law of entropy with some of the comments you make.\n \n \n \nI used to think there was only one way of looking at issues.\n\n \n No, you lowered your standard. \n \n \n \nThen I learned and grew up. I learned that my way was not the only way, regardless of how I learned my way.\n\n \n No.. you got older - we dont' know owhat else happened, but wiser has clearly escaped you. \n \n \n \nI learned there are many roads to virtue, and anyone who said otherwise was simply selling snake oil.\n\n \n Relativistic... doesn't make it valid... liberals always miss the point, 1+1 can and will only equal 2, you can subtract... or you can add. Adding to something is far more preferable to taking away.\n \n \n \nI learned that the worst road to virtue was to blindly follow the rules of some Big Man, either on earth or anywhere else.\n\n \n You swallowed the blue pill... telling you that you are the measure of what is right - subtraction. \n \n \n \nI learned that to think for myself was both virtuous and mature.\n \n \n \n You are free to call something what you wish... it doesn't mean it is what it is to whomever is judging what you resent as \"virtuous\" - liberals and mature never need be int he same sentence. Their whole social argument is the preservations of childishness, or in short, what makes me feel good. \n \n \n \nI learned that MY truth is not necessarily THE truth.\n\n \n \n I learned that people who call themselves virtuous and mature using the most subjective means to do so are foolishly deceived.\n \n \n \nI learned that the proper response to anyone who said, \"Do this!\" was, \"Why should I?\".\n\n \n \n The proper response would have been... Why? period...\n \n \n \n \nI learned that to be convinced was far better than to be commanded.\n\n \n So you swallowed the blue pill of those doing the exacly what you say they aren't doing.... Oh, joy.\n \n \n \n \nI learned to use proper contraception if I did not want to deal with the consequences of a partner's pregnancy.\n\n \n \n What do you want... a cookie?\n \n \n \n \nI learned that there is no \"One size fits all\" when it comes to behavior, values, or morals.\n\n \n \n 1+1 will never equal nine because you can't count... \n \n \n \n \nI learned that what was wrong yesterday just might be right today, and vice versa.\n\n \n \n Sure, abbreviated for convenience of course... you relativists love back doors, no wonder their acceptance of homosexuality was almost compulsory as it is ironic?\n \n \n \n \n \nYep, Archie, I have learned a great deal in 66 years of living.\n\n \n You've done nothing but illustrate the downward spiral... gee, thanks.",
