   "ok, been seeing alot of stuff about this that makes me wonder\n \n the news seems to love displaying how \"backwards\" the arabian culture seems to be in regards to womens rights, men are dominant. but they hype it up and never make any possible rationalization\n \n first off, comparing men to women is like comparing a shoe to a glove, both were ment for different purposes, and neither can properly accomplish exactly what the other was made for\n \n why are men dominant in arabian culture, well, could be because much of their culture is still set in a dangerous area, natural dangers from the country, domestic dangers of other men, who could best defend against this, duh, a man, speaking sociological generalities, men are stronger than women,have larger bone structures, have less sentimental baggage, and are better able to withstand hostile environments, what do we pay for this, we'll get to that later, so women have, for thousands of years, held close to men for protection from danger\n \n what about women, women have very sharp minds, are excellent at manipulating other people, good dexterity, and of course precreation and sex,\n even today when a man looks for a woman he thinks sex partner (ok, so it _may_ not be the very first thing on his mind, but it is always there, unless you marry a falsetto) and women seem to look for a long term commitment, a man to care for her (again, modern thinking has not made this a priority, but its there)\n \n so its a perfect complement, the man defends the woman whom he loves, she in turn worries about his health, and gives him children to help with the chores\n \n lately, sociologically speaking 50 to 100 years is a short time, women have grown tired of being the overprotected flower, and happily we have created a society which is reasonably safe, a woman alone has the odds in her favor, survival is no longer the primary goal, but who do we thank for this. well obviously men did everything they could to create this reasonably safe society so that their women would not need to be afraid, so yay, women can be as independent as they wish, that was our intent (understandably women had a great influence on the creation of the current society, but if a lead role in the down and dirty work of putting it together is to be picked then it would be the male)\n \n but now we have run into a different problem, once freed from their dependence on men women have turned on us, we are insensetive, prideful, stubborn fools, things you used to love about us, pride which kept us from running for cover when a large animal attacked, no, the man would gain women and children time to run before ducking away themselves. insensetivity, which made us all but immune from feeling sorry for the marauder we were killing to protect our women (after all, his father might have beaten him, and his mother was a whore) stubborness, which made us, ok, i dont have an example for this but you get the point, these things which used to serve women so well have now become what is \"wrong\" with men\n \n watch any sitcom, the only group one can make fun of while still being PC is men, and as soon as we speak out we are called shovensists (sp?) pigs of the vilest sort\n \n now to what we lose for this physical superiority, longevity, for a very long time women have lived much longer lives than men, why, we ignore pain, we weigh more (well, i do) which places more strain on our joints and organs, when between the ages of 18 and 40 we are in pretty good shape, things go bad later on, and depending on the life lived prior a man can just plain break\n (old farmers seem to be immune to this effect, i knew an eighty year old man that looked 60 and worked like he was 40)\n \n women have smaller mass, a girl i know mentioned how she was working out, and that her biceps and arms were getting bigger, the thickest part of her arms are smaller than the narrowest part of my wrist, so its obvious that she could not defend herself as well as i could defend her\n \n now how does all this boil down to the middle east, these folks still live in a hostile environment, so when we say that they are treat women unfairly you must take this into account, there is also the fact that those in power do not like to relinquish it, so we need to avoid forcing our values on them, until they are ready for it\n \n also we need to study the culture, this has been going on for centuries, very hard to break, and will make alot of violence when it does, i told the same girl above that women over their were to veil their faces, and keep every part of themselves covered, she said she would be walking around in her underwear, she would be severly beaten at best, such things are not tolerated, imagine a pedophile going to a public beach and try to rape alittle boy every guy on the beach would chase him down and beat him, this is similar to what they see in our bikinied babes and sexual freedom, which they consider to be morally wrong\n \n Mathurin",

   "Mathurin - do you live off of stereotypes???? LOL. Your ideas about women are down right hysterical.\n \n Do you really think it's protection and safety we are after? Of course every individual (well some thrill seekers aside) wishes to be safe. But women still face plenty of violence. However, most of the violence we face isn't \"out there\" - it's at home in form of domestic abuse and spousal or acquaintance rape. (Any idea how rare stranger rape is?)\n \n What women want is acknowledgement that we have brains and are capable of making our own choices. We actually can make living and provide for ourselves. Lots of women throughout histroy have known this. We have run businesses (many female owned business in the old west), led armies and fought in battles (Joan of Arc), we are artists (Frida Kahlo), writers (Jane Austen), scientists (Madam Curie), heros (Harriett Tubman), we have even ruled empires! (Hatsepshut, Empress Wu, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, Cleopatra) We have contributed just as much to our history and society as men. \n \n Women in this country didn't start getting out on their own because men decided to be obliging. We busted butt! Women demanded the right to vote - and fought for it. Women realized they could be equal in the workplace with WWII and Rosie the Riveter.\n \n Whenever our rights have been violated it's not men who come forward to change it. It's us!!!\n \n Of course there are differences between men and women. Men are physically stronger. However you are wrong about pain - women generally have stronger threshold for pain. We have to because we bear the children.\n \n Personally I like the strength in men. It's part of what makes them hot. I don't hate men for being men. However, it is possible to be a man, without being a chauvinist. We are not incapable children and we can desire more than motherhood. Treat us with respect and you will be fine.\n \n Thanks for the giggle tho.....\n \n God, I love being single....\n \n Attached is a fabulous speach by black woman and former slave - this was when women were fighting for the right to vote:\n __________________________________________\n \n Several ministers attended the second day of the Woman's Rights Convention, and were not shy in voicing their opinion of man's superiority over women. One claimed \"superior intellect\", one spoke of the \"manhood of Christ,\" and still another referred to the \"sin of our first mother.\"\n Suddenly, Sojourner Truth rose from her seat in the corner of the church. \n \n \"For God's sake, Mrs.Gage, don't let her speak!\" half a dozen women whispered loudly, fearing that their cause would be mixed up with Abolition.\n \n Sojourner walked to the podium and slowly took off her sunbonnet. Her six-foot frame towered over the audience. She began to speak in her deep, resonant voice: \"Well, children, where there is so much racket, there must be something out of kilter, I think between the Negroes of the South and the women of the North - all talking about rights - the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all this talking about?\" \n \n Sojourner pointed to one of the ministers. \"That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody helps me any best place. And ain't I a woman?\" \n \n Sojourner raised herself to her full height. \"Look at me! Look at my arm.\" She bared her right arm and flexed her powerful muscles. \"I have plowed, I have planted and I have gathered into barns. And no man could head me. And ain't I a woman?\" \n \n \"I could work as much, and eat as much as man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne children and seen most of them sold into slavery, and when I cried out with a mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a woman?\" \n \n The women in the audience began to cheer wildly. \n \n She pointed to another minister. \"He talks about this thing in the head. What's that they call it?\" \n \n \"Intellect,\" whispered a woman nearby. \n \n \"That's it, honey. What's intellect got to do with women's rights or black folks' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?\" \n \n \"That little man in black there! He says women can't have as much rights as men. 'Cause Christ wasn't a woman. She stood with outstretched arms and eyes of fire. \"Where did your Christ come from?\"\n \n \"Where did your Christ come from?\", she thundered again. \"From God and a Woman! Man had nothing to do with him!\"\n \n The entire church now roared with deafening applause. \n \n \"If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back and get it right-side up again. And now that they are asking to do it the men better let them.\"",

   "Thing is, I don't think they are treated with respect at all in many places in the Middle East.\n\n \n That is where you are entirely wrong. Men have been known to kill strangers on the street for treating a woman disrespectfully. This has been one of the sore points regarding US troops in Iraq. They search women at road blocks. To many of the muslims in Iraq, this is an incredibly disrespectful act (touching a woman without her permission). Insulting another mans wife (or sister, or mother) is liable to get you killed. To actually lay your hands on them is almost SURE to get you killed. A large portion of the traditional rules for women in the middle east are very sensible if you live in a society with no real law enforcement and where your recent history (last thousand years or so) has been a long stream of wars, invasions, followed by long periods of relative lawlessness.\n \n We hear all these horrible stories about how badly these women are treated. You hear that they are never allowed to uncover their faces or to speak in public. They do not speak on the street or wander around with their faces uncovered in public usually, but if you go somewhere like a market or a shop which is off the street, you will find them standing around and gossiping. They are friendy eough off the street in locations that they know are safe. IF you go to somebodies house for a meal, the wifegenerally serves but she is usually introduced and ussually eats with you. If I ave people over for dinner, my wife usually serves, but I intoduce her and she eats with us and engages in the normal idle chitchat that goes with a meal.",

   "ok, i never said _you_ wanted protection, i said that this arrangement came because men were more suited to deal with wilderness, such as a long time ago, this evolved to the point where some women barely moved (mostly aristocracy, they had the money to be waited on hand a foot) thankfully we are beyond that\n \n as to the leading women you mentioned i said i was speaking in sociological generalities, out of all leaders and cultures men have lead the most, and as for joan of arc she was mostly a figurehead so i hear, rallying the nearly beaten french troops, giving them something to fight for, and i also never stated that women were bad leaders, quite the contrary, women in general are excellent at manipulation, especially of men...we are too easy so i hear, obviously a quick mind and good people skills is all thats required to lead\n \n \n also, you said that women can make their own money, run their own future, i agree, however who had the greatest share in creating a society where women could walk the streets in relative safety, the pattern is evident men want to make a world where they do not have to worry about the welfare of their wife/sister/mother/daughter every second, freeing them to work more. women found out that they could have independence too, and they protested, rightly so, men didnt want to give up the power (who does) so they tried to stop the movement, it didnt work so we are where we are now\n \n also, i have heard many times that women have a higher tolerance to pain because of childbirth, through personal experience i doubt that, i have seen women cry at wounds that make men shrug, seen women cringe at good natured hits that men would brush off. when my foot gets stepped on it barely hurts, twice i have cut my thumb deep into the muscle, the first on my pocketknife, it barely hurt, i was more incredulous than in pain, my mom had me get stitches, the second occured while head down in the grain bin of a combine cleaning it out (old augers in them things are very sharp) i put a band aid on it, wrapped it in electrical tape to hold it on and worked the rest of the day\n perhaps all this is because many men tend to ignore the existence of pain, to stubborn and prideful i suppose\n \n so anyway, to recap, the majority of my comments were aimed at the root of human existence, when a womans best chance at survival was a man, and were made in generalities, obviously not all women fit a cookie cutter and i never said they did\n \n anyhoo jitobear, you do have interesting points, \n thanks daewoo for some firsthand observation, im reading richard burton now, and while traditions die slowly in the middle east i often wondered how accurate his info is 100 yrs later, everything i have spot checked is right on the money though\n \n Mathurin",

   "Technology and civilsiation has made the need for protection against nature pretty irrelevant, infact as far as that goes I would say that the US and Canada is far more dangerous than the middle east in that respect with wolves and bears still running about wheras if the main environmental problem in the middle east on the whole is a survival thing (water, sunstroke etc) which makes it fairly irrelevant how big and strong your man is.\n \n The only protection from a man they would need is from other men, and thats where the culture problem is, they are seen as a threat wheras here the more equal view doesn't see women as needing such excessive protection and probably less as much as potential victims.\n \n Also isn't the whole insult thing more to do with the insult being directed at their husband or father than their own honour, I doubt very much the woman would be expected to stand up for herself rather than be defended and it probably would be frowned upon this way to.
