Democracy seems to be having a real problem attracting enough supporters to dominate the puppet government in Kabul, as the Russians found out during their folly, any solution opinions?\n\n \n I did hear an interesting idea for this the other day. Allow afghanistan to be certified as a poppy producing nation, which would allow drug companies to purchase their pooie crop for use in producing morphine and other painkillers. There is a pretty serious shortage of painkillers in the world (no, I am not kidding...the US and Europe use them all up leaving none for the rest of the planet). By certifying Afghanistan as a poppy producer, drug companies could leaglly purchase that crop, and they pay roughly twice what the drug lords there do. \n \n The US opposes this plan, though nobody has said exactly why, it is pretty apparent that it is becuase the only kind of power or control that the current puppet government has there is based on the fact that they hand out the foreign aid, and if the afghan people have an alternative, they loose that leverage.",

   "Several studies have been completed on that subject. There's an annual world shortage of morphine and codeine of about 10,000 tons and Afghanistan's production would cut that in half. I don't see US politicians changing our stance on illegal drugs when it creates an enormous LE bureaucracy with political clout and pacifies Christian leadership with their voting block. \n \n US denial of internal social problems that create markets for illegal heroin and other drugs will be in place as long as long as we can blame someone else for producing those products. I wonder who politicians are going to blame for meth.",
