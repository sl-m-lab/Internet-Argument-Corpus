One things for sure things are getting better for mass murderers.\n\n \n To which I replied by pointing out the murder statistics of Chicago.\n \n \nYou keep going on about the evils of legal concealed carry Brady. You cite the Violence Policy Center and their claim that 288 people have been murdered by concealed carry holders since 2007. I pointed out that in the same time period over 1,800 people have been murdered in the city of Chicago where concealed carry and handgun ownership were both illegal and strictly punished. That's a ratio of 6 to 1. 6 people dead in Chicago for every person supposedly killed by a holder of a concealed carry permit.\n\n \n Which received the masterful response by Brady.\n \n \nWhy do you only talk about Chicago. Can we all say CHERRY PICK?\n\n \n Brady felt it necessary to accuse me of cherry picking for pointing out the murder statistics of Chicago in response to his continued citing of the number of people who were supposedly murdered by people who supposedly possessed a concealed carry permit at the time. He does all of this in response to the fact that Loughner chose to hide his gun under his coat just minutes before shooting Giffords and a number of others, all just shortly after it became legal to carry a concealed weapon in Arizona without need for a permit.\n \n However what Brady fails to understand in his comments is that they work against him. He accuses me of cherry picking, but Loughner and his actions were singular in nature. They aren't part of a growing trend cropping up in more and more states in America. He acted by himself as a blip on the radar screen. In all likelihood Jared Loughner's actions count as an isolated incident, are highly unlikely to take place again in the near future, and as such shouldn't be considered as relevant ground for future discussion regarding the gun laws of the nation.\n \n So Brady the evidence is against you, showing that you're the one who's guilty of cherry picking rather than anyone else.\n \n Now we come to Brady's wild claims in another topic regarding murder figures. http://www.4forums.com/political/425135-post8.html\n \n \nSixty-six percent of all murders are committed with guns. The location of homicides (all methods) varies by gender: 73 percent of female murder victims are killed in the home, while 45 percent of men are killed in the home. Twenty-six percent of men are killed on the street.\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence : Studies\n\n \n Brady and his namesake campaign claims that 66 percent of all murders (as in all murders in the entire nation) are committed with guns. Let's apply this figure to the murder statistics of the city of Chicago. From 2007 to 2010 the number of murders in Chicago was 1854 according to data supplied by the FBI. This was during a time that 288 were supposedly murdered by people who supposedly possessed concealed carry permits.\n \n Assuming the 66 percent figure is correct that would mean 1,224 of Chicago's 1854 homicides were committed with a gun, in a city where handgun ownership and possession was both illegal and punishable. Quite a feat really.\n \n So while the Violence Policy Center continues to claim that concealed carry holders have murdered 288 people since 2007, Chicago has a murder rate of more than 4 to 1 with the same implements. For every 1 person supposedly shot and killed by a holder of a concealed carry permit 4 people were shot and killed in the city of Chicago which was supposed to be handgun free according to their claims.\n \n Brady really should be more careful about his claims in the future. What we have him doing simultaneously is pointing to an isolated incident as if it were part of a national trend, and showing the underwhelming number of times a person with a concealed carry license does something wrong.",

   "i WAS renamed the brady campaign. This is about as sordid as it gets but doesn't end there nor did the sordid begin there, it just continues:\n \n Gun Owners of America embraces Brady's son\n \n \nThe Gun Owners of America has awarded an honorary membership to the son of gun-control activist Sarah Brady. \n In her recent autobiography, \"A Good Fight,\" Brady admitted to purchasing a .30-06 caliber rifle for her son Scott, which allowed him to avoid the required criminal background check. Second Amendment activists believe a Delaware law might have been violated if she did not submit information on the person for whom she bought the gun. \n \n \"Now that Scott Brady is the proud owner of a high-powered 'sniper' rifle, he will most certainly need a fuller understanding of the Second Amendment than he ever received at home,\" Erich Pratt, the Gun Owners of America's communications director said in a statement. \n \n In 1991, Sarah Brady became chair for Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based lobby group pressing for tougher gun-control laws. Her husband James Brady was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan while serving as the president's press secretary. \n \n Last year Handgun Control was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in honor of the Bradys. \n \n \"We congratulate Scott for keeping his name 'off paper,'\" Pratt said. \"Because the gun was bought under his mother's name, he completely avoided the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System). This means authorities will never know he has the sniper rifle, a benefit which reduces the possibility that his gun could ever be confiscated by authorities.\" \n \n In 1993, Congress passed the \"Brady Bill\" championed by Sarah Brady, which requires a five-day waiting period and background checks on handgun purchases. \n \n Pratt says the government's system of keeping track of gun owners has been used to confiscate firearms. \n \n \"New York City registered long guns in the mid-1960s after promising those registration lists would never be used to confiscate the guns,\" Pratt said. \"But in 1991, Handgun Control, Inc., supported the city when it banned many of the very guns which were previously registered. Some homes even received visits from police, who confiscated the banned firearms from the clutches of non- compliant gun owners.\" \n \n Related Special Offers: \n \n \"The Seven Myths of Gun Control\" \n \n \"The Second Amendment: Preserving the Unalienable Right\" \n \n Read more: Gun Owners of America embraces Brady's son Gun Owners of America embraces Brady's son\n\n \n printed in full for education or scholarship.",

   "Each and every person that has been murdered by a person that was legally carrying had more of a right to live than you have to own a gun.\n\n \n First George Vreeland and now you Galileo? You're going to try and pull that BS too? I'm going to tell you the same thing I told him.\n \n To start with nobody has ever lost their life \"because of guns\" but rather because they were murdered by another. And this act of murder is not dependent on the existence of the gun in question to be made physically possible.\n \n A person is capable of being murdered through an unlimited number of acts regardless of what the implement in question is. Air bubble embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, toxic induced sepsis, bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, choking, hanging, vehicular homicide, drowning, countless forms of bacteria, medication mix ups, exsanguination, slipping and falling, undiagnosed concussion, genetic disorders, food allergies, medical malpractice, industrial accidents, falling down the stairs, being set on fire, etc.\n \n Also is your claim that the people who were murdered had a right to live. While this is true, that there is a supposed right to life, this right is far from absolute. The death penalty has yet to be found unconstitutional, meaning a person's right to live doesn't supersede the judicial branch handing down a sentence of death for crimes of treason or first degree murder.\n \n There's also the fact that a charge of infringement of one's rights can only be brought against the government and those that work for said government, either on the local, state or federal level. The Supreme Court has said that a private individual can't be prosecuted for violating the constitutional rights of another private individual. I'm afraid I don't know the exact case but I'm sure Bryan can point it out for us if he's asked.\n \n So while someone can certainly be charged for murder it's not possible to charge the average murderer with violating their victim's right to live. If anyone could be charged with such a crime it would be the police who wind up shooting an innocent person by mistake.\n \n Furthermore why should a murder victim's right to live be somehow more important than another person's right to live? If a person has a right to live that means they have a right to defend themselves against those that would kill them. Perhaps you might feel that the average street thug won't feel compelled to end your life if you have nothing of value to give them, but for those of us that are forced to live in areas where crime is very prevalent, or those of us that have physical disabilities that make us unable to fight back unarmed we're unwilling to trust our very lives to the hands of those that would use violence against us for personal gain.\n \n Case in point. A criminal's supposed right to life can't be regarded as more important than the right to life of their victim.\n \n In terms of proper comparison, this entire argument of yours would be like saying an abusive husband has every right to live, but his wife not only has no such right to live, she doesn't even have the right to take steps to defend herself against being murdered because that might violate her husband's right to live.",

The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n What did they find? \n Quote:\n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\"  \n \n The CDC gave a weak apology seeming to contradict everything their findings said, but they did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \n Quote:\n In short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n \n\n \n BTW, when you get to make decisions that affect me and your Romanic choice of death for CCW's, you better make darn sure you go by the penal code and not your own preferences else you become corrupted like the ATF and project 'gun walker and fast and furious' which is now an international incident all the way to the State Dept. and DOJ and could well bring down the entire administration in the desire to make their wishes and budget dreams come true.

The Brady Campaign filed an amicus brief in favor of the DC handgun ban and used their regular junk science arguments for why it should remain in place.\n \n Even if we accept the argument that Chicago's handgun ban somehow saved 942 during the time it was active between 1983 and 2008 as somehow being both factual and honest, that only amounts to a rate of about 38 less deaths per year in a city of about 2.8 million people. And 38 lives saved per year is a poor excuse of a reason for allowing a clear constitutional violation to remain in place. Keep that fact in mind, Chicago's handgun ban was unconstitutional from the very beginning, it was illegal.\n \n \nAs I understand, this basically says that Chicago's high murder rate has been been due to crack cocaine, poverty, and a large African American population.\n\n \n Incorrect. You don't murder someone with crack cocaine. It's a reason to murder someone, but cocaine isn't an implement for murder. Cocaine isn't a deadly weapon that's used for the purpose of killing another, rather it's just a motivator.\n \n Keep in mind though that cocaine is illegal. The people dealing in cocaine are not law abiding, either with federal law or local ordinances. It's quite foolish to argue that Chicago's handgun ban would have any deterring effect on those that would commit murder for illegal drugs.\n \n \nWhen you control for these factors, it becomes clear that the gun ban actually prevented several hundred homicides.\n\n \n Controlling for these factors? How exactly do you control factors such as cocaine poverty and the black population? It's more like you remove them as possible causes for violence and murder and simply look at the gun issue exclusively to try and make a point. Brady presented such an argument regarding violence in pro-gun states and his study was shredded because it adjusted and controlled for issues that would actually influence criminal behavior.\n \n Whatever argument you may present it does little to dispute the listed facts and numbers. And the numbers show that Chicago had more murders taking place than the rest of Illinois despite their complete and total handgun ban being in place during that time. Why is that so hard for you to understand?\n \n In proper comparison terms Chicago was basically below the sea level of the rest of Illinois with their handgun ban. They did nothing that would prevent a flood of weapons from coming across city boundaries and empowering the thugs and murderers because they knew full well that none of their victims would be able to fight back without risking going to prison for defending themselves.\n \n And your attempt at getting the discussion off topic has failed. You haven't been able to change the fact that from 2007 to 2010 the number of people who were feloniously murdered in Chicago was much greater than the number of people who can legally be recognized as feloniously murdered throughout the rest of the country by someone with a concealed carry permit.

I'm not saying the victims of these shootings sprees were not innocent. I'm simply saying since the cases have yet to be determined, and Loughner has yet to be found guilty of killing anyone, it's dishonest to include them on the roster. The Violence Policy Center certainly isn't above listed examples where charges were either dismissed or not filed at all.\n \n The date on \"concealed carry killers\" lists two people who were acquitted of any wrong doing, one who's case was dismissed and two more who faced no charges filed. That's five people who the law recognized as not guilty of their actions but the Violence Policy Center continues to count them as killers.\n \n \nBeing specially trained and fighting crime as a full time job makes them different.\n\n \n Fighting crime, enforcing the law and upholding the peace are the responsibilities of the police. That's what they're trained to do, that's what they're paid to do. Such tasks are not the obligations of the private citizens that make up society. We pay taxes so a police force can exist and carry out these assigned duties. Neither you nor Brady nor anyone else can honestly expect us to carry out the tasks delegated to the police.\n \n As such it truly doesn't matter if concealed carry reduces crime or not since it's not our sworn duty to aid in law enforcement matters. We're talking about our rights here. Rights that more states are recognizing as constitutional in nature. And the rights of the people must be regarded as more important than police powers since we don't live in a police state.\n \n \nI said \"due to\" not \"with\".\n\n \n So the cocaine serves as a motive for murder. How does that change the fact that most of the murders were gun related and likely had criminal connections since cocaine was involved?\n \n Your link says that results were adjusted to account for poverty rates, cocaine and the black population. I say this is dishonest as this doesn't change the fact that the murder rate for Chicago amounts for 64 percent of the murders in Chicago. Poverty and drugs and blacks aren't excuses for murder nor are they factors that would change the point regarding the higher homicide figures.\n \n Maybe you could make a case that the poor are victimized more often than others. You might even be able to make a case that it's blacks and drug addicts who are responsible for more murders than other groups.

Pointing that out does not equate with attempting to get the topic off thread.\n\n \n 64 percent of Illinois homicides happened within Chicago territory.

   "Your post is shameful Brady. Very shameful indeed. You show no respect either for the people of this country or the Supreme Court that determines the constitutionality of the law.\n \n Before I even start tearing into the idiocy you've paraded before us I'm going to tell you the same thing that I earlier told George Vreeland and Galileo simply because you haven't learned from the posts of your associates. Since you share their foolish claim you'll share their lashing.\n \n To start with nobody has ever lost their life \"because of guns\" but rather because they were murdered by another. And this act of murder is not dependent on the existence of the gun in question to be made physically possible.\n \n A person is capable of being murdered through an unlimited number of acts regardless of what the implement in question is. Air bubble embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, toxic induced sepsis, bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, choking, hanging, vehicular homicide, drowning, countless forms of bacteria, medication mix ups, exsanguination, slipping and falling, undiagnosed concussion, genetic disorders, food allergies, medical malpractice, industrial accidents, falling down the stairs, being set on fire, etc.\n \n Also is your claim that the people who were murdered had a right to live. While this is true, that there is a supposed right to life, this right is far from absolute. The death penalty has yet to be found unconstitutional, meaning a person's right to live doesn't supersede the judicial branch handing down a sentence of death for crimes of treason or first degree murder.\n \n There's also the fact that a charge of infringement of one's rights can only be brought against the government and those that work for said government, either on the local, state or federal level. The Supreme Court has said that a private individual can't be prosecuted for violating the constitutional rights of another private individual. I'm afraid I don't know the exact case but I'm sure Bryan can point it out for us if he's asked.\n \n So while someone can certainly be charged for murder it's not possible to charge the average murderer with violating their victim's right to live. If anyone could be charged with such a crime it would be the police who wind up shooting an innocent person by mistake.\n \n Furthermore why should a murder victim's right to live be somehow more important than another person's right to live? If a person has a right to live that means they have a right to defend themselves against those that would kill them. Perhaps you might feel that the average street thug won't feel compelled to end your life if you have nothing of value to give them, but for those of us that are forced to live in areas where crime is very prevalent, or those of us that have physical disabilities that make us unable to fight back unarmed we're unwilling to trust our very lives to the hands of those that would use violence against us for personal gain.\n \n Case in point. A criminal's supposed right to life can't be regarded as more important than the right to life of their victim.\n \n In terms of proper comparison, this entire argument of yours would be like saying an abusive husband has every right to live, but his wife not only has no such right to live, she doesn't even have the right to take steps to defend herself against being murdered because that might violate her husband's right to live.\n \n And now I can get onto your post itself.\n \n \nAnd thats why all guns should be banned.\n\n \n In it's ruling on the Heller case the Supreme Court has said that a total gun ban isn't an option that's legally allowed. They reaffirmed this later in McDonald when they applied the ruling to all 50 states.\n \n Surely you aren't going to publicly take the position that we should simply disregard the Supreme Court and the Constitution are you? You're not going to stand up and proclaim your allegiance to the anti-constitution, big government brigade are you?\n \n \nGuns interfere with peoples rights.\n\n \n As usual Brady you're incorrect and far away from the truth. Guns don't interfere with people's rights they protect them. In the hands of the people they'll save more lives than they'll ever improperly take. A gun enables any average person to protect themselves from harm at the hands of a menace to society like a drug addict or gang member. There's simply no way a handicapped person can physically fight off a youthful offender. In terms of simple physics it's impossible for the average woman to best a male assailant in unarmed combat and survive unharmed.\n \n Criminals have the advantage of surprise and the ability to choose who they'll victimize whenever they want. Surely you aren't going to try and argue in favor of supplying the criminals with more of an advantage than what they already have over us.\n \n \n'endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\n\n \n While the Declaration of Independence is important to the country it's in no way a binding contract restricting the authority or the power of government. Nor is anything mentioned within properly protected under the law. Simply because the Founding Fathers recognized that the right to life is sovereign to the people of this nation that in no way suggests that they meant the people can take absolutely no steps to protect their lives at the cost of another.\n \n As I've said before in the past I'm not a lawyer. I'm not an expert on constitutional law. But I challenge you to find me a court case that determined the life of a dangerous sociopath is so sacred that those he would seek to kill are legally barred from using lethal force to protect their own lives.\n \n \nIf someone kills me with a gun then I will lose my life and liberty and I wont be able to pursue happiness.\n\n \n Wouldn't the results be the same if you were stabbed in the chest? Or if you were bludgeoned to death with a stolen crowbar? Or what if you were held down and injected with an air bubble to induce an embolism? Or maybe getting run over by a drunk driver? Or what about ricin poisoning in the same fashion that killed Georgi Markov in 1978?\n \n Why exactly are you so uniquely fixated on death by gun-related incidents? What about death by other implements that have been made into weapons by those who only have bad intentions in their hearts? How about the rash of stabbings inflicted on school children in China last year? While the death results is relatively low each one of those children have been put at risk of HIV exposure due to the cross-contamination connected to the nature of mass stabbings. And since China lacks the medical facilities to handle a matter like rabies it's reasonable to assume they lack the same facilities for treating possible HIV exposure on a massive scale.\n \n You certainly showed no concern for the federal agents who were murdered by the drug cartel and I can't help but wonder why. Is it because their 2 deaths are too minute in nature for you to worry about?\n \n I've asked you before for clarification on just what you consider a \"mass shooting\" and if there are certain requirements that had to be met such as a minimum body count, but yet you've never gotten back to me on that. Why exactly is that?\n \n You seem to give no concern for those who were murdered with any manner of tools besides guns. They lose their right to life that you claim exists, and their right to liberty and their right to pursue happiness. Why is it that you shed not a single tear for victims of knife homicide? How about all those people that have died from arson incidents? How about the wife of the New York TV executive who was beheaded? How about the children who are either smothered or drowned by their own parents?",

Wesley Earnest - convicted - 1 person killed\n \n 50 exactly. Show me the ones I'm missing if you continue to insist my count is off.\n\n I found 14 more:\n \n Joshua Noel Jones(1 killed), William Calderon (1 killed), Brian McGuire (1 killed), Name Not Provided (1 killed), Michelle Rae Wilson (1 killed), Johnnie Pulley (1 killed), Kirk Caldwell (1 killed), Michael Joe Hood (3 killed), Harry Raymond Coleman (1 killed), Alan Godin (1 killed), Eugene C. Wright (1 killed),\n Evan Gargiulo (1 killed)\n \n \nI believe that counts as intellectual dishonesty in this discussion. Since the perpetrator committed suicide was unable to be brought before court and found guilty for their actions those they killed can't legally be considered murder victims. Regardless of emotional issues the facts remain and must be addressed.\n\n Since the shooters are dead being found guilty in court is irrelevant. I think it's intellectually dishonest to exclude a lot of innocent victims while evaluating the harm that concealed weapon carriers do. \n \n \nI'll admit I was in a bit of a hurry at the time and didn't see those two names.\n \n Loughner's case has yet to be determined in a court of law. I'm not saying the victims of these shootings sprees were not innocent. I'm simply saying since the cases have yet to be determined, and Loughner has yet to be found guilty of killing anyone, it's dishonest to include them on the roster. The Violence Policy Center certainly isn't above listed examples where charges were either dismissed or not filed at all.\n \n The date on \"concealed carry killers\" lists two people who were acquitted of any wrong doing, one who's case was dismissed and two more who faced no charges filed. That's five people who the law recognized as not guilty of their actions but the Violence Policy Center continues to count them as killers.\n\n The VPC is not incorrect by saying that they killed. Even if they killed in self defense they still killed. I will make a reasonable estimate of how many innocent victims there were (excluding suicides)- 64 (from cases that resulted in convictions), 67 (from pending cases such as Loughner's), 55 (from murder suicides- not including the shooters), 9 people killed the crazy people. That's 195 innocent victims. \n \n Let's do some more analysis. Based on the cases that have already been decided, how likely is a person that carries to kill an innocent person v. killing someone in self defense? Let's see... 64 people killed in cases that resulted in convictions, 55 victims of murder suicide (not including the shooters), 9 victims of mentally incompetent people. That's 128 killed. 2 acquittals, 1 case of charges dismissed, 2 cases of no charges filed. That's 5 killed. So there's a ratio of 128 to 5. 128/5= 26. So based on that, a person who carries is 26 times more likely to kill an innocent person than to kill someone in self defense. \n \n \nFighting crime, enforcing the law and upholding the peace are the responsibilities of the police. That's what they're trained to do, that's what they're paid to do. Such tasks are not the obligations of the private citizens that make up society. We pay taxes so a police force can exist and carry out these assigned duties. Neither you nor Brady nor anyone else can honestly expect us to carry out the tasks delegated to the police.\n \n As such it truly doesn't matter if concealed carry reduces crime or not since it's not our sworn duty to aid in law enforcement matters. We're talking about our rights here. Rights that more states are recognizing as constitutional in nature. And the rights of the people must be regarded as more important than police powers since we don't live in a police state.\n \n So the cocaine serves as a motive for murder. How does that change the fact that most of the murders were gun related and likely had criminal connections since cocaine was involved?\n \n Your link says that results were adjusted to account for poverty rates, cocaine and the black population. I say this is dishonest as this doesn't change the fact that the murder rate for Chicago amounts for 64 percent of the murders in Chicago. Poverty and drugs and blacks aren't excuses for murder nor are they factors that would change the point regarding the higher homicide figures.\n\n So you're claiming that multivariate analysis is dishonest? As this explains:\n \n \"A person who answers yes to the question 'Does anyone in the house use illicit drugs?' might be nine times more likely to be murdered, but that doesn't eliminate all the other variables that also contribute to the total murder risk. To isolate the risk attributed to drug use alone, researchers need to perform 'multivariate analysis,' which zeroes out all these other factors. That way, we can learn how drug use in and of itself raises the murder risk.\"\n A gun in the home increases personal safety\n \n Likewise, to isolate the effect attributed to the gun ban alone, researchers need to zero out other factors such as concentrated poverty, crack cocaine, and race. \n \n \nMaybe you could make a case that the poor are victimized more often than others. You might even be able to make a case that it's blacks and drug addicts who are responsible for more murders than other groups. But you aren't able to make a case that taking these facts into account somehow puts a positive light on Chicago's handgun ban.\n \n 64 percent of Illinois homicides happened within Chicago territory. Since Chicago had a handgun ban during that time it's only reasonable to assume that a connection exists between the two facts. Why did the rest of Illinois average a rate of about one murder per city in comparison to Chicago during that time frame?\n\n Because the rest of Illinois has less poverty per capita and different racial demographics. It's not because of the gun ban.",

I performed a word search of the listed data for cases marked as \"convicted\" and I came up with exactly 36 results which I listed.\n \n \nSince the shooters are dead being found guilty in court is irrelevant. I think it's intellectually dishonest to exclude a lot of innocent victims while evaluating the harm that concealed weapon carriers do.\n\n \n Are you interested in the law or not? You can claim intellectual dishonesty if you wish but in my evaluation of the data presented I relied on cases that have seen actual due process and been determined in a court of law.\n \n You want to evaluate the harm done by people with concealed carry permits? Well then let's do just that. Excluding those that were acquitted or had charges dismissed or not filed you have a maximum of 163 possible examples at your disposal. However we have tens of thousands of currently valid permits that haven't been revoked. Hundreds of thousands when you consider the concealed carry program dates back to 1987 in Florida. The number of currently valid permits greatly eclipses the number of permits that have been revoked for whatever reason.\n \n The numbers simply aren't on your side here. There are too many permit holders who haven't had trouble with the law to support your claims.\n \n For the sake of argument let's assume the Violence Policy Center is correct about their claims for 283 of the listed victims. Over a period of 4 years that's a rate of slightly less than 71 people murdered per year. Over an area of 48 states that's less than 6 people per state for the entire 4 year period, about 1.5 people per state for each year. That minute amount is hardly enough to consider a red flag about the supposed dangers posed by holders of concealed carry permits. Why is it so hard for you to grasp that the numbers presented are microscopic in nature when compared to everything else?\n \n The number of currently active permits speaks volumes for the upstanding and law abiding nature of permit holders. The few examples you can prevent do nothing except show how rare and isolated such incidents are and that they're the exception rather than the rule.\n \n \nThe VPC is not incorrect by saying that they killed. Even if they killed in self defense they still killed. I will make a reasonable estimate of how many innocent victims there were (excluding suicides)- 64 (from cases that resulted in convictions), 67 (from pending cases such as Loughner's), 55 (from murder suicides- not including the shooters), 9 people killed the crazy people. That's 195 innocent victims.\n\n \n So it's reasonable to conclude that if one uses deadly force in the name of self defense that person is regarded exactly the same as Jared Loughner as far as the Violence Policy Center is concerned.\n \n Police officers have concealed carry permits so they can legally carry off duty. They kill people all the time when somebody's life is on the line. Why aren't the police included on the list? What special privileges grant them immunity from the Violence Policy Center's attack on honest citizens?\n \n Somebody is being dishonest here. Either the Violence Policy Center for making no distinction between felony murder and justified use of deadly force. Or you for purporting the foolishness they use for their own agenda.\n \n \nLet's do some more analysis. Based on the cases that have already been decided, how likely is a person that carries to kill an innocent person v. killing someone in self defense? Let's see... 64 people killed in cases that resulted in convictions, 55 victims of murder suicide (not including the shooters), 9 victims of mentally incompetent people. That's 128 killed. 2 acquittals, 1 case of charges dismissed, 2 cases of no charges filed. That's 5 killed. So there's a ratio of 128 to 5. 128/5= 26.\n\n \n Question time for you genius. Why would anybody who intended to commit felony murder bother with going through the legal hoops necessary to get a concealed carry permit? For what purpose would they subject themselves to photographing, fingerprinting and other paperwork necessities if their only intent is to commit a crime later on?\n \n \nSo based on that, a person who carries is 26 times more likely to kill an innocent person than to kill someone in self defense.\n\n \n Kellermann claimed gun owners were 43 times more likely to murder a friend or loved one than an actual criminal. His study has been thoroughly debunked. Your junk science is no more valid than his.\n \n Wise up! Those who seek concealed carry permits don't carry in order to kill. We carry in order to protect ourselves and do so legally. If our only intent was to kill others then we'd never bother with a permit. Murder charges trump concealed weapons charges in a court of law. Felony vs misdemeanor, which do you honestly think we'd be more concerned about facing?\n \n \nSo you're claiming that multivariate analysis is dishonest? As this explains:\n \n \"A person who answers yes to the question 'Does anyone in the house use illicit drugs?' might be nine times more likely to be murdered, but that doesn't eliminate all the other variables that also contribute to the total murder risk. To isolate the risk attributed to drug use alone, researchers need to perform 'multivariate analysis,' which zeroes out all these other factors. That way, we can learn how drug use in and of itself raises the murder risk.\"\n A gun in the home increases personal safety\n \n Likewise, to isolate the effect attributed to the gun ban alone, researchers need to zero out other factors such as concentrated poverty, crack cocaine, and race. \n\n \n When you say something like this I can't view you as someone who's interested in the truth. I don't see how it matters what the motivations were at the time of the murder in Chicago. What ultimately matter is that the murders took place in Chicago, in a place that by law nobody could own handguns for any circumstances. And yet we have all these gun-related murders happening in this proverbial sink hole that is the city of Chicago. All of this comes together to show that the ban on handguns did nothing to prevent any murders from taking place or keep anyone safe.\n \n If you can't accept that fact then you're simply not interested in the truth. You care more about your precious anti-gun policy than the actual facts.\n \n \nBecause the rest of Illinois has less poverty per capita and different racial demographics. It's not because of the gun ban.\n\n \n And what the hell does that have to do anything? Murder isn't exclusive to the poor and black communities. Murder isn't even highly limited to poor and black communities. Murder can take place anywhere at any time and that's a fact of life. Anybody can be a victim no matter how old or how young, rich or poor, black or white.\n \n I'm tired of having this argument with you. I introduced Chicago to the discussion to show that there are cities where the use of illegally possessed weapons has lead to more deaths in one year than the Violence Policy Center's cited examples in all four years of their crusade against concealed carry. And what do you do to try and derail the subject? You try and argue that those murders were the result of poor blacks with drug addictions and that the city's handgun ban played no part in it. Well that game is over now. The discussion regarding Chicago is over.\n \n Time to get back onto the original topic. You're trying to show that concealed carry is somehow a greater threat than a help. Come up with an explanation for how those 288 cited cases are enough to trump the hundreds of thousands of currently valid permits in circulation throughout 48 states. Explain how concealed carry spread to 48 states since 1987 if there was simply no good to be achieved from it.",

   "The National Academy of Sciences Report\n   The Use of Firearms to Defend Against Criminals \n In this chapter, we consider what is known about the extent and nature of defensive gun use (DGU). Over the past decade, researchers have attempted to measure the prevalence of defensive gun use in the population. This measurement problem has proved to be quite complex, with some estimates suggesting just over 100,000 defensive gun uses per year and others suggesting 2.5 million or more defensive gun uses per year.\n\n Tell you what. I&#8217;ll take the lowest figure. Howe'd that be? :) 100 Thousand Defensive Gun Uses per year is MORE than enough reason to have a gun. \n \n Addressing Kellerman, the National Academy of Sciences Report says: \n   Continued from The National Academy of Sciences Report \n In light of these findings, Kellermann et al. (1993) ultimately conclude that owning firearms for personal protection is &#8220;counterproductive,&#8221; (p. 1087) and that &#8220;people should be strongly discouraged from keeping guns in the home&#8221; (p. 1090). This conclusion rests on the implicit assumption that the decision to own a firearm is random or exogenous (Exogenous (or exogeneous) (from the Greek words \"exo\" and \"genis\", meaning \"outside\" and \"generated\") refers to an action or object coming from outside a system.)  with respect to homicide in the home (after controlling for various observed factors, including whether a household member has been hurt in a fight, has been arrested, or has used illicit drugs). Cummings and his colleagues (1997) do not draw such strong causal conclusions, but instead simply describe the observed positive association between firearms and homicide.\n \n In the committee&#8217;s view, the exogenous selection assumption and the resulting conclusions are not tenable. (Tenable: Able to be maintained or defended against attack or objection) While these observed associations between firearms ownership and homicide may be of interest, they do little to reveal the impact of firearms on homicide or the utility of firearms for   self-defense. As noted by the authors, even small degrees of misreporting on ownership by either the cases or the controls can create substantial biases in the estimated risk factors (see Kleck, 1997, for an illustration of these biases). A more fundamental inferential problem arises from the fact that ownership is not likely to be random with respect to homicide or other forms of victimization. To the contrary, the decision to own a firearm may be directly related to the likelihood of being victimized. People may, for instance, acquire firearms in response to specific or perceived threats, and owners may be more or less psychologically prone toward violence. Thus, while the observed associations may reflect a causal albeit unspecified path-way, they may also be entirely spurious. As Kellermann and his colleagues note (1993:1089), &#8220;it is possible that reverse causation accounted for some of the association we observed between gun ownership and homicide.&#8221;\n",

   "Perhaps the time has come to step back and reevaluate the current road of debate taking place right now.\n \n When I changed style and actually creating a new thread instead of replying to an already existing topic my goal was to draw attention to the antics of Brady in how he would regularly resort to yelling \"cherry picking!\" anytime someone points out the statistics and facts that cast doubt on whatever nonsense is offered up by the gun control crowd. I even drew examples between his citing of the 288 supposedly murdered victims of concealed carry holders, and my citing of Chicago's murder rate during the same time frame to show that the Windy City is a much more dangerous place.\n \n In response rather than getting an honest debate from Brady I get his trolling attacks rather than useful information, followed up Galileo constantly citing junk science to try and make it look like Chicago's unconstitutional handgun ban managed to save less than 1,000 possible lives during the time it was in place, not to mention his multiple attempts to try and make it look like the true causes for homicide in Chicago were the result of cocaine, poverty and black people and that the handgun ban played no part in those people being murdered. However that does nothing to change the fact that approximately 38 lives theoretically being saved per year is insufficient justification for violating the constitution and the rights of around 3 million people for a period of 24 years.\n \n The validity of the data presented by the Violence Policy Center has also been called into question. A significant number of their cited cases have been ruled as suicides where the only dead body to count was the permit holder exclusively. There's also the issue of the Violence Policy Center continuing to count examples where people have been found to have acting in a legal manner and can't be counted as murderers or having done anything wrong. Despite charges being dismissed, charges not being filed, and cases being acquitted in a court of law these people are still counted as killers the same as Jared Loughner. I personally believe this should cast doubt on the entire case presented by the Violence Policy Center but some choose to disagree.\n \n From there this thread has descended into bickering rather than intellectual thought and I admit I allowed the claims of Galileo to degrade my usual quality of work and take me off my game. Something that I personally hate to see as I try and be intelligent in my approach and make attempts to cite what I use.\n \n We've got the claim that the police do more to fight crime than those who have concealed carry permits. What was missed when this statements was made is the simple fact that the citizenry isn't tasked with fighting crime of carrying out any other duty assigned to the police. As tax payers we fund the various police forces and charge them with the tasks of fighting crime, enforcing the laws and upholding the peace. By law private citizens aren't supposed to get involved in police matters, that's recognized as vigilantism and has the potential to get an official investigation thrown out of court and possibly letting a murderer walk.\n \n We've also seen the comparison made between a few rouge concealed carry holders and terrorists on airplanes, and the suggestion that the actions of the few should be used to punish the many. However this comparison is inherently false as travel on airplanes is a privilege while gun ownership is a constitutional right and can't legally be held to the same standards of infringement and restriction. Concealed carry is being seen in the same light as numerous states are either considering, working on passing, or already have passed, laws that make concealed carry a constitutional right by basically doing away with the requirement for a permit. I find the comparison between those who exercise their constitutional rights and those who commit acts of terrorism to be highly offense and inflammatory and serve no justified basis in a debate other than to try and degrade the overall quality in hopes of derailing the entire topic.\n \n Add to that is the logical shortcomings of such a comparison. Supposedly the many have to be punished for the actions of the few. We see that come up often anytime some idiot decides to start shooting innocent people and make a spectacle of themselves. We even saw that in the aftermath of 9/11 with the implementation of the TSA group. However we haven't seen this same logic applied in other areas where a handful of dangerous lunatics can wreak mayhem. If we applied this logic in a fair and even manner there were be much fewer cars on the road and a whole lot less driver's licenses being issued as a result of a handful of XXXXXX who get into wrecks and commit vehicular homicide.\n \n And then we have Brady doing his usual trolling tactics because he seems to be incapable of generating a coherent thought. We have him going on record and showing a complete disregard for the Supreme Court and basically taking a stance that their rulings mean nothing (what with claiming all guns should be banned despite the illegality of any such attempt as they clearly spelled out) and making the claim that his right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness (standards that aren't even mentioned within the Constitution and carry no legal weight in a court of law) are somehow put at risk by gun owners, while blatantly ignoring the fact these same mentioned rights can easily be violated and extinguished through an unlimited number of other means at the hands of someone creative and sadistic enough to experiment on him for the simple purpose of finding new ways to murder people.\n \n I don't see how an honest and open debate can be had with the supporters of gun control that are here on these forums. They're not interested in the facts or matters of law, they're blatantly ignorant of the current scandal involving the ATF that's in charge of regulating gun related issues, they want to follow the example of the United Kingdom and basically crucify tens of millions of people for the illegal actions of a minute number of people who are of questionable legal backgrounds to begin with, they couldn't tell the difference from a constitutional right and a government authorized privilege if they had to, and anytime they don't like the message we have to say in response to simply add us to an ignore list because they're incapable of addressing out claims in a mature and adult manner. The only reason I can see for treating them with any measure of respect is so we don't sink down to their level of immaturity and trolling nature.",

Guns interfere with peoples rights.\n \n 'endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\n \n If someone kills me with a gun then I will lose my life and liberty and I wont be able to pursue happiness.\n\n \n \n As myself and others have pointed out, that is found in the Declaration of Independance! It was a precursor to WAR. The war began when King George sent the redcoats to disarm THE PEOPLE.\n \n You are following King George and I know of no better way to lose your life and liberty other than attempting what he did and becoming a treasonous tyrant bent on absolute control.\n \n We formed a Republic, a nation of laws and rights of the people, enshrined in the BOR the RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS of a military nature as stated in McDonald. That right encompasses self defense. If you don't want to lose your life it is simple, don't threaten other folks nor their rights lest you suffer the same pains and penalties as King George and his merry henchmen.\n \n You can persue happiness all you want except drugs, and other actions listed in the Penal Code. You do not have a right to feel happy trying to take rights away from others and have no freedom to do so. What good is property if you can't defend it, guns are not only property but are the best defense of it and a person's life.\n \n You make an absurd statement based in the remenants of your induced immagination and have no claim. Your attempts have always been crushed in real courts of law and it is now time to pay the piper. You have no claim! Your freedom is protected by well armed and better men than you will ever be. In the pecking order of existence, you are little more than chicken feed emoticon_xhoho\n \n I am like Pietro and others and tired of you continued presentation of baseless claim and studies without any merit and copied and pasted over and over again in the same format and the same old disproven lies. I would say your disarmament .orgs are responsible for more deaths and false imprisonment than even King George and MORE GUNS = LESS CRIME.\n \n IA is about to pass a statewide law that is pre-emptive which will take away any symbalance and excuse Chicago has to pass any right taking gun law and the carry and use thereof.

You've now got a case of 58 people per year, spread out over an area of 48 states? Wow Brady you really are making headway in your crusade against the constitution.\n \n I'm really not seeing the point you're trying to make here Brady. Was the \"sniper attack\" carried out with a handgun? That must be some superhuman level of marksmanship right there. This guy must've had Jedi training if he could perform two sniping kills with a regular handgun right?\n \n Come on Brady at least try and make an effort at making a case or something. Picking this one apart is way too easy. You've tried harder than this before in the past to make an argument.\n \n You claim the killer was a sniper. Sniping suggests that a rifle of some sort was involved. And as everyone with a brain knows a rifle isn't a concealable weapon that can be hidden under a jacket or a coat in a discrete manner that wouldn't raise attention. That means the gun in question had to be out in the open and visible to some degree which means that supposed concealed carry permit offered no advantage. Last time I checked Virginia permits didn't allow for the concealing of weaponry other than handguns so it's not like the police were prevented from arresting him if they caught him in the act of transporting the rifle if it was in violation of state law governing the transport of long guns.\n \n How exactly does a concealed carry permit \"arm killers\" when the case you present is like this? Show me where exactly Virginia's concealed carry law enables the unrestricted transport of long guns and prohibits the police from arresting anybody for such. Better yet show me how a concealed carry permit is even relevant when a handgun isn't used in the supposed crime. For what reason would a killer obtain a permit to conceal a handgun if their intention is to use a long range rifle instead? You can't conceal the rifle. Would you be raising a ruckus if a concealed carry holder chose to bludgeon somebody to death with a crowbar?\n \n You talk about law enforcement officers losing their lives to these supposed \"misguided laws\" but you don't elaborate. How many police officers are killed annually in this country? It's a double digits number correct? That means out of all the officers killed in a given year only two of their deaths can be somehow linked to a concealed carry permit. What about the other 90+ percent? Don't you care about how they died?",

   "In my browsing of the various news outlets I came across this information that I thought was both interesting and noteworthy.\n \n Illinois and concealed-carry: Fears about concealed-carry in Illinois - chicagotribune.com\n \n Here's the part that really caught my attention.\n \n \nThe opponents rely on a litany of horribles. The Violence Policy Center in Washington claims that since May 2007, individuals licensed to carry guns killed 286 private citizens and 11 law enforcement officers and committed 18 mass shootings. This gory record, it asserts, destroys the myth that permit-holders are generally law-abiding folks who behave responsibly.\n \n In fact, VPC's own data, when inspected closely, doesn't dent the case for gun rights. Over the past four years, there have been more than 60,000 homicides in the United States. The slayings carried out by permit-holders amount to fewer than one of every 200 murders. For every licensee who killed someone, there are more than 20,000 who didn't.\n \n Nor does the evidence indicate that allowing people to carry pistols causes crime. Many of the shootings done by permit-holders took place in their homes - where you don't need a concealed-carry license to keep a gun.\n \n Some of the killings weren't even done with firearms: Among the cases cited by the VPC is a 2008 strangling in Florida, allegedly by a man who was licensed to carry. How can strangulation be blamed on a concealed weapon permit? If a fisherman kills someone, do we ban fishing rods?\n\n \n This is quite true. The case of Tony Villegas cited by the Violence Policy Center involved strangulation as the method of death. How exactly is that relevant? Did the possession of a concealed carry permit facilitate in the strangulation? \n \n If the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center are going to try and make a case about how dangerous concealed carry is then they should limit the scope of their reference material to matters where a concealed carry permit would play an integral part in the killings taking place. Instances of stabbing, strangling, vehicular homicide, incidents within the home and on private property, and the use of shotguns and rifles should be excluded on the basis of being completely irrelevant.",
