   "Exactly. So why did you bring up artificial insemination?\n\n \n We dont know the process by which Jesus was conceived other than by the power of the holy spirit, it goes in to no detail, the process is obviously not important. However the fact so many people can not accept it because one needs to have sex in order have children is why I pointed to artifical insemination, to show that it is possible for human beings to instigate a \"virgin birth\" - now that we have the scientific know how, this miracle is not so much a miracle any more, it is not beyond the realms of possiblity, infact it is here and now a very real reality. now if man with his limited ability of effecting the world only through natural means has been able to achieve this then it seems to me God, who is unlimited in his power over and beyond the universe would have been more than capable 2000 years ago, it would have been a incredably easy task for him and today it is not so much a unbelivable miracle as it once was...we know it is possible for man today, why would it be impossible for God 2000 years ago.... if there is a God then Yes it is possible, even if there is no God we know it is still possible because miracles or what some may call unexplainable freaks of nature occur.\n \n while by our experiance of the world and history of mankind we know \"virgin birth\" is a reality today and although highly unlikely still a possiblity 2000 years ago...add to the mix there is a God then he could quite easily cause this very easy miracle to happen.\n \n The exact process that took place is not important into believing it is possible...we know 1st by the ability of man to do so today that it is more than possible to achieve the same results and 2nd by the very nature of God that it is/was more than possible for him to do so 2000 years ago. So for me mans ability to achieve these results today only reaffirms my faith that god could 2000 years ago. It is easier for us today to believe the virgin birth of our lord than it was all those years ago, to us virgin birth is not spectacular, its not out of the realms of reality.\n \n Of course it depend how you approach this we will have different persepective coming from faith as to those coming from skeptisim or athiesim its all about how we percieve things. For example immediatly thelmoose coming from a skeptic or athiest p.o.v saw the barriers and boundries of biological understanding of man of history and personal experiance. \n \n Myself coming from a faith p.o.v never even acknowledged these boundries and barriers and immediatly crossed over them with my first post in this thread, which of course thelmoose took exception to and pointed that out quite clearly stating that \"the god card that you pull out of your sleeve in the end is outside this discussion\" knowingly or unkonwingly thelmoose wanted to defend and errect the barriers and boundries, she clearly marked out her personal space as it were, almost as if she were saying \"this is where for me the discussion lies, these are the rules, the boundries, you can not cross the line\" \n \n It is her castle that she has built up and anything that crosses that line will be disregarded. But for me a discussion taking place within the boundries of this castle would be oppressive, a prison, a prevention to the extension of my thought, a shackle to stop me thinking outside the box. Even within her own boundries she can not deny that it is totally impossible that a child should be born from a virgin, unlikely but its not an impossiblity. \n \n When someone sees that a God may exist or accepts that there is a God then the boundries do not exist and biology and history turn from stumbling blocks into stepping stones.\n \n for those who do not believe....Was it possible that a child be born of a virgin 2000 years ago by some unexplainable freak of nature?...we have to say yes it is possible!\n \n for those who believe in God...Was it possible that a Child be born of a virgin 2000 years ago by the Act of God?....we have to say yes it is possible.\n \n So to conclude the only rational answer to the original question is \"it is possible\" \n \n The virgin birth is not something that can be disregarded as mere myth or accepted as fact by the use of reason alone, our acceptance as fact or myth must come from something more than mere reason. you can use reason only to come to the possiblity.\n \n I think that our acceptance or disregard of the virgin birth, Jesus and the existance of God comes down to something within ourselves what we want to believe/disbelive and why we want to believe or disbelieve it... I know I want to believe it and I know the reasons why I want to believe it, it is a possiblity and so I believe it....\n \n \n for others the virgin birth, Jesus as the son of God, the existance of God are if they are honest all possibilities but they dont WANT to believe it.\n \n Do you know you dont want to believe it?\n \n Do you know why you dont want to believe it?",

INRI, rational people believe in things they have evidence for, regardless of whether they want those things to exist or not.\n\n \n Rational people believe things they have evidence for, of course I believe in things there is proof of, I believe my car exists if I did not believe in such things I wouldnt be a rational person.... however many rational people believe many things that we do not have evidance/proof for!!!\n \n Are people irrational for believing in a thing called \"luck\" there is no proof or what you would call evidence, although one may argue that evidence and proof are two different things. is it irrational that 99% of the worlds population believe in \"love\" when there is no proof for such a thing?\n \n To disbelieve if you put a loaded gun to your head and pull the trigger you will die..... is irrational \n \n To believe that if you go to a casino you may be \"lucky\" enough to win some money..... is perfectly rational\n \n To believe that one day you may meet someone you love and they love you is perfectly rational.\n \n The gambler believes his luck is in, because he wants play to win the money the one who fears loosing his money and does not want to play is the one who does not believe he is lucky enough to win.\n \n The point is to play the game one must want to play it!\n \n Irrational thought is not the belief in something there is no proof for, but disbelief in things there is proof for.",

   "Are people irrational for believing in a thing called \"luck\" there is no proof or what you would call evidence, although one may argue that evidence and proof are two different things\n\n Yes, people who believe in 'luck' are being irrational. As popularly embraced, it is a concept with no real-world existence whatsoever.\n \nis it irrational that 99% of the worlds population believe in \"love\" when there is no proof for such a thing?\n\n If you mean the western idea of romantic love, your 99% is probably a vast over-estimate; nor has the idea always existed in the west. However, if you mean the various kinds of affection that can exist between humans, then you are talking about an observable phenomenon: of course it isn't irrational.\n \nIrrational thought is not the belief in something there is no proof for, but disbelief in things there is proof for.\n\n You said above that 'one may argue that evidence and proof are two different things': no argument needed, of course they are. And I will re-assert that it is irrational to believe in something there is no evidence for.",

   "We dont know the process by which Jesus was conceived other than by the power of the holy spirit, it goes in to no detail, the process is obviously not important. However the fact so many people can not accept it because one needs to have sex in order have children is why I pointed to artifical insemination, to show that it is possible for human beings to instigate a \"virgin birth\" - now that we have the scientific know how, this miracle is not so much a miracle any more, it is not beyond the realms of possiblity, infact it is here and now a very real reality. now if man with his limited ability of effecting the world only through natural means has been able to achieve this then it seems to me God, who is unlimited in his power over and beyond the universe would have been more than capable 2000 years ago, it would have been a incredably easy task for him and today it is not so much a unbelivable miracle as it once was...we know it is possible for man today, why would it be impossible for God 2000 years ago....\n\n Khm, first about \"virgin birth\": himen still needs to be punctured in order to do IV insemenation - technically the women is by then no longer a virgin.\n second: isn't God an abstract? Abstractions are not physical and I think this would present a small problem.\n \n\n if there is a God then Yes it is possible, even if there is no God we know it is still possible because miracles or what some may call unexplainable freaks of nature occur.\n\n Yeah, I can buy that....cynism.press\n \n\n while by our experiance of the world and history of mankind we know \"virgin birth\" is a reality today and although highly unlikely still a possiblity 2000 years ago...add to the mix there is a God then he could quite easily cause this very easy miracle to happen.The exact process that took plac is not important into believing it is possible...we know 1st by the ability of man to do so today that it is more than possible to achieve the same results and 2nd by the very nature of God that it is/was more than possible for him to do so 2000 years ago. So for me mans ability to achieve these results today only reaffirms my faith that god could 2000 years ago. It is easier for us today to believe the virgin birth of our lord than it was all those years ago, to us virgin birth is not spectacular, its not out of the realms of reality.\n\n Can he make pigs fly too? I'm sure that somwhere in the future, like 2000 years from now, a man would know how to make a pig fly.\n \n\n for those who do not believe....Was it possible that a child be born of a virgin 2000 years ago by some unexplainable freak of nature?...we have to say yes it is possible!\n\n Not unless Mary was a hermaphrodite. Or she just did not want to admit having premarrital sex.\n \n \n\n The virgin birth is not something that can be disregarded as mere myth or accepted as fact by the use of reason alone, our acceptance as fact or myth must come from something more than mere reason. you can use reason only to come to the possiblity.\n\n Even as a possibility I find it hard to swallow. But hey, in hypothesis everything is possible.\n \n \n\n Do you know you dont want to believe it?\n Do you know why you dont want to believe it?\n\n Yes to both.",
