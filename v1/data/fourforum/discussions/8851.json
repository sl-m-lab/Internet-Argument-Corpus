   "Hi,\n \n its been a while since I've had time to participate round here due to the arrival of OccamsRazor junior but has anyone heard that Palaeos.com is offline?\n \n If you are thinking Palaeos what?, Palaeos was an exceptional, nay unique, internet site devoted to paleontology, cladistics and earth history. Not only did it have in-depth critiques of current understanding and research it also injected a healthy dose of wit, dry humour and tongue in cheek saracasm into its articles (and thats without getting mentioning the YEC's!).\n \n With such classic articles as Auntie Stega and the tetrapods, Sauropods vs. the giant rodents and the unforgettabele fungi evolution and the Great Cthulhu the www is an improverished place for the .netpaleontologist now Palaeos has closed down.\n \n So here is a salute to those interpid authors, Toby White, Alan Kazlev and others for providing such a thorough, stimulating and above all entertaining resource for so long- Palaeos will be missed.....................\n \n \n (I'd add that much like the survivors of mass extinction repopulating the world there may yet be a return for Palaeos)",
