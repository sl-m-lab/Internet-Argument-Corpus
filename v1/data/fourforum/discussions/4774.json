   "Hi,\n \n I have a question.\n \n Is there a contradiction between 1 Kings 16 and 2 Chronicles 16 with regard to the reign of Baasha?\n \n To me, there seems to be.\n \n If so why, if not why not?\n \n Here are the relevent verses:\n \n \n1 Kings 16\n \n 1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha: 2 \"I lifted you up from the dust and made you leader of my people Israel, but you walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to provoke me to anger by their sins. 3 So I am about to consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat. 4 Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country.\"\n \n 5 As for the other events of Baasha's reign, what he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 6 Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king.\n \n 7 Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the LORD , provoking him to anger by the things he did, and becoming like the house of Jeroboam-and also because he destroyed it.\n \n 8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.\n \n 9 Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the man in charge of the palace at Tirzah. 10 Zimri came in, struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.\n \n 11 As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha's whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend. 12 So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu- 13 because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they provoked the LORD , the God of Israel, to anger by their worthless idols.\n \n 14 As for the other events of Elah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? \n\n \n Here Elam takes over the throne of his father Baasha in the 26th year of Asa's reign. Then two years later he is overthrown and Baasha's whole family is killed.\n \n \n2 Chronicles 16\n \n 1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.\n \n 2 Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus. 3 \"Let there be a treaty between me and you,\" he said, \"as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.\" \n\n How could Baasha be killed or at least NOT be the king of Israel after the 27th year of Asa's reign and also be King of Israel in the 36th year?",

   "Here are my thoughts. See the 2 books of kings were written from Israel's perspective....and the book of Chronicle's was written from Judah's perspective, because after the death of Solomon Israel and Judah had split. Now you definitely have something in the nature of a contradiction. I don't claim to be a Bible scholar, but this may be a genuine screw up by the Bible company and translators those of who have re-written from Greek/Hebre to Latin to Old English to New English to the New International Version....there is surely some room for error.....in now ways am I trying to justify simply trying to shed some light....we could also be missing more information.....since they're both a decade a part...we may assumer maybe there was some type of calendar difference back then between Judah or Israel for whatever reason.....my belief is that it just may be some guy accidently hit 3 instead of 2 or vice versa....of course none of these are real answers and I will try to find one......or maybe others will have a legiitmate answer......",
