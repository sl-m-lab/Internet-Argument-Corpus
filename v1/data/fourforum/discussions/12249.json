   "No one can dispute the power of the market to generate wealth and expand freedom. Nevertheless, America's current economic crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control--and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart--not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.\n\n Paraphrased from President Barack Hussein Obams's Inaugural Address on January 20, 2009.",

   "....Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.... In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted--for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things--some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.\n \n For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.\n \n For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.\n\n From the Inaugural Address of President Barack Hussein Obama.\n \n Unfortunately, \"those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame\" have had preference over \" men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom, ... they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.\"\n \n Now it seems, circumstances may be turned around and the soft leisure class is going to lose its privileges, its life on the \"Easy Street\" of the rich who have never had to work for a living.",
