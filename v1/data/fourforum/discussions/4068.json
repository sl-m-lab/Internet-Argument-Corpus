   "www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6802629/site/newsweek/ \n \n \nJan. 8 - What to do about the deepening quagmire of Iraq? The Pentagon's latest approach is being called \"the Salvador option\"-and the fact that it is being discussed at all is a measure of just how worried Donald Rumsfeld really is. \"What everyone agrees is that we can't just go on as we are,\" one senior military officer told NEWSWEEK. \"We have to find a way to take the offensive against the insurgents. Right now, we are playing defense. And we are losing.\" Last November's operation in Fallujah, most analysts agree, succeeded less in breaking \"the back\" of the insurgency-as Marine Gen. John Sattler optimistically declared at the time-than in spreading it out.\n \n \n\n \n \n The above is only a small snippet of the article.\n \n OVerall it looks like the US is going to be creating Death Squads much like those from Central America during the 80's.\n \n Death Squads, torture, bombings almost every day, over 120 billion dollars spent so far 1400 dead US soldiers with 24 000 wounded. All to take out somebody who tortured and had death squads. So much for the humanitarian reasons, so much for the WMD reasons. What reasons are left for the war?",

At least the bush administration appears to be condsidering options which have histrocially worked, as opposed to everything they have done to date (things that have historically been dismal failures every time they were ever tried). \n \n While running death squads is unquestionalbly so far over the line of decency that no civilized people should ever find the idea acceptable, they DO work. They always have. Of course, as opposed to what happened in El Salvador which was a relatively obscure civil war that the world as a whole payed little attention to, the world is keeping a sharp eye on the US and such a foolish move is likely to erode the little international support that we still enjoy, as well as boosting membership in anti american groups through the roof\n \n So, the situation here is completly differnt than that in El Salvador, and doing something so foolish is likely to get a lot of Americans killed, but at least it is something that has worked in te past.\n \n Maks you wonder if maybe sombody in the Bush administration found an old high school history book around the white house somewhere",

Politicians live and die by that number and associated ramifications.\n \n US public opinion regarding Iraq, as has been repeatedly displayed by this administration, is very easily manipulated. IMO the current administration is caught up in the same egotistical trap as Johnson and Nixon experienced, why can't the world's most powerful military defeat a supposedly lesser enemy. \n \n Vietnam proved that additional troop levels didn't ensure defeat without complete control over the foe but required a general draft, which would now instantly dismiss a majority of public support remaining with the current administration's present Iraq policy claim, that democracy is desired by the general Iraq public. \n \n Salvadorian rebels presented a somewhat unified, organized adversary seeking political change from an existing system that endured for 12 bloody years. The 'solution' there was not just death squads, but what amounted to genocide by identifying any civilians in any geographical area considered controlled or sympathetic to rebel causes as enemies and eliminating that entire remaining populace with whatever means sufficed. Salvador represented one-quarter of Iraq's population and 5% of Iraq's land mass. \n \n We've basically done that with Fallujah, to some extent Mosel and smaller cities identified as resistant to our occupation, with no success. 'Roundups' of suspected resistance sympathizers has reached proportions where detention centers are becoming revolving doors due to the sheer number of suspects. With nation-wide, highly publicized Gestapo or S. Vietnam tactics using instant execution of all suspected sympathizers, including those in Baghdad, absolute control would be impossible to implement with the present number of troops available for support of any such political action. The hunters would quickly become the hunted. As in Palestine, even the women and children would be carrying bombs. \n \n We tried virtually every possibility to subdue the Vietnamese using force as a tactic, without success. Now we're using the same methodolgy in Iraq, an equally determined foe, with no success. If nothing else, democracy is stubborn to the point of being brain dead when political egos are directing our 'humanitarian' efforts to instill democracy in Iraq.",

Add indirect costs and flow-through domestic transactions at your discretion and match that against an annual GDP growth rate of 3.4%. I hesitate to use numbers on this forum for indirect and flow-through as I can't readily substantiate them without a lot of research, but would be comfortable in assuming a negative GDP if both efforts were halted. Abandonment of the Iraq effort alone would turn GDP negative by lowering consumer confidence after administration claims of being there for the long haul and the importance of democracy in Iraq, whatever that means.",

Based on US incarceration rates in the Land of the Free they're to be colonized after, they'll need enough for roughly 180,000 inmates who disagree with civil laws, more with occupation resistors.

Based on US federal prison guidelines with individual facility populations of 1400, that's going to be one juicy contract. \n \n I didn't realize we had enough special operations troops and equipment to perform mass kidnappings, death being their specialty, and we certainly know our reserve and national guard troops aren't exactly highly skilled as guards.

Even at a conservative \n 20% of Iraq's population with 10% of that number being non-active participants in positions of influence and aid, we're looking at 52,000 people marked for imprisonment or death not including active field resistors. The culture being far different than that of somewhat passive and Christian Salvador, field resistance will increase on an exponential basis. \n \n Using tactics designed by the Hitler regime, that statement will get some people excited, without a military occupation force large enough to totally dominate the general populace will fail. Unless the occupation force is used as an extension of the special forces group. \n \n Could this be the reasoning behind Bush's choice of a new attorney general, who previously applied legal approval on Iraq prisoner interrogation techniques as a White House lawyer, which were later deemed excessive and punished by imprisonment of token perpetrators for public display? Without a field grade officer serving a minute's time? Reinstate those rules with different wording?\n \n It looks like the same desperation and lack of planning we've employed in Iraq since the invasion. The military will follow orders, senior command being as political as it is fearful of being removed for cause, which leaves only the international community to pass judgment on tactics used by Israel multiplied by 25,000 or so. The American public, with full bellies and escape diversions requiring winners, won't know the difference. If it works. We're angering some truly fierce people without adequate military control. If I was a Sunni subject to that known objective, I'd start killing all non-Sunnis at will. When backed into that corner, what can anyone with a sense of pride lose?",

   "On the contrary, I want the US to get out as soon as the election is over and the Iraqis have their own security in place. If they want to clean house after that , they can do as they please, dragging Sunnis out of their houses crying \"Allahu akbar\" if they'd like, for all I care. I say \"teach them to fish\"; if they starve or drown after that, so be it.

I'm curious as to what changed your viewpoint?\n\n \n I'm not sure what GW2's Grand Plan #6 is, but I'll assume that it involves keeping US soldiers in Iraq indefinitely. I can support having A military presence in Iraq following the election, but I don't support the US being the ONLY military presence. I want to see as many US soldiers exiting Iraq as is possible. In other words, if the Shi'ia decide that they want to quell dissent in the Sunni Triangle by dragging insurgants out of their houses and executing them on sight, I can live with that. I just don't want US soldiers being the ones doing the dragging or executing. \n As for women's role in ME democracies, I think it's key to their success. It will drive a deep wedge into the heart of Fundamental Islam, a wedge that is long overdue.",

   "I like Lord T's scenario. We have a tendency of military repetition and using Kurd assets to supplement our limited special forces personnel in removing targeted Sunni leadership and resistance sympathizers is identical to special forces functions using Montegards in Vietnam. Using Kurds to assist in death, pardon me, pacification objectives will certainly raise some interest in Turkey and Iran, especially Turkey. And cause some real excitement with both Sunni and Shia resistance, the Kurds already enjoying a somewhat well-known autonomous occupation status while quietly being told by the US that status will remain in place even after the elections to keep those oil fields from receiving undue attention. With that part of the world being an open book intelligence wise, word will get around real quick. We never seem to learn from our mistakes.",
