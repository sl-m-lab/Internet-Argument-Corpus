However, infinite truth is hardly something that can be derived, simply because the possibilities seem endless to a species with our intellectual capacity. \n \n I submit that the level of attainable knowledge in the universe is such that if a numerical value could be placed on it, that number would appear very large. With this you must look at man's ability to derive truths and make discoveries when it comes to the universe. This is the rate-limiting step that disables man for reaching that bound. So you see the amount of knowledge that our limited minds can compile or store will never achieve the amount of truth or knowledge that the universe holds. Even if our civilization did progress to a higher order species, the absolute value of the knowledge achievable would remain an asymptote. We could get closer and closer to that value without truly achieving it.",

   "\n Infinity! \n \n Would any of you like to tackle this subject?\n \n \n How many books do you want me to write?\n \n \n This subject can be either abstract or logical.

From physics to mathematics, I believe the concept of infinity is still worth discussing.\n \n \n Okay?\n \n \n Is the universe infinite in its bounds? How is infinity used to determine the area under a curve, or obtain values for volume and surface area?\n \n \n Actually, you don't need infinity to determine the area under a curve or obtain values for vlume and surface area. What you need is a metric and the metric induces a topology. You can then talk about length inside this topology and cross the space of the topology to get other topologies where area and volume are meaningful. You can have area and volume inside a topology of finite elements, so infinity is not needed at all! \n \n \n You see this is a general topic that can be looked at in many different aspects.

This would seem to indicate that an actual physical example of infinity could not exist. Then again, is the universe observable within the event horizon all that there is? Is it possible that some big bang event was just a localized event in a larger, infinite universe? We will never know because any observable evidence of such will always lie outside our range of observation.\n \n There are other infinities that could exist even within our finite field of observation. According to the Law of Inertia a body in motion will remain in motion until acted on by some external force. Theoretically a revolving body in space will revolve for eternity unless something acts to stop it. Such a body would make an infinite number of revolutions if it was never stopped.\n \n Mathematically infinity becomes an unusual subject because we can find infinity of different sizes. It's easy for many to imagine the number line going forever since you can always add one to any number you stop at. You can never reach the end. There is also an infinite number of infinite sets between any two numbers on that line. For any number n we can write n/(n+1), n/(n+2), n/(n+3) and so on to infinity. For n=1 we have: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ... For n=2: 2/3, 2/4, 2/5, 2/6, .... and so on. As n is incremented we can generate and infinite set of infinite sets between 0 and 1 and this will not even include any of the irrational numbers between 0 and 1 because of of the members of these sets will be the ratio of 2 integers.
