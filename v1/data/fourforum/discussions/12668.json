I feel bad for you because (going with your 3 reasons):\n \n 1)We are still in Iraq and are going to win afganistan at any cost\n 2) Run the risk of getting Sarah Palin thanks to Obama and Congress. \n 3) Obama has inspired false hope and your fears of not having the correct status is only going to get worse. I actually get some of those now because basically no one represents me and hasn't for 12+ years. A government shouldn't make you feel rejected...only a small government and stop this. As one example, you owe roughly $483,000 to the federal government (your family that is). That should make you feel more middle class for sure.

He basically argues that if you leave man to him or herself that you actually get back to a normal society in the long run. Haven't you noticed that the more government we have the more the income gap increases? Obama basically lied to you when he said the middle class would be treated better.
