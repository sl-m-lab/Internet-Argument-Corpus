   "Religion in the US is a constitutionaly protected class. The anti gay religious stand behind a constitutionally protected wall. The anti gay religions fight gay rights as a part of their religious convictions. Why do we gay people just declare ourselves to be a religion and step behind the constitutionally protected wall. All it takes is a constitution and all gay bars are the places of worship, and all gay people are members. We could worship the male form, or the dance. Gay sex could be part of our religious worship, and the gay karma sutra could be our holy book. The bar just hangs a copy of the gay church constitution on the wall and all the zoning restrictions go away. The anti gay religion would not dare challenge our religious freedom because to do so would be to challenge theirs.",
