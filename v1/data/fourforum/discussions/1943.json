There is but one reason for this-the Spanish cowered in fear after the terrorist bombings there, and their plea for mercy was manifested by the election of people who share their same lack of spine. Now, sit back and watch other democracies (including ours) have their elections influenced by the terrorists, and when it happens, remember to thank the Spanish",

They have shown that the will of the people bow to them if they cause enough destruction. This is exactly the wrong message to send the terrorists as it will only bring more terrorist acts.

   "if you see it as a US war vs terrorism, then sure\n.\n \n \n Al Queda, and Bin Ladens stated goal in the destruction of the united states. The Al Queda problem is a US problem, and is becoming a problem for those countries that support the US in our \"war on terror\".\n \n Look at who Al Queda has attacked. I don;t see france or Germany or Russia on their sh*$# list. This is because these countries are not supporting the US in our war. \n \n \nbut terrorism is a blight on mankind in general, and civilized men in particular. this has never been a war against arabs or islam. it is against the likes of bin laden who exploit the discontentment of arab disenfranchizement and pervert it with violence for violence and terror's sake.\n\n \n Did you C&P this directly form a Bush speech? The majority of the world is unaffected by terrorism. THe US didn't step up to combat this \"blight on mankind in general, and civilized men in particular\" until we were attacked on our own soil. Why should we expect other countries with no real stake in the game to do what we would not?\n \n \ni doubt the killing will stop in spain or europe because of spain's choices. if i were a terrorist i would be emboldened to do more acts, whether i am al qaeda or not. kill a few hundreds, change an election to get what you want. if it worked once, it will again. for al qaeda in particular the second lesson is divide and conquer.\n\n \n I would be willing to bet that Al Queda does not attack spain again. There would be no point. While the goal of terrorism is to terrorise, it is NOT to create random terror, nor is it \"violence for violence and terror's sake\". The terrorism we see is a focused set of attaqcks in an attempt to achieve a stated set of goals. Spain has effectively removed itself from the conflict. Further attacks by Al Queda would be pointless, and I seriously doubt they would waste the manpower and resources to carry them out.\n \n As far as the rest of europe, I think we can expect to see more attacks. Those who have alinged themselves with the US and entered themselves ito the game are goin to have to face the consequences of that decision. I am not saying they were wrong to side with the US, just that there will be consequences for their actions (as there are consequences for every action).\n \n \nbut everyone has a right to make mistakes.\n\n \n \n In this case, the mistake might have been for the government of spain to disregard such powerful anti-war sentiment in their country. Had they not supported the war and still been attacked, I think that spaniards would have rallied round their government rather than voting them out of office. Rulers in a democratic society are bound by the wishes of their constituency. For the government of Spain to support the US in Iraq despite the overwhelming public sentiment against such an action was WRONG. \n \n \n \nMy understanding is that the Spanish people were already 90% opposed to the war before this happened anyway. Of course this will have an impact on the voting there. \n \n \n The numbers I saw said 92%. We can use yours, though, makes no difference to me.\n \n \nSpain is not a country like the US. They don't have the same military might or resources. They deal with internal terrorism already and the fact that at least two parts of Spain want indepence. They are still healing from being under a dictator's foot for nearly half of the last century - socialism is about 180 from Franco as you can get. I am not surprised at all.\n\n \n \n Excellent point. I think that theri internal problems probably had a lot to do with their recent election. These are folks who have seen plenty of domestic terrorism, and I don't think they were keen to take a bigger bite out of the terroist pie.\n \n \nAnd I HATE - just HATE the idea that the rest of the world owes the US some sort of autimatic allegiance anyway. They don't have to jump on our band-wagon. It's their own people they need to be accountable to.\n\n \n This is something a lot of Americans have trouble accepting. To a large part of the world, America is not always considered the guys fighting for peace and justice and girl scout cookies and moms apple pie. The leaders of other democratic nations are slaves tot heir people, just like our elected leaders should be.

They also have more lax security tan Spain, and higher profile targets.\n\n not sure where you came from or going with this as a response to my quoted passage but hey, whatever. they pick spain because spain was an ally and was about to hold election. and because spain is relatively resurgent on the international stage, their resolve questionable. lichenstein is a nobody. germany had already lost resolve. (actually german security higher)\n \nYour ascertations do not stand up to evidetiary scrutiny.\n\n what scrutiny have you put forth?\n i countered your assertion the countries attacked were allies against iraq and you basically agreed.\n then i countered that spain was attack merely because they are an ally, not because their contribution to the war and you basically said the same now.\n better understand the words and not just use them indiscriminately.\n \nIt is inexcusably foolish to believe that those who would go to the ttime and trouble of attacking America and our allies do so for no reason. Do you honestly believe that the 9-11 hiackers got on those planes knowing they were going to die without any cause? Until we accept the fact that these people have a grievance with the untied states and our allies, we will continue to fight the war on terror, and continue to loose. You cannot fight a \"War on terror\" and win. The british proved this pretty suessfully in northern ireland. \n\n ofcourse they have reasons. never said otherwise.\n read history of revolutions and insurgencies. inevitably many who fought and risked their lives for the \"cause\" come to discover the \"cause\" not the same for those who lead and gain power as those who fought and died for them.\n \nIf morally bankrupt means believing that people must take responsibility for their actions and nations should put the welfare of their people first, then I wear that badge with honor.\n\n To me, morally bankrupt in this context would be more along the lines of closing your eyes to what is going on and instead blindly following the propoganda of your government without analysing it for yourself.[/quote]\n no, it is morally bankrupt to think that your innocence will protect those who seek power through violence, as your neighbor is taken away.\n it is perfectly reasonable to dissent. but to dissent while it is safe to do so, but not when your life, property, or liberty is at risk is morally bankrupt.\n \nYOu seem to have this misconception that I support the terrorists in their atacks. I do not. You seem to have a problem with assinging motives to other peoples statements. You also seem to have a major problem with anybody who has anything negative or critical to say of the American government. That, my friend, is fascism.\n\n being critical is not being a fascist. if so you too are a fascist.\n funny that you don't understand that. \n \nMerriam-Webster \n Main Entry: fas\u00b7cism \n Pronunciation: 'fa-\"shi-z&m also 'fa-\"si-\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Italian fascismo, from fascio bundle, fasces, group, from Latin fascis bundle & fasces fasces\n 1 often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition\n 2 : a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control <early instances of army fascism and brutality -- J. W. Aldridge<\n \n\n since i am neither the government of have forcibly suppressed your viewpoints how am i a fascist? emoticon_rolleyes\n \nI don't think any other country in the world has the problems with terrorism that the US has. Al Queda is the largest terrorist network ever, and their sole stated goal is to destroy the USA. IF we are defeated, the terrorists will more than likely go home and enoy living in the middle east wihtout western intervention. OF course, they will most likely overthrow the opressive regime in Saudi Arabia (you know, the one we have been propping up) and take back israel (that other criminal regime we have been propping up).\n \n YOu really believe there was nothing to incte the terrorists to attack te US? HAve you ever read a history book? HAve you ever taken a serious look at US foreign policy where it regards the middle east? Perhapse you should. Te terrorists are definatly in the wrong, but to claim their attacks were entirely unprovoked is crazy talk!\n \n You seem to think we can \"win\" the war on terror. How exactly does one go about combatting an enemy that is dispersed throughtout the entire world and operates cladestinely?\n\n terrorism is quite new to the US.\n giving in to them only empowers them, not bring peace.",

   "don't tell me you believe that bin laden is noble and fighting a just cause by targetting civillians instead of military/political targets?\n\n \n Bin Laden is not noble, but his cause is probably just. Do you remember when Clinton was running for pres and there was the big deal about the chinese giving campaign controbutions? People were up in arms because we didn't want a foreign country affecting th outcome of our elections. \n \n Compare that to American policy in the middle east.

The two are barely related. I am talking about hte \"War on terror\". The war in Iraq has only become a part of the war on terror insofar as it has become a symbol of sorts for the different extremist groups of US intervention in the middle east.\n \n \nofcourse they have reasons. never said otherwise.\n read history of revolutions and insurgencies. inevitably many who fought and risked their lives for the \"cause\" come to discover the \"cause\" not the same for those who lead and gain power as those who fought and died for them.\n\n \n So, you are sticking to your guns on this one? Bin Laden, who has hundreds of millions of dollars, is hiding in a cave in afghanistan, or a village in pakistan because of the great power that the terrorist attacks give him? If what he was after was simply power, he would be far better off having never left the middle east where with that kind of money you can pretty much do whatever you wish.\n \n \nno, it is morally bankrupt to think that your innocence will protect those who seek power through violence, as your neighbor is taken away.\n it is perfectly reasonable to dissent. but to dissent while it is safe to do so, but not when your life, property, or liberty is at risk is morally bankrupt.\n\n \n Power invariably comes from violence.

The terrorists do not want to take away your right to own a gun, or say what you want, or sit on your couch and munch on big macks that you picked up in your SUV whil you watch PPV prono. They couldn't care less. IF it was a question of figthing and dying in order to defend our way of life, perhapse I might see it differently. IF what we are fighting for is the right of the US to install and prop up oppressive regimes in the middle east to stabilise our oil supply so standard oil can net 1.7 billion dollars a year instead of just 850 million, I would have to say that you are more than welcome to fight and die for that one, I think I will pass.\n \n \n \nI bet you do! I personally feel that the rest of the world should kiss our feet. What would you say if the U.S. withheld all of the humanitarian aid we provide to all these other countries? We certainly have no obligation, right? We are accountable to our own people, right? Frankly they OWE us because of the aid we provide, if not for other reasons. \n \n \n Les look at where that foreign aid goes. The biggest recipient of US foreign aid is Israel. THey use that money to buy F-18s and hellfire missiles, which they use against civilians in the occupied territories. They also use part of that money in \"civil\" programs, where they buy things like bulldozers, which they use to bury American peace activists alive whent hey bulldoze peoples houses. THe rest, well, we don;t know where it goes, because they are not frthcoming about what exactly happens to it. We acn assume they used no small part of it in the development of their nuclear arsenal.\n \n Ok, maybe israel is a bad example. Maybe columbia would be better. IN columbia, ther are millions starving to death. OUr foreign aid there hads largly consisted of spraying huge portions of their cropland with defoliation agents. BAsically, sprayed 70% of their cropland with roundup. As an added bonus, the stuff we used also has a high incidence of cancer and birth defects. Foreign aid at its finest!\n \n Other places, we actaull DO provide food for the hungry and medicine for the sick. All we require for these services is gaurantees by the governments of these regions that US companies will recieve preferential treatment, even in regards to local companies.\n \n MOst places, when the cost of recieving US foreign aid is calculated by the population, they certainly feel they owe us something, but is usually isn't friendship. Do you really go to bed at night feeling smug because your tax dollas are being used to feed the hungry and clothe the naked all over the world as the result of totally unselfish US aid packages?\n \n \nAnd quite how was that?\n\n \n THis was in relation to \"The british proved this pretty suessfully in northern ireland\"\n \n TEll you what, answer your own question. Look up how long the Briitish fought terrorism in N Ireland. PAy special attention to the lengths to which they went to combat it. Then come back.\n \n Guess what, THEY NEVER WON. Both sides made some concessions and a cease fire was born. THe british were in a much better situation to combat their terrorists than the US is. The british would never have beaten the IRA, the israelis will never beat the palestenians, America will never defeat Al Queda. This is just the way terrorism is. TO beat them, first you have to find them, then you have to take them down, ythen you have to find their sucessors, and take them down, then THEIR succesors and take THEM down. The problem is, every time you make a martyr out of one, two more pop up to replace them, and each new generation is a little harder to find, a little harder to beat, because each generation learns a few tricks from the one before and then invents a few of their own.",

Our nation requires oil-we could have easily gone in in the '30's and taken over those dust bowl countries and taken their oil, but we chose to work with their governments to get the oil. IF we have interfered in democratic reforms it is out of fear of the people voting in even more radical governments. If you Liberals would let us get our own oil here in this country, we could let those people pour oil on their cereal LOL\n \n \nYou should definatly join the military as soon as possible, and maybe you will get your chance. I doubt you really mean that, though. People are alsways willing to die for their convictions until the time actually comes, then there is a bunch of backpedaling and whining and begging.\n\n \n Why would you assume that I am as spineless as you and others, ones that would beg and plead with the terrorists to leave us alone?\n \n \nWould it really be surrendering to those \"animals\" (you will have to expalin how you decide who are \"people\" and who are \"animals\") \n \n \n The terrorists are animals, sorry, I don't have the same compassion for them as you.\n \n \nLes look at where that foreign aid goes. The biggest recipient of US foreign aid is Israel. THey use that money to buy F-18s and hellfire missiles, which they use against civilians in the occupied territories. They also use part of that money in \"civil\" programs, where they buy things like bulldozers, which they use to bury American peace activists alive whent hey bulldoze peoples houses. THe rest, well, we don;t know where it goes, because they are not frthcoming about what exactly happens to it. We acn assume they used no small part of it in the development of their nuclear arsenal.\n\n \n I say let's give them more!!!!\n \n \nOther places, we actaull DO provide food for the hungry and medicine for the sick. All we require for these services is gaurantees by the governments of these regions that US companies will recieve preferential treatment, even in regards to local companies.\n\n \n Is that really so bad? Seems to me you think that we should just give everything to everybody and expect nothing in return\n \n \nTO beat them, first you have to find them, then you have to take them down, ythen you have to find their sucessors, and take them down, then THEIR succesors and take THEM down. The problem is, every time you make a martyr out of one, two more pop up to replace them, and each new generation is a little harder to find, a little harder to beat, because each generation learns a few tricks from the one before and then invents a few of their own\n\n \n HMMMMMMMMMM tactical nukes might work!!!

   "Well, you seem like a relatively intelligent person, do you really believe that ALL the terrorists want is for us to leave the Middle East alone? And by leaving it alone, are you inferring that our support of Israel is meddling? If so, tough s###. The reference to Hitler, at least by me, was in the context of him, at the beginning, just saying I want a piece of this and it was given him, then he wanted a piece of that, and it was given to him. After he got what he wanted from the appeasers, he tokk the rest by force. You honestly think that if we left the Middle East alone, that the terrorists will just go away? All Christians are infidels to them and as such we are supposed to convert to Islam or die (according to the radicals, who are, afterall, the terrorists)\n\n \n AH, so the analogy is based on a misconception of history then. I understand now. Although the \"appeasement\" theory in regards to Hitler is a nice little bit of revisionist history, in reality, we let hitler take neiboring countries to begin with because nobody though he could be beat. THe rest of the world had to wait until his military was spread thin before counter attacks were anything but suicidal. \n \n As far as muslims attacking and killing cristians for being infidels, it has never happened before, I fail to see why it is going to happen now. As far as I know, the only people to ever go to war based soley on religous idealogy are christians (rememebr the crusades?)/\n \n \n \n \nI have never said we are perfect, and 20/20 hindsight is clear, as things have turned out, there were some mistakes made. We do have national security issues and we ARE a world power-other world powers have done the same thing. Our nation requires oil-we could have easily gone in in the '30's and taken over those dust bowl countries and taken their oil, but we chose to work with their governments to get the oil. IF we have interfered in democratic reforms it is out of fear of the people voting in even more radical governments. If you Liberals would let us get our own oil here in this country, we could let those people pour oil on their cereal LOL\n\n \n Yes, hindsight is 20/20. It is not that hard to look at your actions as you commit them and see gross injustice. We are not talking little errors in foreign policy, we are talking a long term gross violation of our own alleged ideals in the name of corporate profits and continued access to cheap oil.\n \n AS far as taking them in the 30's, never would have happened. The NAzis couldn't do it during WWII. Ther is no way we were going to do it during the 30's. \n \n As far as interfering with democratic reforms, where did you get that impression? There has been a popular movement in many sections of the middle east since the 60's to remove religion from politics. In Saudi Arabia, after WWII they pushed really hard to get a government in that was free from religous intervention. The problem we see with real democracies in the middle east is that the we have to deal with a whole new set of folks. Right now we just have to deal with a few shieks who are motivated soley by self interest. IT is easy to deal with people who are motivated wholey by self interest, it is entirely different when you have to deal with a government that is also concerned with the welfare of the people.\n \n \n \nWhy would you assume that I am as spineless as you and others, ones that would beg and plead with the terrorists to leave us alone?\n\n \n I have done my service, buddy. How about you?\n \n \n \nThe terrorists are animals, sorry, I don't have the same compassion for them as you.\n\n \n So, at exactly what point do you become an animal? Easy question.\n \n \n \nIs that really so bad? Seems to me you think that we should just give everything to everybody and expect nothing in return\n\n \n No, but there is a differnce between expecting some return and imposing crippling economic requirements. THis policy has possibly made America more enemies than any other that we have. I know that many gun-ho type folks how many aenemies we make is irrelevant. This kind of thing tends to come back and bite you in the butt, though.\n \n \nHMMMMMMMMMM tactical nukes might work!!! LOL\n\n \n Good idea. We know there are some of them in Britian. Lets nuke them first. Then we can do France, GErmany, the Netherlands, Belguim and Saudi Arabia. After that, we can start isolating which parts of America we think they may be hiding out in, and we can nuke THEM. New York and LA both have fairly large Muslim populations. Of course, the terrorists could stop their attacks, since we would be destroying everything for them!",

I was unaware that they were ever that big a player in the \"War on terror\". AS far as their security being tighter, Spain spends over 85% of their law enforcement budget on counter terrorism programs due to their domestic terrorism problems. \n \n Germany is riddled with muslim extremist. part of the reason they did not want to the visibility (much like france) of war on terror and iraq.\n if Spain spent 85% if their law enforcement budget to fight terrorism (can you post a link?) then it is even worse that 311 happened without warning to the spaniards.\n \nThey were not just allies against IRaq, they were allies in the \"war on terror\"\n\n one of the central tenet of the war against terrorism is to minimize the damage inflicted by terrorist acts. the worse case scenario always involve wmd. any unstable nation producing wmd must be made accountable. there are two ways to do so, iraq and lybia. \n \nMAybe we need to make a distinction between the war in iraq and the war on terror. The two are barely related. I am talking about hte \"War on terror\". The war in Iraq has only become a part of the war on terror insofar as it has become a symbol of sorts for the different extremist groups of US intervention in the middle east.\n\n see above\n \nSo, you are sticking to your guns on this one? Bin Laden, who has hundreds of millions of dollars, is hiding in a cave in afghanistan, or a village in pakistan because of the great power that the terrorist attacks give him? If what he was after was simply power, he would be far better off having never left the middle east where with that kind of money you can pretty much do whatever you wish.\n\n naturally the common perception from the west is that money brings power. this is not universal. it must have been incredibly frustrating to have all that money and unable to enact policy changes in saudi. besides, if monetary power was sufficient, why did he ever take up terrorism?\n \nPower invariably comes from violence. The only power behind the laws of the united states is that they ca forcibly drag you off and stick you in a cell. THe very basis of democracy is that 51% of the people can beat the H#@$ out of 49%\n\n power is what he seeks, and inevitably violence will be the means. he seeks to be the ME government, or at least one of his creation and blessing.\n btw, a constitutional republic is the safeguard against the oppression of the majority in a democracy.\n \nBeing critical is not fascism. There is an excellent section on fascism in the book \"Political systems: A difinitive comparison of the worlds governments\". They have about 300 pages on fascism. IT is well worth the read.\n\n i find the charge of fascism abused most by the dissenters when their own dissent is in turn challenged. it usually comes out when reason and logic are wanting in the defense of their stance.\n \nHow would you suggest \"defeating\" them? The problem with fighteing terrorists and radicals seems to be that for every one you martyr, 2 more pop up in their place. WE kill bin Laden, we create 50 more Bin Ladens. The enemy is everywhere, in every country in the world, including interspersed with your own population. How exactly do you combat an organisation like this?\n\n 1. undermine their cause and co-opt their agenda. they want a better ME? make that happen, just not on their terms. they want a fundamentalist state, give them democracy.

The fact is most terror groups (al queda included) are not irrational lunatics. They have a stated goal, and they carry out terror attacks to try to produce an outcome. I understand why we would like to think that al queda is just a bunch of crazies, but sadly, they aren't. They are very intelligent and rational, and I think that is one of the reasons they are so dangerous.\n Anyway, again, if someone could post why they think that al queda wants to destroy america simply because we are not a nation of islamic fundamentalists, I would appreciate it. I have never quite understood why people believe this.\n\n \n yes and no.\n anyone who believes that killing hundreds of innocent civilians do not think as the rest of us. that does make them crazy relative to us, but not irrational perhaps. serial killers always have a reason to their madness, and can be meticulous in their plans. \n \n it is not that we are not islamic fundmentalist. it is that our culture is in contradistinction to their fundamentalist ways. the way we parade our women around un covered for instance, our increasingly secular ways. but this too isn't enough. it is also because our way of life spread in popularity and power while theirs seem besieged. it must be incredibly difficult to think that as they do that their way is better conceptually but losing ground rapidly in reality. western ways are insidious in all parts of the ME.",

America cringed??? Where do you suppose he got all those ittle chemical and biological nasties (HINT- his anthrax is the Ames strain, as in Aimes, Iowa). \n \n PArt of the reason Saddam believed he had \"permission\" to invade Kuwait was that he felt he was owed a little something by the US for fighting their war at a cost of billions of dollars.\n \n Read some of Kissingers books. Some of them cover the ME situation during regans presidency pretty well.\n \n \n \nkuwait and saudi arabia are not propped up by the US, no money go to their government, no US troops defend their sovereigns. if we stop buying oil from them the europeans and the japanese would continue to do so. (you do also realize that ME oil helped to end the cold war by keeping prices low to minimize russian oil profit, right?)\n\n \n Uh, the russians were selling oil cheaper than the ME up until their induction into OPEC. COnvincing them to join opec (and raise the price of their oil) was seen as vital for protecting the interests of US oil companies We don;t support really low oil prices, because US producers cannot produce oil as cheaply as it is done int he rest of the world. \n \n \nno, we actually are applying the same standard. we deal with the recognized and legitimate governments for any nation. we interact with them to maximize our benefit, and they do the same. we have not judged them due to cultural relativism. we have engaged them politically and at the same time has applied pressure for political changes. the alternative would have been to isolate and ignore them like say NK and iran. not particularly helpful either cases.\n\n \n Or, we could do what we do with OTHER dictatorial governments with histories of humanitarian abuse, which is to impose trade restrictions on them.\n \n \nbut this then raises another question. by whose standards should we judge whether a nation is fit to associate with? and if they don't meet the standards we placed should we ignore them? isolate them? seek to apply our standards to improve them? cultural imperialism? moral imperialism?\n\n \n See above.\n \n \ntheir goal is to destroy the west/US\n fracturing an alliance contributes to this goal. demonstrating power over a major western democracy contributes to this goal. the deaths are not the ends, just the means by which their power grow and is demonstrated.\n\n \n They want to force the US to quit meddling in middle eastern affairs, end of story. \n \n \n \nthe soviet union and china do not have problems with terrorism is because they are willing to fight in the same arena, to be ruthless in tracking themdown and killing them. recently the russian killed a chechen leader in qatar with a car bomb. yup, but they were messy about it and now the qatari are unhappy about it.\n we do not need to become a police state to combat terrorism. we need to keep our resolve and determination to fight terrorism.\n\n \n That is the only way to combat terrorism without \"resorting\" to compromise and re-examining your policies. Keeping ur resolve and determination doesn't do squat, unless you can find the terrorists and bring them down, or put measures in place to stop their attacks. The British were pretty harsh when dealing with the IRA, and it didn;t seem to be effective. I guess to really beat terrorism, I mean to end it without having to stand up and go \"Ok, we screwed up some\", the Russina policy is the only way to go. Again, are you willing to resort to this?\n \n \nNK has been implicated to exporting both nuclear and missile technology to states like lybia, iran, and pakistan. which way NK goes remain to be seen. but containment has not worked.\n\n \n NK HAS proven that if you can get your nukes operational before the US can get wind of it, you will not see abrams tanks rolling up your street.\n \n \ncivil or economic power does not always translate to political power. bin laden does not want power to buy the latest mercedes, he does not want people thrown in jail, he wants to dictate the future of the ME. he is not a champion of the arabs. why not spend his wealth to buy food, medicine, education?\n\n \n He wants the ME to be able to create its own destiny wihtou US interference. HE wants to protect their way of life.\n \n \n \nbecause someone agrees with the government that do not make them fascist. if they disagree with you it does not make them fascist. if they call you unpatriotic and report you to the authority, that makes them fascists\n.\n \n There is a difference between \"agreeing with\" and blind faith.\n \n \n1. we actually want to keep oil prices low, and this is in contradistinction to what kuwait and saudi arabia wants.\n 2. should we sponsor overthrow of these governments?\n 3. if we stop buying oil from them someone else would.\n 4. democracy in iraq has not even started yet.\n 5. why not the shiite? would it be wrong for christians to be the majority in the US government?\n\n \n 1.WE do not want to keep oil prices low. We want oil prices to be at a level that allows AMerican companies to compete on the international market.\n 2. IS this in relation to #1?\n 3. So, this makes it right?\n 4. NOpe, and it most likely won't. It will probably be something like \"democracy\" in afghanistan.\n 5. BEcause theya re fundamentalists.

Apparently the terrorists have figure this out (thus the bombings in Saudi and such).\n \n \nall individuals have the power to affect change in the world around them \n \n \n Thought this was worth quoting again.

How does an individual who lives in a society whewre they cannot vote, do not have the right of free speech, the right to bear arms, the right to assemble, or the right to a trial, have the power to change the world around them? HOw do you change yur government when publicly criticizing that govermewnt is likely to get you thrown in jail without a trial for the rest of your life (luckily, your life span in a Saudi jail can be expected to be pretty short).\n \n At that point, you are not a person, you have no more power to change the world around you than my dog does. As far as I know, my dog may think I am a tyranical dictator. I tell him when to pee, I decide when he eats, when he sleeps, when he sits. If he ever tries to \"change the world around him\" I will simply punish him and put him back in line. IF he ever had the audacity to actally BITE me, I would punish him so severely that he woudl never be tempted to do that again.\n \n As a free man with rights, you have the power to change the world around you.

There was an area in Iraq, some marshland where the people had lived for thousands of years. The French wanted to work there but did not want to be shot at, so they asked Hussein to get rid of them...and he did, draining the marshlands and destroying these peoples lives, probably killing many of them, all for the almighty buck.

And this is actually my point. US do not want to hand over the control of the ocupation of Iraq to the UN, the spanish public do not want to support the ocupation of Iraq unless it is controled by the UN (or rather the current Spanish goverment pledged not to support the ocupation unless it was controled by the UN). There is nothing wrong with wanting two different things, and there is nothing wrong with acting on your own interests. Therefor US refused to give up the control of the ocupation and spain withdrew their forces. The fact that you seem to blame the Spanish government for acting on the will of their public (and their pledges to their voters) sounds like you assume that countries should unconditonally act according to american interests..

However, you persistently put words in my mouth, make assumptions about my intentions, imply that I am a liar (and other slanderous ideas as to my chracter) and deny me the simple respect of acknowledging that I do my own thinking. You can't seem to see past your stereotype of liberals to see or hear a thing I am saying. All you seem to want is to preach to the choir and insult anyone who has a differing point of view. Consider our conversations over.\n \n - Leslie\n\n\n \n Well, I'm sure sorry to hear that. We all have stereotypes, none of us are above that. However, in looking over my post, save for the one comment about all Liberals supporting Clinton (although I believe this to be true), I only asked for proof of these examples of the abuse of the Patriot Act that you have heard. And since there ARE none, one can only assume that it's an issue that those opposed to Bush are repeating over and over again in an attempt to have people believe that it's the truth",
