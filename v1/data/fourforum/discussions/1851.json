The funny thing is people make grandiose claims of things the bible says, but most is just tradition or rationalizing. I believe in creation not magic. When you ask the creationist to propose an actual theory about anything they shudder because they realized they are making stuff up the whole time. Then they cop out and say it was magic and science is like and \"You want us to change our theory for what now?\". The novice creationist is stuck making their own theory because no creationist has the guts to make a real one.\n \n If you read the bible all of the qoutes from God (btw I love that El reference) are not subject to change nor error. The rest of the narratives from the people that penned the bible is full of the same holes you and I have when we write events from years ago. Where in the bible did it say humans will become smarter just beacuse they write down something God said? Most of these stories are not even writen by the people themselves such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, the list goes on. Also most of the early ones God never personally delievered. People \"working\" with God mostly added their two cents about something they knew about. Who was the people that made up this idea that the bible is flawless. God never even intend for there to be a \"bible\" until the christians started mailing each notes to see how each other was doing. God personaly dictated long law codes and prophecy.

Of course, since you remember events from last Wednesday and before, these memories were also created by an omnipotent god.\n \n The problem is that this view makes god a liar.
