   "OK I have been thinking about memes lately..\n So I would like to know what you guys think... For those of you who don't know what a meme is\n Here is a short description \n This also in my opinion relates somewhat to advertising. I can remember in some of my art classes trying to find those ads that you can clearly see images in lets say the ice for a drink ad... Do you remember this? They still do it today. Subliminal ads....\n Now that we have the internet, do you think that all the forwards and jokes, spam are a form of meme?\n If so, even as we click them off, what a powerful tool to put the \"virus\" in our minds...\n This is such a broad subject, I hope people will respond.\n I couldn't decide which forum to put this in because I also think that religion, gay topics and well just about anything could be related...\n If your not really familiar with this just do a google and read for a bit, there are many good sites that talk about it.\n I am not one for crazy theories but this one just might have some merit, advertising is a science to some degree and what we pick up on without even knowing will amaze you :)",

   "You&#8217;re exactly right, Anastasia. It has merit. And to be honest I think it works well, if &#8220;well&#8221; is a good choice of words.\n And I do remember the subliminal ads spoken of on the news, the ones with a soft drink and a bag of popcorn and the start of a movie and so on.\n Passing along that meme has been possible for as long as there have been humans on earth, I believe. I can&#8217;t say much about the advertising industry, but from a country &#8211; boy&#8217;s view I can.\n Folklore, not the fantastic variety, but the genuine, down-home brand, is one example. Despite the expanse between those old stories and modern science, the fact still remains that people&#8217;s ideas are guided by that one little meme &#8211; or that information passed from one person to another.\n You can link that, in the train of thought, to a virus that infects the body. Even though the symptoms are the same medically, personally (or individually) they could be different, depending on several factors, mainly the immune system. Ideas brought about through memetic design can also be different. For example: An owl that makes a screeching noise and that scares the pants off you should be called a Screech Owl, but it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s called a Barred Owl. The Screech Owl&#8217;s call is nowhere close to a screech, but is a low, soothing warble. So, why was it named so? Did that idea gain momentum to the point that later in years that is was so established that is was left alone? Who knows.\n The same could be said about foxfire in the riverbottoms and the coalition of it and swamp gas &#8211; how foxfire ignites the swamp gas and catches the bottoms afire. Of course we know better now and that foxfire is living organisms that cannot spark a flame.\n Bigfoot: Is he real? Of course he is to some. The idea that he exists is more intense now than it was twenty years ago &#8211; all due to that meme.\n How about superstitions? How much of that do we owe to cultural self-propagation?\n \n Good thread, Anastasia.",

   "There are so many examples, and this can go so many different ways, almost like mass media mind control....\n \n \n ...................................\n \n Car lovers recognize vehicles as faces \n \n NewScientist.com news service \n \n Men who are fanatical about cars identify vehicles using the same brain circuitry used to recognize faces, new research shows.\n \n Forty men, half of whom were proven automobile aficionados, were fitted with sensors to monitor electrophysiological activity in part of the brain linked with facial identification. They were then asked to identify faces and cars, individually and then together. \n \n The car lovers had greater difficulty in recognizing vehicles from isolated details, suggesting they recognize them \"holistically\". This method is normally associated with facial identification. \n \n The researchers, Isabel Gauthier of Vanderbilt University in Nashville and Tim Curran of the University of Colorado at Boulder, say their findings contradict the theory that at one part of the brain is used solely for facial recognition.\n \n Automobile aficionados also found it more difficult to identify an image consisting of parts of both faces and cars. The researchers say this \"traffic jam\" in the brain indicates that the same neural process is used to process both types of image.\n \n \n Extreme interest\n The monitoring of subject's brain activity showed that attempts to identify cars and faces simultaneously occurred at the same time. Both signals were recorded less than a fifth of a second after the image was seen, leading the researchers to conclude that they represent an early stage of image processing.\n \"This indicates that it is a basic perceptual process, not something that happens because auto experts attend to, or reason about, cars in a different way,\" Gauthier says. \"At least some of the same neural circuitry must be involved in identifying faces and other objects of extreme interest,\"\n Andy Calder, at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at Cambridge University, UK, agrees that the work indicates that the region of the brain used for facial recognition has a discernable effect on the recognition of other things. \n But he says alternative interpretations of the electrophysiological signals are possible. Even in the short time available, some suggest that the subjects' brains could be performing a more complex perceptual process, assigning a sociological meaning to the images seen. \n \n \n \n I don't think it's a stretch to see the hooks that advertisers can use to pull our strings regarding identifying with their \"inanimate\" products in \"animate\" ways. We can easily be made to develop actual love for this stuff we buy.",

   "I figured it would wind up here.\n \n I think most of the \"Christianity memes\" stems from manmade religion - especially through so-called miracles. (This might fit in unkerpaulie's thread)\n \n These \"Christians\" are so focused on miracles and the need for them that they would fall for anything. It's like the article said - the preacher that said God gave him his gold teeth - then when confronted about having them installed by a dentist a few years ago replied that he admitted a mistake, but that don't prove that God can't heal --- gimme a break! \n \n But those are the sheeple of the world, including \"Christianity Memes\". They can't know God or know His Word or feel His presence, but someone else has and that's enough for them.",

   "I thought I would bump this thread with some good definitions of memes..\n \n Glenn Grant: Meme (pron. meem): A contagious information pattern that replicates by parasitically infecting human minds and altering their behavior, causing them to propagate the pattern. (Term coined by Dawkins, by analogy with \"gene\".) Individual slogans, catch-phrases, melodies, icons, inventions, and fashions are typical memes. An idea or information pattern is not a meme until it causes someone to replicate it, to repeat it to someone else. All transmitted knowledge is memetic. \n \n Tony Lezard: Richard Dawkins, who coined the word in his book The Selfish Gene defines the meme as simply a unit of intellectual or cultural information that survives long enough to be recognized as such, and which can pass from mind to mind. There's not much of a sense of describing thought processes, but nor is it just a model. As Richard Dawkins writes (this is from memory), \"God indeed exists, if only as a pattern in brain structures replicated across the minds of billions of people throughout the world.\" (Of course the patterns aren't physically identical, but they represent the same thing.) \n \n Richard Dawkins: Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leading from body to body via sperm or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation. If a scientist hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to his colleagues and students. He mentions it in his articles and his lectures. If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain.\n Memes should be regarded as living structures, not just metaphorically but technically. When you plant a fertile meme in my mind, you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell. And this isn't just a way of talking -- the meme for, say, 'belief in life after death' is actually realized physically, millions of times over, as a structure in the nervous systems of people all over the world. \n H. Keith Henson: A meme survives in the world because people pass it on to other people, either vertically to the next generation, or horizontally to our fellows. This process is analogous to the way willow genes cause willow trees to spread them, or perhaps closer to the way cold viruses make us sneeze and spread them. \n \n Peter J. Vajk: It is important to note here that, in contrast to genes, memes are not encoded in any universal code within our brains or in human culture. The meme for vanishing point perspective in two-dimensional art, for example, which first appeared in the sixteenth century, can be encoded and transmitted in German, English or Chinese; it can be described in words, or in algebraic equations, or in line drawings. Nonetheless, in any of these forms, the meme can be transmitted, resulting in a certain recognizable element of realism which appears only in art works executed by artists infected with this meme.",
