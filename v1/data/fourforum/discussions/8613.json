Basically, the question is if it still applies when the guy is unarmed?\n\n \n Three: It provides that persons using force authorized by law shall not be prosecuted for using such force.\n \n Notice the \"authorized by law\" part. All states have a law regarding use of force and use of deadly force. In my state it says that I can use deadly force if I \"fear great bodily harm or injury to myself or another\". Basically the castle doctrine repeals the \"duty to retreat\" which can be very dangerous (i.e. person with a young child on the street confronted by someone with a knife). It does not give people the right to kill someone begging for money. \n \n With your situation, how would I know that peron is unarmed? They came into my house(?) without me knnowing and they have now seen me. If they are running away then by my state laws I cannot shoot or cause harm to them and I wouldn't. If I were to cause harm to a person running away, I could still be prosicuted for that sense there was no way I could have felt \"great bobily harm\". \n \n I hope this helped clear it up for you.",

In this situation, if the crook is running away after seeing you, then chances are they don't have a weapon or if they did, it was unloaded (providing it was a gun). But how I understand it, it also includes places like the park. I don't know, I just imagine there is a difference between someone who is a petty thief and a person who guns/knifes down people for something and then also someone who murders to murder. I would imagine a petty thief would not be as much of a threat if they saw you. But then again, I never had to worry about it.",

It includes anywhere that you have a legal right to be (any public property such as parks, sidewalks, roads and commertial property such as parking garages or stores). But even there, the \"force autherized by law\" still applies. You cannot say you were scared of the homeless guy that asked for money as a defense to you shooting him. However if the homeless guy is saying \"give me money or I'll kill you\" that would fall in line with the law. You do not know if the homeless man is armed or not and he just made a threat to kill you.",

Basically, the question is if it still applies when the guy is unarmed?\n\n \n How would the potential victim of an unarmed thief know the \"intent\" of that thief? If the thief did not threaten bodily harm or death, the victim would be less likely to comply with the thief's demands. Also, how would the victim be certain that the thief was not armed. People without scruples are often savvy of laws that reduce the penalty for crimes committed without the use of a weapon.
