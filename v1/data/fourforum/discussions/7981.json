   "In a recent publication of U.S. News and World Report, David Gergen wrote an editorial titled \"An Unfair Attack\". In the article he issues a rebuttal to an article written by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walttitles {\"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\"}. Gergen states the following: \"In essence, their 82-page piece argues that U.S. policy in the Middle East has been hijacked by a pro-Israel \"Lobby.\" \"The core of the Lobby,\" they say, \"is comprised of American Jews who make a significant effort in their daily lives to bend U.S. foreign policy so that it advances Israel's interests.\" As a result, \"the United States has a terrorism problem in good part because it is so closely allied with Israel.\" I agree with Mearsheimer and Walttitles.\n \n Back in 1948 when the Jewish state of Israel was created, the United States and Britain agreed to allow it to exist in its present place of location. Evidently no thought was given to the long term effects of creating such a state in the middle of so many Arab countries. It would have been wiser to use this land to create a place where all three major religions could visit to practice their faiths but not be allowed to reside their. The State of Israel should have been established anywhere but the Middle East. Consequently, the United States has obligated itself to support a so-called democratic Jewish state against potential threats from the Arab monarchial dictatorships. This has indeed opened the door to undue influence from the \"Jewish lobby\" not only on U.S. policy in the Middle East but also on domestic policy as well. Few could doubt the negative influence they have on the media and the entertainment industry. \n \n As for negative stereotypes, the Jews have been known to create their own. Everything from their materialistic money mongering to their history of being forcefully removed from so many countries. It always seems very ironic that the Jews continue to decry themselves as the only victims of a holocaust where in fact their own bible describes in detail how they massacred many nations and cultures. Some historians believe it was their investment money that helped sponsor the African slave trade. Even their own Talmud states that \"Jesus is in hell and is being punished by being boiled in semen.\" Still further, while the Jews advocate diversity in the United States, only those born into Jewish families may attain citizenship in Israel. Mearsheimer and Walttitles are right and therefore the United States should withdraw from its support of Israel. Perhaps then will the so-called chosen people wisen up and learn to get along peacefully with the rest of the world.",
