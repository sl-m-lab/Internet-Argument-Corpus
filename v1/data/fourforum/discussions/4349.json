   "Here is a quiz of different situations that one might consider abortion. Please take the time to think each over.\n \n How would you respond in these situations?\n \n 1. A preacher and his wife are very, very poor. They already have 14 kids. Now she finds out she's pregnant with the 15th. They are living in tremendous poverty. Considering their poverty and the excessive world population, would you consider recommending she get an abortion?\n \n 2. The father is sick with sniffles, the mother has TB. Of their four children, the first is blind, the second has died, the third is deaf, the fourth has TB. She finds she's pregnant again. Given this extreme situation, would you consider recommending abortion?\n \n 3. A white man raped a 13-year-old black girl and she is now pregnant. If you were her parents, would you consider recommending abortion?\n \n 4. A teenage girl is pregnant. She is not married. Her fiance is not the father of the baby, and her fiance is upset. Would you recommend abortion?\n \n If you answered yes to any or all of these situations:\n \n In the first case, you would have killed John wesley, one of the great evangelists in the 19th century.\n \n In the second case, you would have killed Beethoven.\n \n In the third case, you would have killed Ethel Waters, the great black gospel singer.\n \n In the fourth case, you would have declared the murder of Jesus Christ.\n \n God is the author of life, and He has given every single individual supreme value. Each life...whether inside or outside the womb, should therefore be valued by us. God knows the plans He has for each individual and has written in His book all the days ordained for us before one of them came to be. When we presume to know better than God who should be given life, we are putting ourselves in the place of God and are guilty of idolatry.\n \n Psalm 127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is His reward.\n \n This quiz was written by Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort.

A white man raped a 13-year-old black girl and she is now pregnant. If you were her parents, would you consider recommending abortion?\n \n Huh! If you think it's nice to force a 13-year-old to be pregnant I wonder about your moral standards!\n \n 4. A teenage girl is pregnant. She is not married.

Would you recommend abortion?\n \n Inasmuch as the myth involved with this little situation stated that both had been made aware by the Deity of what was going on, it's none of my business.

Science came back to Europe via the Crusades and the information that returning crusaders brought with them.\n \n You are so pitiably uninformed.\n\n \n Really?! Here's an excerpt from How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs  \n Author De Lacy O'Leary, D.D. \n \n \n\n Greek scientific thought had been in the world for a long time before it reached the Arabs, and during that period it had already spread abroad in various directions. So it is not surprising that it reached the Arabs by more than one route. It came first and in the plainest line through Christian Syriac writers, scholars, and scientists.  Then the Arabs applied themselves directly to the original Greek sources and learned over again all they had already learned, correcting and verifying earlier knowledge. Then there came a second channel of transmission indirectly through India, mathematical and astronomical work, all a good deal developed by Indian scholars, but certainly developed from material obtained from Alexandria in the first place. This material had passed to India by the sea route which connected Alexandria with north-west India. Then there was also another line of passage through India which seems to have had its beginnings in the Greek kingdom of Bactria, one of the Asiatic states founded by Alexander the Great, and a land route long kept open between the Greek world and Central Asia, especially with the city of Marw, and this perhaps connects with a Buddhist medium which at one time promoted intercourse between east and west, though Buddhism as a religion was withdrawing to the Far East when the Arabs reached Central Asia.

   "No, Sheri, I am merely saying that as decent human beings, which largely seems to be the characteristic trait of Atheists rather than Christians, we should make sure that absolutely no child in the world is without shelter, enough food, adequate medical care, safety from exploitation as well as access to decent education, before we force unwilling women to bear even more children who will suffer the fate of starving, being shelterless, unprotected from sexual and economic exploitation, no access to medical care and education--all these things that Atheists believe that all children should have--even though Christians have no problem with the abandonment of these children.\n\n \n Am I missing something here? You're claiming that all Atheists hold monolithic beliefs that are more moral than Christians? This thread is getting more absurd by the minute.

Kind of like a cancer surgery kills a non-sentient tumor that is already there.\n \n The only way the two have anything in common is that sex can lead to pregnancy.\nIrrelevant to this point, but while we are at the cause/effect thing, smoking can lead to lung cancer, driving can lead to head injuries, and eating burgers and drinking milkshakes while typing on the computer instead of exercising can lead to heart attacks.\n \n And for all such unwanted outcomes, we have medical treatments available for the unwanted outcome, including that of an unwanted pregnancy.\n \nSex itself is not what is wrong, it is killing the resulting fetus that is.\nNah, nothing wrong with that. And, BTW, most abortions end up killing an embryo, not a fetus.\n \nThis is why we have birth control. To prevent an egg from being fertilized in the first place.\nAnd when that fails, we have abortion to rectify that unwanted pregnancy, as is the case for more than half of all abortions.\n \n Nothing wrong with that because an egg alone is not what makes a human. Sperm alone is not what makes one either.\nAnd the zygote alone is not what makes one either.\n \nIts kind of like baking a cake. It takes ingredients. When your batter is made,\nAh, that would be like the zygote. Are you saying that the mixed ingredients are a cake? Or does it need to be done baking first (Yes, indeed. Just like we need the development through to birth). Yes good analogy. A human being, a baby is like a baked cake, once it is done and is born.\n \nthen all that has to be done is baking it.

A preacher and his wife are very, very poor. They already have 14 kids. Now she finds out she's pregnant with the 15th. They are living in tremendous poverty. Considering their poverty and the excessive world population, would you consider recommending she get an abortion?\n\n \n If he's a preacher and wife, then that just poses more questions. Does he have a pastoral following? (A flock, a church...) If so, are they not supportive?\n \n This question of yours is simply too vague.\n \n \n2. The father is sick with sniffles, the mother has TB. Of their four children, the first is blind, the second has died, the third is deaf, the fourth has TB. She finds she's pregnant again. Given this extreme situation, would you consider recommending abortion?\n\n \n First off, \"the sniffles\" doesn't exactly equal a life threatening situation. The TB the mother has does! There is a high risk of her infecting everyone else in the family or who comes in close contact with her without treatment. Also, if the second kid died, then you can't say there are four children...there are only three. One would wonder what living conditions this family is in as well we genetic background to have one deaf child and one blind. The kid with TB needs treatment as does the mother. Given your discription, I might recommend abortion until she can get a better grip on her life.\n \n \n \n3. A white man raped a 13-year-old black girl and she is now pregnant. If you were her parents, would you consider recommending abortion?\n\n \n Your usage of racial identifications in this example are only meant to confuse the issue. They are of little to no importance. \n A thirteen year old child should NEVER have to suffer with the burdon of an unwanted pregnancy, ESPECIALLY from a rape!\n Yes! If she and her family (being that she is under age and does not fully have the capacity to make these kinds of decisions) feel an abortion is their solution, then it's their desicion.\n \n \n \n4. A teenage girl is pregnant. She is not married. Her fiance is not the father of the baby, and her fiance is upset. Would you recommend abortion?\n\n \n She's a teenager? What is she doing being engaged in the first place? \n Honey, if she's so backwater as to be engaged as a teenager in this day and age and she is so irresponcible as to be sexually active with multiple partners...yes...abortion is recommended along with the option of adoption. But I really don't think she is ready to be a good parent.\n \n \n \nIf you answered yes to any or all of these situations:\n \n In the first case, you would have killed John wesley, one of the great evangelists in the 19th century.\n\n \n Well right there, you used an oxymoron, \"Great\" and \"Evangelist\" got together about as well as Military Inteligence.\n Secondly, as I stated before...you left too many other questions unanswered about the \"Preacher.\" \n \n \n \nIn the second case, you would have killed Beethoven.\n Again, misleading questions will give you subjective answers.\n \n \n \nIn the third case, you would have killed Ethel Waters, the great black gospel singer.\n\n \n Oh well. Life goes on.\n \n \nIn the fourth case, you would have declared the murder of Jesus Christ.\n\n \n Well first off, again, you asked a misleading question. Jesus didn't just happen in the last century, nor in the last decade. Besides, God Rapes an unmarried Jew and gets away with a violent crime?!?\n And people wonder why I'm such a skeptic.\n I've never bought the whole \"emaculate conception\" jazz to begin with.\n \n \n \nGod is the author of life, and He has given every single individual supreme value.

When we presume to know better than God who should be given life, we are putting ourselves in the place of God and are guilty of idolatry.\n\n \n Hmmm...there's a twist..Myself as God!! WOW!!! I never would have been so arrogant as to think so, but since you insist...COOL!!! \n \n \n \nPsalm 127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is His reward.\n\n \n Sweet sentiment, especially when there were only a few thousand bodies on the planet to begin with.

That would be like calling people that are for the death penalty pro-death. I believe that if it is harmful for the woman to have a baby or can't support it the best thing to do would be to have an abortion. But I don't want every mother to have an abortion. Anyway, their mothers all chose life after they were alive and could make their own decisions. Fetuses can not think at all, let alone chose life or death. They are not alive. anyway why do you kill bugs (I'm assuming you have swatted a fly in your life)? Aren't you pro-life? That fly you swatted is a life.",

I'm afraid I'm a true fence sitter when it comes to abortion. Every human, or every individual animal for that matter, is an individual because they have a unique genetic makeup. At the moment of conception, a new individual is created. The single-celled zygote is a human individual. It is a human life, if you will. It's not a particularly viable form of human life, but it is still an individual human. So abortion is truly the killing of a human individual. The reason I sit on the fence is because I cannot bring myself to consider this a murder. And, sadly, I can find no good dividing line to judge when the abortion is a murder and when it is not. I'm just glad I'm not a Supreme Court Justice. I wouldn't want to be forced to make that decision. \n \n I did pass a sign on a lightpost that said there have been 40 million abortions in America since 1973. That's amazing to me.

If you had bothered to notice, I have never had an abortion and have the son to prove it. Therefore I am not \"pro-abortion\" as a means of birth control. I'm an avid promoter of contraseption, but if a woman is raped, it's no one's business but her own. If a girl is impregnated by a family memeber/ie incest, it's her body not her families! If a woman who, for her own reasons has found herself in a situation where continuing a pregnancy would be detrimental to her own health, it's her decision...NOT anyone elses.\n Personally, I feel the Catholic Church is way out of line by banning any and all forms of contraseption/protection. I firmly believe in education and distribution of condoms anywhere men and women/boys and girls/ guys and gals, congregate publicly. I believe insurence companies should cover \"the pill\" in prescription coverages. (Not only for it's contraseption uses, but for it's hormone ballencing properties)\n \n I do not promote abortion as a catch-all form of birth control. \n \n So don't assume the two terms of \"pro-abortion\" and \"pro-choice\" are in anyway interchangable. They are not.\n \n \n BTW - As a MAN you don't get a say in what ANY woman does or does not do with HER body....YOU DO NOT OWN WOMEN! PERIOD, no \"if's\", \"and's\" or \"but's\" about it! ",
