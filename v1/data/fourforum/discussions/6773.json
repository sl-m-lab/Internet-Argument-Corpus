No one would resent the Dems standing up for what they believe in, or at least no one who doesn't dislike the Dems to start with. No, the real issue, to my mind, is what would the Dems gain by fillabustering? If it worked and Alito was blocked, can they really expect the next guy to be any better? Could they actually expect Bush to get the message and appoint someone more moderate? Given the average slope of Bush's learning curve, I'd say that's not a very good bet.

   "I got a few ideas to fix the judicial branch.\n \n 1) make all rulings anonomous (sp). This would help keep politics out of the confirmation hearings...this one could probably be worked on\n 2) make rulings a \"yes\" or \"no\" with maybe a paragraph stating which laws were used (using the exact law and not their own version of it). \n 3) Make issues of the constitution harder to judge on. For example you could have all matters that are a \"constitutional question\" be sent to all the circuit courts. There the judges decide and majority wins. You could extend this by saying majority of the circuit judges and 2/3rd (6 outta 9) of the Supreme Court to rule something unconstitutional (in other words to strike down the law).\n 4) Make it so suggestions can be made to congress to fix a problem. This is probably the best one. Lets say the judges rule that gay marriage is not in the constitution so any law that said gay marriage is illegal is not forbidden by the constitution. The judges can write a personal opinion on how congress needs to fix this problem because it seems to violate principals that our founding fathers had (or something like that). So Congress would have to address the issue and either say the laws are ok or that congress is going to make a law banning all laws about gay marriage (this could be modified to be a \"sub\" constitutional law maybe?? where 66 senators and 50% of house is needed to pass the law and president and thus becomes a jurisdiction of the federal government and becomes a federal law).\n \n These can obviously be improved but it would make a large leap into getting the \"power hungry\" people out of being judges and help so judges are all on the same page of the constitution without and \"political views\" getting in the way.",

I hate flag burning and I think people should go to jail for it...but it just happens to not be in the constitution and Scalia was right on this issue. There was a case one time that was about 18yr old womens being allowed to drink alcohol and the age for males was 21. The reason was that men drive drunk more often.

They HAVE to be. they are the foundation of your government. Every small change drastically changes the rules buy which we live. You cannot go around changing the rules haphazardly.\n \n The constitution is the sole document that provides for any government int eh united states. WIthout it, there is no government, no courts, and indeed no states. The constitution is a covenant between the people and the government. Chanign the constitution, or how we interpet it, changes that covenant, and no judge, no legislature, and no president ahs the right to do that. Only the people truly have the right to do it, and only by ammending the constitution.\n \n The problem with arguing whether an originalist or a living view of the constitution is correct is that there is little evidence for the originalist view, beyond the words of thomeas Jefferson, who warned that when interpeting the consittution we should try to divulge the original intent of those who drafted it, not try to rignt \"what meaning\" we may from the words. \n \n On the other hand, the \"living\" view fo the constitution has no foundation at all, other than people would like to change the constitution, or make certain provisions go away, but know damn well they cannot get the support to do it. There is certainly no evience from the time that anybody ever intende the constitution to be a \"living\" document. \n \n Additionally, the argument is illogical, since you are arguing for essnetially changing the constitution to suit the times, and the method for changing the constitution is VERY clearly laid out within the text of the document itself. Therefore, any attempt to change the meaning of the constitution without using those methods. This is unconstitutional.",

It isn't a technology-bounded Amendment.\n\n \n No, it should include all arms that fulfills its intended purpose. Nuclear weapons and weapons that do wholesale destruction will not level the playing field between citizens and an oppressive gov't. MAD does not apply in this situation, since you cannot oppress a crater and we have more problems than defense of our freedom if the Federal gov't is using these weapons on its own citizens.\n \n I guess I'm off-topic :-\\ I'm not entirely sure of Alito yet.",

   "I do hope that dear Mr. Alito will be able to respond in an honest fashion to certain conflict of interest issues:\n \n http://www.thejudiciary.org/\n \n \nSupreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr. said yesterday that he did nothing improper when he ruled in cases involving two financial firms in which he held accounts, although he had told the Senate 15 years ago that he would step aside in matters involving the companies.\n \n Alito, trying to quell conflict-of-interest issues raised by liberal opponents, said he had been \"unduly restrictive\" in promising in 1990 to recuse himself in cases involving Vanguard Group Inc. and Smith Barney Inc. After the Senate confirmed him as an appellate judge and when he subsequently ruled on routine cases involving the two companies, he said, he acted properly because his connections to the firms did not constitute a conflict of interest under the applicable rules and laws.\n \n Alito had at least $390,000 in Vanguard mutual funds when he ruled in a 2002 case that favored the company. After a party to the suit complained, he stepped aside and another panel of judges reheard the case. Alito also ruled in a 1996 case involving Smith Barney, which was his brokerage firm.\n \n The Supreme Court nominee's comments, made in a two-page letter to Senate Judiciary Committee members, differed from the White House's explanations of his actions. The White House said last month that a courthouse \"computer screening program\" had failed to alert Alito to step aside in the Vanguard case. Alito made no reference to computers in yesterday's letter. He said he went further than he needed to in 1990 when he promised to avoid ruling in cases involving Vanguard and Smith Barney.\n \n \"To the best of my knowledge, I have not ruled on a case for which I had a legal or ethical obligation to recuse myself during my 15 years on the federal bench,\" he wrote.\n \n Alito's letter added a second defense that the White House had not pressed earlier. The 1990 Senate questionnaire dealt with possible conflicts during his \"initial service\" on the appellate court, Alito noted. \"I respectfully submit that it was not inconsistent with my questionnaire response for me to participate in two isolated cases seven and thirteen years later,\" he wrote.\n \n . . . .Democrats said yesterday that they plan to ask Alito about his role as a judge in a 1995 case that involved a client of his sister's law firm. Rosemary Alito belonged to the New Jersey firm of McCarter & English LLP when it represented Midatlantic National Bank in a legal dispute with a borrower. After a three-judge panel, which did not include Samuel Alito, ruled against the borrower, the plaintiff appealed to the entire 3rd Circuit court. Alito was among the 15 judges listed as \"present\" in the court's denial of the request for a rehearing. . . .\nOr, are we going to have to pray that Sis doesn't have a case come forth before the Supreme Court if and when Alito sits on it?",

   "Admittedly, I am not entirely clear what a \"living constitution\" or \"originalist\" exactly mean but,from what I've gathered on this board, a living Constitution in this example would be the bank originally stating they would give you a \"reasonable rate\", never specifying what that rate was, then changing it later stating \"what was reasonable then is not reasonable now\". In the same way, there are new interpretations with terms that were not defined in the Constitution such as \"cruel and unusual\" that change meaning as society changes. Is this not the case\n\n no, A living constitution is where you rule that the death penanlty for minors is not unconstitutional and then 10 years later rule that it is unconstitutional but the other decision was correct for the time and thus they don't overturn it. They use \"evolving standards of decency\".",
