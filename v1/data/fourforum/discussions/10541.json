   "Are you looking to defend Al Gore or actually reduce your own emissions?\n \n \n A major difference between sulfur credits and carbon credits is in their availability. The sulfur credits are only available to refineries and can only be obtained from other refineries within their area. The carbon credits are available to everyone. You can buy them from Al Gore's firm. He encourages you to do so...along with asking you to ride a bike and wave to him as he flies over in his soot-spewing airplane.\n \n Gore's plan for reducing emissions is to buy enough credits to pollute as he wishes while claiming that he has effectively reduced pollution in some other part of the world and is therefore \"leading a carbon neutral life\". God forbid he should actually reduce his family's ability to pollute at will.\n \n ON SULFUR: (This program has a dealine of 2010.)\n http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYH/is_23_4/ai_68926622\n \n U.S. EPA finally made official what Diesel Fuel News first revealed earlier this month: Refiners will indeed have to make at least 80% of their mid-2006 highway diesel as a 15 ppm sulfur cap ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD).\n \n ....\n \n \n EPA says refiners/importers must produce at least 80% ULSD (called a \"temporary compliance option\" or TCO) in order to play in the highway diesel market, starting June 1, 2006, until the end of 2009. If they produce more than 80% ULSD, then they can sell sulfur credits to refiners who want to continue selling today's conventional 500 ppm sulfur diesel to old trucks (pre-2007 model year) that lack sulfur-sensitive catalysts and traps.\n \n Sulfur credits can be generated from June 2006 until Dec. 31, 2009, but can only be sold to another refinery (or transferred to an affiliated refinery) in the same PADD region. However, refiners in California, Alaska and Hawaii won't t be allowed to sell sulfur credits outside their own respective states.\n \n A refinery can produce less than 80% ULSD only if it gets offsetting sulfur credits from another refinery in the same PADD.\n \n \n \n * Early Sulfur Credits\n \n While all credit generation ceases at end2009, refiners with sufficient banked sulfur credits can use them up until May 31, 2010.\n \n Refiners can also bank extra credits for ULSD produced and sold between June 1, 2005 to June 1, 2006, in order to help cut sulfate emissions from any diesel engine.\n \n In addition, refiners can bank credits starting in 2001 \"if a refiner demonstrates that the fuel will be used in vehicles certified to meet the 2007 particulate matter standard (0.01 g/bhp-hr) or in vehicles with retrofit technologies that achieve emission levels equivalent to the 2007 NOx or PM standard verified as part of a retrofit program administered by EPA or a state,\" EPA says.\n \n \"Because there could be situations where a refinery planning to use credits to comply with the minimum percent of fuel required comes up short at the end of the year, we are adopting provisions that allow a limited amount [5% maximum] of carryover, or credit deficits,\" EPA says. \"However, the refinery will have to make up the credit deficit and come into compliance with the required [ULSD] production percentage in the next calendar year.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n ON CARBON: (This program is designed to make Al Gore rich. I think it has no deadline for compliance with any kind of standard. Maybe it does...but it is still a ridiculous system...paying so you can pollute and still call yourself working for clean air.)\n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54528\n \n \u00a9 2007 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n Al Gore's Nashville mansion (PajamasMedia.com)\n \n Al Gore defends his extraordinary personal energy usage by telling critics he maintains a \"carbon neutral\" lifestyle by buying \"carbon offsets,\" but the company that receives his payments turns out to be partly owned and chaired by the former vice president himself. \n Gore has built a \"green money-making machine capable of eventually generating billions of dollars for investors, including himself, but he set it up so that the average Joe can't afford to play on Gore's terms,\" writes blogger Dan Riehl. \n Gore has described the lifestyle he and his wife Tipper live as \"carbon neutral,\" meaning he tries to offset any energy usage, including plane flights and car trips, by \"purchasing verifiable reductions in CO2 elsewhere.\" \n But it turns out he pays for his extra-large carbon footprint through Generation Investment Management, a London-based company with offices in Washington, D.C., for which he serves as chairman. The company was established to take financial advantage of new technologies and solutions related to combating \"global warming,\" reports blogger Bill Hobbs. \n \n http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2007/03/al_gores_inconv.html\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-09-gore-green_x.htm\n \n http://www.suntimes.com/news/steyn/281949,CST-EDT-STEYN04.article\n \n How Gore's massive energy consumption saves the world \n \n March 4, 2007\n BY MARK STEYN Sun-Times Columnist\n Stop me if you've heard this before, but the other day the Rev. Al Gore declared that \"climate change\" was \"the most important moral, ethical, spiritual and political issue humankind has ever faced.'' Ever. I believe that was the same day it was revealed that George W. Bush's ranch in Texas is more environmentally friendly than the Gore mansion in Tennessee. According to the Nashville Electric Service, the Eco-Messiah's house uses 20 times more electricity than the average American home. The average household consumes 10,656 kilowatt-hours. In 2006, the Gores wolfed down nearly 221,000 kilowatt-hours. \n Two hundred twenty-one thousand kilowatt-hours? What's he doing in there? Clamping Tipper to the electrodes and zapping her across the rec room every night? No, no, don't worry. Al's massive energy consumption is due entirely to his concern about the way we're depleting the Earth's resources. When I say \"we,\" I don't mean Al, of course. I mean you -- yes, you, Earl Schlub, in the basement apartment at 29 Elm St. You're irresponsibly depleting the Earth's resources by using that electric washer when you could be down by the river with the native women beating your loin cloth dry on the rock while singing traditional village work chants all morning long. But up at the Gore mansion -- the Nashville Electric Service's own personal gold mine, the shining Cathedral of St. Al, Tennessee's very own Palace of Versal -- the Reverend Al is being far more environmentally responsible. As his spokesperson attempted to argue, his high energy usage derives from his brave calls for low energy usage. He's burning up all that electricity by sending out faxes every couple of minutes urging you to use less electricity.\n \n Also he buys -- and if you're a practicing Ecopalyptic please prostrate yourself before the Recycling Bin and make the sign of the HDPE -- Al buys \"carbon offsets,\" or \"carbon credits.\" Or, as his spokesperson Kalee Kreider put it (and, incidentally, speaking through a spokesperson is another way Al dramatically reduces his own emissions), the Gores \"also do the carbon emissions offset.\"\n \n They do the Carbon Emissions Offset? What is that -- a '60s dance craze? No, it's way hotter. I mean, cooler. All the movie stars are doing it. In fact, this year's Oscar goodie-bag that all the nominees get included a year's worth of carbon offsets. Totally free. So even the stars' offsets are offset. No wonder that, when they're off the set, they all do the offset. Look at Leonardo DiCaprio: He's loaded with 'em, and the chicks think he's totally eco-cool. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the boy with carbon offsets goes walking and when he passes each one he passes goes aaaiiieeeeeeeee!\n \n How do \"carbon offsets\" work? Well, let's say you're a former vice president and you want to reduce your \"carbon footprint,\" but the gorgeous go-go Gore gals are using the hair dryer every night. So you go to a carbon-credits firm and pay some money and they'll find a way of getting somebody on the other side of the planet to reduce his emissions and the net result will be \"carbon neutral.\" It's like in Henry VIII's day. He'd be planning a big ox roast and piling on the calories but he'd give a groat to a starving peasant to carry on starving for another day and the result would be calorie-neutral.\n \n So in the Reverend Al's case it doesn't matter that he's lit up like Times Square on V-E Day. Because he's paid for his extravagant emissions. He has a carbon-offset trader in an environmentally friendly carbon-credits office suite who buys \"carbon offsets\" for Al from, say, a terrorist mastermind in a cave in the Pakistani tribal lands who's dramatically reduced his energy usage mainly because every time he powers up his cell phone or laptop a light goes on in Washington and an unmanned drone starts heading his way. So, aside from a basic cable subscription to cheer himself up watching U.S. senators talking about \"exit strategies\" on CNN 24/7, the terrorist mastermind doesn't deplete a lot of resources. Which means Tipper can watch Al give a speech on a widescreen plasma TV, where Al looks almost as wide as in life, and she doesn't have to feel guilty because it all comes out . . . carbon-neutral!\n \n And, in fact, in the Reverend Al's case it's even better than that. Al buys his carbon offsets from Generation Investment Management LLP, which is \"an independent, private, owner-managed partnership established in 2004 and with offices in London and Washington, D.C.,\" that, for a fee, will invest your money in \"high-quality companies at attractive prices that will deliver superior long-term investment returns.\" Generation is a tax-exempt U.S. 501(c)3. And who's the chairman and founding partner? Al Gore.\n \n So Al can buy his carbon offsets from himself. Better yet, he can buy them with the money he gets from his long-time relationship with Occidental Petroleum. See how easy it is to be carbon-neutral? All you have do is own a gazillion stocks in Big Oil, start an eco-stockbroking firm to make eco-friendly investments, use a small portion of your oil company's profits to buy some tax-deductible carbon offsets from your own investment firm, and you too can save the planet while making money and leaving a carbon footprint roughly the size of Godzilla's at the start of the movie when they're all standing around in the little toe wondering what the strange depression in the landscape is.\n \n A couple of days before the Oscars, the Reverend Al gave a sell-out performance at the University of Toronto. \"From my perspective, it is a form of religion,\" said Bruce Crofts of the East Toronto Climate Action Group, who compared the former vice president to Jesus Christ, both men being (as the Globe And Mail put it) \"great leaders who stepped forward when called upon by circumstance.\" Unlike Christ, the Eco-Messiah cannot yet walk on water, but then, neither can the polar bears. However, only Al can survey the melting ice caps and turn water into whine. One lady unable to land a ticket frantically begged the university for an audience with His Goriness. As the National Post reported, \"Her daughter hadn't been able to sleep since seeing ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' She claimed that seeing Mr. Gore in person might make her daughter feel better.\" Well, it worked for Leonardo DiCaprio.\n \n Are eco-celebrities buying ridiculousness-emissions credits from exhausted run-of-the-mill celebrities like Paris, Britney and Anna Nicole? Ah, well. The Eco-Messiah sternly talks up the old Nazi comparisons: What we're facing is an \"ecological Holocaust, and \"the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the sound of glass shattering in Berlin.\" That 221,000 kilowatt-hours might suggest that, if this is the ecological Holocaust, Gore's pad is Auschwitz. But, as his spokesperson would no doubt argue, when you're faced with ecological Holocausts and ecological Kristallnachts, sometimes the only way to bring it to an end is with an ecological Hiroshima. The Gore electric bill is the eco-atom bomb: You have to light up the world in order to save it.\n \n \u00a9Mark Steyn 2007",

   "http://newsbusters.org/node/10989\n \n Global Warming Solution Known as 'Carbon Credits' Collapses\n By Noel Sheppard | February 22, 2007 - 11:44 ET \n One of the primary solutions for climate change being touted by global warming alarmists is the purchase and sale of carbon credits. Put simply, companies, countries, and individuals could balance their CO2 output by purchasing credits from others that are emitting less greenhouse gases than prescribed maximums. \n \n The concept is that this would give companies, countries, and individuals a financial incentive to produce less CO2. Readers might recall that during a debate on \"Hannity's America\" this past Sunday evening, the two liberal guests firmly avowed that there wasn't anything wrong with Al Gore's use of private planes because he was offsetting his massive emission of CO2 with purchases of carbon credits. \n \n Unfortunately, there's a hitch in this scheme that threatens to totally derail it: carbon prices are plummeting due to an excess supply. I realize this might be a bit complex, but an article published in Green Business News wonderfully detailed the problems inherent in this scheme (emphasis mine throughout): \n \n Story Continues Below Ad &#8595;\n \n A leading economist this week warned that the world's two leading carbon trading schemes are failing to deliver the expected benefits due to a collapse in the price of carbon credits - and the situation is likely to get far worse before it gets better.\n \n Many politicians have identified carbon emissions trading schemes as the best means of tackling climate change, arguing that by putting a price on carbon emissions firms have a financial incentive to reduce their carbon footprint. \n \n However, speaking to an audience of academics and business leaders at this week's Tyndall Centre conference on investments in low carbon technologies, Professor Catrinus Jepma of the University of Amsterdam warned that both the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme and the UN's Clean Development Mechanism were in danger of failing with prices for the carbon credits used under both schemes predicted to reach just a few cents.\n \n \n Stick with this, folks, because the entire concept of carbon credits could totally implode:\n \n \"The Stern Report suggests we need a price for a tonne of carbon emissions of $20, rising to $30, $40 or even $50 to stabilise [the level of CO2 in the atmosphere] at manageable levels,\" he said. \"But there is a good chance that the carbon credits that are meant to provide incentives for reducing emissions will be available for next to nothing.\"\n \n \n How delicious. The article marvelously continued:\n \n The problems with the European Trading Scheme are well documented with the collapse in the price of a tonne of carbon dating back to May last year when it emerged that most countries in the scheme had set their carbon caps far too high, resulting in fewer firms than expected having to buy credits and causing the price of a tonne of carbon to plummet from over \u008030 to less than \u008010.\n \n \n Everybody still with me? Good:\n \n As one delegate observed \"with some firms having carbon emissions capped at 110 percent of what they actually required it was always going to fail\".\n \n The EU is seeking to rectify the problem ahead of the second phase of the scheme, which starts next year, and recently rejected many member countries proposed emission allowances for the next phase as too high, ordering them to go away and come back with lower caps that will force more firms to cut emissions or buy credits. \n \n However, Jepma argued that with no link existing between the first and second phase of the scheme the cost of carbon credits will drop to almost nothing by the end of the year. Currently the price is already below one euro meaning there is little incentive for firms to cut emissions as it is cheaper to just buy in credits to offset their pollution.\n \n \n The net effect here, folks, is that all incentive to cut emissions completely disappears if there is no value to these credits. The article continued:\n \n He also warned that something similar was in danger of happening with the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which is designed to allow signatories to the agreement to meet their carbon emission reduction targets by buying in Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) or carbon credits from CDM-approved carbon reduction projects in the developing world. \n \n Jepma said the scheme was in danger of becoming a victim of its own success with over 500 projects already approved by CDM and a further 1,000 projects in the pipeline awaiting approval. He predicted that as a result over 2.4bn CERs will be available by 2012.\n \n Meanwhile, Jepma warned that Russia and many of the Central European States are on track to be well below their Kyoto emission targets for 2012 meaning they will generate 2.8bn credits or Assigned Amount Units that they can sell to those countries unable to meet their Kyoto obligations. \n \n This means that there will be a supply of 5.2bn tonnes worth of assorted carbon credits available under the various Kyoto carbon trading mechanisms by 2012, but the biggest polluters in the scheme - the EU, Canada and Japan - are expected to exceed their targets by just 3.6bn tonnes.\n \n \"Under the Kyoto targets the supply of credits will outstrip the demand,\" said Jepma. \"We are going to see the same scenario as with the ETS whereby the price for a tonne of carbon starts high and then collapses to close to zero by the end of the scheme... which is precisely the wrong message.\"\n \n \n And here's the payoff, folks:\n \n He added that such a scenario would not only remove the financial incentive for countries to invest in clean technologies that help them stick to their emissions targets - as it would be cheaper to continue polluting and just buy credits - but it would also discourage investment in carbon reduction projects in developing countries as they would have to pay for CDM approval only to find they could not get a good price for the carbon credits they generate. \n \n \n As liberals and the media carp and whine about America's lack of involvement in Kyoto, they completely ignore all the inherent flaws. As a result, it seems that the Senate in 1997 was quite wise to recommend - in a 95 to 0 vote - that the Clinton administration not participate in this farce.\n \n Of course, this is a fact that all in the media have completely forgotten as they blame America's lack of involvement in these protocols on George W. Bush. \n \n Regardless, don't expect to see any of this reported by major American media outlets. After all, we certainly wouldn't want the public to know how this whole scheme is failing in Europe.\n \n -Noel Sheppard is an economist, business owner, and Associate Editor of NewsBusters.",

   "It might well be, but even if it is, it's only 1% of all greenhouse gasses.\n\n \n Alright, but we know that small changes in certain parts of the environment can have drastic effects. For instance, removing a keystone predator even though they are small in number can turn a ecological system upside down. A\n \n \nCombine that with the fact that of that 1%, humans are only responsible for a fraction of it and it's easy to see that human CO2 emissions are not in any way relevant to the big picture.\n\n \n You're assuming that a small change doesn't effect in a material way. Is there evidence of this? We know that giant super volcanic eruptions which released comparatively tiny amounts of ash managed to cool the Earth in the past by several degrees for several months. That was a tiny fraction yet resulted in a serious outcome. \n \n \nYou mean 'massive' climate change like during the Medieval Warm Period when it was much warmer than it is now and when Venice and Holland didn't get flooded and when the polar bears still survived? You mean that kind of 'massive'?\n\n \n Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't that period largely regionalized? The entire world didn't go through that. Furthermore, the populations of the polar bears were significently higher and did not have to compete with humans for food. Furthermore Venice didn't have those additional hundreds of years of sinkage.\n \n \nBecause \n \n a) the amount of sulfur that we humans put into the atmosphere was pretty sizable compared to the natural sulfur output\n \n b) sulfur was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be harmful in the quantities that human put out, same same cannot be said about CO2, neither in terms of volume or the effect itself.\n\n \n Cannot be said? Or because we don't have the data to prove it? It appears you may be jumping the gun. \n \n IMO, by the time we figure out what is causing it, we won't be able to change it (if it can be changed at all), thus we need to prepare for a future that is far warmer. \n \n \nWhat really irks me is that because of the foolishness of some easily swayed and conned individuals the focus of environmental protection has been derailed from the really important issues to a non-existent threat.\n\n \n How is global warming not a threat? \n \n \nMost of the major rivers in the world like the Ganges and the Yangtze have turned into industrial sludge. \n Deforestation is continuing on a massive scale, resulting in erosion on a massive scale.\n We're turning food sources like corn into fuel for our SUV's .\n But do we focus on that? Of course not, we focus on a harmless gas that's one of the building blocks of life.\n\n \n You are clearly overstating parts of the problem and understating. Do you really believe that changing the proportions of C02 which does trap heat won't do anything? Ice cores show that times of much higher temperatures correspond to much higher concentrations of C02 in the atmosphere.

Huge sectors in the US are building energy efficient products. What are you talking about? \n \n \nLet's face it, if CO2 was really the grave threat that Al Gore says it is, he wouldn't be flying around in a private jet and he wouldn't be using enough energy for his home to light up the Eiffel Tower.\n\n \n Hardly.

Furthermore, the populations of the polar bears were significently higher and did not have to compete with humans for food.

BTW have you ever seen pictures of drowned polar bears, because I haven't. From what I've heard, there has only been one instance that people have found drowned polar bears. Apparently 4 of them drowned during a storm and that's it.

   "This is why the carbon credit system doesn't work like the sulfur credit system.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.newsbusters.org/node/12314\n Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit' Fraud?\n By Noel Sheppard | April 25, 2007 - 22:54 ET \n It's conceivable that years from now, America's media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history: the idea that a wealthy person, for instance, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore, can purchase \"carbon credits\" to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote \"carbon neutral.\"\n \n Given the media's love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria, few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is.\n \n However, on Wednesday, an impeccably reputable publication, the Financial Times, published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore, Laurie David, Sheryl Crow, and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever (emphasis added throughout):\n \n Story Continues Below Ad &#8595;\n Companies and individuals rushing to go green have been spending millions on \"carbon credit\" projects that yield few if any environmental benefits.\n \n A Financial Times investigation has uncovered widespread failings in the new markets for greenhouse gases, suggesting some organisations are paying for emissions reductions that do not take place.\n \n Others are meanwhile making big profits from carbon trading for very small expenditure and in some cases for clean-ups that they would have made anyway.\n \n \n http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/48e334ce-f355-11db-9845-000b5df10621.html\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/business/05online.html\n \n \n By DAN MITCHELL\n Published: May 5, 2007\n Correction Appended\n \n CARBON credits are advertised as a way for polluters to offset the greenhouse gases they produce. Just write a check, and someone else will reduce his emissions, so you can keep driving your Hummer or operating your coal-burning power plant without guilt. \n \n \n \n Worse, reports of fraud and abuse are piling up. Most recently, an investigation by The Financial Times found that companies and individuals \"rushing to go green have been spending millions on 'carbon credit' projects that yield few if any environmental benefits\" (ft.com).\n \n The newspaper's environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, wrote of \"widespread failings in the new markets for greenhouse gases, suggesting some organizations are paying for emissions reductions that do not take place.\" In other cases, organizations profit by selling credits for environmental projects they would have undertaken anyway. \n \n Francis Sullivan, the environment adviser for the banking giant HSBC, said: \"The police, the fraud squad and trading standards need to be looking into this. Otherwise people will lose faith in it.\"\n \n Besides 16 articles examining just about every aspect of carbon trading and its problems, the package also includes an interactive graphic detailing carbon-reduction projects around the world, an online chat with Ms. Harvey, a video interview with her and a guide to navigating the world of carbon credits.\n \n Some bloggers who oppose initiatives to reduce carbon emissions piled on, most of them making sure to mention Al Gore, whom The Financial Times does not even mention. Upon reading the newspaper series, Noel Sheppard of NewsBusters wondered, \"Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit' Fraud?\" (newsbusters.org). \n \n Bryan Preston of the Hot Air blog, run by Michelle Malkin, characterized the investigation as proving that carbon credits are \"nothing but a scam\" (hotair.com).\n \n The series says no such thing, but Ms. Harvey does caution that if you are going to buy carbon credits, \"you have to do lots of homework first.\"\n \n \n \n http://rgcombs.blog-city.com/cashing_in_on_carbon_credit_scam.htm\n Cashing in on carbon credit scam\n << H E >> email\n posted Thursday, 15 March 2007\n It's long been obvious to me that the environmental fear-mongers are chiefly interested in power - their solution to every perceived problem, whether it's overpopulation, pollution, cooling, warming, or whatever, is always less freedom and more government compulsion. And it's been equally clear that many of them are hypocrites, lecturing us for not being green enough while they live in humongous mansions and jet to their second and third homes in their private Gulfstreams. \n \n It turns out that some of them are also greedy money-grubbers using climate-change hysteria to enrich themselves (emphasis added):\n \n The two cherub like choirboys singing loudest in the Holier Than Thou Global Warming Cathedral are Maurice Strong and Al Gore.\n \n This duo has done more than anyone else to advance the alarmism of man-made global warming.\n \n With little media monitoring, both Strong and Gore are cashing in on the lucrative cottage industry known as man-made global warming.\n \n Strong is on the board of directors of the Chicago Climate Exchange, Wikipedia-described as \"the world's first and North America's only legally binding greenhouse gas emission registry reduction system for emission sources and offset projects in North America and Brazil.\"\n \n Gore buys his carbon off-sets from himself--the Generation Investment Management LLP, \"an independent, private, owner-managed partnership established in 2004 with offices in London and Washington, D.C.\" of which he is both chairman and founding partner.\n \n There's a fine compendium of information about Gore, Knight, and the GIM carbon credit scam at The Global Warming Hoax. Interest in Gore's carbon credit firm grew after the Tennessee Center for Policy Research discovered that Gore's 10,000-square-foot mansion near Nashville used $30,000 worth of electricity and natural gas in 2006.\n \n \n http://risingtide.org.uk/resources/factsheets/carbontrading\n The case against carbon trading\n CARBON TRADING IS CONTRARY TO SOCIAL JUSTICE\n THE LARGEST RESOURCE GRAB IN HISTORY\n You can't trade in something unless you own it. When governments and companies \"trade\" in carbon, they establish de facto property rights over the atmosphere; a commonly held global commons. At no point have these atmospheric property rights been discussed or negotiated - their ownership is established by stealth with every carbon trade.\n \n THE CARBON TRADE WILL STRENGTHEN EXISTING INEQUALITIES\n Market shares in the new carbon market will be allocated on the basis of who is already the largest polluter and who is fastest to exploit the market. The new \"carbocrats\" will therefore be the global oil, chemical, and car corporations, and the richest nations; the very groups that created the problem of climate change in the first place. What is more, with the current absence of \"supplementarity\", the richest nations and corporations will be able to further increase their global share of emissions by outbidding poorer interests for carbon credits.\n \n THE CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM POSES A DIRECT THREAT TO VULNERABLE PEOPLES\n Many of the projects proposed within the CDM, in particular tree planting and dams, are subject to the same criticisms as other large scale development projects- they assert foreign ownership of local resources, they consolidate the power of undemocratic elites, they oust people from their land, they undermine local self sufficient economies and low carbon cultures.\n \n MANY OF THE SOURCES OF CARBON CREDITS ARE SCAMS\n TREE PLANTING IS NOT A SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n Carbon absorbed by forests is only removed from the carbon cycle for as long as the tree is standing and alive. Industrial forestry will not sequester carbon. Permanent reforestation is a once only removal of carbon from the cycle and cannot offset sustained overproduction.\n \n CARBON TRADING ENCOURAGES COMPANIES TO PROFIT FROM EFFICIENCIES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED ANYWAY\n Because we cannot know the future, we can have no certainty that any project selling carbon credits has really reduced its emissions further than it would have done without the intervention. Profit competition and technical innovation ensures that industry consistently reduces its energy costs. A carbon market can provide an automatic cash subsidy for any investment in low energy technology. If such incentives exist they should be explicit, targeted and accountable.\n \n \"HOT AIR\" TRADING IS AN ACCOUNTING FRAUD\n Russia's economic collapse since 1990 has reduced its emissions by 30%. Russia is intending to sell this incidental windfall (often call \"hot air\") as international carbon credits- potentially swamping the market. If countries subsidise their emissions with these Russian credits, the final global emissions will end up being exactly the same as they would have been without a carbon market or a Kyoto protocol.\n \n HUGE INCENTIVES FOR CHEATING\n There are strong incentives for cheating and creating bogus credits that do not represent any real reduction in emissions. The vendor gets the cash without having to change anything and the buyer gets cheap credits. There are similar incentives for misdeclaration, and \"leakage\"- transferring polluting activities to areas that are not accounted.\n \n CARBON TRADING CANNOT WORK\n THE CARBON MARKET CANNOT BE MONITORED OR CONTROLLED\n The temptation for all parties to cheat requires that every transaction to be scrutinised and every sale to be certified. There is no global institution or accounting system that can manage the complexity of this market.\n \n THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK WILL NEVER BE STRONG ENOUGH\n International legal frameworks are usually very weak. Countries that want to use carbon credits to subsidise their emissions are already arguing for penalties so weak that they will not discourage cheating. Many of the Annex 1 (Russia, Turkey, Ukraine), Romania- these are some of the most corrupt and lawless countries are corrupt or desperate for foreign currency and will happily endorse doctored carbon credits.\n \n CO2 IS NOT SO2\n The main model for carbon trading is Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) emissions trading under the US 1990 Clean Air Act. This programme faced none of the problems listed above- it was small (a few hundred companies), easy to monitor (one pollutant from one source-power generation), had permanent targets, and, above all, was conducted within one country with strong enforcement mechanisms.\n \n CO2 IS NOT CFC\n The only international emissions trading has been in CFCs under the Montreal Protocol. Once again, the programme was small (only 17 producer companies), easy to monitor (one pollutant from one industrial process), and within a strong legal framework.\n \n CARBON CREDITS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES ARE NOT EQUIVALENT\n The market assumes that carbon credits from different sources will be fully interchangeable (\"fungible\" in carbospeak). However, carbon sequestered in sinks is a completely different product from the carbon \"saved\" by a technical innovation, which is different again from the carbon \"saved\" by a social or lifestyle change. Add to this the complexity of trading in different greenhouse gases. Each source requires different monitoring rules, different criteria and different agencies. Forcing them to be interchangeable in one market is a recipe for corruption and fraud.\n \n THE REAL REASONS FOR CARBON TRADING\n Supporters of carbon trading will argue that these are not problems- they are challenges. \"Just because it is hard, does not mean that we should not take action\", they say. Let's be clear that carbon trading is not being supported because it will solve climate change. In fact it will undermine even the pathetic emissions reductions already proposed. The real reasons for carbon trading are:\n \n 1. Governments want to be assured of a cheap way to buy off their failure to meet their Kyoto targets which will keep public and corporations quiescent.\n 2. Brokers, accountants, and financial institutions are extremely excited at the thought of the size of their cut in a new $2.3 trillion speculative market.\n 3. Corporations and other major polluters want pliant governments who don't punish them for their emissions and hand over public money to pay for any emissions they are forced to make.\n 4. Oil companies support carbon trading as a way to avoid making any cuts in oil production.\n 5. Academics and financial consultants see rich pickings from becoming \"experts\" in the new market.\n \n CARBON TRADING WILL NOT SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE\n THE KYOTO PROTOCOL HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY CARBON TRADERS\n Corporations, the finance industry, and their government supporters demanded the insertion of carbon trading throughout the Kyoto Protocol as a condition for their continued support for the process. The intergovernmental negotiations are now concerned almost entirely with the structure and management of this vast international carbon trading regime.\n \n CARBON TRADING IS AN EXCUSE TO AVOID REAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS\n The hopelessly compromised Kyoto Protocol now allows countries to meet all their emissions reductions with carbon credits bought through three forms of carbon trading; Joint Implementation, Clean Development Mechanism, International Emissions Trade. Some countries will certainly choose to buy credits rather than make any serious attempt to reduce their underlying dependency on fossil fuels.\n \n THE REAL SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE UNDERMINED BY CARBON TRADING\n \u0095 Educate the public on the urgency of climate change and the need for dramatic solutions\n Carbon trading is a false solution and undermines individual responsibility\n \n \u0095 Set a schedule for cutting global fossil fuel consumption by up to 60%.\n Carbon Trading is an excuse for avoiding any significant net cuts\n \n \u0095 Recognise the moral (and political) imperative for fairness and social justice by allocating targets to every country on the basis of equal per capita emissions\n Carbon Trading institutionalises existing inequalities and rewards the largest polluters\n \n \u0095 Reduce the supply of fossil fuels with an international ban on all new oil, gas and coal development. As a first step, cut the $200 billion per year global subsidies for coal and oil power.\n Carbon trading is not concerned with the supply of fossil fuels, which is why oil companies support it. As a result, government subsidies are increasing, reducing the price of energy and swamping any attempts at demand management.\n \n \u0095 Invest heavily in renewable energy to replace all fossil fuel supplies\n Although Carbon Trading promotes itself as funding renewables, this is far more expensive per ton of carbon than credits from bogus \"hot air\", tree planting, or outright fraud. These cheap carbon credits will set the market price and soak up the capital.\n \n \u0095 Involve people at all levels of society in solutions\n Carbon trading is an inherently elitist, corporatist, technocratic solution. It provides no role for civil society, and fails to deal with the 50% of emissions from houses and personal transport.\n \n RisingTide UK March 2002",

If you want to follow in algores footsteps as a poster child for good environmentalism then take that Forest of yours which I'll assume is full of 100 year old Pine Trees, sell them to the nearest lumber harvester who will sell them to the nearest Paper Mill. Then put an ad out there that you're selling your own Carbon Offset Credits. After calling algores company first and finding out what air is worth today. \n \n So you can sell the lumber every twenty years because a new Pine harvest grows fast and then you can renew the carbon credits you sold every year in between the new harvests thereby making a solid annual income from your land and still play your part in helping to save the environment.",

Some of the tops and culls would go to the pulp mill but there would be a lot of good saw logs...now we are talking money! \n \n I'm for working farms/tree farms not nature museums that whitewash the realities of land ownership. Most of those trees would be harvested for considerable profit (for folks who purchased land before prices skyrocketed) or perhaps held to wait for better market conditions (the downside of holding is the risk of losing all to storms, fire or disease).\n \n I don't believe that there is currently a real market for these carbon offsets without government support. \n \n For those of you who feel like the next administration will force carbon offsets down your throat I recommend buying land, planting trees and enjoying your investment. \n \n For those of you who support carbon offset programs, what support will be provided to the private landowner? Have you purchased carbon offsets? If yes, did you purchase from some company promising to plant trees in Brazil or some other overseas location? If no, are you waiting for the government to develop a program?\n \n If someone is really serious about buying carbon offsets from a real tree farmer then let me know and I'll follow Archangel's recommendation and I'll place that advertisement.",
