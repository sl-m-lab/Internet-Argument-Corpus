   "It appears that the University of California at San Diego has uncovered genetic evidence linking the Hox gene to limb supression. This could very well be a reasonable explantion for early evolution, and most surely provides an explanation for changes in type. For instance, this discovery gives us an idea how crustaceans could have evolved to form early insects hundreds of million years ago. Credit for this discovery goes to Matthew Ronshaugen.

   "You might as well look at this one too....\n \n Fossils dating somewhere in the range of 1.5- 2.0 million years old were found in South Africa. Apparently, one of them is the most complete \"ape-man\" ever found. It's looking bad for creationist, because the fossil record for our human ancestors is coming together. Hopefully, it will converge one day to give us a detailed account of the human evolutionary path. Only time will tell. Source: ABC News",

   "I suspect that there aren't many creationists, especially on this board, that have the slightest idea what a Hox gene is. The concepts are a bit complex and I only have a general understanding. You may see several terms used in referring to these genes. The most frequent is hox genes. Also used are homeobox and homeotic. They are a family of similar nucleotide sequences that encode sequence specific DNA-binding proteins. They are essential for establishing the developmental fate of various cell groups and also for maintaining the differentiated state. They have homologues in the genomes of many organisms, including humans and some plants.\n \n I had read about this over a year ago when the study was first published. Very interesting. A single mutation that is responsible for the supression of all but the throacic legs of an arthopod. It seems to be an example of one \"kind\" of animal becoming a completely different \"kind\" of animal.\n \n Anyone who is interested can go to GOOGLE and search for hox genes. You will get lots of information about Hox genes in a variety of organisms.",
