   "Most of the threads here are concerned with the immediate future of an abortion. For Archie and friends, the 'choice' is an evil one to allow because it is a choice between 'life' and 'death'. However, is this necessarily the case, if we take a longer view?\n \n Consider a couple, Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob are in a committed relationship, they might even be newly married, but at their current point in time neither of them wants children - they are both early twenties and just starting stressful careers. They are sexually active, but always use contraception. However, disaster strikes. The contraceptive fails, and Alice becomes pregnant. At this point, thanks to the pro-choice movement, she has a choice.\n One choice is to abort the foetus. She does so, continues to work and becomes more successful, and she and Bob have a planned child in a few years time. Because she and Bob waited until they were prepared, emotionally and financially, their child - call her Annie - lives a happy healthy life. Possibly she gains a sister at some point, as Alice has a higher-paid job to return to and the couple have built up savings before Annie was born, so a second child becomes financially viable.\n The other choice is to continue with the unwanted pregnancy. Alice has a child - call her Betty - but because Alice and Bob were not financially/emotionally prepared for a child, Betty lives a poorer life. Furthermore, partly because Betty's arrival forced Alice to take extended maternity leave so she returns to a poorly paid job and partly because Alice and Bob did not have prepared savings to deal with Betty, Alice and Bob are poorer in a few years time and cannot afford a second child. Annie is never born, nor her potential future sibling.\n \n The choice, then, is not a clear-cut issue between 'life' and 'death', even if you wish to consider a foetus as a living organism. Instead, the choice is between Annie and Betty - two possible routes, both of which are filled with life. The choice is not 'kill a child vs have a child' (as Archie sees it), it is 'have a child now vs have a child later'.\n \n Postscript: Regarding the alternative of 'adoption' - I have deliberately left this out of my considerations as an unrealistic option. There were 1.2 million abortions in the US last year, and ~127,000 children were adopted, of which 2/5 were from publicly funded operations (assuming last year was similar to 2001). Putting an extra million babies up for adoption each year is entirely unfeasible - parents would be turned away and would be expected to care for their own children. \n Such an alternative also detracts from my main point - that the choice to abort a child 'now' can result in the existence of a separate child in the future, who otherwise would not have existed.\n \n Post-postscript: This post might be tinged with my mildly deterministic leanings. However, I don't see that as any reason to discard it.",

Suppose Alice and Bob desire to have a child, but only if it is a perfectly healthy male. Suppose also that Alice and Bob are fortunate enough to get what they want (because everyone is entitled to have everything they want, right?) Suppose further that five years down the road, their perfectly healthy child develops a chronic illness for which much resources will be required to address. Are Alice and Bob justified in killing their child? They did not want an ill child, but that is what they now have. Why should Alice and Bob not be permitted to kill this chronically ill child?\n \n For the pro-life community, the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth, and their life is valuable for its own sake, and not for any benefit they might bring to their parents, their society, or any other person. This is ultimately why arguments of social utility fail to persuade pro-life individuals that unrestricted abortion is not only acceptable, but is often preferable.",

Prove it in an unbiased scientific way.\n\n \n ok. Even though I've been through this before:\n \n As surprising as this may be to some people, there is no debate within the medical community as to when life begins. Life begins at conception. Consider the testimony below from an assortment of leading embryology textbooks.\n \n \n The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 6th ed.\n Keith L. Moore, Ph.D. & T.V.N. Persaud, Md., (Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 1998), 2-18.\n \n \"[The Zygote] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being. Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.\"\n \n \n Essentials of Human Embryology\n William J. Larsen, (New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1998), 1-17.\n \n \"In this text, we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes, which will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual. ... Fertilization takes place in the oviduct ... resulting in the formation of a zygote containing a single diploid nucleus. Embryonic development is considered to begin at this point... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.\"\n \n \n \n Human Embryology & Teratology\n Ronan R. O'Rahilly, Fabiola Muller, (New York: Wiley-Liss, 1996), 5-55.\n \n \"Fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... Fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... The zygote ... is a unicellular embryo... \"The ill-defined and inaccurate term pre-embryo, which includes the embryonic disc, is said either to end with the appearance of the primitive streak or ... to include neurulation. The term is not used in this book.\"\n \n Adding to the consensus of contemporary textbooks, is the testimony of older medical texts as well:\n \n * Human Embryology, 3rd ed.\n Bradley M. Patten, (New York: McGraw Hill, 1968), 43.\n \n \"It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.\"\n \n * Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics\n J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, (Philadelphia: W.B. Sanders, 1974), 17.\n \n \"The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.\"\n \n * Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed.\n E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975), vii.\n \n \"Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.\" \n \n In addition to the consistent testimony found in medical textbooks, there is some equally conclusive evidence that exists on the public record. In 1981, a United States Senate judiciary subcommittee received the following testimony from a collection of medical experts (Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, Report, 97th Congress, 1st Session, 1981):\n \n * Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth\n Harvard University Medical School\n \n \"It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception.\"\n \n * Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni\n Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania\n \n \"I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.\"\n \n * Dr. Jerome LeJeune\n Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes\n \n \"After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.\"\n \n * Professor Hymie Gordon\n Mayo Clinic\n \n \"By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.\"\n \n * Dr. Watson A. Bowes\n University of Colorado Medical School\n \n \"The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter - the beginning is conception.\"\n \n The official Senate report reached this conclusion:\n \n Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.",

   "Why do you believe that EXTREME AND IMPOSSIBLE HYPOTHETICALS are rational examples in debating what is factual reality regarding what is the growth process we all went through in order to get here as sentient beings?\n\n The reason I keep bringing up this hypothetical is to explore the reasons why pro-life proponents value the early fetus / embryo. If they value it only for what it WILL BE not for what it currently IS, then it makes sense to present a hypothetical where the embryo currently IS the same, but has no chance to ever become what you hoped it will be. In that way, one can judge its worth purely by what it is AT THAT MOMENT. You seem to often equate what WILL BE with what IS. That is why this question is so important and why you seem to have such difficulty with it.\n \nHow can you just dismiss the reality that every single human being who is alive today, and whom you would fight for their rights to exist, started out exactly like these embryo's you are so quick to dismiss as not alive, or a non person, or not worthy of the same rights you enjoy? The hypocrisy and shallowness of your perspective, not to mention the selfishness of it is mind boggling. \n \n All you need to do is think a rational thought and look in a mirror; then consider that you were once an embryo in your mothers womb to understand the intrinsic and undeniable value in every other embryo in every other woman's womb. To deny that is to deny reality which is what the pro-death side represents, which is an obvious and determined break with reality to even attempt to argue from the position you are forwarding as the least bit reasonable.\n\n Of course I agree that our bodies all started as early embryos. Our bodies all also started as unfertilized eggs that needed the fertilization step to get them starting to grow. My body also started that way. However, I myself didn't come into the picture until my body developed mental existence - where I view mental existence as the core of who WE are, the core of what makes us us - people. Prior to that, it wouldn't have mattered if you had aborted a 2nd trimester fetus, or a newly fertilized zygote or if you had simply stopped the fertilization process through natural or artificial contreception. Either way, I would never had existed because my mind would never had existed. \n \n In comparison, If I had been aborted in third trimester, when my mind might have already existed, then it is certainly possible that I might have experienced pain, even fear or other emotions. So, I am quite glad that I was not put through that and was allowed to continue. This is a very different situation than what a body with \"nobody home\" experiences - there is no pain, no fear, no thoughts or emotions of any kind - just a soul-less mindless body. I have no sympathy for soul-less mindless bodies. Their only value lies in their usefulness to the person that will eventually exist once the brain is sufficiently developed.",

   "I've always respected you as a poster because you are very thoughtful in your analysis and respectful in communicating your views.\n\n Thank you for that comment. I do try to honestly think through issues - whether or not it confirms an earlier assumption - and I view that one can only have a reasoned debate if both sides remain respectful.\n \nMy view is that individual membership in the human family is all that is required for one to be a rights-possessing person entitled to respect.\n \n The fact that an embryo may have stopped growing does not bear on my view of the value of the embryo. For example, many pro-lifers, myself included, oppose research that would destroy an embryo even where there is little chance that the embryo would ever be brought to term. That is because human life is valuable for its own sake.\n\n What would you do to that living embryo or early fetus, then, if it just stopped growing but needed the woman's body to survive? Would you force her to carry it indefinitely?\n \n I think that most of us, even on the pro-choice side, think that human life (even pre-mentally existing life) is valuable - to higher or lesser degrees. A main difference is that the pro-choice side also places very high value on a woman's right to her own body. If you could take an unwanted embryo or fetus and put it in a hypothetical artificial womb, then the abortion debate would probably disappear since nobody would be arguing for killing that embryo or fetus. The reason that pro-choice advocates advocate for the woman to have the right to kill it through abortion (particularly when it is in its very early stage of development) is that we view her right to her body as very important and forcing her to carry that embryo/early fetus against her will is seen as a far greater wrong than killing it (again, if it is in its early stages).",

What mechanism do you propose for enforcing that authority over her?emoticon_xangel\n\n I have already presented my arguement in our recent discussions in other threads. Perhaps you have forgotten so I will present it again. **When there is more than one person involved, the state has the right to intervene.***\n \n To support this arguement from another angle that might be more difficult for you to ignore:\n \n From section IX B of the Roe vs Wade decision:\n \nAs we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly. \n \n \n Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. \n\n This is the conclusion of the Justices of the Supreme Court whose Roe vs Wade decision gave women back abortion rights - justices that I and nearly all pro-choice people would view as better judges than you of what the US government can and cannot do.\n \n Roe vs Wade left that determination of personhood open since there was no consensus between \"those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology\". In arguing the issue of personhood here in this forum, we are attempting to do exactly that - reach a consensus. These comments by Roe vs Wade meant that, if a consensus could be reached, then the state could control abortion based on the idea of personhood.\n \n We know that we have not reached a consensus on personhood. That is why it is worth discussing it and why this point is quite relevant to the abortion debate.\n \n Either way, despite the fact that we have not reached a consensus, Roe vs Wade DOES still allow for state interference for other reasons - namely viability.\n \n From Roe vs Wade section X:\n \nWe repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes \"compelling.\" \n ...\n With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \"compelling\" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. \n\n \n So, the Justices of the Supreme Court (the ones that gave women the right to abortion) that decided Roe vs Wade view that personhood and viability are both compelling reasons for the state to intervene in abortion rights. Since personhood has not been well defined by society, that left viability as the main compelling reason by which they argued restrictions on abortion rights.\n \n You apparently think that your view of the state never intervening should automatically be true - despite the fact that 84% of Americans disagree with you and that the essentially pro-choice justices of the Supreme court that decided Roe vs Wade disagree with you. Perhaps you think that you are so incredibly important that your views should be automatically paramount - without you first needing to convince the rest of us. Nearly all of us would disagree.",

Or is it more like 1 in every hundred million which might attach to an egg? And are you so ignorant as to believe that sperm without an egg could ever result in life? So, once again you go to the extreme to make a fallacious point which is based on a strawman argument.\n \n \n or a woman has her monthly period. THOSE contain life too. In-fact if they didn't, then a ZEF would never have the capability to start dividing its cells. \n\n \n Are you so ignorant as to not understand that what a woman flushes out of her body in her monthly menstrual cycle are DEAD CELLS WIITH ABSOLUTELY NO POTENTIAL FOR LIFE AT ALL? Of course you are that ignorant to have made such a statement as you made above.\n \n \nYou are such a hypocrite. Do you drive a car? Cars are know takers of human life. \n\n \n Yes I drive a car, a Lexus. And I've had my license for 39 years now, and I'm a classic defensive driver with a perfect driving record, and I've never hurt anyone with it. Are you suggesting that because others might not be as responsible as me, that I shouldn't drive a car? Is that how warped and twisted your mind is ingus?\n \n \nDo you support guns?\n\n \n Yes, I support individual gun ownership because I understand that if good honest people don't, then only the criminals would be armed. I also have an alarm system in my home and have never shot anyone. But are you implying that by owning a gun, I don't respect human life? It just so happens that I respect the lives of my family members more than the lives of those criminals who would break into my home with a lethal weapon. That is the ultimate respect of human life. It's called protecting the innocent ingus. Something that is a foreign concept to you, as has been so staunchly proven by your repeated claims that the fetus is actually a TRUE PARASITE. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n Are you a vegetarian? \n\n \n Are you kidding me? This is what I mean by infantile and off topic drivel. Are you suggesting that I don't respect life if I'm a meat eater? But what about the vegetables you heartless beast! Don't you know that they too are alive? Are you a proponent of torturing and killing vege's just because they can't communicate like mammals do? And are you suggesting they don't feel pain? Here ingus, educate yourself: \"Scientists Prove Plants Feel Pain, Vegans Face Starvation\"\n \n \nWhat about supporting our troops in the war? \n\n \n Again, even in your twisted mind, this is far away from the abortion debate. But to answer your ridiculous question directly, the answer is an adamant YES, I support our troops. Especially since I have a daughter who serves in the Air Force Military Police.\n \n \nSo the facts of the matter prove that LIFE is not such a big concern of yours - Controling what other people do IS! Court jesters like you talk out of both sides of their mouth, and you know it ;)\n\n \n THE FACTS OF THE MATTER? emoticon_xbounceremoticon_xgoodemoticon_smileemoticon_rolleyes All you have proven with this absolutely infantile and irrational tirade is that you are completely unable to write an opinion which is the least bit on topic and intelligent by any standard of measure. Now do you see why I didn't want to respond to this off topic foolishness? Must I post this in my public messages also, along with your fictional post as further evidence of your inability to reason on the most basic level of rationality? Is that what you want ingus? Now slink away like the troll that you are and stop bothering the adults.",

   "What's foolish is that you direct this polemic toward an anonymous poster rather than toward the fat cats who have brought out nation to the brink of Depression\n\n \n I see you have the typical liberal affliction known as topic oriented ADD or TOADD. Tell me what does the economy have to do with the topic at hand.. directly? \n \n \n The simple fact is, in regard to the topic of the thread, that there are areas of personal responsibility that are none of your, my, or the law's business.\n\n \n \n No that is where you are dead wrong.. Roe vs. Wade was a Stare Decisis legal maneuver espousing a \"right to privacy\" and the Supreme Court bought it, that was bad law. There is no constitutional right or guarantee of privacy... which in the end will spell the end for Roe v. Wade. Must I remind you and minds like your social liberal ilk. We are governed by the rule of law... and the rule of law here is based on moral absolutes. Effective law cannot exist without moral clarity. The government does in fact by constitutional charter have the right to mandate whatever is necessary to \"... provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare\" and the general welfare at present is the preservation of the union. Leveling off the population for effect social agendas in the lifetimes of the social engineers who have spawned this genocidal Orwellian nightmare is the net effect - in the name of some perceived right as the twisted mind of the feminist would have you believe or worse yet... radical environmentalists. Abortion is not a religious issue only, not only a moral issue... it is a matter of utmost importance. No woman has the right to extinguish a life in the name of illegitimate \"choice\" - not when she should have guarded her behavior up first. Law governs behavior... not feelings, and your feelings just aren't relevant.\n \n \n One of the most important is the choice of a pregnant woman whether to continue or terminate her pregnancy. Her making that choice is the epitome of personal, not societal responsibility.\n\n \n \n She would never have to get into that situation if she used propriety and self-control. Our system of governance here is that of a a self-governing people and the only way this can work is if people learn how to act decently. Decency is at the very heart of the matter... I know you liberals laud anything that is an open door to lasciviousness, but here... that behavior is not welcome. There is enough freedom in day-to-day choices without one that can collectively destroy the nations. It is that lie of individuality and the selfish arguments that have been perpetuated by the far left that has been a stain on the peripheral forefront of the American social consocius... and must be revered if we are to have a viable society to pass to our children, but it is the insanely selfish voice to today's postmodern moral reprobate that thinks it actually has a socially relevant point consistent with the social values that were established in this nations beginnings, you couldn't be further from the truth... you don't have that right here.",

Pip Pip Cheerio! ^ \n Posted on June 28, 2004 4:31:10 PM EDT by ConservativeMan55\n \n Scans uncover secrets of the womb\n \n Baby 'walking' in the womb A new type of ultrasound scan has produced the vivid pictures of a 12 week-old foetus \"walking\" in the womb. The new images also show foetuses apparently yawning and rubbing its eyes.\n \n The scans, pioneered by Professor Stuart Campbell at London's Create Health Clinic, are much more detailed than conventional ultrasound.\n \n Professor Campbell has previously released images of unborn babies appearing to smile.\n \n He has compiled a book of the images called Watch Me Grow.\n \n Conventional ultrasound, usually offered to mothers at 12 and 20 weeks, produces 2D images of the developing foetus.\n \n These are very useful for helping doctors to measure and assess the growth of the foetus, but convey very little information about behaviour.\n \n Complex behaviour\n \n More pictures of developing foetuses Professor Campbell has perfected a technique which not only produces detailed 3D images, but records foetal movement in real time.\n \n He says his work has been able to show for the first time that the unborn baby engages in complex behaviour from an early stage of its development.\n \n Professor Campbell told the BBC: \"This is a new science for understanding and mapping out the behaviour of the baby.\n \n \"Maybe in the future it will help us understand and diagnose genetic disease, maybe even conditions like cerebral palsy which puzzles the medical profession as to why it occurs.\"\n \n The images have shown:\n \n From 12 weeks, unborn babies can stretch, kick and leap around the womb - well before the mother can feel movement\n \n From 18 weeks, they can open their eyes although most doctors thought eyelids were fused until 26 weeks\n \n From 26 weeks, they appear to exhibit a whole range of typical baby behaviour and moods, including scratching, smiling, crying, hiccoughing, and sucking. Until recently it was thought that smiling did not start until six weeks after birth.\n \n An hour long session using the new technology, which is not yet available on the NHS, costs \u00a3275.12 WEEK OLD BABY WALKS IN THE WOMB!",

   "Another opinion", 
   "Views are nothing more than opinions. I don't think my views, or anyone elses views should impact the laws. Facts should.\n\n In a Democracy, views do impact the law both through voting and through the fact that most politicians do place importance in results of polls of their constituency. Be that as it may, I agree that laws should be based on facts (and the range of interpretations that can be rationally based on those same facts), but if the only facts that they are based on are the current status of the law, then that is circular reasoning. One does not make a law only because that is how it has always been. One makes a law on what makes most sense, given the facts we know. If you claim that the Constitution agrees with your view of women having abortion rights at all times for all reasons, then you are wrong - Roe vs Wade disagrees with you since it allows the state to interfere in the third trimester for the sake of the fetus, which is then viewed as viable.\n \nWell there you go. You see I don't play make believe word games so I guess you're out of luck. I can only respond to what is currently real. So you can ask what would I do if I saw a unicorn but the simple truth is that until I'm put in that situation I would have no way to know how I'd actually react. There are some abortion laws which are good, and some that are crazy. Generally speaking if it is part of a woman's body then she legally has the right to say what to do with it. Also I am not a lemming and I don't do something (or believe something) just because, as you put it, \"most pro-choice advocates\" think one way or the other. I am responsible for my own actions and I have a strong enough back bone to make my own decisions on every topic that comes my way when given the FACTS of the matter. I do not believe in double standards, and so if a man can control what goes on inside his body, then the same rule should apply to women as well. That only makes good sense, whether you like it or not.\n\n Most of this response of yours is a complete irrational non-sequitor to my point so I will ignore it as a rambling. As for your view that, if it is part of a woman's body, she has a legal right to say what to do with it, that is only fully true through the end of the second trimester. After that, Roe vs Wade determined that the state can interfere for the sake of the now-viable fetus, baring exceptions of risk of mother's death or risk to her health. Since it left out any detail about the health exception, this has caused contraversy in its interpretation that some, such as yourself perhaps, have interpreted to mean that ANY risk to health is a fine excuse, no matter how small.\n \n As for a woman's right to control her body, I certainly think she should have such a right. Where we disagree is that, in late pregnancy, hers is not the only right that counts - it needs to be balanced with the rights of a now viable, mentally-existing fetus. That is the right that you so clearly ignore. Judging by how desperate efforts you are making to dodge my questions about this, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is only due to your intellectual cowardice in knowing that you do not have a leg to stand on there. Perhaps I am misinterpreting and you are not an intellectual coward. The only way you can prove me wrong is to finally ANSWER THE QUESTION that I have asked so many times, and be ready to support your answer (That is how one holds proper debates, not by dodging questions):\n \"In your opinion, do you or don't you think that a woman sould be able to abort a fetus just prior to birth for any reason she chooses?\"",

If you revoke a womens choice regading their capability to bring another life into this world then you are condoning the world of abuse it will obstain when it is forced to be born.\n Please dont kid yourself about the world of childrens/social services! there is a REAL reason i am moving away from it into law.\n \n I did not want to get into this area, but your narrow minded veiw does not extend to what happens to the babies you force into existence.\n Adoption is a very hard, tedious and often unavailable process for many thus the foster care system is over crowded.\n \n Social services has to be one of the harded industries to ever work in. It really shows you the darkest side of humanity. I love children, but i cannot save them all.\n \n Its not enough to agrue for the life of the unborn, you need to understand the life of the ones who are born, born unwanted and abused for their existence.\n \n If you could change what happens to them, then you would have me on side. But untill the abuse of unwanted children desists, my vote will always be for choice.\n\n \n Very well stated.\n \n \n\n coservatives are some of the most [truly] openinded people are around. \n\n \n Huh?

   "The fact that you \"do not deal in relativism\" is simply one more sign that neo-conservatism is intellectually and morally bankrupt.\n\n \n First off, neo-con is a liberal slant on conservative, they wish there were actually neo-conservatives. It would help them sleep a little better at night, but since you cannot divide reality - you either accept it or reject it. Neo-con is a label and nothing more. But - just one for the road... having a liberal call something morally bankrupt is truly bass-ackwards.\n \n \n \nDo you seriously propose that the rules made for a nomadic tribe living in the deserts of the Middle East are valid for the technological age we live in today?emoticon_confused\n\n \n \n The rules don't change to suit lifestyle, that is the one thing nutters cannot seem to get their twisted minds around. Everything is just supposed to be dumbed and dithered down to the primordial soup-ish level of acceptance then can live with. I'm sorry... that is just simply irrational to consider.\n \n \nDo you really mean to say that the words written in the Constitution and Bill of Rights in 1787 and 1791 have exactly the same meaning today as they did then?\n\n \n Contrary to Al Gore's \"living, breathing\" rhetoric... the US Constitution is the rule of law, drafted on no less than principle. Principles [in case you cared or dared to wonder] carry within them characteristics that are immutable. Which mean they are not privy to ideolagical tampering and change because you need it to for how you want to live. Only the reprobate mind has spun such nonsense. This frustrates liberal law hacks.. and is the reason why we have the language of \"interpretation\" involved with the exersizing of law and order today... it is rapidly becoming flaw and disorder, but that seems to suit the lawless. But that is not what we have here...\n \n \nIf you truly believe this, why are you not advocating for the repeal of laws outlawing kiddie porn? After all, don't the words of the First Amendment state that, \"Congress shall make NO LAW abridging Freedom of the Press\"?:xbanghead\n[/QUOTE]\n \n \n Yes I truly believe this... but as long as there are relativist lawmakers in office that don't' prosecute the laws that are already on the books... it is a moot point to bring up. However... the 1st. Amendment [and we are off topic here] does not guarantee the kind of free speech the left has been intentionally obfuscating and blatantly misrepresenting. The press has no more right that citizens do... you may speak out against the government without fear of reprisal, insomuch as the behavior is not seditious, or treasonous. The press in the election cycle has overstepped several limits that would have never been tolerated in days before this... it is a sad commentary really.",

Faith is never certainty regardless of strong convictions.\n\n \n \n I have followed your train of arguments in the line of reasoning with Phylis, until you got to this line of questioning. I am curious about your feeling on the matter... so you personally feel there cannot be an objective value guiding behavior in the best interests of the individual, therefore socially beneficial overall. Morals [as a concept] are subjective by nature, what pulls them out of that category is what they are based on. They can be allied with ideologies and philosophies or they can be based on principles. The latter tends to have the greatest benefits overall... whereas ideals and philosophies don't work well principles because they are based more on feelings than values principles engender. \n \n As to the comment regarding faith, yes it is the singular characteristic that separates man from the common animal [although in this forum... lol] and free will is attached to it. We have a word \"unconscionable\" this word is interesting because as I researched the use, it is used to described as acting against your conscience. Now, your conscience carries within it the innate understanding of right and wrong, and to act against it was to act \"unconscionably\" so is there an inherent obejective morality? I would have to say an innate understanding of a moral truth exists in us... the evidence in our behavior when we do wrong.",

   "Morality originally was something meant to protect humans from each other. It established right and wrong. If something was unnecessarily harmful or hurtful to another human being, it was immoral. Now anything and everything Conservative Christian wackjobs don't agree with they wrongfully label \"immoral\" to give their out of line views a powerful word. The thing is, when you walk past the absolute right and wrong line, things get tricky. There is no way to prove for sure if something is moral or immoral. You can make arguments for and against the morality of something, but ultimately there will always be uncertainty. Some people call abortion \"immoral\", which at least I can understand because they believe that the fetus is being harmed. However, when one discovers the fetus possesses no mental existence, one discovers that there is no one to harm. Then we get into some of the hard core fanatics preaching things like premarital sex being \"immoral\". There is an argument I don't understand, because there is nothing harmful about the concept of premarital sex.\n \n I can call taking medicine \"immoral\", and if I get 1/3 of the US to back me, would that make taking medicine immoral? I could come up with all kinds of wacky arguments and throw God in there a couple of times and voila, I've got an argument to make something \"immoral\". This certainly pertains to the abortion issue, and shows how dangerous legislating morality that is not commonly agreed on, because anyone could say anything is immoral and then gather support to try to legislate it.",

Now this is not to say all things you do are questionable. But when we have people lashing out at a system of values merely for the reason they feel convicted about their behavior is in itself irrational. There is standard in place that doesn't protect feelings... it prtects human life. Seculars attack Christianity because they want somethign else in place. They Attack Christianity because they want to feel conviction for the morally bacnkyupt lives they live. That is why every soclia institution that stands for good, balance, self control and social decency is under a near violent opposition by such voices. But, social upheaval or not...

The relativist [like yourself] for the most convenient reasons feels oppressed by the conviction associated with the values. So, don't blame Christians... they have don nothing to you personally, you react to what they represent in the most Pavlovian way I can think.\n \n \n \nThere is no way to prove for sure if something is moral or immoral.\n\n \n That is just blatantly false, that is like saying I am not quite sure 1+1=2 because the only thing certain is that you can't count. The reason you cannot count is only one of two realities, you are unwilling or unable... no one is unwilling to better themselves in a way of equipping themselves to administrate their lives on a day-to-day basis. Which leaves the only obvious choice... they chose to be ignorant. Regardless of the choice, it does not remove the reality or significance of math. That is the issue more strident secularists run into... their denial may be convenient but it is clearly irrational; thus irresponsible for a state to blindly allow it citizens to engage in willfully self destructive behavior. The survival of the union depends on a cohesive unity through the strength of its laws. Ours are minimalistic, but I find it telling how far the left will go to force the hand of those who know the right way, and still try to leverage it with legal tactics. Other nations have their... and we have ours.\n \n \n \nYou can make arguments for and against the morality of something, but ultimately there will always be uncertainty. Some people call abortion \"immoral\", which at least I can understand because they believe that the fetus is being harmed.\n\n \n \n Yes, you can make arguments against anything you wish... but it doesn't make them valid. Moral clarity cannot be argued, it can be challenged [ignored] but not dismissed as if they don't exist. The fact that there is an argument at all give credence the the fact that there is a law designed innately in our consciousness, we avoid it by consensus affiliation, but that doesn't always work. The label of \"fetus\" is a vain attempt by pseudo-science to trivialize the value of human life. Because if it means nothing... then I can do what I want... how I want to. NO! every little step it takes to create life is what it takes. The excuses the liberal contingent offer are as trite as they are dissmissable... so to the overall relevance to this thread, it is ultimately fatalistic for a society to continue to zero off its birth rate, instilling a sense of irresponsibility in its citizenry by allowing the state to sponsor a safety net promotes nothing but sexually promiscuous society, and that begins the downward spiral because history is replete with lessons on what happens when you suspend moral law to pursue indulgences... that nation perishes.",

The crusades were the actively recruitment of open piracy in the name of the Almighty, but under the banner of the Catholic Church. You tell me Mr. Dime Store theologists how Catholicism and Christianity are the same doctrine. Fact is... Roman Catholicism was on a power grab and I in no was justify nor substantiate what happened, but how does that differ from Stalin's murderous rampages, Hitler's high tide of state sponsored bigotry, or Mao's blood bath's. The latter all look at life in the same secular manner as you do and leverage that same fascistic tactics to get their way... but all based on what they felt  was right and they murdered far more than any crusade in the name of Catholicism - again you have failed to make your point, but of course that is actually giving you credit for actually having one.\n \n \nWhen you are done with that, show us how the Christian-on-Christian wars in France in the 16th Century improved civilization.\n\n \n Again, because you have the secular world view, anything religious to your mind is \"Christian\", but that is not how it plays out in reality. You have to know something about the Christian church in contrast to the Catholic Church to make intelligent contrasts there, but since you lack intelligence but have an abundance of anger I don't' expect you to understand that.

Your choices in life are your problem buddy, not Christians, get that straight - no one is more insane than the mind that lauds how they feel over accepting what is real.

   "because it has nothing to do with how you live your life... you have choice. But in our country you are not free to simply engage in any choice you feel... simply because you feel. Now this is not to say all things you do are questionable. But when we have people lashing out at a system of values merely for the reason they feel convicted about their behavior is in itself irrational. There is standard in place that doesn't protect feelings... it prtects human life.\n\n \n Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with people believing in whatever they want. My problem comes when people try to force a baseless belief on another group of people, especially when the group of people its being forced on do not share that belief. As for abortion goes, most people believe that a fetus is not a viable entity, and it certainly does not have a right to overrule the valuable human right of ones own body. You are free to \"prtect\" fetuses in the confides of your own home.\n \n \n \nSeculars attack Christianity because they want somethign else in place. They Attack Christianity because they want to feel conviction for the morally bacnkyupt lives they live.\n\n \n Intellectuals and seculars do not attack Christianity because they want to live a morally \"bacnkyupt\" life. They reject Christianity because they have sharp logic and reasoning skills. Again, no one is saying Christianity should be outlawed. Christianity and its followers are free to practice whatever they want, however they are not free to legislate religiously based ideas into laws.\n \n Also note that your willingness to call anyone who doesn't believe as you do \"morally bankrupt\" proves my point exactly. You have no proof or reason to think that I have done anything wrong, yet you still disagree with me. Therefore \"morally bankrupt\" is an easy word to use, since it carries weight, and you are not obligated to further elaborate.\n \n \n \nThat is why every soclia institution that stands for good, balance, self control and social decency is under a near violent opposition by such voices. But, social upheaval or not... Chrisianity is the lay of the land here. It has formed our laws and social values, you words:\n\n \n Someone fell asleep in 8th grade history.\n \n \nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\n\n \n \nThis is baseless vitriol... we didn't invent moral law, we simply don't reject the obvious conviction of engaging in openly self destructive behavior.\n\n \n Such as? Again, use of a word that you fail to back up. Much of the wacky right believe that sex between gay couples is immoral and \"self destructive\", yet there are next to no medical consequences (next to heterosexual sex, of course).\n \n \n \nHistorically Christians have been anything but... are weperfect no, we never claimed to be but our values when execerized never has done anything but improve civilization where it has been allowed to flourish.\n\n \n Of course it has. So are you going to accuse me of witchcraft now or later?\n \n \n \nThe relativist [like yourself] for the most convenient reasons feels oppressed by the conviction associated with the values. So, don't blame Christians... they have don nothing to you personally, you react to what they represent in the most Pavlovian way I can think.\n\n \n You mean the imperfect and flawed Christian values dreamt up by the flawed Christian minds of the flawed Christian men? Right, adhering to those definitely will keep you away from the red guy with a pitch fork.\n \n \n \n \n \nThat is just blatantly false, that is like saying I am not quite sure 1+1=2 because the only thing certain is that you can't count. The reason you cannot count is only one of two realities, you are unwilling or unable... no one is unwilling to better themselves in a way of equipping themselves to administrate their lives on a day-to-day basis. Which leaves the only obvious choice... they chose to be ignorant.\n\n \n You are making no sense. Morality is relative, mathematical laws are not. Good analogy.\n \n \n \nRegardless of the choice, it does not remove the reality or significance of math.\n\n \n Oh please, I'm not supposed to be laughing this hard before I sleep.\n \n \nThat is the issue more strident secularists run into... their denial may be convenient but it is clearly irrational; thus irresponsible for a state to blindly allow it citizens to engage in willfully self destructive behavior. The survival of the union depends on a cohesive unity through the strength of its laws. Ours are minimalistic, but I find it telling how far the left will go to force the hand of those who know the right way, and still try to leverage it with legal tactics. Other nations have their... and we have ours.\n\n \n You do exactly what every Conservative Christian does when posed with this question. Dance around the question while saying absolutely nothing of importance. Denial of what? Can someone deny what they've never been introduced to?\n \n For what's right, I follow my internal conscience, not a flawed ancient book that has no proof behind it whatsoever.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nYes, you can make arguments against anything you wish... but it doesn't make them valid. Moral clarity cannot be argued, it can be challenged [ignored] but not dismissed as if they don't exist. The fact that there is an argument at all give credence the the fact that there is a law designed innately in our consciousness, we avoid it by consensus affiliation, but that doesn't always work.\n\n \n Again, wth are you talking about? What moral clarity? Where do people get this moral clarity?\n \n \n \nThe label of \"fetus\" is a vain attempt by pseudo-science to trivialize the value of human life.\n\n \n In your humble opinion.\n \n \nBecause if it means nothing... then I can do what I want... how I want to. NO! every little step it takes to create life is what it takes.\n\n \n Again, why not? Why do I have to do what someone else thinks is right and not what I think is right?\n \n \nThe excuses the liberal contingent offer are as trite as they are dissmissable...\n\n \n Sorry I forgot. Science, hard evidence, and popular vote are not enough for the Conservative Christians. All they need is a dusty old book and some fancy language and they're in business.\n \n \n \nso to the overall relevance to this thread, it is ultimately fatalistic for a society to continue to zero off its birth rate, instilling a sense of irresponsibility in its citizenry by allowing the state to sponsor a safety net promotes nothing but sexually promiscuous society,\n\n \n A) \"Zero off its birth rate\"? What world are you living in? Because I live in an overpopulated world, with rampant unemployment, pollution, poverty, and starvation. The last thing we need is bozos running around saying we need more unwanted babies.\n \n B) \"Irresponsibility\"? So now pregnancy is a punishment?\n \n C) Promiscuousity is only bad if it is done unsafely, or someone is getting hurt. Otherwise you have yet to prove there is a problem.\n \n \n \nand that begins the downward spiral because history is replete with lessons on what happens when you suspend moral law to pursue indulgences... that nation perishes.\n\n \n And what moral law would that be? Again I state, Christian's only sense of morality come from an outdated and ancient book that ultimately should have no meaning in today's society. That book was written by men, and reflects an ancient way of mind. Christianity and its members have done more to harm society than to help it. The millions lying dead of starvation, torture, and burning can account to that. Oh wait, I forgot. The Christians who did that weren't real Christians, but you are. And guess what? In about 100 years they're going to be saying \"Yeah, those Christians 100 years ago were barbaric and un-Christian, with their anti-abortion protests and their willingness to allow discriminative anti-gay legislation to pass, but we are the real Christians\". And that's going to go on and on and on. And all you have is one, unproven book. And the fact that the only reason its followers read it and live by it is simply because it says its true. I should crack open a copy of Harry Potter and start preaching my moral truths to you.",

You see a runaway railroad car careening down a track toward some children who are unaware of its approach. Within you reach is a switchstand. By throwing the switch, you can divert the car to another track. The problem is that there is a homeless person sleeping on the track, using the rail for a makeshift pillow.

Lying next to you is an obese person who is either unconscious or sleeping. You get the idea that throwing him onto the track will act as a brake and stop the car. If you don't the kids die; if you do, the obese person will.\n What do you choose and why?\n \n Is there any distinction between:\n (A) throwing or not throwing the switch?\n (B) Tossing or not tossing the obese person onto the track?\n \n Which scenario presents the worst moral choice - having the children die by your inaction, having the homeless person die, or having the obese person die, each by your hand?\n \n Are any of the deaths murder?

From that I have advanced the conclusion that moral absolutes logically must exist.\n\n \nNow, if a moral objectivist were to say (as he surely would), \"murder is objectively immoral,\" he would be uttering a moral proposition. The moral relativist must, by virtue of his own premise, deny the truth of that proposition. He must say, \"no, murder is not objectively immoral.\" But that reply is a moral proposition. Therefore, in order for it to actually counter the moral objectivist's proposition, the moral relativist's moral proposition must itself be objectively true. But that would present a contradiction between the relativist's initial premise, and the conclusion compelled by that premise.\nAs far as I am concerned, you are missing a major part to your argument. That is: that an action/opinion is not always restricted to the moral/immoral, but instead can be amoral. Scientific fact is amoral - that the solar system is heliocentric is a perfect example of this.\n \n Thus, to contradict 'murder is objectively immoral', you can simply say 'murder is subjective, but I don't like it' - that is, 'there is no absolute standard by which to judge the morality of murder (but I find it immoral)'. This isn't a moral statement, unless you include a further axiom of 'belief in the correct morals is morally right' - in which case, we're in all sorts of headache territory. Instead, it is an objective (disputed) 'fact' - that I believe murder to be subjective.\n \n My turn. Depending on what country you are brought up in, you are more likely to support/oppose the death penalty. How is there a 'moral absolute' governing this?\n \n EDIT: As a second counter, it is perfectly possible to be subjective about subjectivity. Hence my favourite phrase - \"there are no absolutes - and we're not even sure about that\".",

   "Revelation does not bear out your claims here, if they simply rejected it... we wouldn't have the political climate we have today. You comments are a dismissal of the reality of what social engineers in the education, law and so-called science have wanted to do for decades... change the moral climate to something more favorable to their lifestyles. You have not validated your position in any way.\n\n \n First of all, you did not answer my question. How do you expect us to believe in something that has absolutely no evidence to support it?\n \n Second of all, why do Christians think people leading better lives is such a bad thing? Since the beginning of time, religious folk (namely Christians and Muslims) have led an all out war on any kind of fun. They only suggest that we work harder, don't drink, don't dance, etc. That may not be the climate today, however it is similar.\n \n This was originally made up to scare people into working harder so that society could function better, however this is obviously not the case today.\n \n \n \n \nWhat was the purpose in you quoting the 1st. Amendment?\n\n \n Because you don't seem to keen on the whole \"freedom of and from religion\" thing.\n \n \nIt in no way substantiates or validates, nor lends veracity to any claim you have made. Your baseless assertion that is is only the voice of the religious is blind on its own merit and reveals your predispositioned bias against religion, which at this point is just aimless talking points.\n\n \n You misunderstood. The voice of the religious is valid, however the voicing religiously based ideas is invalid.\n \n \nProp 22 passed by a whopping 61% of the electorate in the State of California... they weren't all religious. Yet the mind of the Darwinian naturalist will hold onto all the claim made, but yet fail to understand the hardcore Darwinian proponents reject homosexuality because it cannot perpetuate the survival of any species... furthermore to make a blanket claim that there are no medical consequences for abortion is a pathetic dismissal of reports from thousands of women who report depression and other related illness post abortion, but the insane left simply suppresses the knowledge of such.\n\n \n A) Eating junk food doesn't perpetuate the survival of species either, yet we are still allowed to do it.\n \n B) Same as with legislation against the rights of black citizens about 60 years ago, it wasn't all religiously based. Just like now, it was based on ignorance. Religion is ignorance, however ignorance is not religion.\n \n \n \n \n \nThat comment made no sense, that is par for the course... and your [like all liberals] simply deny the reality the consequences of your actions and if you have a perfect right to cause them... foolish.\n\n \n That comment made perfect sense, and you've just done it again. You've proved nothing while using the word \"reality\". There is nothing \"real\" about something totally imaginary. There are also no consequences to doing things that are not bad. You have yet to prove to me that religious taboos are morally wrong, and the bible is a credible source of information (without using the words \"reality\" or \"morally bankrupt\", of course).\n \n \n \n \nOh, don't you mean pseudo-science, and the hard consensus of the lifestyle advocates...revealling their agenda to all, therefore forming up the informed decision any reasonable person would come to understanding our laws protect those who cannot protect themselves... hmmmm, I'd say you missed the entire point, willfully.\n\n \n Rejection of fact is blatant stupidity. If you choose to live in stupidity, that is your choice and I respect that choice. However, do not expect me to keep a straight face while reading it.\n \n \n \n \nListen, this ingnorant tirade of yours is nothing more than pointed vitriol... prove your points, or dont' make baseless challenges. Anyway you slice it... in the end true science will invalidate your point.\n\n \n Oooh, more fancy words that say absolutely nothing.\n \n I still don't see any points I haven't proven or that haven't been proven.

   "Apologies, I missed it. Incidentally, d'you think should I take this into a new thread?\n\n Sure, why not?\n \n \nAs far as I am concerned, you are missing a major part to your argument. That is: that an action/opinion is not always restricted to the moral/immoral, but instead can be amoral. Scientific fact is amoral - that the solar system is heliocentric is a perfect example of this.\n\n Even granting the category of \"amoral\" for the sake of argument, the conclusion is still the same. The claim \"X is not objectively immoral,\" if assuming a category of amoral, is not the same as the claim \"X is moral.\" So, I don't think that I overlooked the possibility of amoral actions at all in the two posts I referenced. \n \n Take golf as an example. Suppose after 18 holes, Tiger Woods was tied with Phil Mickelson. Suppose further that a Tiger Woods fan proclaimed, \"Tiger is beating Mickelson.\" The reply would be, \"It is not true that Tiger is beating Mickelson\" (this is what the simple reply \"no, he is not\" means). That would be a true statement whether Tiger was actually losing, or whether he was tied with Mickelson. Now, I try to apply this concept even more below.\n \n \nThus, to contradict 'murder is objectively immoral', you can simply say 'murder is subjective, but I don't like it' - that is, 'there is no absolute standard by which to judge the morality of murder (but I find it immoral)'. This isn't a moral statement, unless you include a further axiom of 'belief in the correct morals is morally right' - in which case, we're in all sorts of headache territory. Instead, it is an objective (disputed) 'fact' - that I believe murder to be subjective.\n\n I'm afraid this doesn't counter my argument. If it is true that there are no objective moral truths, then a moral relativist must logically deny the truth of any claim of moral objectivity. That is the only conclusion that can follow from the premise. So, if a moral objectivest says, \"X is objectively immoral,\" the relativist logically must deny that as being a true statement. The relativist must say, \"It is false that X is objectively immoral.\" Notice that that reply is not saying that X is moral. It is simply negating the objectivist's claim. But that negation is itself a moral claim which, to be effective, must be objectively true. But were it to be so, then the conclusion contradicts the premise.\n \n \nMy turn. Depending on what country you are brought up in, you are more likely to support/oppose the death penalty. How is there a 'moral absolute' governing this?\n\n I don't quite understand this question. If one were to grant that morality is objective, then it seems at least possible that administrating the death penalty could be either objectively moral or objectively immoral.\n \n \nEDIT: As a second counter, it is perfectly possible to be subjective about subjectivity. Hence my favourite phrase - \"there are no absolutes - and we're not even sure about that\".\n\n I truly find it interesting that your favorite phrase is a logical contradiction.",

If you learn that God controls everything, and God wants you to wait until you're married before having sex, then you're going to feel guilty about having sex before. However if you were brought up with a more open minded view of sex and you're practicing sex safely, you most likely won't feel guilty.\n \n How you're brought up plays a huge role in what you're morals are, and the fact is everyone does not share your personal morals, and therefore the Christian need to force your principles on another must be restrained.\n \n \nThose moral precepts are etched into our consciousness and are supposed to preserve us, but we make choices that are not always the best for us.\n\n \n I agree, however this is not whats being debated.\n \n \nHowever, to make a grand claim like you made above... wow, that is a fairy myopic world view in my opinion.\n\n \n You have yet to provide evidence or even logic to the contrary.\n \n Although you may have misunderstood me above.
