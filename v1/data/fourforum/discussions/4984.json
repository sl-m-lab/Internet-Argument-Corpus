   "Now I will begin an opening argument. This nation is decaying morally, economically, and as a whole we are split between party politics that tear at the core foundation that we are one people. I see that most Americans do not care what happens on Capital Hill and take their freedoms for granted. They don't even know what the government is trying to accomplish whether it be social security, tax reform, etc. From an economic standpoint we are headed for disaster. We simply import more than we export. The defecit is growing at an alarming rate. The nation is simply getting into to much debt. We send all of our manufacturing over seas. Sue, it helps third world countires, but think all of these jobs could be at home. We depend too much on oil from foreign powers. Gasoline is on the rise, and still we are losing jobs everyday. Then as a result the government is pressured to pay social security but cannot due to the overpopulation due to illeagal immigration which in turn, results in the \"babyboomers\". This country is simply overburdened,and yet we spend spend spend. Oh sure we won't be bankrupt till 2041 so lets let the next generation deal with it. Is this the future we want to leave to our children? Do we wish to give them poverty? To we wish to give them no social security? Do we want to give them inflation? Do we want to give them $10.00 a gallon gas prices? Something must be done not only for our sake, but for the sake of the rest of the world as well. Turning to the moral side of the issue, we see murder is surely on the rise. Crime is at an all time high. \"Following the golden rule\" is a thing of the past. Now our youth looks to drugs, sex, alcohol, violence, and music artsts who glorify this living and degrades women to such a low, the family pet has more respect than she in their eyes. It sickens me to see this is a result of the so called \"generation gap\". We are responsible for the way our kids are raised, we teach them to follow the right examples, we show them what is right. But like many wanton people today's parents drop little susy at the neighbor's while they work. Or at the day care center. While the child has no parental guidance, she will find guidance from other sources. She will not know what is right and wrong simply because no one told her, and second, no one enforced it. If we are to stop the rampage of crime in this nation we must take the bull by the horns and discipline our kids. No not hit them or yell at them like insane monsters, but be firm and show them with love and tell them we do these things because we love them and want them to have a bright future for tommorrow. Is that not what we want? Then people we must put word into action. Another topic is pollution. Everyday I see nothing at the basin of Mt.Baldy because it is covered in smog. L.A. just got the worst air rating in the nation! Sure we say oh we'll do something about it, but we still drive gas guzzilling smog factories to get our kids to soccer practice. We must look to cleaner less conssuming vehicles. If we don't we'll destroy this planet and give birth to the generation with lung cancer. BY the way in case some of you wonder which party I \"belong\" to Im a Republican. lol.",
