   "What are your thoughts on the european union and your country in relation to it ?\n \n \n Personally, I think it would be more effective (for scandinavia) to form a scandinavian union instead. The EU just seems too disparate and the member nations to widely different to really make it much more than an economic trade alliance",

   "What the EU basically does is turn a conglomeration of states into a single nation for trading purposes. It seems to be a good idea in that it allows nations with largly skilled labor pools to interact with potential investors with large deposits of natural resources, or large scale industrial complexes without tarrif concernes.\n \n As far as how it will affect my country (the USA), I can forsee a very dramatic effect. The Us has for years been the big dog on the block economically and militarily. The EU has largly surpassed the US as the economic leader of the world when you look at things like trade deficits.\n \n While the US still has a lot of pull as the worlds largest consumer economy, there is a better than average chance that China will surpass us int eh not to distant future, as they have made it their stated goal to raise their average income above $10,000. \n \n The trade benifits that coem with inclusion in the EU are immense. You have a stable currency to deal in (the euro), and basically all the benifits of being a large country without the drawbacks.",
