   "Genesis 4:7 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?\n \n \n \n Notice in Genesis that Cain was given a chance at salvation but like his Father he \"went his own way\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n I find that by observing the present the past is revealed, and one can get a deeper insight into what kind of life/ culture the Serpent manifested before the creation of men? By observing the Lineage of Cain......\n \n \n Eve's first encounter /introduction to sex, Bestiality, which did bring forth the children of disobediance, a hybrid race, and from that time, and throughout the ages, this particular hybrid has ruled over the Earth, establishing a kingdom, contrary to God, in the image of their Father, Satan, yet, because of this occurence, both seeds have the opportunity to see/walk/ and live in the knowledge of Good or Evil.... whilest exercising free moral agency..... \n \n \n \n Remeber,.. God did command that all beast was now subject to men, including the serpent, however, I OFTEN question was it jealousy/envy that played a role in the sabotage of the newest creation( human) on the serpents behalf? Which led it to bargain with Lucifer, and by doing this, mixing with the original seed, it could/ and would retain dominion over the planet.\n \n \n God cursed the serpent(vagabond/ fugitive) he did not destroy it(scripture?)",
