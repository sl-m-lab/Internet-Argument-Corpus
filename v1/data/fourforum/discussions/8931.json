   "Israel's \"Right to Exist\"\n by KATHLEEN CHRISTISON Sunday, Jun. 04, 2006 at 4:36 AM\n \n \n The insistence on Arabic acceptance of Israel's \"right to exist\" is racist without a similar insistence for Israel to accept Palestine's \"right to exist.\"\n \n \"The Palestinians Must Pay a Price for Their Choice\"\n Surrender vs. the Right to Exist\n By KATHLEEN CHRISTISON\n Former CIA analyst\n \n Noting that he had been raised with the deep conviction that the Jewish people would never have to relinquish any part of the \"land of our forefathers,\" Ehud Olmert told Congress in his address to a joint session on May 24, \"I believed, and to this day still believe, in our people's eternal and historic right to this entire land.\" He did then concede that dreams alone cannot bring peace and will not preserve Israel as a \"secure democratic Jewish state.\" But what stands out in this little-noted statement of Jewish attachment to the land is its affirmation of a supreme Jewish right to all of Palestine, never mind who else may live there. In the context of any hope for a just and equitable peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, this is a deal-breaker par excellence.\n \n In light of this official Israeli view that the Jewish people have \"an eternal and historic right to this entire land,\" one is startled by the hypocrisy of the demand -- enunciated universally by Israel, the U.S., the EU, and most of the rest of the international community -- that the Palestinians must recognize Israel's \"right to exist\" before anyone will even speak to them, before they can be admitted to civilized company in the world. Does this demand that Palestinians recognize Israel's right to exist mean that they must recognize Israel's \"right to the entire land\" as defined by Olmert? And if that is the case, how could the Palestinians possibly be assured, even if Israel were magnanimously to grant them a \"state\" or a \"Bantustan\" in a part of that \"entire land,\" that Israel would not at some future date take it back, since Jews have \"an eternal and historic right\" to it? Why should anyone believe that any Israeli concession of land would be permanent?\n \n Olmert's assertion of this all-encompassing Jewish \"right\" is certainly not a new feature of Israeli and Zionist dogma. The notion has underlain Zionism from the beginning, hidden sometimes behind a leftist veneer of accommodation to the reality of the Palestinian presence in this sacred Jewish land, but never very far beneath the surface. The Zionist belief in Jewish supremacy has never truly been hidden. I ran into this in crude form a few years ago. Shortly after the Palestinian intifada began in 2000, an acquaintance -- no friend, but an irritating bigot who always argues Israel's case openly on the basis that Jewish interests are superior to Palestinian interests -- wrote me an email in which he concluded that, because there is \"simply not enough room in Palestine for both Jews and Palestinians,\" the Palestinians should \"go back to Jordan, where they came from\" and leave Palestine to the Jews, who own it and so badly need a homeland. (The erroneous notion that Palestinians came from Jordan is a conscience-clearing artifact of the Zionist imagination, designed to \"prove\" that Palestinians did not originally come from Palestine, are simply interlopers in a Jewish land, and therefore will not be hurt or inconvenienced by \"going back\" where they came from.) I told him he was factually wrong and completely immoral -- which I'm sure did nothing to burden his conscience, but which did serve, blessedly, to end our correspondence.\n \n The particular argument put forth by this particular man expresses more crude racism than most supporters of Israel would admit to feeling, but in fact his position reflects the official views of the Israeli government and of the U.S. government that supports it. Ultimately, his position, which is of course identical to Olmert's, captures the essence of Zionism and defines what has been the basis of U.S. policy toward Israel and Zionism since well before the state of Israel was established 58 years ago: that is, that Israel's interests as a Jewish state and Israel's \"rights\" always take precedence, no matter what the interests and rights of the Palestinians, and that Palestinian needs can be accommodated only when these do not interfere with Israel's or when Palestinians give in to Israel's demands. At bottom, this is a policy based on the assumption that there is \"simply no room in Palestine for both Jews and Palestinians\" and that the only possible solution over the long term is for the Palestinians to disappear in some fashion. As the PLO ambassador to the U.S., Afif Safieh, is fond of saying, Israel wants the Palestinians' geography but not their demography -- the land but not the people.\n \n \n snip\n \n \n http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2006/06/1728889.php\n \n What do you think about what she is saying. I think it goes to the heart of the problem. Israel has to also accept the right of a Palestinian right to have their own state within the Middle East just has much as Israel as the right to exist.",
