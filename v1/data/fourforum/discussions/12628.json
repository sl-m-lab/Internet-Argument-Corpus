   "  Gun and ammo sales \n In the last three months of 2008, that's right, three months, Americans bought enough guns to outfit the Chinese and Indian armies, combined. Actually, that's just reflective of the NICS checks, which don't cover sales by private parties, and buys by CCW permit holders. There were also 1.5 BILLION rounds of ammo sold, which explains why I'm having trouble finding .45 ACP lately.\n\n \n   USA Buys Enough Guns in 3 Months to Outfit the Entire Chinese and Indian Army \n EveryTown, USA - -(AmmoLand.com)- In just 3 months Americans bought enough guns to outfit the entire Chinese and Indian army's combined.\n \n You also bought 1,529,635,000 rounds of ammunition in just the month of December 2008. Yeah that is right, that is Billion with a \"B\".\n \n This is an evaluation of overall firearms and ammunition purchases based on low end numbers per Federal NIC instacheck data base Statistics. The numbers presented are only PART of the overall numbers of arms and ammunition that have been sold. The actual numbers are much higher.\n\n The NICS background check system is now 10 years old.\n   FBI Background Checks for Firearm Purchases Hit 100 Million \n The NICS 100 millionth transaction corresponds with a 27.1 percent increase in firearm sales for the first quarter of 2009 over the same quarter last year.\n \n \"As firearm sales continue to sky rocket across the country and the FBI-NICS team celebrates its 100 millionth transaction, the professionalism and outstanding customer service offered by FBI-NICS continues to flourish,\" said Keane. \"A sincere congratulations is due to our friends in law enforcement.\"\n\n I don't know, but I think the American People have spoken! Leave the 2nd amendment alone!",

   "What does all of these gun sales mean to conservation?\n \n   Conservation efforts benefit from 31 percent jump in excise taxes \n Firearm and ammunition manufacturers paid more than $98 million in excise taxes in the fourth quarter of 2008, up 31.2 percent over the same period in 2007, according to figures released earlier today by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. \n \n Excise tax collections are a key economic indicator for the industry. The taxes are calculated as a percentage of wholesale receipts, paid quarterly by firearm and ammunition manufacturers, and earmarked for state wildlife conservation and habitat restoration programs.\n \n A total of $345.2 million was collected in excise taxes in 2008, up 13.9 percent from the $303.2 million collected the previous year. These statistics are based solely on U.S. civilian sales and do not include sales to military, police, etc.\n \n   See chart for full information on how gun ownership benefits conservation ",

   "And it is STILL Going!\n \n   Gun sales skyrocket \n (Speaking of the so called Assault Weapons) Local firearms dealers said they haven't been able to keep that type of firearm on the shelves for months. Scott Hoffman said that since November he hasn't been able to immediately fill orders for items considered personal weapons. He's back-ordered in certain kinds of ammunition, too.\n \n \"Gun sales have at least doubled,\" said the longtime owner of Hoffman's Gun Center on the Berlin Turnpike. \"Business is up at least 50 percent and that's in a bad economy. It shows you how scared people are.\" \n \n cross town at the Newington Gun Exchange, business is equally brisk. In the past six months, \"Any type of military-style firearm has been selling well,\" Lenk said. \"We've been lucky to have any to put on the wall.\n \n The rush of first-time gun owners has tripled in some places, leaving local and state police struggling to process the overflow of pistol-permit applications.\n \n Gun salesmen like Lenk and Hoffman are attributing the boost in sales to a collision of political and economic forces. Lenk said business started picking up when it became apparent that Barack Obama, who is perceived as promoting tighter gun restrictions, might win the election.\n \n At the same time, as the economy soured, fears of increased crime created a boom in a business that has traditionally been steady but not necessarily given to dramatic spikes.\n \n \"Traditionally when the economy is bad, crime goes up,\" Hoffman said. \"Add to that, that everyone who is in charge of our government doesn't want us to have guns, and guns sales have at least doubled.\"\n\n \n   Is the Ammo Shortage the Result of a Government Conspiracy or an NRA Marketing Campaign? \n \n At this time we are not taking any new backorders for primers that are not listed here. We currently have over 50 million primers on backorder.\n\n And Powder Valley is just one little company selling primers and other reloading components.\n \n Obama's election certainly got it going, and his anti-gun history and the awful appointments of hoplophobes to his cabinet didn't help. But there is something more existential going on here beyond \"get them while you can.\" .... No conspiracy is involved, only buyers, sellers and objective conditions responsible for demand.\n\n \n   Will the Obama administration come for your guns? \n No one really expects business to increase 60 percent in a worldwide economic crisis. Unless, of course, you own a firearms store, online ammo shop, or lease a booth at the regional gun show, in which case business is exploding.\n \n ....The business moved in 1977 to Prescott, Arizona, renaming itself J&G Sales. ...But sales have never been as high as they are at the moment, DeSaye says. \"Business is probably triple more than normal,\" he tells TAC. \"It's unprecedented.\" ... Boxes of ammunition of all calibers are reportedly flying off the shelves at double, even triple the normal price in neighborhood mom-and-pops, Wal-Marts, and at gun shows across the country. Big online dealers like Texas-based Cheaper Than Dirt are ordering millions of rounds at a time and slamming up against backorders of six to eight months.\n \n Meanwhile, Dave Hardy, who blogs at armsandthelaw.com, reports that gun shows are becoming surreal. \"The last gun show I went to, ammo prices were close to double what they were six months ago,\" he says. \"I saw three or four people enter with moving dollies, using them to haul out a load of ammo too heavy to carry. I have never seen that before, and I've been attending gun shows since the mid-1970s.\"\n \n From November through to March, the number of FBI background checks administered when someone purchases a gun jumped 29 percent to 3.8 million, compared to the same period last year. A survey by industry researcher SportsOneSource found that firearm sales by large retailers such as Wal-Mart are up 39 percent this year.... \"I think it's a reasonable reaction,\" Novin says of the sales spike. \"This demonstrates that gun owners are determined to exercise their individual, constitutionally protected, Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, safely and responsibly.\" \n",

   "  Obama's court pick, Sotomayor, keeps gun stocks soaring \n President Obama's nomination of federal appeals court Judge Sonia Sotomayor to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice David Souter heralds yet another victory for gun-makers. Yes, you read that right.\n \n Let me explain. \n \n While most investors have been rightly focused on the crisis in the markets and economy lately, some Americans have been focusing on other political issues, namely the Second Amendment.\n \n They wonder, will the Obama Administration and new Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor put the right to bear arms in jeopardy? Clearly, many think so, as evidenced by an increase in gun sales and an associated rally in gun stocks.\n \n .......(Another reason they consider) \n \n You see, the recession has brought massive budget cuts to many municipalities. That means less fire and police protection. \n\n In other words, personal safety is a real consideration to them. \n \n Another thing I think I see is, with things going this bad economically, and with the Obama government firing all of our Economic bullets at once, if this does not work, things can go very bad and in a really big hurry. If that happens, the American Government has NOTHING left that they can do any more, except to watch it all go under! \n \n People want the ability to protect themselves, and what they have, from those who would take it from them. \n \n It is also, very interesting to watch the fact that the more you on the Left try to control them, the more the American citizens seem to rebel! If I read this correctly, and I think I am, there is ONLY so far the American People are prepared to let you go! They are Mad as Heck, and they don't plan to take it anymore! \n \n With Sooooooooooo many Americans armed, buying up everything is sight, and virtually all of the ammo too; I suggest you consider your gun control moves very carefully! The American people just don't want you taking their guns from them, not to mention the proven fact that you do not have the Right! \n \n When I went to a gun show on a Cold and Rainy December day, and because of an overwhelming crush of people, standing in lines that have never been seen before, I was forced to stand in that line for 30 minutes waiting to get in, an hour after the show opened. Totally unprecedented. I began to see this mood developing right before my very eyes. People buying up everything in sight, sending prices threw the roof! I knew then, that they had absolutely NO Intention what so ever, of telling YOU what they had, where they had it,or letting you have it back from them. \n \n Isn't Freedom wonderful, I said to someone in the line! emoticon_smile He and his wife sneered back! No! We won't be able to get what we want, at the best prices anymore! I thought that was very short sighted, because they missed the bigger picture. If people were willing to stand in the cold rain, in a line that was there all day long, they were voting in ways neither party could have ever predicted! They were voting to remain free from those who seek to control them! This is not about guns, I thought!\n \n This is about Freedom! \n \n America! Do you want to be controlled by the Gun Controllers?",

   "  The Right to Bear Arms and the Armed Bears \n The fear of another ban has driven gun and ammunition prices up, as people have rushed to purchase them since Obama's election in November. The price of an AK-47 almost doubled between October and December of 2008. In May, president Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court, which alarmed gun lobists since she has a record of supporting gun control.\n \n In the United States debate also continues on the subject of various interpretations of the Second Amendment to the Constitution. According to a 2008 Gallup survey, a solid majority of the U.S. public (73 percent) believes that the Second Amendment guarantees Americans' right to own guns. Twenty percent believe that the amendment only guarantees this right to the members of the state militia. Also according to Gallup, in 2008 nearly seven out of ten Americans were opposed to a law prohibiting possession of a handgun. \n \n The diversity of legislation surrounding guns in the United States is a result of the country's rich firearms history. Guns are an integral part of the American national identity, beginning with the drive of the pioneers to the West and their need to protect themselves and to hunt. Guns acquired further patriotic symbolism during the Revolutionary War, where the threat of British confiscation sparked the \"shot heard around the world.\"\n \n According to the NRA, in 2008 there were over 250 million privately-owned firearms in the United States, 90 million of them handguns. This number is growing by four million every year. There are 70 to 80 million gun owners. For comparison, the U.S. Army has about 489 thousand people on active duty and approximately 189 thousand in reserve-civilian possession of guns in the United States is higher than within government agencies and the military put together.\n \n Unlike in the United States, the Russian central government has a monopoly on gun legislation along with all other laws. The Soviet Union prohibited civilian gun ownership in 1929. Joseph Stalin has once said: \"We don't let them have ideas. Why would we let them have guns?\"\n\n Humm! Joseph Stalin sounds like some of you on the Left! emoticon_smile",
