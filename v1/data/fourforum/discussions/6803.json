My question to you is; What do you teach them regarding GLBT people? Do you teach them the difference between some thing that is morally wrong for you as a heterosexual and is not morally wrong for a GLBT people? In other words do you teach them that everyone has a different view of what is morally right and wrong? If you teach them that it is morally wrong to be gay and act upon being gay, without teaching them that these are only your pesonal views and not everyone feels this way, then that is just as bad as teaching them to hate GLBT people.\n \n To the subject of the thread I can see it was self defense, but knowing our homophobic double standard justice system, he will probably get life in prison.

But for all we know those may have been street kids. I think kids that hate gay people often learn it through their peers. That's not to say parents can't instill hate in kids. But I think most parents just want to be good parents and raise their kids to be good kids. I'm convinved that a parent can teach his kid that homosexual behavior is wrong and at the same time teach them to be respectful and not to hate others. (just as they do for any moral issue.)

I'd say that thievery is NOT always \"trivially\" demonstrable as immoral. (Take the looting in New Orleans as an example--some of it was to survive.) With moral issues, we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere and decide which side we are on. You say that homophobia is not a moral stance, but no one said it was. I think the morality of homosexuality is a seperate issue than homophobia. A person can believe gay behavior is immoral and not be a homophobe, IMO. \n \n If you want to disagree with the idea that gay relationships are immoral, go ahead. No one's trying to impose this on you and make you think that way. But don't try to tell people how to raise their kids or how to be a parent as you did here in this thread. Everyone has their own beliefs they teach to their kids, and frankly, it's just none of you business. I think you'll better understand this if you are a parent some day.",

And going on some of their past posts, that might be a good thing.emoticon_rolleyes \n \n I remember the first time I heard the joke, \"Know what a.i.d.s. stands for? Another infected d*** sucker.\" And everybody laughs. Moms and dads often make snide comments regarding gays and often it is done in humor as they see it. \"C'mon Jr. Don't be a sissy-boy! Get back on that bike!\" Then, a year or so later they comment negatively on their \"limp wristed, sissy-boy\" neighbor who grows gardenias. Not delivered in hate perhaps, but definitely delivered with a \"better than thou\" attitude making clear that being gay is totally unacceptable.\n \n Trying to dehumanize or belittle a certain group of society is common practice when conditioning or nurturing a superior attitude. Hitler did it with the jews. And even though no half-decent parent may teach their child to hate gays, too many (that bother to teach them at all) teach them to consider gays \"less-than\" heterosexuals. It happens here all the time on this very website. Who can deny that?\n \n I wonder how some in here would react if their very own child came to them and professed to be gay.

   "But other STDs also soar among gay men. (See http://news.yahoo.com/s/hsn/20051109/hl_hsn/syphilisratesrisingamongusmen) The only reason I'm focusing on HIV is that it happens to be one of, if not the most deadly, and is therefore the most alarming. And before you accuse me of slander again, please note that these are simply facts.\n \n\n I thought you said you wanted civil debate? In that case please wait until I accuse you of something before sniping back, ok?\n \n As to your argument, the article you cite also says: \"Chlamydia is the most common of the three diseases covered in the report. \"Almost half of them are among young people ages 15 to 24,\" and that std's are a threat, \"Especially for young women, men who have sex with men, and people of color,'\n By your argument, that would make being a teenager harmful, or being female, which is of course silly. The problem is that you're trying to draw an unwarranted causal relationship. There's nothing inherent with being gay that makes you more likely to engage in unsafe sex than there is with being a young woman. And if you're going to make the claim that gay sex is harmful, then you need to establish that causaul relationship.\n \n \n \n Even if it is strictly an \"unsafe sex\" issue, I can only think of two possibilities: a.) there's something about gay male sex that makes it more prone to HIV infection, or b.) gay men don't like to use protection very much. Logically, that's the only two possibilities I can think of. \n\n Try this for a third one then. HIV is more predominant among gay men in North America because A) it's an STD, and B) patient zero in N.A. was gay. HIV spread through the gay community before people knew what it was, that's why it's so much more predominant there. If patient zero had been straight, then it would have been a predominantly straight disease. And in reference to your a), I again refer you to Africa, where huge segments of the straight population have AIDS.\n \n \n \n\n I think the first part is wrong. I don't think the second part is wrong. And I don't deny that in some ways, gays have been relegated to 2nd class citizens. I think that's unfortunate. That's why I support them having couples' benefits.\n\n Ok, if you want convincing proof it'll take a little research to dig it up. I'll get back to you. In the mean time, if homophobic comments aren't the cause then why do you think that gays have been releagted to second class status?",

Allowing misinformation to spread is wrong.\n \n If the math is causing you trouble, let's try a concrete example. We each have two stacks of playing cards, each with 100 cards. Your stack is almost all clubs and spades, it only has one diamond. My stack has 40 black cards, and 60 red cards. Now, we each will pick a card randomly from our decks, look at it, and put it back.

After my 10 pulls I'll expect to have gotten 6 red cards.\n \n The stacks represent the straight and gay population. A red card is someone infected with HIV; someone in the gay popultion is 60 times more likely to have HIV than someone in the straight population, so you get one red card and I get 60. Choosing a card equates to haveing random, unprotected sex. Because there are 10 times more straights than gays you chose 100 times to my 10. I drew 6 red cards, you drew 1. This gives us 6 gays catching HIV for every one straight, based on random chance and the way the population is distributed. However, in reality the ratio is only 5 to 1. This means that gays are, in fact, beating random chance. They are doing something to tilt the odds in their favor. The only possibility is practicing safer sex.

   "Nope. You brought this up, and if you aren't understanding why you're assertions are wrong, then others might also make the mistake of thinking you're right. Allowing misinformation to spread is wrong.\n\n \n No, we've gotten to the point where we're simply viewing these stats in different ways. You're seeing it as a positive thing because it's proof that gays are using protection. I see it as still a negative thing because it still reflects that they have higher infection rates. It's not worth continuing this, because our interpretations of the stats are different. We're seeing 2 different results from them.\n \n \nIf the math is causing you trouble, let's try a concrete example. We each have two stacks of playing cards, each with 100 cards. Your stack is almost all clubs and spades, it only has one diamond. My stack has 40 black cards, and 60 red cards. Now, we each will pick a card randomly from our decks, look at it, and put it back. You'll do this 100 times with your deck, I'll do it 10 times with mine. After your hundred pulls, you'll expect to have gotten a red card once. After my 10 pulls I'll expect to have gotten 6 red cards.\n \n The stacks represent the straight and gay population.\n\n \n I understand your math completely. But the point is, why are the decks even different in the first place? If both groups are using protection, one shouldn't be getting infection rates any more than the other. In fact, there should be less infections in the gay group, since there are a lot less gays. This is common sense.\n \n \nThis means that gays are, in fact, beating random chance. They are doing something to tilt the odds in their favor. The only possibility is practicing safer sex.\n\n \n Sure, like I said if having more infections instead of many more is considered success, absolutely! Heh, by all means, Let's aim high. Yet none of this changes the fact that there are many more infections among 10% of gays than the other 90% of straights. I have no problem with the idea that gays are beating the odds of what it could be. But if this is what you call success, I'd sure hate to see what you call failure.\n \n \nThere are no studies or medical reports indicating that HIV/AIDS is caused by homosexuality, nor that an uninfected monogamous couple could possibly contract it\n\n \n Agreed; no one has claimed otherwise.\n \n \nRegardless, in this country we don't take away the rights of groups who, for one reason or another, are more likely to contract a non-airborne virus than another. (We don't punish or condemn African-Americans because of sickle-cell anemia, e.g.) \n\n \n Sickle-cell anemia isn't passed on by anything anyone does. Gays (and straights for that matter) have complete control over whether they spread HIV via sex, unlike people do with sickle-cell anemia which is a hereditary disease. If a group continues to engage in a dangerous activity at alamingly high rates more than any other group, knowing full well that it's deadly, then I'd say we should visit the issue of whether they should continue having that right. Does a person's right to unprotected sexual pleasure trump another's right to live? I don't think so. That's not to say that gays shouldn't have the right to marry or have sex; after all straight people sometimes spread HIV too. But the rates should at least be a wake up call to the gay community, and apparently it has yet to truly have that affect. And it's hard to blame people for seeing a groups' completely out-of-control voluntary act that can kill as being immoral.\n \n \nAnd it's particularly idiotic to use such an argument to deny such a group access to an institution (marriage) that traditionally and historically has been touted as discouraging promiscuity\n\n \n Would you respond to repeated burglaries by passing out keys to your house?",

Any random gay is 60 times more likely than a random straight to have HIV at this point. 60! That's the bit of data you keep neglecting. Straights only outnumber gays 10 to 1. 60/10 = 6. Gays should get HIV 6 times more often then straights. The infection rate for gays ought to be 6 times the straight infection rate. This has nothing to do with behaviors or morals. You could replace HIV with the flu, and being straight and gay with living in California or Delaware. If someone is 60 times more likely to have the flu in Delaware than in California, then more people total will catch the flu in Delaware,even though there are far fewer people there. It has nothing to do with Delawarians having unsanitary conditions or not practicing flu containment procedures. It doesn't mean that there's anything different about being a Californian or a Delawarian. The odds are just stacked against those in Delaware.\n \n \n\n If a group continues to engage in a dangerous activity at alamingly high rates more than any other group, knowing full well that it's deadly, then I'd say we should visit the issue of whether they should continue having that right.\n\n However, I have proven here that it's the straights who are practicing unsafe sex at a higher rate than gays.

   "\n It's 5 to 1. We're talking a huge difference, percentage-wise, and again gays only make up less tahn 10% of the population.\n \n \n \n But let's be honest here--if there's THAT much of a discrepancy in the rates, then obviously there's a lot more gay people, percentage-wise, that are being irresponsible. THAT'S the moral issue I have.\n \n \n\n OK, maybe this has been answered already, but you've claimed this a couple times and no one has pointed explicitly to the problem. Let's just assume (this may not be 100% true, but it should be close) that gays only have sex with gays and straights only have sex with straights. This makes two different communities of people that are for our purposes, isolated.\n \n Now let's say there were 100 people in the world, 10 would be gay, right? But since the first person with HIV was gay, let's say 9 gays are infected and only 5 straights. Now, the next generation comes along, another 90 straight and 10 gay, with a new slate. These 10 gays have 19 possible partners now and 9 of them have HIV while the straights have 199 possible partners, 5 with HIV.\n \n Now let's say the straights are irresponsible and 50% use protection but 90% of the gays use protection. This is a big difference and probably unrealistic, but the chances of a straight getting HIV would be (.5*.025) 1.26%. But the odds of a gay getting HIV would be (.1*.47) 4.7%. Even with the gays here exercising so much more care in practicing safe sex, the fact that there's better odds that the person they will have sex with will have HIV overcomes that. This is a little under 4 to 1 by the way and I would guess that the difference between the gays using protection and straights would be closer together than this.",

That's ALL you've shown. \n\n That's all I need to show. If gays were doing something bad, then the infection rate would be worse than random chance. But the infection rate is better than random chance. This proves that gays aren't doing anything bad, that your assertion that being gay is somehow harmful is completely wrong. \n \n \n \n\n Don't you see this? There's a rate infection discrepancy to begin with that's higher, that shouldn't be there. \n\n I've explained this multiple times. I'll do it again. Tell me where you get lost. I'm serious about that too, tell me where this stops making sense to you.\n \n The rate discrepancy is there because gays caught HIV first. The first person to get HIV in North America was gay. Since HIV is an STD, the disease spread through gays before it entered the straight population. By the time anyone knew HIV even existed, alot of gays were infected. Now here's the tricky bit, pay attention here because I suspect this is where you get lost. If a certain population has a high incidence of infection, than the rate of infection will be high in the population. Read that sentence again, because it's the key point you aren't getting. That's why gays, who are 60 times more likely to have hiv than straights at this point, catch hiv more often than straights. 60 times more likely to have hiv, compared to 1/10 the population means 6 times more likely to catch hiv. Not due to any behavior, but simply because the gay population was exposed first.\n \n \n\n Yet they are doing it enough to prevent the sort of HIV infection rates that gays have.\n\n Absolutetly wrong, and further proof that you haven't understood this discussion at all. The only reason that straights aren't catching hiv at the same rate as gays is that fewer straights have hiv, at the moment. But that's changing. Straights aren't exhibiting the same precautionary behavior as gays, and so they'll catch up. If straights don't clue in soon, the way that gays already have, then the infection rate among straights will be far worse than among gays. Straights must stop acting like HIV has anything to do with being gay, or they'll be proven wrong in the worst possible way",

You claim that HIV infection rates show that practicing gay sex is harmful. To do that, you need to show that having gay sex would give you HIV more often than random chance would predict. I've proven that that is not the case. In fact, gays have a lower rate than random chance would predict. Yes, the rate is high. This has nothing to do with the behavior of gays. That's your thesis, that's what you want to prove. You can't just say \"the rate is high\", you must show that this is linked to the behavior of gays. I've proven that it isn't, and that's all I need to prove.

Sure, one could make the argument that more testing is always better, but obviously the gay community had a more immediate need for it.\n\n \n OK, take a deep breath, you don't understand what we are trying to say as shown by your policeman analogy, which is totally different than what we are trying to say. Please try to read this with an open mind.\n \n HIV is a disease you can only get from someone who already has HIV.\n \n In the beginning (and now) there are more gays with HIV than straights\n \n The odds of a gay of getting HIV is 60 times as likely as the odds of a straight getting HIV if no protection is used or if the same percentage of people use protection.\n \n The ammount of gays that get HIV compared to straights that get it is 6 to 1 although with pure chance if no one at all used protection or if straights and gays had the same percentage using protection would be 5 to 1.\n \n \n To go back to your policeman analogy, it actually is applicable. You need a policeman to get a ticket as you need a partner with HIV to get HIV. The only difference is that you don't turn into a policeman when you are given a ticket. So let's pretend that the penalty for speeding is working as a policeman the rest of your life. Also the policemen are all unmarked and plainsclothesed.\n \n There are 2 big cities, one called gayville and the other straightville. Gayville has 25 million people, and 225 million people live in straightville. Now because of the history, 72,745 people in gayville are policemen and 10,256 people in straightville are policemen. To stay true to the analogy we also have to assume that there is always one other person with you when you are driving, maybe a policeman and maybe not. So randomly speeding in gayville gives you a 29% chance of getting caught, because 29% of the people in gayville are policemen. There is a .5% chance of a person in straightville of being caught when they speed. So since .5% times 60 is approximately 29%, there is 60 times the odds of getting caught if you speed in gayville as opposed to straightville.\n \n Now we see the fact that since the population of gayville is one tenth of the population of straightville and that if everyone in gayville sped once and everyone in straightville sped once then approximately 6 times as many people in gayville would have been pulled over and turned into policemen as the people in straightville. As you can see the policemen have only caught 5 times as many people in gayville as the amount of people in straightville. Either that means the people in gayville pick places to speed where they know there are no policemen (have sex with people they know dooesn't have HIV), don't speed (don't have unprotected sex), or just by random chance the people of gayville have better luck.\n \n As you can see also as the amount of gays that get HIV increases, so does the odds of new gays getting HIV as they have sex. If there is a town with more policemen, the odds of getting pulled over is higher. And that's a trend hard to reverse, because when you get pulled over you turn into a policeman, that's what you seem to miss. Please let me know if there's anything you don't understand. The odds of a NEW PERSON getting HIV depends on how many people there are with HIV (how many policemen there are in a neighborhood). Hope you can at least understand what I've been trying to say.",

   "For jyoshu....\n \n \n  Homosexuals are no more promiscuous or predatory than heterosexuals\n There is an extant myth, propagated by the Christian Right, that homosexuals engage in highly promiscuous behavior. Granted, there are some homosexuals that do engage in such behavior. But there are heterosexuals that do the same thing. What is important to recognize is the substantial heterosexist bias that causes people to ignore heterosexual flaws while highlighting homosexual flaws.\n \n a) One study which appears to support the idea that homosexuals are highly promiscuous was published by Bell and Weinberg, and is often cited by the Christian Right, and even some secular sources. However, their data is highly suspicious, and cannot be generalized to the entire homosexual population. Because of their methodology, their data is valuable only as a case study for the sample they studied, but it is not by any means representative of the general gay population. See Appendix A for my specific critique of this study, and why their statistics on gay promiscuity are so bizarrely high.\n \n b) In a study of sexual behavior in homosexuals and heterosexuals, the researchers found that of gay and bisexual men, 24% had one male partner in their lifetime, 45% had 2-4 male partners, 13% had 5-9 male partners, and 18% had 10 or more sexual partners, which produces a mean of less than 6 partners. (The statistics I did by myself using the data presented, which is presented as a percentage of total males interviewed, both gay and straight (p. 345)--they can be verified yourself by looking at the numbers given in the paper)(Fay; n=97 gay males of 1450 males total). In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy). This data indicates that gay men may have fewer number of sexual partners than heterosexuals.\n \n J Billy-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25:52-60\n R Fay-1989, Science 243:338-348\n \n In another set of studies, the first (n=2664) showed that gay men had an average of 6.5 sexual partners in the past 5 years. In fact, the authors of this paper report that \"homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate\" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs). The table indicates the percentage of men having the given number of sexual partners in the previous year [top row: Binson; bottom row: Dolcini]:\n \n orientation no partners 1 partner 2+ partners\n gay 24 % 41 % 35 %\n straight 8 % 80 % 12 %\n \n D Binson-1995: Journal of Sex Research 32: 245-54.\n M Dolcini-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25: 208-14.\n \n A third major study, by Laumann, appears on the surface to indicate that gay men do have many more sexual partners than heterosexual men. However, a more extensive analysis of the data gives a more balanced perspective. Laumann fails to explore the radically skewed nature of the data. Typically this indicates that the mean, the statistic presented by Laumann, may not be the best measure to report. A further analysis of the GSS data (on which Laumann based his results) indicates that the median (50th percentile) number of sexual partners for heterosexuals is five and for homosexuals is six (http://www.jeramyt.org/gss/partners.html). The discrepancy between the mean and median is indicative of a small sub-population of gay males who tend towards high rates of sexual partners, skewing the mean, while the majority of gay men tend to have rates about the same as heterosexual males.\n \n Laumann, Edward, et al.

You just want all gays to look diseased.\n\n \n a.) Indeed, Kronos did prove something in laying out a mathematical look at the stats I linked to. But he didn't disprove any moral view. What he DID prove was that gays are doing better at staving off HIV among gays (at their numerical infection rates) than straights are doing among straights (at the straight numerical infection rates, which are much lower). But again, gays have to work harder at it because of the much higher number of infections in the gay catagory as opposed to the straight. But in reality that's as much proof as his statistical analysis can provide.\n \n b.) You haven't proven anything. I don't mean that to be rude, but take for instance the very last article you posted above. It's about promiscuity, which had not even been brought up prior to the article. The fact is, even if gays and straights have the same amount of promiscuity, gays are at higher risk of HIV infection because of the infection base. I've not been saying that gays are promiscuous. My point is that if someone knows the behavior they are engaging in has a dangerous probability of causing harm, it's immoral to engage in it. That's why I think gay sex is immoral. \n \n c.) I certainly do not want gays to \"look diseased.\" Frankly, I think it's pretty disengenuous of you and anyone else to throw up the \"you hate gays\" smoke screen every time the HIV word is uttered in these forums.

   "\n First, my stance has been that there is 'more potential for harm' in same gender sex. I've not made a blanket statement that it's all harmful (that I'm aware of). Yet that alone warrants an understanding that it's immoral based on the potential for harm. \n\n Which you have failed to show, and I've disproven. But we'll get into that next.\n \n \n\n Second, The 2 points you've made here are connected simple logic of the issue. If we make the argument that pre-16 year olds have more automobile accidents than people over 16, then we can logically assume that there is more potential for harm if pre-16 year olds drive automobiles.\n\n \n No you can't. That's how logic works. You have to show what the connection is. Your example is perfect to show this. If we took your conclusion at face value, we would assume that there's something about being under 16 that make you a bad driver, so we bump the driving age up to 18. But the accident rates don't change. So we bump the age up to 21, then 25, but still no improvement. So we finally sit down and try to draw a connection between 1) and 2) and realize that it isn't age that makes 16 year olds more likely to get into accidents, it's lack of experience driving. Any driver, regardless of age, is more likely to get into an accident the first couple of years after they learn.\n \n Correlation does not equal causation. To say that an action causes harm, you need to link the action to the harm, you need to show that the action is responsible for the harm. You haven't. You in particular haven't shown that gay sex has more potential for harm than any other sort of sex. Your conclusion doesn't logically follow from the data.",

There is correlation between ice-cream sales and drowning accidents. But drowning accidents are not caused by ice-cream purchases (or sale) but both drowning accidents and ice-cream purchases are caused by good (sunny) weather.",

If we took your conclusion at face value, we would assume that there's something about being under 16 that make you a bad driver\n\n \n Well I see one problem in your view: you are assuming that the whole thing is a value judgement. Assuming that gays should not engage in a certain behavior because there is a very significant chance they will be harmed is not a value judgement about a person. In fact if anything, it's a protective measure.\n \n \nso we bump the driving age up to 18. But the accident rates don't change. So we bump the age up to 21, then 25, but still no improvement. So we finally sit down and try to draw a connection between 1) and 2) and realize that it isn't age that makes 16 year olds more likely to get into accidents, it's lack of experience driving.\n\n \n Which, for all practical purposes, means age. Your point doesn't change anything here--call it an experience matter all you want, we still logically don't allow young inexperienced drivers to drive because they have accidents. Same difference. A + B results in C. You are trying to add a third letter somewhere into the equation when it's not necessary. Some matters of causation are obvious. \n \n \nAny driver, regardless of age, is more likely to get into an accident the first couple of years after they learn.\n\n \n If that were relevant, then we wouldn't base it on a certain age at all. We'd give 10 year-olds a driver's license if they could demonstrate they could safely operate a vehicle. In these sort of issues, age IS how experience is measured. If it makes you feel better, reread my analogy and put \"young and inexperienced\" in place of 16 year olds. Same difference.\n \n \nCorrelation does not equal causation. To say that an action causes harm, you need to link the action to the harm\n\n \n If A is a person, B is touching a hot stove, then C is potential harm. We don't need a link--the link is already there by the nature of the issue. A is gay people, B is gay sex in a community with a large HIV infection base, then C is potential for harm. This is elementary logic, and you know this. \n \n \n You in particular haven't shown that gay sex has more potential for harm than any other sort of sex.\n\n \n You have got to be kidding me.
