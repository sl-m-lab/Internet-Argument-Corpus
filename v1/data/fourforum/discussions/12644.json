   "I could write a lengthier introduction to this thread but I think the title pretty much says it all, so I won't elaborate much further. \n \n I do want to add the circumstances of my own \"evolution\" on the issue and I'll also add what I think it would take to change my mind again on the matter.\n \n My first introduction to the word \"abortion\" came about 1972-1973. It had nothing to do with \"babies\" or women or anything like that. I was only about 11 years old and our pet calico cat (Patches) got her entire hind quarters mangled somehow. We think it was a car engine.\n \n At any rate, we rushed her to the vet and he tried to save her hind legs and life. She later got so infected the vet had to put her down. \n \n But during the ordeal, I remember my step-mom telling my dad that the vet \"had to take the kittens.\" \n \n \"What kittens?\" I asked. \"Where are they?\"\n \n \"They are dead\", she said,... \"the Dr. had to abort them,... they were only about the size of a walnut.\"\n \n I missed our cat and felt bad that we didn\"t even get to see her kittens,... \n \n You might think that this is the event that made up my mind about abortion, but it's not. I was eleven and didn't know (didn't care) about girls, how babies are made or any of that. This did however come back to me later, and that's why I mention it now.\n \n Fast forward about 6 years and I started working and driving myself to school. I started dating. And I now had classes in health and biology. None of which (at that point) heightened my awareness about abortion. Neither did it raise any concerns.\n \n Then one day while talking about a girl I liked to my step-mom,... My step-mom said; \"you do know that if you get some girl pregnant, she'll have to get an abortion.\" \n \n \"You're too young,\" she said. \"You can't even take care of yourself.\"\n \n Never mind my rebellious attitude toward my insistent step-mom,.. (what does she know? or care?) I had a job and my own money and I wasn't trying to bed the girl anyway. I was just talking about a date.\n \n (Good thing this is the short version, huh?) \n \n \n Anyway,.. I'll try to wrap this up.\n \n Not long after I started dating and getting into more and more serious relationships,... it was sex, not abortion that became the topic of conversation. \n \n It was only after having several of these dating relationships that I finally had to address the \"what if I get pregnant?\" question?\n \n I thought that it would impress the girl I was with if I stepped up and said,.. \"if you get pregnant, I guess I'll be a daddy.\" Well that was what she wanted to hear,... But it didn't get me into her pants either.\n \n So that didn't work...\n \n A couple years later, while dating a different girl,.. and having had the same conversations a few more times, (and after finally losing my virginity),... we were driving down the road and came upon a billboard size picture of an aborted baby. The only words on the sign said \"choose life.\"\n \n At first glance, the picture looked like a mix between peanut butter and jelly with some fish bones sticking out of it.\n \n This started the first REAL, (I would say) Mature discussion that I ever had about the subject.\n \n Oddly enough, we both had the same reaction,... we both agreed that we probably wouldn't want an abortion,... but why would anyone put something that gross and disgusting up in a public place?\n \n At that point, I believed that she and I felt the same about abortion.\n \n A few weeks later, we were on yet another date,.. and we drove near a crowd of people walking a picket line. They were carrying signs and shouting at people. There were horns honking. Bibles waving in the air,... and (remembering how gross the billboard was) I couldn't resist yelling at the \"bunch of ######.\" I remember yelling \"STFU and mind your own business!\"\n \n I had arrived at one of the most common mindsets regarding abortion; \"I would never want to have an abortion (have my child aborted),... but who am I to tell anyone else what they can or can't do with their body?\"\n \n My girlfriend agreed!\n \n Then, about three months later,... She came to me.\n \n Crying.\n \n She said \"I'm late.\"\n \n \"Late for what?\" I asked.\n \n She said, she was pregnant and she wanted $250.00 \n \n She didn't say it was for an abortion and she didn't have to.\n \n \"\"\"NOT MY CHILD!\"\"\" \n \n I said. \"I'll chain you to the bed before I let you kill our child.\" \n \n \"What's the matter with you? I said; \"I love you.\" \"We talked about this.\"\n \n She just walked away.\n \n A week later, she told me,... she promised me that it was all just a false alarm.\n \n But now, my personal views were more set than ever.\n \n I still believed the same \"I don't want mine aborted, but who am I to tell another,...\" \n \n Only now, it was in the front of my mind and not buried in the Grey area.\n \n I'm going to split this into two posts.",

   "Ok,.... to finish the story.\n \n I'm in my early 20's, abortion as it plays into relationships is no longer a stranger to me and I'm dating again.\n \n Now, more than ever before,.. I'm determined to make sure that whoever I date agrees with me on abortion so I don't ever have to go through that again. Don't get me wrong, it didn't always come up in first 2nd or 3rd dates. (It wasn't that many relationships either.) But always, when I thought the time was right, we would discuss abortion. I even shared with some of my dates, the story of the one who wanted the money for the abortion.\n \n Some young women that I dated liked my wanting to make sure we agreed,... that abortion was not something I wanted for my kid,... that I wanted to be a dad, etc. And frankly some were turned off by it. They couldn't even continue the conversation.\n \n Two girls I dated had had an abortion. One of them couldn't see me anymore because she said she felt ashamed.\n \n I really liked her and didn't really care that she had-had an abortion. It's wasn't my child and it was before she knew me,...\n \n Fast forward a few more years and one day, down the street from my house,... I passed another group of people waiving signs and pictures of aborted babies and such,... This time they were close to MY house!\n \n I shook my head and muttered to myself,.. \"what a bunch of ######.\" \"Look at em.\" \"Nothing better to do with their time.\"\n \n I told an uncle about the protest as he lived close by too. He was the first guy that I ever mentioned abortion to.\n \n It was fall 1989.\n \n My uncle said, \"oddly enough, there's a guy on the radio, you should listen to.\" \"He does this thing called caller abortions.\" \"His name is Rush Limbaugh.\" \"You've got to hear it.\"\n \n So, the next week or so, I tried and finally found the show. I listened long enough to know I couldn't stand the S.O.B. and I wanted to reach through my radio and rip his condescending head off. He never played a caller abortion while I had the radio on. I would hear people call him and complain. I would hear him mention it,... etc.\n \n And then explained WHY he was doing it.\n \n Rush said something like \"I intentionally play those sounds to get the very reactions you give me.\" \n \n \"Imagine what it means that you get more bent out of shape over a stupid imitation of an abortion than you do a REAL one taking place right down the street from your house.\"\n \n Having the protesters near my home,... Rush now had my un-divided attention.\n \n He went on to say that he \"believes that every human being's life begins at conception and that it's not possible to begin it at any other point in time or by any other means.\" He also challenged his audience to prove it can begin any other way!\n \n Ah-HA! (I thought)--- \"I got him!\"\n \n I started reading about abortion. I didn't have a computer yet,... Neither did anyone I knew. I started talking to more and more people, telling them of this challenge. We talked about the test-tube baby. We talked about our own personal views. We talked about the religious aspects,... But I kept coming back to conception. \n \n The first chance I got,... I bought a computer. My friends at work told me of a \"Bulletin board\" called \"FIDO-NET\" where you could \"log on\" and meet people and debate things like politics, abortion if that's what you're interested in,... etc.\n \n It took a while,.. but I finally got online to the BBS. \n \n We used a off line mail editor called the \"Blue wave\" mail reader. And it took FOREVER to connect, download, upload and post messages.\n \n I was on a mission now,.. I had dropped over $2,500.00 for a 386 PC. A 2400 baud modem and a color monitor. Running Dos 3.0 and a relatively new program called \"CompuServe.\"\n \n During all the distraction and learning curve of learning computers, I gave up on the abortion thing. I even gave up on Rush. \n \n But, just for grins... Hidden behind my anonymity I posted a new thread titled \"ABORTION IS MURDER I CAN PROVE IT!\"\n \n And I waited for a response.\n \n When the responses came, I just posted what Rush said,... which was all it took for me to realize that yes,.. biologically speaking a new life begins at conception. \n \n I didn't know about DNA,.. genetics was a brand new discovery and if it was ever discussed, I didn't notice it. \n \n Long story short,.. I had this faint conviction that Rush was right,... but I didn't have a clue on how to argue the point. The responses I got were so well worded, the posters vocabulary so much greater than my own,.. their ability to make me look and feel stupid even when I knew I was right infuriated me.\n \n I upgraded to AOL (I bet that's the first time that line has been used in nearly 10 years)\n \n I discovered other \"chat rooms\" and subsequently got banned from many of them just for trying to have a discussion about abortion. \n \n I found out that I was the exception to the rule in that I could be convinced by such a simple observation as Rush's,... but others were completely un-affected by it.\n \n STILL,.. My position remained that I was against abortion for myself,... and other than trying to convince others that life begins at conception,... I wasn't into the legality thing at all. I had skimmed Roe v. Wade, Griswold v. Connecticut,.. and other landmark cases,... But the legal #### did nothing for me.\n \n During all this, I was dating again. And in the midst of an election year, an on again off again relationship,... I got sent out of state for more school. My date and I stopped for lunch before I left and we agreed to take a break again from our relationship while I was away,... She commented on how she had this odd sticky sweaty clamminess to her hands. I remember taking them into mine and saying to her,.. \"you're pregnant,.. you better go get checked.\"\n \n I got the call while I was out of state that I was right. She was pregnant. We were both opposed to abortion and we were about to go our separate ways.\n \n The pregnancy was a tedious, draining nightmare. There were some good times too,... don't get me wrong. But my (by then) wife contracted \"Toxemia.\" She was given magnesium and other drugs to try to keep her body from rejecting the babies. We had to grow up fast and learn a lot about babies and such even faster.\n \n I attended Lamaze classes,.. and it was only then that I looked closely at the biological development of prebirth children. MY child was in there. MY child's life was in danger because my wife's body was rejecting it. Our daughter finally had to be induced 6.5 weeks preemie. She was charcoal black from the magnesium and stress and not breathing when she was born. There was no \"Dad cut the cord\" or anything like that,... she was rushed straight to the neo-natal-NICU. I helped the Dr.s get her to take her first breath. I held my hand over her eyes to shield them from the light and I was the first to see her open her (then) coal black eyes. She weighed only 4lbs 5 oz. \n \n Two years later, our marriage was over. long story short and many many details omitted,.. I came away with physical custody and I raised my daughter for nearly 10 years by myself. \n \n It was during my (then) wife's pregnancy, the Lamaze and the birth itself,... That the abortion issue brought me the furthest to the point that I am at today. \n \n To the point that I am driven as much by the ignorance and denials; denials about what I know; the denials held by others,.. than I am by the knowledge about abortion itself.\n \n Maybe it will be for another thread,... But there was a time when I actually co-responded for a short time with Norma McCorvey (aka Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade). Norma is a very nice lady. She is also a very vulnerable, skeptical and somewhat confused lady. She is passionately religious now about Her views regarding abortion and it was MY insistence that religion have nothing to do with the debate that drove the two of us apart.\n \n I will forever be grateful to Norma for corresponding with me and for giving me a chance to work with her efforts to (now) overturn the ruling that she now regrets being part of.\n \n I should add my answer to the question; \"What does it take to change my mind regarding abortion?\"\n \n It would take the same thing Rush challenged me with 20 years ago. Someone would need to prove to me that a person's life does not begin at and by their conception,... but by some other means or at some point in time thereafter.\n \n Good luck.",

   "Haven't I given you many possible 'start points'? And provided evidence that conception is a relatively minor event?\n \n Other points for a 'beginning' (note I don't particularly believe all of these):\n 1. When the mind develops to the extent that a foetus is concious of what happens to it. This is corroborated by the fact that a person is only considered medically 'dead' when their brain function has ceased - despite the fact that many of the cells in their body are still 'alive' and they may even be breathing and have a heartbeat, thanks to modern life support machines. The presence of 'a mind' is also the rationale by which many people are against cruelty to animals, etc - but think nothing of mowing their lawn or uprooting weeds.\n \n 2. When the sperm and egg that will eventually fuse to become a zygote are created. This is corroborated by the fact that the sperm and egg are the 'alive' cells which will go on to create a new individual - the zygote is only a middle step.\n \n 3. When the umbilical cord is cut. This is corroborated by the fact that up until this point, the foetus is a biological 'part' of the mother, with the same blood supply etc. The standard 'foetus as symbiote/parasite' argument.\n \n You know my arguments against conception...",

You need to stop it already with these women's rights arguments. A fetus is NOT part of a woman's body. It is simply inside of her, attached by the umbilical chord. The woman cannot have two separate sets of DNA in her same body, that is not how it works. Clearly, the fetus is a separate being.\n \nhis is corroborated by the fact that up until this point, the foetus is a biological 'part' of the mother, with the same blood supply etc. The standard 'foetus as symbiote/parasite' argument.\n\n Actually, that is incorrect. The fetus's blood is not at all connected nor does it intermingle with the mother's blood. Often, the fetus has a separate blood type, and the same human body cannot have 2 separate blood types nor can it have two separate sets of DNA.\n A fetus is attached to the mother and is inside of the mother, but it is a separate human life. Period. All humans deserve the right to live.\n \n I advise everyone to watch at least the first three minutes of this video:\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPF1FhCMPuQ\n The woman in the video survived an abortion and is speaking about how she would never have wanted to died. Not only that, but this woman is also disabled with Cerebral Posy, and still wants life despite he disability. She is very Christian, but that does not mean that what she says is false. She survived an abortion, and now she is fighting against it. Where was her right to live?",

Surely something that simple would take almost less words than were needed to tell me how simple it is, no?\n \n To summarise Lakrite (and my responses):\n Q1. The foetus is not 'part' of the body, but 'attached to' the body.\n A1. 'attached to' is what defines 'part of' - as nicely stated by Archangel for me.\n\n \n That's clearly a misrepresentation of what I said. I pointed out that an arm is surely attached to ones body, but Lakrite clearly showed why a fetus isn't.\n \n \nQ2. The foetus and the mother have different blood types.\n A2. Yes - but nutrients and oxygen pass directly from the mother's blood to the foetus, and waste products go the other way. The foetus may have a different blood supply, but it's using the mother's organs in order to survive.\n\n \n You are attempting to imply that a natural process of a developing life during the gestation period is therefore a part of ones body as a limb is. That is fallacious since the gestation process is a specific period of time before the separate life becomes independent of its mother. Do we eventually give birth to our limbs or any part of our bodies which then go on to be sentient beings? Of course not.\n \n \nQ3. The foetus and mother have different DNA\n A3. Human individuals exist who are composed of more than one type of DNA, and some individuals have identical DNA. From this, it can be deduced that 'unique DNA' does not mean individuality.\n\n \n Bull!!! Just because there are exceptions to a rule, does not mean the exception is the norm in any way, or to even be expected. But can you show where the seam person has more than one type of DNA \"NATURALLY\", without having gone through some medical procedure?",

These people were supposed to be aborted, and lived. They all WANTED to live. Why should they not have that right?\n \nOn April 22, 1996, Gianna testified before the Constitution Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee on the issue of abortion. Sadly, out of 13 members of the subcommittee, only 2 were willing to listen to her testimony; abortion supporters boycotted the meeting.\n\n The abortion side tends to plug their ears and go \"nah nah nah\" when they know someone might potentially change their minds or give them guilt.

You state that a mother and a fetus are part of the same body because they are biologically connected by the umbilical cord. Yet you consider conjoined twins, also biologically connected, two separate bodies. Huh? And there is something called childbirth that will physically separate the fetus from the mother...\nActually, you're following my reasoning pretty well, so far. It's simply that you are using you own assumption - that a foetus is an 'individual' - in order to try and fault it. By my reasoning, a (early) foetus is not an individual - it is simply part of the mother's body. With this initial condition, your post kinda falls apart. \n At a certain point, a foetus will become an individual, and your own post gives a clue as to where. Remember saying that 'Identical twins are essentially one body controlled by two minds'? A foetus is not under control of it's own body for most of it's development, because it doesn't have a mind with which to do the controlling. As such, it is part of the mother's body - until it develops a mind of it's own.\n That turning point - the introduction of 'mind' - is where I would say individuality occurs.\n \n \nSo if I understand correctly pregnant women are chimeras? The problem with this chimera argument is that a person who is a chimera can never remove one of the DNA sets from his or her body. A pregnant woman is not a chimera, she simply has to give birth and she will not have the new set of DNA.\n Furthermore, chimeras are the result of twins merging into one. A fetus and a mother are not twins. The fetus has DNA COMPLETELY foreign to the mother's body or any person in the mother's biological family. The fetus has DNA of the father. So this entire chimera argument is quite ridiculous.\nBolded for contradiction.\n \n I'm not quite sure what you're talking about here - I don't think you have understood my point correctly. To clarify, then - a chimera is an individual whose body is composed from more than one different DNA strand - for example, the DNA in my left arm could be different from the DNA in my right leg. To say that unique DNA = unique individual implies that a chimera is two individuals. Clearly this isn't the case - one mind, one individual, two DNA types. \n Incidentally, contrast this with conjoined twins - two minds, one DNA type, two individuals. This is further evidence that it is the mind, not DNA, that implies individuality.\n \n \nIdentical twins still do not have identical DNA, no matter how similar... \n\n But from what point? At the initial point, where the fertilised zygote splits, identical twins probably do have identical DNA - the identical-ness in conjoined twins strongly implies this. It's only later that one twins DNA changes, as the individual develops. Again, there is a separation between conception and 'individuality'.\n \n \nThe bolded is true. The rest are fallacious. \n [flame snipped]\n I have made my point and see no reason to continue to try to convince you of it.\nYou're going to have to learn, at some point, that simply 'stating your opinion' is not the same as 'making your point'. To 'make your point' you have to actually back up your opinion, and then defend the backing-up if it is attacked. As we're about to see, your 'backing-up' kinda relies heavily on the conclusions of the argument you are putting forwards - and you seem to be refusing to defend your 'backing-up'.\n Ah well. You put in more effort than Chuz, at least.\n \n \n[flame snipped]\n Really? fertilisation is just another step (which preceds implantation,? Can you name one other step other than fertilization which could cause a new life to form in a woman's womb?\nThis is circular reasoning. You're using your conclusion in order to back up your conclusion (that conception is when new life is formed).\n Conception is not where new life is formed, simply new DNA. As such - fallacious point.\n Incidentally, I could probably find people who would argue that each of those 'steps' is the significant one, amongst many others. You have Catholics ('every sperm is sacred'), people such as yourself ('DNA = life'), people like cyberateos ('an egg should be considered as 'born' at the moment of implantation'), people like Sinjin and (to an extent) myself ('you need a mind for individuality'), etc, etc...\n \n 'Life' is subjective.\n \n \nNo ian, you are attempting to argue a natural function and process which is the reason for survival and propagation of the human race with examples which is they became the norm would lead to our extinction. But I guess from the perspective of an evolutionist, if such a mutation became universal, you would just consider it to be another step in the evolutionary process. \nI'm not sure how this is relevant (seeing as it doesn't actually address my point), but I'll respond to it anyway. You are characterising chimeras as 'un-natural' in order to dismiss them, because they poke holes in your 'absolute' view of life. Given that such 'flukes of nature' do exist, however - is it not possible that your 'absolute' is incorrect, instead?\n \n As an aside, both Chimera twins, identical twins and conjoined twins are all perfectly able to reproduce - the original 'siamese twins', Chang and Eng Bunker, fathered 21 children between them (11 to one, 10 to the other).

   "In this argument the burden of proof is on you. You were the first to argue that a human being must have a mind in order to be a human being, and you stated a fetus does not have one. Where is your evidence?\n\n Let's split this up a bit. \n Firstly, I stated that a 'mind' implies an individual - and provided my reasoning. \n \n Secondly, I stated that at some point a foetus acquires a 'mind'/conciousness/awareness - implying, as you say, that an early foetus does not have one. However, it was you who stated that a foetus could have a 'mind' without a fully developed brain - for that (the metaphysical aspect), the burden stays with you.\n \n Some evidence for my part, then:\n \n From your website: The developing foetus, weeks 25 - 40. \n\"The most dramatic growth takes place in the brain with new brain cells and many new connections between cells forming by the minute. The long root-like extensions called axons carry electrical signals from one part of the brain to another, some over quite long distances. A fatty substance, called myelin, develops around the axons, allowing the electrical signals to move much more rapidly and efficiently.\n \n A lot of the brain growth in the third trimester (and in the first two to three years of life) involves laying down of myelin. Myelin is also important in the spinal cord and the nerves that reach to every part of the body, allowing the quick back and forth flow of information that is required for coordinated, skillful movement. The jerky, poorly coordinated movements of newborns (and particularly in premature infants) are due in large part to their relative lack of myelin.\"\nEssentially - it's only as myelin is laid down that the brain begins to actually function as a brain - before, it is simply being set up, ready for use (as it were). You can see the effects of reduced myelin in multiple sclerosis sufferers - they have reduced faculties ranging from vision to co-ordination to cognition, depending on the neurones affected. Before the 25-40 week point when foetuses have no myelin, this affects every faculty - and to a vastly increased level.\n \n From a seperate source - foetal awareness - \"Evidence is imprecise, but the fetus is probably not capable of being aware before 16 weeks, and has the mechanisms necessary for awareness after 26 weeks.\"\n \n I could go on, but that should do for now, especially as you haven't provided any evidence of your own.\n \n This has been my argument all along - that each foetus should be checked, my a doctor, for signs that it has achieved awareness (note - not simply reflexive actions). If it has, an abortion should not be allowed unless there are health issues. If it hasn't, the abortion should be fully legal.\n \n EDIT: Just to repeat one of my points from a previous post - as you have said, before 8 weeks an embryo - which you consider to be an 'individual' - does not even have a distinguishable brain, let alone a sufficiently developed one.

   "I believe it should be legal but I don't attempt to pretty up my view. It should be legal because frankly its provides revenue (for all you pro-choicers its a business just like nearly every other medical procedure if you think they're not turning a profit you've got your head in the clouds) helps stop poverty (most of them are the ones getting the abortions which is a good thing) and overpopulation (less people = less competition) We already have competition with other countries we don't need it with each other. \n \n Of course when this reaches ridiculous levels and there's a negative birth rate the immigrants will be able to get more jobs. There's always more people. Of course when seeing this as a gender issue one has to realize that more girls are aborted then boys. (Which again population control = good thing) this is going to have societal consequences. People have more opportunities, life is easier for women and men. Of course people would see lives as being ended. Also this might lead to pregnant women/single mothers being more disadvantaged then usual with the \"she could just get an abortion/she could have gotten an abortion\" argument.\n \n Increased discrepancy between females and males could lead to forced marriages, rapes, an increased slave trade and more being forced into prostitution (which some believe will happen in India if they keep their current sex selective abortion up) \n \n Some would prefer to have a boy rather than a girl and its a women's control over her own body.

Both, for example, believe that the Constitution does not protect a woman&#8217;s right to abortion. &#8220;An originalist on abortion would say that at the time of the Constitution, or of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, abortion was prohibited, and that&#8217;s it,&#8221; Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, said. &#8220;A conservative like Roberts, on the other hand, wouldn&#8217;t look immediately at the question of whether all abortions should be outlawed, but examine the specific restriction on abortion rights at issue in the case and probably uphold it. He&#8217;d avoid the culture-war rhetoric and gradually begin cutting back on abortion rights without making lots of noise about getting rid of it altogether.&#8221; In 2007, Roberts joined Kennedy&#8217;s opinion that followed this approach in upholding a federal anti-abortion law.

It's a meaningless point in time relative to the MILLIONS of complex interactions that are necessary for an airplanes life-cycle.\n \n Conception is the formation of a zygote, two gametes that are wonderfully complex machines that come in contact in a VERY small subset of life forms (most life-forms do not use sex-discrimination as a method of reproduction).\n \n If you looked at primitive single-celled micro-biology, you'd be hard pressed to even begin to quantify it's beauty and complexity. The fact that a subset of micro-biology happens to congregate into multi-cellular organisms for 'communal living' has both advantages and disadvantages (microbes will survive global warming, will we?). With multi-cellular life, there's sex and sexless reproduction... Again, the conception (from a mechanical perspective) is all but meaningless.\n \n So to give significance to conception reveals several things about the promoter:\n 1) There is little appreciation, or at least little awareness of the scope of complexities (i.e. how primitive humans and our brains are compared to the mechanics of our micro-biological constituents)\n 2) There is little appreciation, or at least little awareness of the insignificance of conception as a process (it merely promotes genetic diversity without the aid of external agents like viruses)\n 3) There is likely an overt indoctrination of a spiritual element to conception/birth - cognitive dissidence is common where a decision that you've made earlier in your life (i.e. that the church is a good source of wisdom) preempts future decisions, even in the face of new logical evidence. \n \n It follows that 'life' as is primitively portrayed in the \"pro-life\", \"pro-abortion\" debate neglects the fact that we are not individuals, but a collective of billions of life-forms. Many of which dedicate their brief life to specific mechanical functions (formation of skin, hair, red-blood-cells, gametes, etc). Cells regularly 'commit suicide' for the good of the collective (they are programmed to do so). Thus the loss of a cell's life is precious, to be honored, and for the purposes of our discussion, to be taken in context.\n \n A zygote is nothing more than a fraction of a second after a mechanical process of two would-be-dead gametes. There is no \"injection-of-a-soul\". In Rush's paradigm, I challenge you to know otherwise. There is no measureable change in energy/mass or even appearance. Nothing more than can be derived by watching individual molecular structures interacting with their otherwise boring chemical surroundings.\n \n A 'soul', as many would promote, must either be intrinsically present before the zygote or be non-existent.

By having sex, both the man and the woman must be willing to accept the natural result of sex.\n \n You make too many unfounded assumptions in this claim.\n 1) Pregnancy is the natural result of sex.. But death is the natural result of an abortion. Both are very natural processes. Killing is a very natural and necessary action. You wouldn't live very long without it.\n \n 2) Your thread makes a moral judgement about the right-to-life of the fetus, and the general immorality of killing [a fetus]. What is the basis of this morality? Meaning what is the logic (or if you prefer) the dogma that encompases this morality. You can't say Christianity because it has no definitive ruling (the Jesus quote of acting on the least of my children is completely out of context). You can extrapolate Judaisum or possibly Islam or eastern religions which give hundreds of specific divine laws. Their divine rulings may apply. But I suggest that they do not (for the same reason that they don't apply to the decision about whether to use fossil fuels v.s. renuable fuels as a moral decision). Their 'divine wisdom' as it were is out of context. At best you can extrapolate, which is subject to the biases of the reader.\n \n 3) Even if you can extrapolate some exerpts from a sacred doctrine, are you able to reconsile other exerpts from the same document? The areas of the Jewish texts have hundreds of laws which we do not have any interest in upholding today. Christians cherry-pick which verses are relevant (again, the biased extrapolation). \n \n Several examples:\n \n Do you support capital punishment (the unwelcome death of a fully healthy human)\n Do you support euthenasia (the easing of the suffering of an unhealthy human)\n Do you support the slaying of a military opponent (sanctioning war)\n Do you support the condeming of your fellow country-man to death by sending them to a war with a known high casualty rate for reasons other than emminant homeland defense (i.e. Russians defending Moscow literally at the gates in WW I).\n Do you reject universal health-care, all but guaranteeing deaths that COULD be prevented by submitting to slightly higher taxes.\n Do you reject welfare, thereby condeming the poor to life in squalar and likely starvation.\n Do you support game-hunting, promoting the death of healthy life for reasons other than survival - rather, merely for amusment\n Do you support FDA regulation of harmful substances to include alcohol, marajana, tobacco, experimental drugs, etc. The government allowance of known harmful substances is condoning murder/suicide. (murder by the seller/pusher, suicide by the user).\n \n \n There are no necessarily right or wrong answers to the above - but I argue that you can NOT answer the question of the morality of abortion in a vacuum.",

   "the foetus is alive, she/he is an actual life. gametes are potential lives\n \n \n \n But you said before that the foetus was only a 'potential life'.\n \n\n \n Sorry dudes and dudettes, gametes and fetus's and zygotes are biologically identical (or at least similar in complexity to several orders of magnitude). If one can be considered 'alive' then they're all alive (unless you want to get into the spiritual dimension, which I'd rather not - it's he-said/she-said impervious to logic). The fact that two are only carrying only half a blue-print is irrelevant, as the blueprints not directly utilized by the living, moving, breathing cells.\n \n What I get from this thread, and I can empathize, is the 'emotional' aspect. Things just 'feel' wrong. And that's fine. But consider whether your emotional experiences justify the sanctioning of laws that affect other people. Some people get very angry when somebody cuts them off in traffic. I don't mean they're frustrated, I mean red-in-face angry. This is an emotional problem that they have to deal with. Does this mean we should pass a law? Maybe. It 'feels' unfair that aggressive drivers can cut in line or risk near-accidents. But ultimately not everybody is as negatively affected as this type of individual.\n \n Likewise with abortion. I've seen all the propaganda movies about late term abortion. But my grounding in science is such that I don't have the same emotional reaction as many other people in my class. And most importantly, what's shown in those 'slasher movies' is almost completely unrelated to what most people mean when they say abortion.. And by abortion, I mean 'the morning after pill'. There's no suction and crushing of the skull going on here. The degree of emotional attachment to the word 'abortion' is intentional in these movies. The expression should be '3rd trimester abortion', and these are EXTREMELY rare in the world.\n \n While I'm not emotionally moved by 3'rd trimester abortion, I certainly can see why most people would be.. And personally I don't even have a problem with making 3'rd trimester abortion illegal.. Ideally I'd like to preserve the health of the mother-clause (which as I hear almost never actually comes up). But ultimately laws are about the will and morality of the people.. Constitutional legacy is 100% irrelevant because we can ammend the constitution.. Who gives a #### what the founding fathers intended. Were they God's? Should we spend then next 10,000 years trying to figure out what they meant? No, set the laws for the day we live in. And today, we have people that want abortions (at least in the first 2 trimesters).\n \n Given the fact that American economic / foreign policy is decided based on the argument that 3'rd trimester abortions == all abortions == the soul being crushed. I'm willing to compromise to send the red-necks back to their campers and out of the ballot box. (I know, tell us what you really think).",

All it would take for me to change my views on abortion would be for someone to somehow convince me that a person's life \"begins\" at some point after conception.\n \n I believe the Constitution secures the rights of all persons as \"biological\" beings,... not spiritual or metaphysical ones.... Specifically, if you are a human being (organism of the human species) you have a right to your life whether \"souls\" exist or whether \"personality\" is just a chance chemical reaction in your brain.\n \n So, you see.... since \"souls\" are not factored into my basis at all,...

You are correct, that a soul has a difficult time entering into a legal definition - unless you're among the many current theocracies of the world.\n \n What I would say to that, is that a government has a need to protect it's citizens, and thus we have the murky question of at what point the pre-child can be considered a citizen. While certainly you can argue that as soon as the child COULD survive outside it's mother, the government COULD keep the child alive and thus COULD have a legal obligation to protect it. meaning immediately after conception.
