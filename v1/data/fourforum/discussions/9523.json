   "From Pharyngula's blog via IIDB: The Irreducible Complexity Evolver\n \n Yes, folks, it's a simple genetic algorithm based on known mutation types and natural selection. It will sometimes produce irreducibly complex individuals.\n \n To understand how the algorithm works, see the text below the applet.\n \n I've run three extended trials. One ended up essentially \"dead,\" and one didn't produce any IC individuals before I restarted it, but the other produced three in fewer than 350 generations.\n What some people here may find interesting is to see the beneficial patterns that emerge from RMNS. For example, in one of my runs, nearly every surviving individual had an R in box (6,9), which redirects points to the counter. Many of these had an L in box (4,9), which does the same. In another trial, most individuals' column 4 had a large string of As to increase points before large messes of splits and redirects. Another trial ended up with an L in (3,9) but an S in (4,9), funneling points into the counter. This trial later ended up with As replacing the Ss in (4,9), funneling extra points into the counter.\n \n These trends each arose randomly and were implicitly selected for by the algorithm. This is precisely how RMNS works, despite the insistence by some members here that randomness cannot play any part in increased fitness. So unless the genetic algorithm is alive, or each \"individual\" has a conscious life force...",

Why cannot ALL organisms adapt at will to a changing environment? Your acolyte Bertha Jane declared that not all will adapt because not all are able to. Hmmm.... If they are not all able to, then what makes those that are abvle to adapt able to do so?\n \n If EAM were real, why are there no real-life examples - examples that do not rely on angry proclamations and accusationsfrom its advocate?\n \n *this is simlar to google expertise, but more deserving of ridicule",
