   "The history of Globalism has been one of failure and the latest edition is no different. According to John Ralston Saul, author of The Collapse of Globalism, it reached its peak in the mid 1990s with the WTO (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION) and is now on the way out. There are some true believers, however, (like George Bush) who continue to push for this New World Order. During his recent visit to South America Bush tried to sell this recipe for disaster (the FTAA) to Brazil and other nations that oppose it.\n \n Saul gives a list of examples in which attempts to run the world, or a large part of it, through trade, have not been successful. This includes the latest effort by leaders of multinational corporations in our hemisphere, who approach their task with a \"near religious conviction\" \"...that nation-states were heading toward irrelevance, to be replaced by the power of global markets; that economics, not politics or arms, would determine the course of human events; that growth in international trade would foster prosperous markets that would, in turn, abolish poverty and change dictatorships into democracies.\"\n \n Quite the opposite. Check out the dismal results experienced by Maylasia and New Zealand before they abandoned the economics of Globalism and successfully recovered from their bad choices. The reason South America is against this attempt to impose the corporate America brand of economic and political togetherness is that it \"...tried Globalization for a decade, and it led to collapse.\" Read-Why Say No to FTAA, by Columbian Senator Jorge Robledo at www.bilaterals.org/article-print.php3?id_article=1064\n \n Globalists are not concerned with the human factor: the culture, aspirations, the choices that people make. A world run by multinational corporations is one in which \"free trade\" is not hindered by government regulations, such as labeling of products and testing for safety. These are impediments and international arbitration courts (WTO, etc.) are there on the side of big business.\n \n However, there is no international court \"...to deal with the individual's human and working rights.\" The profit motive is the sole reason for the globalist's existence. \n \n The more than 30,000 pages of regulations in all of these trade agreements deal mostly with transferring power from governments (member states) to multinational corporations, giving them the right to operate, unobstructed by governments at any level. Workers, on the other hand, are treated as a commodity., or \"human capital.\"\n \n George Bush, in an effort to demonstrate to the rest of the Western Hemisphere that the proposed FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) will work, announced on March 23,2005 that he, President Fox of Mexico, and PM Martin of Canada have committed their nations to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPPNA). The name of this new economic and political union (without the knowledge or consent of the American people) is North America and it will be in place by 2010.\n \n The Task Force on Building a North American Community is responsible for this plan, which will destroy a big chunk of each member state's sovereignty. It is sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations and its Canadian and Mexican counterparts. The plan contains recommendations for the three nations to implement by 2010. Some facts about the new \"Corporation of North America\" should cause alarm bells to go off if you work for a living.\n See www.cfr.org/content/publications/NorthAmerica-TF_final.pdf-\n \n North America will have a common security perimeter around all three nations and eventually open borders, as in the European Union. (Now you know why Bush won't secure the border with Mexico and enforce the immigration laws.) See politics at www.thesigintreport.com\n \n Recommendations include:\n \n 1- \"Move to full labor mobility (by 2010) between Canada and the United States.\" Eliminate \"...all remaining barriers to the ability of their citizens to live and work in the other country.\"This policy should extend to Mexico later, when the \"...wage differentials between Mexico and its two North American neighbors have diminished considerably.\" [p.27,28] \n \n That means when American and Canadian wages are reduced considerably. American businesses want to hire the cheapest labor available. They already do that by outsourcing and hiring illegal aliens from Mexico. In addition, HB-1, HB-2, and L-1 visas allow American companies to hire workers from overseas (India, for example), fire the American workers (software engineers,etc.) and pay the new employees a fraction of the salary that the Americans were receiving. \n \n American manufacturers have also moved their factories to Mexico, then Guatemala, and now to Thailand, Vietnam, and China - constantly seeking laborers who will work long hours for no benefits and cheap wages.\n \n 2- \"Mutual recognition of professional standards and degrees.\" This is something that NAFTA \"already encourages.\" Big business can then have \"...rapid access to a larger pool of skilled labor.\" [p.28]\n \n Translation: Business can have access to a larger pool of cheap labor. Not lettuce pickers, but professionals like teachers, nurses, technicians, doctors, managers, etc. Americans will be competing for jobs and losing them to foreigners from south of the border.\n \n 3- \"Expand temporary migrant (guest) worker programs. Canada and the United States should expand programs for temporary labor migration from Mexico.\"\n \n A recent PEW International poll found that if George Bush is able to get his guest worker program passed through Congress, 50 percent of Mexicans say they will cross the border into the U.S. That adds up to about 50,000,000 more Mexicans on the dole, committing crimes and having babies. The word catastrophic would be an understatement.\n \n 4- \"Implement the Social Security Totalization Agreement negotiated between the United States and Mexico.\" [p.27]\n \n According to the GAO, millions of illegal aliens from Mexico and their dependents in Mexico could be eligible to collect from the nearly broke U.S. Social Security program. All Bush has to do is sign the agreement.\n \n This is a sampling of the bleak future that lies ahead for American workers. And if George Bush and his co-conspirators are able to buy and threaten enough congressmen and women to pass the FTAA, and the other 33 nations in the hemisphere sign on, a new megastate will be created, consisting of up to 800,000,000 citizens, with access to member states. And a large percentage of them will be happy to take your job for a big cut in pay.",

   "Since you obviously cannot deal with the facts, you fall back on the race card. Maybe you two are just lazy.\n \n There is racism and it lies clearly in the Mexican/ American community. It is found in groups like La Raza and MEChA (Chciano Student Movement of Aztlan), which is a Chicano racist group sanctioned in high schools and colleges across the U.S. In the preamble to their mission statement it includes the goal of \"politicizing our race with an emphasis on indigenous consciousness to continue the struggle for the self-determination of the Chicano people for the purpose of liberating Aztlan (the Southwest United States) See Reconquista: The Invasion of America www.thesigintreport.com \n \n EL Plan Espiritual de Aztlan (The Spiritual Plan of Aztlan) is a clear call to reconquer the American Southwest under control of the \"bronze\" race. It declares that the land does not belong \"to the foreign Europeans.\"\n \n Before the world, before all of North America,\" \"...we are a nation, we are a union of free pueblos, we are Aztlan.\"\n \n Under a plan of action:\n 5. Economic plan to drive the exploiter (white race) out of our community... (Southwest United States) \n \n The motto of this plan: Por La Raza todo. Fuera La Raza nada.( For the Race everything. Outside the Race nothing.) www.panam.edu/orgs/MEChA/aztlan.html\n \n The method of taking control of this part of America is infiltration of millions of immigrants from Mexico and demographic dominance (Chicanos being elected to office by a region overwhelmingly of Mexican origen).\n \n Many members of the radical, racist organization MEChA have been elected to office throughout this region, especially in California. Examples are Cruz Bustamante, Lt. Governor of California and Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles.\n \n Mexican /American citizens are not afraid to tell anyone how they feel about the white race. Jose Angel Gutierrez, Professor of Political Science at the University of Texas, Arlington,states: \"We have got to eliminate the gringo (white American), and what I mean by that is that if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.\"\n \n This reconquista is well underway and the Mexicans will be successful and not just in the Southwest. I suggest you do your homework before making thoughtless comments.",

All topics should be open to discussion. \n\n \n Perhaps because we don`t really believe in the future you describe. Let`s take a look.\n \n \n \nThe history of Globalism has been one of failure and the latest edition is no different. \n\n \n This is a weird claim... What do you mean by \"Globalism\"? Is it a political movement, an economic force or an historic process (or perhaps pendelum)? How does it relate to the more commonly accepted and recognized term \"globalisation\"\n \n Furthermore, what do you mean by failiure? Does \"Gloabalism\" have an agenda it has failed to fullfill?\n \n \nAccording to John Ralston Saul, author of The Collapse of Globalism, it reached its peak in the mid 1990s with the WTO (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION) and is now on the way out.

During his recent visit to South America Bush tried to sell this recipe for disaster (the FTAA) to Brazil and other nations that oppose it.\n\n \n Bush and Globalism? I haven`t seen this connection before. Free trade and the US however is a common association, but are you merely talking about free trade? If so, why use the term \"Globalism\"\n \n \nSaul gives a list of examples in which attempts to run the world, or a large part of it, through trade, have not been successful. This includes the latest effort by leaders of multinational corporations in our hemisphere, who approach their task with a \"near religious conviction\" \"...that nation-states were heading toward irrelevance, to be replaced by the power of global markets; that economics, not politics or arms, would determine the course of human events; that growth in international trade would foster prosperous markets that would, in turn, abolish poverty and change dictatorships into democracies.\"\n\n \n This sounds like the process of globalisation and \"the end of history\". The end of history (Fukuyama) has largely been debunked as far as I know. None, or very few describe the globalisation process in this way anymore.\n \n \n \nQuite the opposite. Check out the dismal results experienced by Maylasia and New Zealand before they abandoned the economics of Globalism and successfully recovered from their bad choices. \n\n \n What are these \"economics of Globalism\" you talk about?\n \n \nThe reason South America is against this attempt to impose the corporate America brand of economic and political togetherness is that it \"...tried Globalization for a decade, and it led to collapse.\" Read-Why Say No to FTAA, by Columbian Senator Jorge Robledo at www.bilaterals.org/article-print.php3?id_article=1064\n \n\n \n This article seems to be about neo-liberal economic polycies. Is this perhaps what you mean by \"Globalism\"?\n \n \n \nGlobalists are not concerned with the human factor: the culture, aspirations, the choices that people make. A world run by multinational corporations is one in which \"free trade\" is not hindered by government regulations, such as labeling of products and testing for safety. These are impediments and international arbitration courts (WTO, etc.) are there on the side of big business.\n\n \n Government regulations are being frowned upon by various groupings of neo-liberals, free trade advocates and austrian-school economists. But I have never heard any complaint about labeling products or testing them for safety (just that this is better handled by private organisations, not political powers with vested interests and lobby groups of special interests breathing down their necks).\n \n Nor do I really see what this has to do with \"culture, aspiration or choices people make\". In fact, if anything, they want people to make the choices for themselves, practice their own culture and aspire to whatever they want without government intervention. I don`t agree with them on this one, but I would never blame them from having the agenda you seem to imply.\n \n \nHowever, there is no international court \"...to deal with the individual's human and working rights.\" The profit motive is the sole reason for the globalist's existence. \n\n \n This is however often the goal of internationalists and hyper-globalisation advocates (but not neo-liberals or austrian-school economists). So depending on your definition of \"Globalist\" my oppinion regarding this statement could swing either way...\n \n \n \nNorth America will have a common security perimeter around all three nations and eventually open borders, as in the European Union. (Now you know why Bush won't secure the border with Mexico and enforce the immigration laws.) See politics at www.thesigintreport.com\n \n\n \n Seems like a good long-term plan.\n \n \n \n1- \"Move to full labor mobility (by 2010) between Canada and the United States.\" Eliminate \"...all remaining barriers to the ability of their citizens to live and work in the other country.\"This policy should extend to Mexico later, when the \"...wage differentials between Mexico and its two North American neighbors have diminished considerably.\" [p.27,28] \n \n That means when American and Canadian wages are reduced considerably.

It means that when American and Canadian wages are on par with Mexican, regardless of wether this has been accomplished through depricating American/Canadian wages or appriciating Mexican wages. Furthermoe, american bussiness are allready wanting to hire the cheapest labour availiable and as you point out, they are allready doing this. So I don`t see what your beef is?\n \n \n \n2- \"Mutual recognition of professional standards and degrees.\" This is something that NAFTA \"already encourages.\" Big business can then have \"...rapid access to a larger pool of skilled labor.\" [p.28]\n \n Translation: Business can have access to a larger pool of cheap labor. Not lettuce pickers, but professionals like teachers, nurses, technicians, doctors, managers, etc. Americans will be competing for jobs and losing them to foreigners from south of the border.\n\n \n Teachers, nurses and doctors are service based proffesions. They cannot be outsourced \"south of the border\"... Regardless of mutual recognition of standards and degrees. \n \n But granted, mutual accepted standards will encourage trade as well as worker migration. This is generally a good thing as this will encourage specialisation which in the long-run makes everyone better off. \n \n Allthough these kind of things are really great for the individual worker who wants to migrate. It is also economicly benefitional for all parties (nations) involved since it will make it easier for immigrants to practice what they have allready learned (and thus spent a significant amount of resources on).\n \n \n \n3- \"Expand temporary migrant (guest) worker programs. Canada and the United States should expand programs for temporary labor migration from Mexico.\"\n \n A recent PEW International poll found that if George Bush is able to get his guest worker program passed through Congress, 50 percent of Mexicans say they will cross the border into the U.S. That adds up to about 50,000,000 more Mexicans on the dole, committing crimes and having babies. The word catastrophic would be an understatement.\n\n \n Why would migrant workers be \"on the dole\"? Isn`t that an oxymoron (sp?)?\n \n As for criminality, I don`t know so much about the statistics, but can you show that guest workers are more criminal than americans? I sincerely doubt that...\n \n As for babies, I would say, good for you!. You`ll need that infusion when your dependancy ratio hits the roof. Your population is aging rapidly and you better do something before you`ll have the same problems we are currently facing in Europe. The sooner you do sometrhing, the better. Guest workers and immigrants is probably the only possible way to stem this process.\n \n \n \n4- \"Implement the Social Security Totalization Agreement negotiated between the United States and Mexico.\" [p.27]\n \n According to the GAO, millions of illegal aliens from Mexico and their dependents in Mexico could be eligible to collect from the nearly broke U.S. Social Security program. All Bush has to do is sign the agreement.\n\n \n Scrap the social security programe allready. Shift the system from transfers from current workers to current retirees to a better system of current workers to future retirees. If you do this, and sign the above mentioned negotiation, you will be able to inject even more capital into your economy as well as up the savings rate. Not a very bad scenario...\n \n \n \nThis is a sampling of the bleak future that lies ahead for American workers. And if George Bush and his co-conspirators are able to buy and threaten enough congressmen and women to pass the FTAA, and the other 33 nations in the hemisphere sign on, a new megastate will be created, consisting of up to 800,000,000 citizens, with access to member states. And a large percentage of them will be happy to take your job for a big cut in pay.\n\n \n And how would this be different from now? Capital is allready free flowing. The only difference is that you would then regain some of the lost ability of self determination through democracy. You`d share the ability to affect your common future with other american, canadians and mexicans. It seems like a win-win situation. Far better than let the capital owners use their mobility (of capital) to screw you all over. Start organising cross-border labour unions, organise cross-border interest groups and start organising cross-border political parties and you (as a united people) just might gain the upper hand\n again...\n \n And I`m not going to go into the issue of the benefits of lowering the US wage rates.

Or perhaps they should use their democratic freedom of organisation and form a union instead of bitching about the \"evil indians\"... \n \n \n\u00039- I wrote 50,000,000 more Mexicans on the dole. We don't even have jobs for the millions of illegals who are here now. See #2 above.\n \n\n \n But why would mexicans cross the border if they had no ability to find work? And I`m still waiting for figures to back your statements up. As it stands, you have shown nothing of the kind.\n \n \n\u0003 1-\n 10- No. I'm not left-wing or right-wing. I do not belong to any political party so I do not have to spout any talking points or follow any dogma. I\"m free to find the truth.\n\n \n Yeah, and you are doing a swell job :p",

   "For a definition of Globalism, see the second paragraph of my post. In the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, South America, and North America), large corporations would, essentially, run the 34 nations of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas). The tens of thousands of regulations in these \"trade agreements\" take power from the member states and transfers it to multinational corporations. Unelected bureaucrats, tribunals, and technical committees would rule on disputes between business and governments at all levels. These rulings would be the law of the land, covering 800,000,000 people. The FTAA will utilize NAFTA, CAFTA, WTO, and other agreements for this purpose. The goal is to put the business community in charge of every aspect of life, including privatization of virtually all civilian public services, including (for profit) education, healthcare, water, criminal justice, etc.\n \n See www.bilaterals.org/article-print.php3?id_article=1064\n \n On March 23, 2005, Bush, Fox of Mexico, and PM Martin of Canada committed their nations to the SPPNA (Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America). It will be an economic and political union of the three countries (without the knowledge and consent of the people) and is to be in place by 2010 (See original post). This, according to Bush, is a demonstration for the rest of the hemisphere to show them that the FTAA will work. \n \n Recommendations by the authors of this plan (Council on Foreign Relations) include a parliament and council that, like the European Union, will eventually become law-making bodies that will bypass all member states legislatures (including the American Congress). Any laws passed by these bodies will be the law of the land. \n \n See www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/03/print/20050323-4.html www.cfr.org/publication/8121/building_a_north_american_community.html \n \n There is a plethora of info on the high cost of illegal immigration. Here are a few examples:\n \n 1- In a newspaper article on a a couple of illegal aliens who just had a baby in an Arizona hospital, the writer says: \"The baby will be just one among about 15,000 babies born to undocumented mothers (Mexican, Central American) this year in Arizona and granted automatic citizenship.\" Daniel Gonzalez, The Arizona Republic, 11/25/2005\n \n 2- The Center for Immigration Studies, based on 2002 birth records and other goverment data, says that \"... there were 383,000 babies born in the United States to undocumented mothers, or about one in 10 births.\" Daniel Gonzalez\n \n 3- In 1994, 74,987 anchor babies (babies born to illegal aliens, mostly on welfare, in California hospital maternity units) cost $215 million and constituted 36 percent of all Medi-Cal births.\" Illegal Aliens and American Medicine, Madeleine Peiner Cosman, Ph.D., Esq., The Journal of the American Physicians and Surgeons, Volume 10 Number 1 - Spring 2005 \n \n 4- \"In 2003 in Stockton, California, 70 percent of 2,300 babies born in San Joaquin Hospital's maternity ward were anchor babies.\" Cosman\n \n 5- \"Between 1993 and 2003, 60 California hospitals closed because half their services became unpaid. Another 24 California hospitals verge on closure.\" Cosman \n \n 6- As for crime: In Los Angeles, 95 percent of outstanding homicide warrants are for illegal aliens, as are 66 percent of fugitive felony warrants. The notorious 18 Street Gang has 20,000 members, of whom 60 to 80 percent are illegal aliens, according to the California Department of Justice and the Los Angeles Police Department...\" Cosman\n \n 7- \"Based on Census Bureau data, \"... households headed by illegal aliens used $10 billion more in government services than they paid in taxes in 2002. These figures are only for the federal government.\" (Center for Immigration Studies) \n \n 8- The illegal immigration problem has exploded nationwide. Pick a state: Georgia, Florida, Colorado, North Carolina- all are experiencing the same problems as California and the Southwestern U.S.\n \n There are a large number of illegal aliens in America, from coast to coast. Many do not have jobs. They exist on welfare, They commit crimes. If Bush gets his \"guest worker\" program, the Mexicans say they will cross in huge numbers (50 percent) in order to get work. Why would they do that? I just told you.\n \n This amnesty program has been tried a number of times by past presidents, including Reagan. Each time the program was announced, there was an immediate surge in illegal aliens crossing over from Mexico. They stayed.\n \n \n More on the \"trade agreements\" that will affect the future of every person in the Western Hemisphere (if it succeeds).\n \n \"NAFTA is much more (than a trade agreement). It gives corporations extraordinary protections from government policies that might limit future profits, and extraordinary rights to force the privatization of virtually all civilian public services. Disputes are settled by secret tribunals of experts, many of whom are employed privately as corporate lawyers and consultants. At the same time, NAFTA excludes protections for workers (FTAA also),the environment and the public that are part of the social contract established through the long political struggle in each of the countries.\" \n \n \"As Jorge Castaneda, Mexico's recent foreign secretary, observed, NAFTA was \"an accord among magnates and potentates: an agreement for the rich and powerful...effectively excluding ordinary people in all three societies.\" (America, Mexico, and Canada) 'Thus was NAFTA a model for the neoliberal governance of the global economy.' www.thenation.com/doc/20040202/faux",

   "The borders with Mexico should be sealed and illegal immigrants deported. The latest study indicates that approximately 20,000,000 illegal immigrants (the majority from Mexico) are currently in the U.S. George Bush, of course, does not want to close the borders for the reasons I have already stated. In addition, the unnatural redistribution of continental labor (many uneducated farmers with no job skills, who refuse to assimilate and whose allegiance is not with America) will only Balkanize the nation and lead to its breakup. \n See Illegal Immigration at www.thesigintreport.com\n \n NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) is one reason the immigration problem has worsened. Under NAFTA, trade increased among the member states of Mexico, the U.S., and Canada but the U.S. suffered a deficit ($20.6 billion in 1993 and $110.6 billion in 2004). As a result of NAFTA , America lost 1,015,290 jobs between 1993 and 2004 but Mexico lost even more, including 1.3 million jobs in the agricultural areas due to imports from factory farms in America. These Mexican job losses and the decline of real wages are contributing to the increase in illegal immigration to America. [Economic Policy Institute, Issue Brief #214, July20, 2005] \n \n The \"trade agreements\" (NAFTA, WTO, GATT, CAFTA) have already demonstrated that the thousands of regulations in these agreements overrule the laws and constitutions of the member states. They are, in effect, a new economic and political constitution for North America, the new supreme law of the land in which large corporations control government decisions at all levels (city, county, state, and national).\n \n There are a number of examples. The most recent is Wal-Mart. This huge corporation, which tells its suppliers to move offshore (China) in order to take advantage of cheap labor (28 cents an hour) or lose their contract, has now launched an attack against the American people and local government.\n \n A growing number of communities have rejected the opening of Wal-Mart giant box stores because of the negative impact (traffic, crime, damage to the local economy). In some cases Wal-Mart has withdrawn. In others, local zoning boards have denied their application. \n \n Now, the giant retailer has appealed to the WTO (World Trade Organization) to rule against governments in America who deny it permission to build their SuperCenters anywhere they want. These denials by local governments prevent a corporation from making a profit and are a violation of free trade agreements signed by the United States. Tribunals and technical committees (NAFTA, WTO) have already been successful in ruling for corporations vs. governments in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. These rulings cannot be challenged. Governments must either change their laws, etc., or pay a large monetary penalty to the offended party (corporation).\n \n The FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas), if passed, will incorporate regulations from the other trade agreements and will intrude into every aspect of a society (health, education, environment) for the benefit of large corporations. The race to the bottom will be unleashed.",
