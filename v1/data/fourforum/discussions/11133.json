   "Throughout history, Gods have largely been there to be an answer for the tough questions, rather than just saying \"I don't know\". Way back when, every tree, rock, and stream had a spirit. Later, as people got more sophisticated, the Gods answered the bigger questions. Why does it rain? Rain god. Why do the crops grow, or why didn't they grow? Fertility goddess, happy or sad as the case may be. You get the idea.\n \n Nowadays there are very few questions left. Why are we here and what happens when we die are the biggies in recent history. And that means, for many people, that God must be a creator God and a judgement God, to provide the answer for those two questions. So even though we know where we actually came from, some people still cling to the notion that God did it, rather than strip God of what amounts to half of his arena for expression. Without creation God becomes nothing more than the guy who pushes the up or down botton when you die.",

   "Many of you brought up the point that one of the main purposes of religion was to answer the great questions that plagued humanity - including our origins and purpose, the reasons for natural calamities, etc. Since most religions were developed before these questions had answers, it makes sense that a theology of creation was an important aspect to their development. Many of these same religions are now struggling, of course, in the conflict that has arisen since alternative well-supported scientific explanations are available. Some ignore the evidence whereas others, such as the Catholic Church, try to somewhat take it into account - claiming that God developed the human soul and evolution the body. \n \n It makes me wonder about two aspects of the cultural evolution of religion:\n \n 1) Will any of the current world religions adapt to the point where God is taken out of the Creation role all together? I suspect that is possible but I doubt it will happen with any of the main world religions - at least within our lifetimes.\n \n 2) Is it possible, in this day and age, for an entirely new religion to arise which takes into account the scientific world view, or do religious beliefs need the mystery and obscurity of ancient, insufficiently recorded history to develop and survive? I suspect the later is true.",
