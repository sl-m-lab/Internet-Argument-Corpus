   "Hi duck,\n \n Well, first of all, to your one-sentence thread starter. Do you think you correctly used \"whom\"? Why did you choose it over \"who\"? Or for that matter, why the awkward \"of whom\" phrase when it could be more clearly stated in three keystokes: \"who\"? I'm the English Language Police and I'm watching you. :) \n \n As for your question, here in MN it's referred to as pop.\n \n regards",
