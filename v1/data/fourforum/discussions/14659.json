And as much as everyone thinks that your position is indefensible and irrational, you almost always have some reference you can pull out to justify your argument (even though these references are usually considered just as irrational and indefensible lol). \n \n It seems as though the trend is moving away from the absolutism of the 10 commandments to a position where God is now more gracious in the post-christ era than he was before when judgement and vengance was his default m.o. You can not observe the commandments, and still be ok if you have faith in God. \n \n The problem with the \"faith in God\" paradigm is that no 2 people can agree on what having faith in God means. One might argue that if you had real faith, you'd observe the commandment no matter what. Another may argue that faith means God will provide, including providing a way out of the trouble he got himself into by breaking the law. \n \n Salvation requires that you have steadfast faith in God. The problem is that the bible is full of so many contradictory things that God supposedly said, 2 people can have the identical \"measure of faith\" in God, and believe in the exact opposite doctrine. And its happening every single day. Why do you think there are so many bible-believing non-denominational churches, each one of them believing in something slightly or sometimes radically different from the others, and each proclaiming to follow the bible's true interpretation. I'm willing to bet that you also belong to a non-denominational christian church, and you're about to start your own, if you haven't done so, or as soon as you raise enough in the building fund to branch out on your own. In the church that I used to attend, there are at least 3 individuals zealous and diligent about the bible and study aids, to the extent that they would easily break out into their own churches. And they learn under a pastor who was just like them, and who formed his own church for the same reason. \n \n So why is it impossible (yes, impossible), for all these non-denominational churches to unite, but rather will continue to keep splitting and dividing until they almost form incompatible species of christianity? Because there is no clear standard. Even the bible says that there is only one right answer. And every one of these churches think that it is the one that has it. And the next generation of sub-churches will also each think that they have it, and so on. And these churches often target the inadequacies of organized religions, yet are totally blind to the \"absolute\" fact that if there truly was only one right way to salvation, all christianity would be one single religion.",

   "Yes, but they are not absolute. In fact they never were. Right after the law \"thou shalt not kill\" was passed in israel, the killing rate went through the roof.\n\n \n I think Gansao said it best - God's laws are absolute but our ability to obey them isn't.\n \n Here's what I put together years ago on Progressive Sanctification:\n \n PROGRESSIVE SANCTIFICATION\n \n Now whereas definitive (positional) sanctification is seen as a completed act by Christ for His body of believer's, where they are \"positionally\" seated in righteousness and holiness in God's eyes at the point of faith in Christ (Acts 26:18), as long as the individual's life continues, there also occurs in their lives what is referred to as \"progressive sanctification.\" The Westminster Catechism (Q. 35), seems to provide a fine description of what takes place in progressive sanctification:\n \n \"Sanctification is the work of God's free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto sin and live unto righteousness.\" (Geneva Study Bible 1806)\n \n Progressive sanctification then, is a process of refinement that God performs in the lives of His believers. \n \n \"Because by one sacrifice He has made perfect forever those\n who are being made holy.\" (Hebrews 10:14)\n \n I refer you now to the \"refiner's fire\" that we see mentioned in Malachi 3:3, which states,\n \n \"He (God) will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; He will purify the\n Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the Lord will\n have men who will bring offerings in righteousness.\"\n \n The refining of an individual unto purification is a process that occurs over a long period of time. It is a process whereby the Lord may even use trials, suffering, and tribulations to break down the individual so that they come to trust and believe in the Lord, instead of trusting in themselves. For it is often in the valleys of our lives that we find God, not when things are going well. In Romans 5:3 the apostle Paul speaks of rejoicing in our sufferings because, \"we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.\" If sanctification is a process by which we come more and more into the likeness of God, then the \"character\" of which Paul is speaking is the Christ-likeness that God is trying to instill in us, and suffering (refinement) is one of the vehicles by which it is attained. \n \n Concerning the premise that progressive sanctification is a life-long process, Wayne Grudem (Systematic Theology) remarks,\n \n \"Sanctification is a process that continues throughout our Christian lives. Although Paul says that his readers have been set free from sin (Romans 6:18) and that they are 'dead to sin and alive to God' (Romans 6:11), he nonetheless recognizes that sin remains in their lives, so he tells them not to let it reign and not to yield to it (Romans 6:12-13). Their task, therefore, as Christians is to grow more and more in sanctification, just as they previously grew more and more in sin: 'Just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for sanctification' (Romans 6:19).\" (Grudem 748)\n \n Finally, Progressive Sanctification isn't just a Christian invention. Like most Christian doctrines there is a basis for it in the Old Testament:\n \n Ezekiel 36:25 - I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.\n \n Once again, God, the Holy Spirit, working in the life of the believer.",

Let's say a thousand, and the 100 evil men wind up in hell when they die.\n \n Now, let's let those 100 evil men have 100 offspring that over time grow up to kill the original 1,000 other people, plus 1,000 more. Now, you have 200 evil men in hell and 2,000 murdered others. \n \n Let's take it to the 10th or so generation. Now you've had 10,000 evil men giving birth to 10,000 offspring and together those 20,000 evil men and or women offspring kill 200,000 people total. So, you now have 20,000 evil men and women in hell (vs. 100 if you had nailed them earlier), plus 200,000 other dead people.\n \n So God, being smarter than his critics, and able to see consequences further out in time than the stiff-necked \"God is evil\" crowd, saves 19,900 people from going to hell plus he saves 199,000 others from getting murdered. (please excuse any math errors).\n \n Get the picture? God SAVES!!\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n \n p.s. being innocent, the babies wind up in Heaven and don't mind it a bit.\n\n \n You are so full of it, you have no idea what you are talking about. It's right there in your own Book of fairy tales that you live by.. Shortly after your GOD said do not Kill he himself ordered the deaths of 3000 or so Israelite. You are claiming that GODS law is absolute.. but you contradict yourself at every turn. The Commandment says \n \n \"THOU SHALL NOT KILL\"\n \n It doesn't say thou shall not kill , oh unless they are from a different tribe and deserve it. GOD doesn't save, GOD doesn't care, GOD don't exist.. when you realize that you will be a lot better off ..",

   "Nah, you're claiming a far more absolute stance than those links actually take, when you know full well you're just trying to bait. Opposing atheism on moral grounds is NOT the same thing as indicating one is morally superior to atheists or declaring that atheists have no morals. Unless you can show statements made that actually SAY that, you're whole basis there is just your unfounded opinion.\n\n Let's see...\n http://www.4forums.com/political/debate-challenges/14645-science-not-atheistic-really-then-prove.html#post413745\n \nYou have just shown that you have no absolute moral center at all and what's more, you are clueless as to the existence of absolute truth. You actually believe that you are qualified to be an honest and objective arbiter of right and wrong and good and evil in life. This is your first and most serious self delusion because it sets you up for a lifetime of thinking you are qualified to be your own god. That is not only delusional, it is blasphemous and puts you at odds with your Creator who made you in love for fellowship.\n\n http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/7663-secularism-vs-atheism.html#post200276\n Note: in this post marc is reposting the dictionary.com definition of atheism. Apparently the belief that atheism equates to no morals is a universal one\n \na&#8226;the&#8226;ism P Pronunciation Key ( th - z m)\n n. \n 1. \n a. Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods. \n b. The doctrine that there is no God or gods. \n 2. Godlessness; immorality. \n\n http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/14586-there-point-evolution-4.html#post412010\n \nThere are absolute morals and laws that lead to the absolute standard: perfection.\n \n They were created in the knowledge that no man can ever be perfect. \n \n That is why we need God to save us, and why we cannot save ourselves.\n\n I'm not even going the mention the times when easyrider refers to atheists as godless heathens with no moral compass...\n \n Do Atheists Have No Reason to be Moral? Are There No Atheistic Moral Standards?\n \nThe idea that atheists have no reason to be moral without a god or religion may be the most popular and repeated myth about atheism. It comes up in many forms and all are based on the assumption that the only valid source of morality is a theistic religion, preferably the religion of the speaker which is usually Christianity. Thus without Christianity, people cannot live moral lives.\n\n \n I'll stop there. My claim is that theists consider themselves as having a superior standard of morals than atheists. You say that theists never consider themselves as having a superior moral standard than atheists. Again, using the same links that you probably didnt even look at, I'm showing you that theists indeed consider themselves as having a superior moral standard to atheists. It is obviously not only my claim, and whether you've heard theists make such a statement or not, the fact is that they do.",

   "You do know the Horus -<Christianity thing is a well-known hoax, right?\n \n http://conspiracyscience.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-one/\n \n \"Horus was not born on December 25th, he was born on the 5th day of the \"Epagomenal Days\"[3], which does not even take place in December on the modern or ancient calendars, but rather between August 24th and 28th, but in terms of the rising of Sirius (August 4), they are July 30th through August 3rd[4]. His mother was also not a virgin. Horus's father was Osiris, who was killed by his brother Seth. Isis used a spell to bring him back to life for a short time so they could have sex, in which they conceived Horus[5].\n \n I, as well as several others, as well as several Egyptologists you can find on the Internet, know of no reference anywhere to a \"star in the east\" or \"three kings\" and \"new-born savior\"; it is simply made up. I cannot find any source or information proving he was a \"teacher when he was 12 years old\", that he was \"baptized at age 30\", that he \"walked on water\" (but on the Internet, I did find several places that suggest he was \"thrown in the water\", but I have no direct source at this time for that). More so, I cannot find any evidence he was referred to as \"The Truth\", \"The Light\", Lamb of God\", \"the Good Shepherd\", etc.\n \n Also lacking is any evidence that he was betrayed by Typhon. In fact, Horus never died, at any time, he later merges with the sun god, Ra -- but never dies and certainly never is crucified, and therefore could not have been buried for 3 days and resurrected. If you want to look it up yourself, you can find documentation of Horus and Isis and Osiris here [6] and here [7].\n \n Zeitgeist, the movie did not make this up originally, you can find several places on the Internet that make such claims, but there are no sources or suggestions as to where this information came from. It is highly possible all this originates from The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold - If you read the Amazon reviews, you can find that a lot of people who point out how the information is completely unsourced [8]. I went to Barnes and Nobel and actually found this book in the Christianity section. Needless to say it was completely unsourced and was like reading much the other \"Christianity Conspiracy\" books out there. So, if these claims all originate from this book, there's absolutely no evidence for it [9]. I should note that this book is used as a \"source\" in Zeitgeist, the movie [10]. And it is worth pointing out the title is only one word away from the title of this part of the movie \"The Greatest Story Ever Sold\" vs \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\".\n \n Horus did not have 12 disciples, rather he had four semi-divine disciples called \"heru-shemsu\" (followers of Horus) [11 - 1.491]. He did have 16 human followers [11 - 1.196]. One can also find reference to an unnumbered group of followers called the Mesniu (blacksmiths) who accompanied Horus into some of his battles, but no where can 12 of anything be found [11 - 1.475f].\"People love a good conspiracy theory.",

   "As with the Old Testament, we just don't know who wrote most of the New Testament. Tradition has assigned the Gospels and most of the Epistles to certain authors, all of whom were important figures in Jesus' life or the early days of the faith. It was important for the early church to believe the authors wrote the works attributed to them, since their eminence lent the writings authority. But since we don't have the original signatures, none can be verified except through textual clues. \n \n The first generation of Christians didn't see any need for a permanent written record of the sayings and stories of Jesus. Jesus' return and the restoration of the Kingdom of God on earth were imminent--why bother preserving stories if the world was about to end? Stories were simply passed along orally, primarily as a means of preaching and convincing outsiders. But as the first generation began to die off and hopes for the Second Coming dimmed, there was a need to preserve Jesus' words and deeds for posterity.\n \n Quite a few collections of stories about Jesus circulated in the early church, among them The Gospel of Thomas, The Gospel of Mary, and the Secret Book of John. Some of these gave very different and in some cases conflicting accounts of the gospel and, most importantly, of Jesus' alleged resurrection. Some argued for the physical resurrection, with the mantle of leadership falling on those who had experienced it firsthand: the apostles. Others said the resurrection was a spiritual event that anyone could experience. Some thought this latter \"heresy\" would have led the church away from an organized entity into a situation where anyone could judge the truth for themselves. As Elaine Pagels points out in The Gnostic Gospel, this was no trivial matter. The decision on which interpretation was \"correct\" was central to the future of the church. \n \n We'll return to the question of how the \"canonical\" books of the New Testament were determined in the fifth and last installment of this answer. For now we'll just say that Iraneus, the bishop of Lyons in 180 AD, decided that the validity of any work had to be judged by whether it was \"apostolic.\" That is, it should have been written by or for one of the twelve apostles. But, as Pagels goes on to say, regardless of whether the names given to the Gospels are those of the actual authors or merely reflect a claim to apostolic authority, \"we know virtually nothing about the persons who wrote the Gospels.\"\n \n Recent scholarship or, more correctly, recent rethinking of previous scholarship has brought an intriguing possibility to the table. Matthew, Mark and Luke are termed the Synoptic Gospels, so called because they generally agree on the details and timeline of Jesus' life, sometimes even using the same words to describe the same events. Because of this similarity, quite a few scholars posit that there was a previous collection of Jesus' sayings and works which all three gospel writers relied on when compiling their histories. This collection, as yet just a theoretical construct, has been given the name \"Q\" (short for Quelle, German for \"source\").\n \n It's a tempting idea. Mark is regarded as the earliest gospel and hence closest to Q. Of the 661 verses in Mark, only 24 aren't quoted in either Matthew or Luke. Matthew and Luke occasionally disagree with Mark regarding Jesus' words or the order of events, but they never both disagree on the same point. \n \n Burton Mack in The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins offers another conjecture. It's possible Q was the work not of a single person, but rather of a community trying to give written form and substance to what it believed. If that's the case, the question of authorship in the usual sense evaporates. But rather than have this discussion come to an abrupt end, we'll work on the assumption that the authors were individuals, not a committee.\n \n Mark, not an apostle himself, was an associate of the apostle Paul for a short time, but the gospel bearing his name is (to some minds) based on the preaching of Peter. It's generally assumed to have been the first gospel written, coming in right before Matthew at about 65 AD.\n \n The author of Matthew is traditionally held to be the tax collector mentioned in Matthew 9:9, sometimes referred to as Levi. However, Matthew borrows heavily from the Gospel of Mark. It's hard to believe someone who was in close contact with Jesus would have had to rely on secondary sources. Since this gospel has the most quotations from the Old Testament, sometimes going to ridiculous lengths to try to show that Jesus was the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, it's assumed that Matthew was written for a Jewish audience. There is suspicion that it might have been originally written in Hebrew, although only Greek texts have ever been found. Scholars differ on the composition date, but most agree on roughly 65 - 70 AD with a few placing at as late as 100 - 134 AD.\n \n The Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts are assumed to have been written by the same person, since they are addressed to the same individual, a Roman named Theophilus. The author was a doctor, Paul notes in Colossians 4:14. If Mark represents the teachings of Peter about Jesus, Luke most likely represents the teachings of Paul. Luke claims to have researched his material, but his dating, especially in the early chapters regarding Jesus' birth, is inconsistent with other sources.\n \n The book of Acts can be seen as a sequel to the gospel of Luke, starting where the previous book ends. But where in the earlier work Luke needed to research the story, in Acts he is a character in it. He was a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys and was present during his imprisonment. In this sense, Luke had more first-hand experience of Paul than he had of Jesus. Both books were probably written after Matthew and Mark, probably around 65-70 AD but before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.\n \n The Gospel of John differs markedly from the other three books both in tone and in some historical details. John does not follow the timeline in the other three and adds quite a few stories and details not found in them. For this reason, it's thought that John's gospel was not a child of Q, but a completely original work either by someone who knew Jesus directly or by one of his associates. The three letters of John found near the end of the New Testament are generally assumed to have been written by this same individual.\n \n The identity of John has remained a mystery, although tradition has it that he is \"the disciple that Jesus loved\" mentioned in John 13:23. But here is a curious thing. In the entire gospel, John never mentions his own name (although he does mention other gospel writers). His purpose is to exalt the deity of Jesus. It seems out of character for him to pat himself on the back in that one verse, if in fact he was John the apostle.\n \n William Barclay gives us an elegant answer. He states outright that even if John was not the direct author of the book, it was at least written under his authority. The book likely dates from about 100 AD, the last of the books to be written. If this dating is accurate, John would have been very old. Barclay posits that it was probably a group writing remembrances from John's fading memories, and it was they who described John as the disciple Jesus loved..\n \n The letters to the Romans, the Corinthians, the Galatians, the Ephesians, the Philippians, the Colossians, the Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus and Philemon are widely assumed to have come from the hand of the apostle Paul and are called the Pauline epistles for that reason.\n \n E. P. Sanders says it's fairly clear Paul was unaware of the four Gospels, and the authors of the Gospels didn't know of Paul's letters.\n \n A few small stylistic variations in Colossians and Ephesians make some scholars suspect Paul didn't write them, but the evidence is sparse and unconvincing. The letters to Timothy and Titus are suspect as well, and some critics feel they were later edits of some of Paul's more personal correspondence to individual church leaders, or pastors. Hence, they are often referred to as the Pastoral epistles. \n \n The author of the letter to the Hebrews is completely unknown. Stylistic or literary criticism has failed to match it with any known author, although it is usually included among the letters of Paul. Some names that have been bandied about are Barnabas (an associate of Paul), Apollos, or even a dual authorship of Aquilla and Priscilla, two Christians who ran a church out of their house in Rome. Early tradition knew that it was anonymous, but since it was such a popular work among the early Christians, it was included among the letters of Paul in order to insure its apostolicity and thus its place in the Bible.\n \n The letter of James isn't anonymous, but it's not known who exactly James was. Five people named James are mentioned in the New Testament, one of whom was the brother of Jesus. It's this person whom tradition has accepted as the author, although the evidence is sketchy.\n \n It's always been assumed the first and second letters of Peter were in fact written by Saint Peter. No real objection to that belief has been raised until rather recently, largely because few early church fathers quoted it as they did other canonically accepted books.\n \n The Revelation is often called the Revelation of Saint John. Tradition says this is the same as the author of the fourth gospel, but that seems implausible. The style of the Greek is different, and while the gospel author avoids mentioning his own name in order to focus attention on Jesus, the author of Revelation mentions his own name repeatedly. He doesn't call himself an apostle, as would be his right, but merely a prophet. Exactly who the author was is open to conjecture. There is no real consensus, except that he was apparently a Jewish writer, writing in Greek to the Jewish believers after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Most critics put the date at about 95 - 100 AD.\n \n RESOURCES:\n \n The Literary Guide to the Bible, edited by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode, Belknap Press, 1987\n \n The Gospel of John, by William Barclay, Westminster John Knox Press, 1975\n \n The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible, by Robin Lane Fox, Knopf, 1992\n \n The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins, by Burton Mack, HarperSanFrancisco, 1993\n \n Testament, by David Morell, Warner Books, 1993\n \n The Synoptic Gospels, by Keith F.

   "[QUOTE=Easyrider;415428]That's a lie.\n \n Scholars date New Testament:\n \n Chronological Order\n \n \nThose are well within the life spans for the traditional authors.\n\n \n \n Yep with an average life expectancy during the time around 28 that puts the Apostles as a bunch of preteens following an old man. \n \n Still have not addressed how the content is verified without originals.\n \n \n [QUOTE]And let's just take the Gospel of Matthew as to authorship:\n \n The second-century writer Papias shares the following concerning Matthew: Matthew made an arrangement of the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each translated them as he was able...\n \n \nWere you familiar with Eusebius (who quotes Origen), you would know that \"the first (Gospel) was written by Matthew...and was prepared for the converts from Judaism\" (Ecclesiastical History, 6:25). There is also additional evidence that it was originally written in Hebrew. Eusebius quotes Papias as stating, \"\"Matthew put together the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\" Irenaeus wrote, \"Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church.\"\n\n \n \n Maybe read what I posted about Papias, but lets expand on what you have here. \n \n\n Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements.\n\n \n How could he possibly know he wrote without error or Peter did not embellish or misunderstand. He can't and neither can you\n \n \n \n [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark; but with regard to Matthew he has made the following statements]: Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\n \n\n \n But Papias has a problem, scientific evidence is clear the retelling of oral history repeatedly distorts the story of time and the telling. To quote Ireaneus Papias states \n \n \nFor I imagined that what was to be got from books was not so profitable to me as what came from the living and abiding voice. \n\n \n There was a tremendous amount of distortion of Jesus' teachings in the beginning. The early church was constantly struggling with what was true and what was not. Because there was no accepted standard, there was nothing from the Apostles or Jesus to separate the truth from the lie.\n \n \n Papias further attributes the following as being taught by the Apostles\n \n \nAs the presbyters say, then those who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven shall go there, others shah enjoy the delights of Paradise, and others shall possess the splendour of the city; \n\n \n Paradise? The splendours of the city? I don't hear about them much in religious discussions, what are they?\n \n \n \nAnd you'll find the same sort of assertations for the other Gospels by the earliest church fathers.\n \n So enough of your sophomoric fairy tales about spurious dating and authorship.\n\n \n \n I am looking for facts not assertions, presumptions or lucky guesses.",

ROFLMAO \n \n You're Pathetic, go tell it to GOD....lol\n\n \n I'll try this one more time xcaliber because I love you in spite of your corrupted spirit. You are right that I cannot support personal salvation with undeniable evidence. That's because personal salvation can't be experienced vicariously through another. God desires a personal relationship with each of us and will meet each of us where we are at if we will only reach out to Him sincerely, directly and seek His face. \n \n I cannot save your soul or prove what the bible says is true, but if you sincerely said God I don't believe, please help me in my unbelief, He promises that He will \"find\" you. And remember, I'm forcing you to do nothing, the anger you feel toward me is because it's the Holy Spirit tugging at your very soul and as you pull away from Him you lash out at me for the truth I'm telling you. \n \n That's why your ilk always complains that we christians are forcing you to do something against your will when all we are doing is telling you the gospel truth of eternal salvation from our God who loves us so much He became flesh, lived as a perfect example for us and then gave His sinless life on the Cross as a perfect sacrificial lamb to atone for our sins as a truly acceptable sacrifice to God for our fallen nature which we inherited from Adam, just as the bible says is required.\n \n But you prefer the lie to the truth and that is a barrier I cannot overcome.

   "\n Yep with an average life expectancy during the time around 28 that puts the Apostles as a bunch of preteens following an old man.\n\n \n Funny then how they had to nail a 33 year old man to the cross to kill him.\n \n When were the gospels written and by whom?\n \n Dating the gospels is very important. If it can be established that the gospels were written early, say before the year 70 A.D., then we would have good reason for believing that they were written by the disciples of Jesus Himself. If they were written by the disciples, then their reliability, authenticity, and accuracy are better substantiated. Also, if they were written early, this would mean that there would not have been enough time for myth to creep into the gospel accounts since it was the eyewitnesses to Christ's life that wrote them. Furthermore, those who were alive at the time of the events could have countered the gospel accounts and since we have no contradictory writings to the gospels, their early authorship as well as apostolic authorship becomes even more critical.\n \n Destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. , Luke and Acts\n \n None of the gospels mention the destruction of the Jewish temple in 70 A.D. This is significant because Jesus had prophesied its destruction when He said, \"As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down,\" (Luke 21:6, see also Matt. 24:1; Mark 13:1). This prophecy was fulfilled in 70 A.D. when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and burned the Temple. The gold in the Temple melted down between the stone walls and the Romans took the walls apart, stone by stone, to get the melted gold. Such an obvious fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy most likely would have been recorded by the gospel writers if they had been written after 70 A.D. Also, if the gospels were fabrications of mythical events then anything to bolster the Messianic claims -- such as the destruction of the temple as Jesus prophesied -- would surely have been included. But, it was not included suggesting that the gospels (at least Matthew, Mark, and Luke) were written before 70 A.D.\n \n Similarly, this argument is important when we consider the dating of the book of Acts which was written after the gospel of Luke by Luke himself. Acts is a history of the Christian church right after Jesus' ascension. Acts also fails to mention the incredibly significant events of 70 A.D. which would have been extremely relevant and prophetically important and naturally would have garnered inclusion into Acts had it occurred before Acts was written. Remember, Acts is a book of the history of the early Christian church. The fact that the incredibly significant destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple is not recorded is very strong evidence that Acts was written before A.D. 70. If we add to this the fact that Acts does not include the accounts of \"Nero's persecution of the Christians in A.D. 64 or the deaths of James (A.D. 62), Paul (A.D. 64), and Peter (A.D. 65),\"1 and we have further evidence that it was written very early and not long after Jesus' ascension into heaven.\n \n If we look at Acts 1:1-2 it says, \"The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach, 2 until the day when He was taken up, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.\" Most scholars affirm that Acts was written by Luke and that Theophilus (Grk. \"lover of God\") \"may have been Luke's patron who financed the writing of Luke and Acts.\"2 This means that the gospel of Luke was written before Acts.\n \n \"At the earliest, Acts cannot have been written prior to the latest firm chronological marker recorded in the book-Festus's appointment as procurator (24:27), which, on the basis of independent sources, appears to have occurred between A.D. 55 and 59.\"3 \n \n \"It is increasingly admitted that the Logia [Q] was very early, before 50 A.D., and Mark likewise if Luke wrote the Acts while Paul was still alive. Luke's Gospel comes before the Acts (Acts 1:1). The date of Acts is still in dispute, but the early date (about A.D. 63) is gaining support constantly.\"4 \n \n For clarity, Q is supposedly one of the source documents used by both Matthew and Luke in writing their gospels. If Q actually existed then that would push the first writings of Christ's words and deeds back even further lessening the available time for myth to creep in and adding to the validity and accuracy of the gospel accounts. If what is said of Acts is true, this would mean that Luke was written at least before A.D. 63 and possibly before 55 - 59 since Acts is the second in the series of writings by Luke. This means that the gospel of Luke was written within 30 years of Jesus' death.\n \n When were the gospels written and by whom? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n Matthew\n \n The early church unanimously held that the gospel of Matthew was the first written gospel and was penned by the apostle of the same name (Matt. 10:2-4). Lately, the priority of Matthew as the first written gospel has come under suspicion with Mark being considered by many to be the first written gospel. The debate is far from over.\n \n The historian Papias mentions that the gospel of Matthew was originally in Aramaic or Hebrew and attributes the gospel to Matthew the apostle.5\n \n \"Irenaeus (ca. a.d. 180) continued Papias's views about Matthew and Mark and added his belief that Luke, the follower of Paul, put down in a book the gospel preached by that apostle, and that John, the Beloved Disciple, published his Gospel while residing in Asia. By the time of Irenaeus, Acts was also linked with Luke, the companion of Paul.\"6 \n \n This would mean that if Matthew did write in Aramaic originally, that he may have used Mark as a map, adding and clarifying certain events as he remembered them. But, this is not known for sure.\n \n The earliest quotation of Matthew is found in Ignatius who died around 115 A.D. Therefore, Matthew was in circulation well before Ignatius came on the scene. The various dates most widely held as possible writing dates of the Gospel are between A.D. 40 - 140. But Ignatius died around 115 A.D. and he quoted Matthew. Therefore Matthew had to be written before he died. Nevertheless, it is generally believed that Matthew was written before A.D. 70 and as early as A.D. 50.",

You claim you know for certain, I disagree. \n\n \n I didn't say you have anything against me personally, it's your animosity towards born again christians in general that reveals your religious bigotry. And your disagreement that I know for certain what my place is in life also means nothing since you can't appreciate the truth I know. My greatest question in life from childhood was why do I exist. It ate at me to know what the reason for our existence was. Only when I got saved and received Gods Holy Spirit within me did I get that answer and it is the most important question and answer any of us can ask and receive in life. \n \n Have you discovered why you exist and you know for certain that you are right? I doubt it since you believe you evolved from some germ that spontaneously appeared from the primordial ooze some 3.5 billion years ago. But good luck clinging to the fable that was most assuredly and admittedly created by fallen men with no faith just as you represent.\n \n \nIf you had been born in a Buddhist country you would now be defending Budda.

And you just proved you still don't get the concept of true salvation at all. You admitted you were born into christianity and went to a christian church but since you never personally met the living God via the born again experience you are as spiritually dead as a muslim who believes in Mohammed. \n \n So even though I wasn't born into a christian family, I searched for the truth and God found me in all of my ignorance and sinfulness. I am saved by grace not by any worthiness within myself.\n \n \n I'm not making up any lies, it's a simply fact that YOU DON\"T KNOW any more than anyone else on this planet, and to make the claim that you do is absurd. \n\n \n I'm not alone here in my confidence. You can and most likely have debated many believers who sound like I do and you have probably told all of them they are delusional. The sad fact for you is we aren't delusional but we do know the living God personally because we are attached to Him by that crimson cord of Jesus blood which was shed for our sins. And your repeated denials of that relationship which hundreds of millions of believers around the world have experienced does nothing to diminish the eternal truth I know.\n \n \nI personally don't care if you CHOOSE to believe in an imaginary God. I CHOOSE not to believe in any god, yet you and your kind attack me, call me an infidel,and constantly judge me because I choose not to believe in your God or your beliefs.

You believe what you want to.. but let me believe what I want to without Trying to Force your God down my throat. Religion has done enough damage to this world isn't it time to stop .\n\n \n Hey, get this right, will you? I'm not attacking you and I haven't called you an infidel at all. That word is not in my vocabulary. You are spiritually dead and a lost soul at this point. In this spiritual war between good and evil during this Age you are a DOA on the battle field of life. If you die in your sin that is exactly what you will realize seconds after you perish and wake up dead. You will instantly know you wasted your life and ignored as well as rejected the very God who created you PERSONALLY for fellowship WITH HIM and died on the Cross to redeem you.\n \n You will know the truth and will understand that you deceived yourself as you believed the lies of the devil. You will also comprehend eternity and realize where you'll be spending it. And your greatest never ending regret will be your memories of these truths I and others like me told you and the willful stubbornness you exercised in attacking us for the loving good news of salvation we were sharing with you. \n \n I have held out the keys to the kingdom of Heaven to you in our exchange but like a pig in a poke full of mud you have kicked it under foot because of your arrogance and pride that you are the smartest kid on the block.

In later Jewish messianic tradition and eschatology, messiah refers to a leader anointed by God, and in some cases, a future King of Israel, physically descended from the Davidic line, who will rule the people of a united tribes of Israel[2] and herald the Messianic Age[3] of global peace.

Also, in response to that claim, God sent Nathan the prophet to David, to speak these words to him: \"When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he shall be My son.\" (II Samuel 7:12-14) \n \n This is an Old Testament promise which only requires an honest interpretation to admit it is foretelling the coming Son of God whom Jesus the Christ fulfills to a T. Especially when He is considered in light of the fullness of His life experiences as outlined in scripture, both old and new testaments.",

Enjoy ....\n \n Not only Contradictions from John vs. the other Gospels but a few other Contradictory Verses for you to Try to explain like all \" Good\" Christians do.\n \n  In Matthew, Mark and Luke the last supper takes place on the first day of the Passover (Matthew 26:17, Mark 14:12, Luke 22:7).\n In John's gospel it takes place a day earlier and Jesus is crucified on the first day of the Passover (John 19:14).\n \n \n a. Matthew, Mark and Luke say that Jesus was taken directly to the high priest (Matthew 26:57, Mark 14:53 and Luke 22:54).\n \n b. John says that Jesus was taken first to Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest (John 18:13) who, after an indeterminate period of time, sent Jesus to the high priest (John 18:24).\n \n \n a. Matthew 26:57 says that on the night Jesus was arrested the priests and scribes were gathered together prior to Jesus being brought to the high priest.\n \n b. Mark 14:53 says the priests and scribes gathered together on the night of Jesus' arrest after Jesus was brought to the high priest.\n \n c. Luke 22:66 says the priests and scribes assembled the day after Jesus was arrested.\n \n d. John mentions only the high priest - no other priests or scribes play a role in questioning Jesus.\n \n \n 1. Mark 15:7 and Luke 23:19 say that Barabbas was guilty of insurrection and murder.\n \n 2. John 18:40 says that Barabbas was a robber.\n \n \n Matthew 27:38 and Mark 15:27 say that Jesus was crucified between two robbers (Luke just calls them criminals; John simply calls them men). It is a historical fact that the Romans did not crucify robbers. Crucifixion was reserved for insurrectionists and rebellious slaves.\n \n \n \n 1. Who found the empty tomb?\n \n a. According to Matthew 28:1, only \"Mary Magdalene and the other Mary.\"\n \n b. According to Mark 16:1, \"Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome.\"\n \n c. According to Luke 23:55, 24:1 and 24:10, \"the women who had come with him out of Galilee.\" Among these women were \"Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James.\" Luke indicates in verse 24:10 that there were at least two others.\n \n d. According to John 20:1-4, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb alone, saw the stone removed, ran to find Peter, and returned to the tomb with Peter and another disciple.\n \n \n \n 3. Who did the women tell about the empty tomb?\n \n a. According to Mark 16:8, \"they said nothing to anyone.\"\n \n b. According to Matthew 28:8, they \"ran to report it to His disciples.\"\n \n c. According to Luke 24:9, \"they reported these things to the eleven and to all the rest.\"\n \n d. According to John 20:18, Mary Magdalene announces to the disciples that she has seen the Lord.\n \n \n \n At one point the Pharisees come to Jesus and ask him for a sign.\n \n 1. In Mark 8:12 Jesus says that \"no sign shall be given to this generation.\"\n \n 2. In contradiction to Mark, in Matthew 12:39 Jesus says that only one sign would be given - the sign of Jonah. Jesus says that just as Jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Here Jesus makes an incorrect prediction - he only spends two nights in the tomb (Friday and Saturday nights), not three nights.\n \n 3. In contradiction to both Mark and Matthew, the gospel of John speaks of many signs that Jesus did:\n \n a. The miracle of turning water into wine at the wedding in Cana is called the beginning (or first) of the signs that Jesus did (John 2:11).\n \n b. The healing at Capernaum is the \"second sign\" (John 4:54).\n \n c. Many people were following Jesus \"because they were seeing the signs He was performing\" (John 6:2).\n \n \n \n 1. In Matthew 4:18-22 and Mark 1:16-20, Peter and Andrew are casting nets into the sea. Jesus calls out to them and they leave their nets and follow him. Jesus then goes on a little further and sees James and John mending their nets with their father. He calls to them and they leave their father and follow him.\n \n 2. In Luke 5:1-11, Jesus asks Peter to take him out in Peter's boat so Jesus can preach to the multitude. James and John are in another boat. When Jesus finishes preaching, he tells Peter how to catch a great quantity of fish (John 21:3-6 incorporates this story in a post- resurrection appearance). After Peter catches the fish, he and James and John are so impressed that after they bring their boats to shore they leave everything and follow Jesus.\n \n 3. In John 1:35-42, Andrew hears John the Baptist call Jesus the Lamb of God. Andrew then stays with Jesus for the remainder of the day and then goes to get his brother Peter and brings him to meet Jesus.\n \n \n When Jesus summons the twelve disciples to send them out to proclaim the kingdom of God, he lists the things the disciples should not take with them.\n \n 1. In Matthew 10:9-10 and Luke 9:3-5, a staff is included in the list of things not to take.\n \n 2. In contradiction to Matthew and Luke, Mark 6:8 makes a specific exception - the disciples may take a staff.",

Here Jesus makes an incorrect prediction - he only spends two nights in the tomb (Friday and Saturday nights), not three nights.\n \n 3. In contradiction to both Mark and Matthew, the gospel of John speaks of many signs that Jesus did:\n \n a. The miracle of turning water into wine at the wedding in Cana is called the beginning (or first) of the signs that Jesus did (John 2:11).\n \n b. The healing at Capernaum is the \"second sign\" (John 4:54).\n \n c. Many people were following Jesus \"because they were seeing the signs He was performing\" (John 6:2).\n \n 1. In Matthew 4:18-22 and Mark 1:16-20, Peter and Andrew are casting nets into the sea. Jesus calls out to them and they leave their nets and follow him. Jesus then goes on a little further and sees James and John mending their nets with their father. He calls to them and they leave their father and follow him.\n \n 2. In Luke 5:1-11, Jesus asks Peter to take him out in Peter's boat so Jesus can preach to the multitude. James and John are in another boat. When Jesus finishes preaching, he tells Peter how to catch a great quantity of fish (John 21:3-6 incorporates this story in a post- resurrection appearance). After Peter catches the fish, he and James and John are so impressed that after they bring their boats to shore they leave everything and follow Jesus.\n \n 3. In John 1:35-42, Andrew hears John the Baptist call Jesus the Lamb of God. Andrew then stays with Jesus for the remainder of the day and then goes to get his brother Peter and brings him to meet Jesus.\n \n \n When Jesus summons the twelve disciples to send them out to proclaim the kingdom of God, he lists the things the disciples should not take with them.\n \n 1. In Matthew 10:9-10 and Luke 9:3-5, a staff is included in the list of things not to take.\n \n 2. In contradiction to Matthew and Luke, Mark 6:8 makes a specific exception - the disciples may take a staff.\n\n \n Tsk, tsk, tsk...\n \n You screwed up, as usual.\n \n Harmony of the Gospels\n \n Gospel Harmony: A chronological chart of the Life of Jesus Christ.\n \n The Gospels (In Chronological and Historical Harmony) Greenley Commentary\n \n Harmony of the Four Gospels | Comparison of the Four Gospels in the Bible\n \n That pretty much bursts your bubble.\n \n And the radical left is losing the House.

   "Just a bit of theological insight for you regarding the four gospels, x; Imagine you and 3 other people are standing at a crossroads intersection and you all see a 3 car pile up in the center of it. From each of your respective perspectives you would all see something different. But separately, each of you see's only one angle of the accident. That's why police interview all witnesses in order to get all the angles and perspectives of the accident.\n \n So it is with the four gospels. They aren't meant to coincide with each other but to give different and unique perspectives of the same events. If you took each of the links you posted and studied what they say with an open mind you would get a fuller and more complete view of what occurred.\n \n I know you'll probably reject this explanation out of hand, but I thought I'd share it with you anyway because it is the theological truth.\n\n \n Which is why I gave a specific example, on which day was Jesus Crucified?\n \n Certain events may be viewed differently, but there has to be agreement on certain things. You can't give specifics about doctrine using only ambigous biblical references. Slight variations can be expected, but give the same regard to the reverse. \n \n The day and time of Jesus' death is of vital importance to both the Jews of the time who would need to be convinced he had died and to Christians that he rose when he said he would. \n \n The soundness has more to do with your desire for it to be so. Your claims that others lack objectivity when considering the veracity of the Gospels is no different than what you do with evidence contrary to your belief.",

   "Does Believing the Bible Make You Irrational?\n\"The Bible said it, I believe it, that settles it,\" proclaims a common Christian bumper sticker. Strong belief in the Bible is considered a mark of spiritual maturity in most conservative Christian churches. Christians esteem that person in the congregation who is able to back up everything he or she says with a verse, whose Bible pages are yellow and wrinkled from flipping through them so often.\n \n Outsiders, however, are likely to see a person with whom they cannot reason. What in the church is considered a virtue is to them a vice. \"The Bible said it and that settles it\"? Apparently the Bible is only good for making one impervious to rational persuasion, they conclude. Or for enabling one conveniently to cut the argument short. People begin to suspect that perhaps the Bible is only useful for those who refuse to think, or for those wanting to justify their own bigotry.\n \n If many Christians seem difficult to reason with, it is probably true that they don't know how to think, and there probably are many people who do have bigotry they want to justify. This may have less to do with their Christianity than with the reality that this is simply the way most people are, regardless of whether or not they are Christians. Christians seem to make up the greater population of ignorant and bigoted people simply because they are more vocal and shameless in airing their true opinions. The common decency that restrains most people from saying what they really think has little stronghold on the person who is convinced that offending people with judgmental pronouncements is what it means to take a stand for God.\n \n Of course, most people don't care about the private opinions of others. They just want people to be civil enough to not to express them in hurtful and inappropriate ways. Here, I grant, Christians have failed far more miserably than the rest of the population.\n \n Why are Christians so bent on airing their views? Many Christians are actually told that it doesn't matter that they lack reasoning skills, or that they know little about other religious and philosophical worldviews. All that matters is that they know the truth of the Bible, and this is apparently reason enough for people to listen to them whether or not they are making much sense. They are not to be shy about inviting themselves even into arenas of debate where they are clearly in above their heads. Such persons imagine that they are bringing God's truth into the discussion, when in reality all they are doing is confirming to everyone involved that there must surely be a relationship between simple-mindedness and Christian belief.\n \n One might think that this only proves that the Bible does make people irrational. For since the Bible claims to be the truth, even the authoritative word of God, people who believe they have the truth will naturally want to impose it upon everyone else. Such a person has little use for the process of reasoning because all that matters to him is the bottom line. He has already looked up the answer in the back of the book; why then the need to show his work? Everyone is just supposed to take his word for it.\n \n Case in point: The Bible uses some pretty strong language to condemn same-sex sexual relations. How then can homosexuality be unchosen? If it is unchosen, we Christians reason, that seems to imply there is no moral culpability involved in homosexual behavior, and that goes against biblical teaching. So because the claims of homosexuals don't appear to match up with the view of the Bible, we tell ourselves we don't need to listen to them because we know better. Even in the face of an overwhelming consensus among homosexuals from all walks of life that their homosexual inclination is involuntary, we go to great lengths to deny what others are coming quite undramatically to accept. Perhaps the reason we assert and reassert our arguments in shrill and authoritative tones is that we are hoping no one will notice the shallow basis upon which they are built.\n \n Many Christians arrive at such a place not because of their belief in the Bible per se, but because they believe in a certain view of the Bible. Believing the Bible can make you irrational only if you view it as merely an answer book and do not think there is a rationale behind its teachings. This means that if the promptings of common sense contradict what the Bible seems to be saying, you will tend to ignore them instead of considering whether there is something deeper in the biblical text that needs to be investigated. Those common sense promptings couldn't be from God because you view God as someone who is not interested in helping you understand the world around you. He instead requires a kind of raw obedience that is always demanding that you act counter-intuitively, that you deny reality, that you rework the data to make it add up to a conclusion that doesn't make sense.\n \n The correct view of the Bible, of course, is that its teachings ought to help us make sense of life. They should resonate with reason and with common sense. This is not the same as saying that we should try to get the Bible to approve of whatever people feel like doing, which is what Christians understand gays and lesbians to be saying when they argue that they cannot help being homosexual. Christians are rightly concerned about having objective moral guidance to restrain whimsical and irresponsible behavior, and clearly there are many homosexuals who could use some moral guidance. But it is also clear when you hear gays and lesbians talk in depth about their homosexual feelings that this is not simply a case of people bent on doing what feels good to them and so morality can just take a hike.\n \n Any fair-minded person who reads the personal accounts of people who have battled fear and self-hatred to come to terms with their own homosexuality will be struck by the authenticity of such stories. It is amazing how often words like \"honesty,\" \"integrity\" and \"wholeness\" are used unabashedly to describe this journey toward self-acceptance. (Would adulterers dare to defend their actions using such terms?) It certainly ought to make one question whether going around calling gay people \"perverts\" and characterizing them as sexual predators is really a very informed way of trying to bring biblical teaching to bear on the homosexual experience.\n \n Historically, the church has always recognized the validity of rational inquiry. The churchmen of old used to say that God has written two books, the Bible and the Book of Nature. God invites us to study the Bible to know the way of salvation; but he also invites us to apply our reason in studying his creation, i.e., the Book of Nature. That includes fields such as biology, mathematics, psychology, music, physics, etc.\n \n The church has always viewed the Bible as more authoritative than human reason, so when the two seem to clash the church will favor what it believes the Bible teaches. Historically speaking, then, the current resistance of the church to the arguments of homosexuals is a fairly typical response. Of course, it is a fallacy to think that just because the Bible is more authoritative than reason, that the conclusions of reason must be false. Sometimes the conclusions of reason are legitimate and ought to inform our interpretation of the Bible.\n \n For example in the 17th century, Galileo upset people's customary understanding of the universe when he taught Copernicus's theory that the sun and not the earth was at the center of the solar system. The church responded by opposing Galileo's observations about the earth's orbit around the sun because the Bible seemed to teach that the earth was stationary. Psalm 93:1, for example, says \"the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.\" Much uproar and decrying of heresy followed Galileo's findings, resulting in his public trial and condemnation. It took a century or two, but the church did eventually come accept the Copernican theory, realizing that this biblical passage was simply a metaphorical way of talking about the security of our human existence under the everlasting rule of God, and was not an objective scientific commentary on the earth's relationship to the rest of the solar system.\n \n When it comes to considering whether the findings of reason should force an adjustment in our understanding of the Bible, the church typically drags its feet because certain interpretations tend to become almost traditional among Christians, and there is always resistance to changing what people are used to. But of a greater concern is that making such adjustments is always risky because a wrong move in that area could threaten to undermine more essential Christian teachings, such as those relating to the doctrine of salvation.\n \n Think of it like this. Christian theology is a system and all its doctrines fit logically together, like a giant jigsaw puzzle. The most important doctrines are the pieces located at the center of the puzzle. Modifying your understanding of one doctrine is like changing the shape of one of the puzzle pieces; the surrounding pieces also need to change shape a little to accommodate it. It's fine if it is only one of the outer pieces that needs some adjusting. Problems arise when the adjustment is so great that the subsequent chain reaction of adjustments threatens the central pieces; or when the piece that people are considering for adjustment is located too close to the center of the puzzle. A mistake could spell disaster, and the leaders of the church are aware of all the times in church history when such disastrous mistakes have been made.\n \n Unfortunately, the rise of liberal theology during the Enlightenment, when theologians began to use reason to deny the miracles of the Bible, was one such disaster that has caused conservative Christians to be suspicious of human reason to this day. Now denying the miracles of the Bible is pretty serious business, because belief in miracles is tied in with some of the most fundamental Christian doctrines such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, and the second coming of Christ. The outcome of this bitter controversy was the splitting of Christian theologians into liberal and conservative camps. The former denied the historicity of the biblical miracles and the latter was put in the defensive posture of having always to justify their belief in them.\n \n The outcome of this controversy was that conservative Christians felt burned by human reason, and began to view the conclusions of rational argumentation with great suspicion. Over the years they have became so jaded that it would be accurate to say that modern day fundamentalism is a thoroughly anti-intellectual and anti-rational movement. For these Christians hostility toward reason has practically become the hallmark of Bible belief. It reminds me of a plaque I saw in one fundamentalist pastor's study: \"You don't need a PhD to believe the Bible, but to deny it you might.\"\n \n And so if Christians seem difficult to argue with, it is because many of them have adopted the odd idea that they can bypass rational persuasion and simply assert the Bible. To try to relate to people at the level of reason would be tantamount to a betrayal of faith, and so they are not concerned about relating. Their aim is to assault people with a truth-blitz, and if their audience rejects them it only confirms what rebellious heathen they are.\n \n With such a mentality, I wonder what hope there is that conservative Christians will ever be able to respond appropriately and intelligently to the increasing visibility of gays and lesbians in their communities, whose lives are dismantling all the old stereotypes, whose positive contributions to society are causing people to rethink their prejudices, and who will probably not be going away any time soon?\n \n The irrationality of Christians is not in their concern to defend the Bible. Their irrationality is in thinking that defending the Bible means closing their eyes to reality, because it is saying that defending the truth involves closing your eyes to truth. And for all their protesting that they believe in the Bible, is it not an admission of doubt rather than faith to go to such lengths to protect it from any kind of challenge or scrutiny? I mean, do we Christians believe in the God of the Bible, or do we secretly think he doesn't know what he's doing, and that's why we need to cover for him?\n \n It is unfortunate that conservative Christians have become so intellectually isolated from the debates that are currently taking place in our society. For if we really believe the Bible is God's inerrant and infallible truth, then of all people we ought to be in the best position to confront difficult questions, because we stand in a place of tremendous intellectual security. If what we learn about people's experiences with homosexuality seems to conflict with some of our traditional interpretations of Scripture, we ought to welcome the challenge. For we know that there must be answers out there if we believe that the God who authored the Bible is also the God who created humanity with all its complexities and mysteries. Real confidence in the Bible, and in the God who inspired it, ought to open up our minds, not close them.\n",

   "Go to perseus project.com, it is a little difficult at first, but once you figure it out you can translate from english to greek to latin and vice versa get definitions on individual words and run comaprisons on words as well as usage not only in biblical texts but numerous other collections. It's not the most user friendly but is extensive.\n \n Your telling me not to miss the forest through the trees, but that is exactly what your doing or worse spreading a corrupt version of God's will. Whether it effects anything is secondary to what minor and then major distortions even done unintentionally led to division and misunderstanding. A result contrary to God's desire. Saying it doesn't matter is not understanding the effects. 30,000 different denominations, sure they all believe Jesus but based on results it is more important for them to be right. This is one of the things Jesus said Judaism was becoming. \n \n Your inability to maintain your faith unless the Bible is true leaves you and many others with a sometimes irrational defense of scripture. If the book is wrong it's wrong and I find it hard to believe that God would find the actions of his people towards correcting these errors acceptable.\n\n \n You're expectorating, as usual. First, there's no evidence I've seen that what you believe is viable. For instance, you say you've researched the theories for a Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday crucifixion. So tell me, what day of the week is the \"preparation\" day? Wednesday? Thursday, Friday? In the Gospels, was it the preparation day for the weekly sabbath or the preparation day for the Passover that was being written about? How do you know which day they were referring to in their mind? Do you agree that there are \"High Sabbaths\" that can fall on days other than Saturday (i.e. sundown Friday to sundown Saturday)? What is a \"High Sabbath\" in your world? When Passover is being spoken of, was it the Passover week or a Passover day?\n \n Was John at odds with the Synoptic Gospels on which date Jesus was crucified?\n \n \"...the Greek term tou pascha (lit., \"of the Passover\") is taken to be equivalent to the Passover Week. This refers to the seven-day Feast of Unleavened Bread (Heb. massot) that immediately followed the initial slaughtering and eating of the Passover lamb on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month Abib, which by Hebrew reckoning would mean the commencement of the fifteenth day, right after sunset. The week of masso-t, coming right after on the heels of Passover itself (during which masso-t were actually eaten, along with the lamb, bitter herbs, etc.) very naturally came to be known as Passover Week (cf. Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed., 12:1041), extending from the fifteenth to the twenty-first of Abib, inclusively.

The angel noted their amazement (verse John 5 ) and urges the cessation of it using this very word. The Nazarene (ton Nazarhnon). Only in Mark, to identify \"Jesus\" to the women. The crucified one (ton estaurwmenon). This also in Matthew 28:5 . This description of his shame has become his crown of glory, for Paul ( Galatians 6:14 ), and for all who look to the Crucified and Risen Christ as Saviour and Lord. He is risen (hgerqh). First aorist passive indicative, the simple fact. In 1 Corinthians 15:4 Paul uses the perfect passive indicative eghgertai to emphasize the permanent state that Jesus remains risen. Behold the place (ide o topo). Here ide is used as an interjection with no effect on the case (nominative).

How odd wouldn't you say?\n\n \n I guess it doesn't bother you in the least that there's not one Bible on earth that buys into your translation? If there is, what is it?\n \n The late liberal scholar John A.T. Robinson of Cambridge conceded that the burial of Jesus &#65533;is one of the earliest and best-attested facts about Jesus.&#65533; This statement is based on several sound arguments. First, as mentioned earlier, both liberal and conservative NT scholars agree that Jesus&#65533; body was buried in the private tomb of Joseph of Arithmathea. Christian scholar William Lane Craig underscores this fact by explaining that: (1) Joseph of Arithmathea, as a member of the Jewish court that condemned Jesus, is unlikely to be a Christian invention; Christ&#65533;s early disciples would not have attributed such a respectable act to a member of this group if it was not factual; (2) no competing burial story exists; (3) the account of Jesus&#65533; entombment is substantiated by Mark&#65533;s gospel and is, therefore, far too early to have been the subject of legendary corruption. Furthermore, in ty, women had low social status and their testimonies had very limited legal validity. Therefore, if the empty tomb story were simply legendary, women would not have been featured as the initial discoverers of this dubious event. The fact that they were, presents strong evidence that the four gospel writers faithfully recorded what actually happened. \n \n Finally, the earliest Jewish response to the resurrection presupposes the empty tomb. Instead of denying that the tomb was empty, the enemies of Christ accused his disciples of stealing the body. \n \n After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of who are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all to me also.&#65533; (1 Corinthians 15:3-8) According to a great majority of scholars, Paul is reiterating an early creed that can be dated to within three to eight years of the crucifixion itself. The historian Gary Habermas states that this creed is not only early, but it is also free from legendary contamination, unambiguous and specific, and ultimately rooted in eyewitness accounts. \n \n In addition, Peter, Paul, and the rest of the apostles claimed that Christ appeared to hundreds of people who were alive and available for cross-examination. \n \n \"There is evidence to support Christ's resurrection!\"",

Moses was the greatest of all prophets. \n \n &#8226; Origin of Universe and Life\n Most believe that Genesis is to be understood symbolically. God created and controls all phenomena revealed by modern science. \n \n &#8226; After Death\n Reform Jews believe in the world to come and a messianic age (but no individual Messiah). Personal beliefs in the details of afterlife are diverse, as there is no official position. Some believe in heaven and hell but only as states of consciousness; some believe in reincarnation; some believe God is all-forgiving; and some may not believe in an actual afterlife. Regardless, Judaism generally focuses on living a virtuous life, rather than working toward reward after death. \n \n &#8226; Why Evil?\n No original sin. Most often, Satan is interpreted symbolically to represent selfish desires that are inherent within all. God gave people free will, and people are responsible for their actions. \n \n &#8226; Salvation\n The main emphasis is on living the kind of life that God commands, which will surely be rewarded if there is an afterlife. Most believe God is forgiving of all; there is no hell to which some are condemned. Salvation is achieved through faith and prayer to God, good works, concern for the earth and humanity, and behavior that does no harm to others. The extent to which one follows Jewish Law is an individual decision. \n \n &#8226; Undeserved Suffering\n God gave humans free will to feel pleasure and pain, and his purpose in allowing deep suffering of the innocent must be good even if mysterious. It is generally believed that God suffers along with the sufferer. More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need. \n \n &#8226; Contemporary Issues\n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth.

   "I guess it doesn't bother you in the least that there's not one Bible on earth that buys into your translation? If there is, what is it?\n\n \n If you understood the making of the bible even today you would not be so surprised. Also I asked for the Greek not English.\n \n \nThe late liberal scholar John A.T. Robinson of Cambridge conceded that the burial of Jesus &#65533;is one of the earliest and best-attested facts about Jesus.&#65533; \n \n \n That is not a concession the Gospel accounts are the ONLY source of information about Jesus\n \n \n \nThis statement is based on several sound arguments. First, as mentioned earlier, both liberal and conservative NT scholars agree that Jesus&#65533; body was buried in the private tomb of Joseph of Arithmathea. \n \n \n They agree that is what is stated in the Gospels. Nothing more than that. Everybody agrees that the Big Bad Wolf huffed and he Puffed and he blew their house down. Doesn't mean it really happened.\n \n \n \nChristian scholar William Lane Craig underscores this fact by explaining that: (1) Joseph of Arithmathea, as a member of the Jewish court that condemned Jesus, is unlikely to be a Christian invention; \n\n \n Not true. It would help their cause immensely to say even members of the council were Christians at heart. See even Jewish leaders knew Jesus was the son of God. What is unlikely is that he would be permitted to be buried in a private tomb.\n \n \nChrist&#65533;s early disciples would not have attributed such a respectable act to a member of this group if it was not factual; \n\n \n Why did they have something against the Jews? Do you mean to imply that he wasn't despised and hated and that there was even pity for what had happened? Again it would be in their Christians best interest to fabricate the story. He had to have been buried and who else would have been able to have him taken down early and placed somewhere he could rise from. Without Joseph the resurrection runs into problems. It is not only likely that they would attribute this to a Joseph like person but the resurrection can't happen without it.\n \n \n \n(2) no competing burial story exists; \n\n \n Do you suppose the Gospels would have different burial stories? How asinine is this as a proof?\n \n \n\n (3) the account of Jesus&#65533; entombment is substantiated by Mark&#65533;s gospel and is, therefore, far too early to have been the subject of legendary corruption. \n \n \n 10, 20, 30 years of word of mouth is not sufficient time? You have proof in the gospels themselves that it takes less time for a story to be built upon. Each gospel gets more exotic than the previous one. It has been proven retelling a paragraph can be corrupted within 10 tellings. Paul's letters are more then sufficient to demonstrate their existed a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding within the early churches.\n \n \nFurthermore, in ty, women had low social status and their testimonies had very limited legal validity. Therefore, if the empty tomb story were simply legendary, women would not have been featured as the initial discoverers of this dubious event. The fact that they were, presents strong evidence that the four gospel writers faithfully recorded what actually happened. \n\n \n How can they faithfully tell what happened four different ways. Mary runs away and tells no one, she talks with one boy in white, two boys in white, she sees Jesus and talks to him, she doesn't, Peter finds the tomb empty first, Mary finds it empty first. These are not 4 people's versions of the same event with slight variations. She tells no one vs. she has a conversation with Jesus and twice runs to get the Apostles are major differences. They most certainly did not record faithfully decades after the fact.\n \n \n \nFinally, the earliest Jewish response to the resurrection presupposes the empty tomb. Instead of denying that the tomb was empty, the enemies of Christ accused his disciples of stealing the body. \n\n \n And what is the earliest Jewish response?\n \n \nAfter that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of who are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all to me also.&#65533; (1 Corinthians 15:3-8) According to a great majority of scholars, Paul is reiterating an early creed that can be dated to within three to eight years of the crucifixion itself. \n\n \n Habermas got his aXX handed to him with this idea. He got so torn apart that he quit using it in his debates because it was all wishful thinking and based on nothing.\n \n \nThe historian Gary Habermas states that this creed is not only early, but it is also free from legendary contamination, unambiguous and specific, and ultimately rooted in eyewitness accounts. \n\n \n Since there is absolutely no way he can prove this claim he no longer makes it to people who might dispute it. It is only used by the Shepard to fleece the flock\n \n \n \nIn addition, Peter, Paul, and the rest of the apostles claimed that Christ appeared to hundreds of people who were alive and available for cross-examination. \n \n \n Really the rest of of them all had a list of names of the people who Jesus appeared to? How about a list of names of people who saw the walking dead that Matthew says entered the city, before Jesus had risen I might add. What happened to them I wonder and you would think zombies walking the streets would be something to write about, but not even the walking dead could get Historians of the time to write about Jesus\n \n \n \"There is evidence to support Christ's resurrection!\"[/QUOTE]\n \n So you see you have nothing but a lot of want. No real facts just a lot of people who want it to be true and are willing to look past the obvious and accept it at face value and are rewarded for for having that faith",

If the rest are miserable then it's because they also rejected the truth at Mt. Sinai and everywhere else in the OT where they were judged. Like the Lord said, \"I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.\" - Exodus 32:9\n \n But still, there is mercy in Christ for those who will receive the truth.\n \n I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: \n &#8220;The deliverer will come from Zion; \n he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. \n And this is my covenant with them \n when I take away their sins.&#8221; - Romans 11\n \n As for the rest of your denials and WATs (wild-a**ed theories) in post # 233, I'll take the Word of God and you can have your contrary theories. \n \n All four Gospels confirm Christ is Risen, and that's the end of it.",

Go ahead and actually support something you assert for once. \n \n As for one upping Judaism, that is also horse dung since true christians fully accept that \"salvation came to the world by way of the Jew\". And you neglect to appreciate or are oblivious to the fact that the complete first church in Jerusalem was made up of loyal and faithful Jews, except for Dr. Luke who was a Greek/gentile, I believe. And we believer and followers of Christ our Lord believe the same Gospel message that they preached and adhered to. So get your facts right about what is true before you misrepresent the historical and gospel roots of our faith. \n \n \n What is even more amusing is that you can only hope that you are right.

Your soul may not be saved by works but they are expected of you none the less.\n\n \n The bolded is more evidence that you are steeped in spiritual darkness and have idea what the gospel promises are to believers or what we personally receive from God through the salvation experience. You don't understand the promise that Jesus made that we would receive the comforter, the Holy Spirit of God Himself as our indwelling guide for life once we accept Jesus as our Savior.\n Jhn 14:26 and the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and remind you of all things that I said to you.\n Jhn 15:26 `And when the Comforter may come, whom I will send to you from the Father -- the Spirit of truth, who from the Father doth come forth, he will testify of me;\n Jhn 16:7 `But I tell you the truth; it is better for you that I go away, for if I may not go away, the Comforter will not come unto you, and if I go on, I will send Him unto you;\n Also, to reiterate, The Apostle John, a Jew is the inspired author of this repeated promise from the gospel with his name on it. \n \n Also, why is it that you perceive our warnings that denying Christ will separate you from Gods love in eternity as we condemning you to hell? A warning of impending doom if one doesn't repent isn't a condemnation, it is given in love to lead you to a saving grace and a knowledge of Gods eternal truths. Just so you know...\n \n \nLike many Christians you have given very little thought to the afterlife. You seems to think that it will be the same as it is now just less people who don't think like you. That you will carry your emotions and experiences with you and have a eternal picnic in the clouds with loved ones who are waiting for you.\n\n \n Again you attempt to speak for believers when you have no idea what we believe or what Heaven will actually be like.\n \n \n That isn't what the Bible says heaven is like and common sense from the hints given makes it a very different place than what you think.

True born again believers have never taken anything from Israel or the Jew. We/I totally support Israel and understand very well that Messiah came from her and that any Jew who accepts Jesus Christ doesn't convert to christianity, but becomes a completed Jew. \n \n You act like the Crusades were a biblically based born again christian war against Israel when the moslems were a major player in the events that transpired. Here, educate yourself: Saladin &#8212; Salah al-Din al-Ayubbi\n In 1174, Saladin began his expansion of his territory. In just twelve years he conquered Damascus, Alleppo, and Iraq. Saladin united the efforts of Egypt and Baghdad, and preached to the Muslim world to rise in a Jihad, a Holy War, a counter crusade, of all the Muslims against the Christians. Gathering a large force of Muslims of various groups, called Saracens by the Christians, Saladin set out to attack the Christians. Saladin attacked the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187, and after three months of fighting he gained control of the city.\n \n When Jerusalem fell to Saladin, all of Christendom called for a new crusade. In 1189, the nations of western Europe launched the Third Crusade to win back the holy city. During the Third Crusade, led by King Richard the Lionhearted, the King arranged for supplies to be accumulated and ships used to deliver them to his troops as they marched along the coast; however, when the King finally marched inland to besiege Jerusalem, he found that Saladin had stripped the countryside of food and fodder. The wells had been poisoned and Richard realized that his army would fall apart from starvation if he tried to besiege Jerusalem. The crusaders had to settle for a treaty with Saladin that guaranteed Christian pilgrims access to the Holy Places.\n \n The death of Saladin in 1193 led Pope Innocent III to inaugurate the Fourth Crusade, but they could not defeat the empire that Saladin had established. The Ayyubid dynasty, founded by Salah al-Din ibn Ayyub, ruled Egypt and Syria from 1169 to 1250 CE. In some regions of upper Mesopotamia and Yemen, their rule continued until the end of the 15th century.\n \nCan you prove you are not worshiping the work of Satan designed to make the Jewish people turn from God? After all Satan is the great deciever how would you be able to know the difference? And if God permitted it as before you would have no way of knowing. There are hints throughout the Bible that this is the case. How can you prove that Paul was not spoken to by Jesus, but by Satan. Something for you to think about, but you won't which is why you may not find yourself in the third Heaven as described by Paul in his out of body experience.\n\n \n The verses above prove we are not being deceived since we possess the Holy Spirit of God Himself according to His promise of personal salvation through Jesus sacrifice on Calvary's Cross. We are saved by grace and not by works so that no man may boast. It is you who is the pawn of satan and is being deceived by him every second that you oppose Gods plan for your life and accuse His gospel of salvation of being the problem.\n \n In conclusion, we believers are never alone since the Holy Spirit of God dwells within us every moment of our lives and convicts us of Gods truths. It is you who can only hope that your denials of the gospel will pay off when you pass through the veil from life to death.",

   "Talks cheap and as usual you are full of it, go ahead and post even one link to each christian denomination that adheres to each of the points THIS SURVEY REVEALED AS THE MAJORITY BELIEFS OF REFORMED JEWS. Go ahead and actually support something you assert for once. \n\n \n Such a waste. You write so well, but it is always angry, bitter bluster. As usual you make an eloquent argument that lacks substance. I actually do provide evidence to support what I say, but I have noticed you consistently demand evidence, but when given ignore it and rarely provide any for your opinions even when asked.\n \n If you like I will go through every one, but to save some time for the moment I will only do a few. This should be enough to make my point without causing you further embarrassment.\n \n Evil\n \n Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons, or LDS more specifically) do not believe in the concept of original sin as it is generally used in Christianity.\n \n Restoration Movement\n \n Most Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement Churches, such as the Churches of Christ, Christian Churches, and the Disciples of Christ, reject the notion of original sin, believing only in the sins for which men and women are personally responsible.\n \n Eastern Orthodoxy\n \n The Orthodox Church in America makes clear the distinction between \"fallen nature\" and \"fallen man\" and this is affirmed in the early teaching of the Church whose role it is to act as the catalyst that leads to true or inner redemption. Every human person born on this earth bears the image of God undistorted within themselves.[41] Furthermore, they explicitly deny that we inherit guilt from anyone, maintaining that instead we inherit our fallen nature. In this they differ from the Augustinian position common in the West that each person is actually inherits Adam's guilt.\n \n In our Tradition there is no such thing as fallen nature. There are fallen persons, but not fallen nature. The implication of this truth is that we have no excuses for our sins. Do Not Resent, Do Not React, Keep Inner Stillness, 2-3\n \n Original sin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Most American Christians Do Not Believe that Satan or the Holy Spirit Exist \n \n \n \"All 1,871 self-described Christians were asked about their perception of God. In total, three-quarters (78%) said he is the \"all-powerful, all-knowing Creator of the universe who rules the world today.\" The remaining one-quarter chose other descriptions of God &#8211; depictions that are not consistent with biblical teaching (e.g., everyone is god, god refers to the realization of human potential, etc.).\n \n For the other survey items a four-point opinion scale was used to measure people's reactions to statements about each spiritual entity.\n \n Four out of ten Christians (40%) strongly agreed that Satan \"is not a living being but is a symbol of evil.\" An additional two out of ten Christians (19%) said they \"agree somewhat\" with that perspective. A minority of Christians indicated that they believe Satan is real by disagreeing with the statement: one-quarter (26%) disagreed strongly and about one-tenth (9%) disagreed somewhat. The remaining 8% were not sure what they believe about the existence of Satan.\n \n Although a core teaching of the Christian faith is the divinity and perfection of Jesus Christ, tens of millions of Christians do not accept that teaching. More than one-fifth (22%) strongly agreed that Jesus Christ sinned when He lived on earth, with an additional 17% agreeing somewhat. Holding the opposing view were 9% who disagreed somewhat and 46% who disagreed strongly. Six percent did not have an opinion on this matter.\n \n Much like their perceptions of Satan, most Christians do not believe that the Holy Spirit is a living force, either. Overall, 38% strongly agreed and 20% agreed somewhat that the Holy Spirit is \"a symbol of God's power or presence but is not a living entity.\" Just one-third of Christians disagreed that the Holy Spirit is not a living force (9% disagreed somewhat, 25% disagreed strongly) while 9% were not sure.\"\n \n Inconsistencies Noted\n \n The study also identified a number of instances in which people&#8217;s beliefs seemed inconsistent. Among those were the following:\n \n * About half (47%) of the Christians who believed that Satan is merely a symbol of evil nevertheless agreed that a person can be under the influence of spiritual forces such as demons.\n \n * About half (49%) of those who agreed that the Holy Spirit is only a symbol but not a living entity also agreed that the Bible is totally accurate in all of the principles it teaches, even though the Bible clearly describes the Holy Spirit as more than a symbolic reference to God&#8217;s power or presence.\n \n * About one-third (33%) of the self-defined Christians who agree that the Bible, Koran and Book of Mormon all teach the same truths simultaneously contend that the Bible is totally accurate in its principles, even though the three sacred books have very different ideas about truth, salvation, and the nature of God.\n \n These are just excerpts the article is much longer and can be read here\n \n The Barna Group - Most American Christians Do Not Believe that Satan or the Holy Spirit Exist\n \n The Barna Group - Most American Christians Do Not Believe that Satan or the Holy Spirit Exist\n \n \n Homosexual Behavior\n \n Undecided. (Int'l Anglican Communion) (CofE)\n \n The Anglican Communion has been divided over the issue of homosexuality. The Church of England, the mother church of the Communion, currently maintains (according to the statement Issues in Human Sexuality) that same-sex partnerships are acceptable for laypersons but gay clergy are expected to be abstinent.[2] The Lambeth Conference of 1998 called homosexuality \"incompatible with Scripture\" but this remains a purely advisory guideline as there are no communion-wide legislative bodies in the Anglican Church.[3] On the other hand, in 2003 the Episcopal Church, which is the American body (province) of the Anglican Communion, approved Gene Robinson to the bishopric of the diocese of New Hampshire. Bishop Gene Robinson is the first openly gay (non-celibate) clergy to be ordained to the episcopate.[\n \n Contraception\n \n Reformed/ Presbyterian accepted \n \n CofE - accepted \n \n \nAs for one upping Judaism, that is also horse dung since true christians fully accept that \"salvation came to the world by way of the Jew\". And you neglect to appreciate or are oblivious to the fact that the complete first church in Jerusalem was made up of loyal and faithful Jews, except for Dr. Luke who was a Greek/gentile, I believe. And we believer and followers of Christ our Lord believe the same Gospel message that they preached and adhered to. So get your facts right about what is true before you misrepresent the historical and gospel roots of our faith. \n\n \n Yes Paul went before them to praise them for their strict adherence to Christian teachings, right? Or were they no different at the \"church\" (Do you really think James and the rest referred to themselves as The Jerusalem Church?) than every other Jew with the exception of Jesus. The only thing Christians keep from them is the exception they gave to not follow Jewish law handed down by God. My facts are straight you need to do a little reading this weekend or get a better spin on your misinformation.\n \n \n Inspiration & Inerrancy of the Bible \n \n \n Reform\n The Bible is inspired. \"For some, that means the Bible is inerrant. For others, it means that even though the Bible is culturally conditioned and not necessarily factual or even always true, it breathes with the life of God.\" (PCUSA) \n \n \n Luthuran\n Inspired and inerrant. (LCMS)\n \n Inspired but not inerrant. (ELCA)\n \n \n Grace\n \n Luthuran\n Common grace enabling good works given to all; sufficient grace for salvation\n given to elect only \n \n \"We reject every type of millennialism, or Chiliasm, the opinions that Christ will return visibly to this earth a thousand years before the end of the world.\" (LCMS) \n \n \n Baptist\n Salvation cannot be lost. \"Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end.\" (SBC) \n \n Purgatory\n \n Catholic\n Affirmed\n \n Methodists\n Denied. Purgatory is \"vainly invented and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.\" (UMC) \n \n Comparison Charts of Christian Denominations - ReligionFacts\n \n \n Do you need more or is that enough to make my point for you?\n \n \nThe bolded is more evidence that you are steeped in spiritual darkness and have idea what the gospel promises are to believers or what we personally receive from God through the salvation experience. You don't understand the promise that Jesus made that we would receive the comforter, the Holy Spirit of God Himself as our indwelling guide for life once we accept Jesus as our Savior.\n Jhn 14:26 and the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and remind you of all things that I said to you.\n Jhn 15:26 `And when the Comforter may come, whom I will send to you from the Father -- the Spirit of truth, who from the Father doth come forth, he will testify of me;\n Jhn 16:7 `But I tell you the truth; it is better for you that I go away, for if I may not go away, the Comforter will not come unto you, and if I go on, I will send Him unto you;\n\n \n Thank you for restating my point. \n \n \nAlso, to reiterate, The Apostle John, a Jew is the inspired author of this repeated promise from the gospel with his name on it. \n\n \n Prove it. Where is your evidence?\n \n \n \nAlso, why is it that you perceive our warnings that denying Christ will separate you from Gods love in eternity as we condemning you to hell? A warning of impending doom if one doesn't repent isn't a condemnation, it is given in love to lead you to a saving grace and a knowledge of Gods eternal truths. Just so you know...\n\n \n For some this is very true for others not so true.\n \n \nAgain you attempt to speak for believers when you have no idea what we believe or what Heaven will actually be like.\n\n \n AS I said it can only be guessed at by the few hints in the bible, none of which fit the sterotypical place described by Christians or EZ.\n \n \nMore lies and misinformation. True born again believers have never taken anything from Israel or the Jew. We/I totally support Israel and understand very well that Messiah came from her and that any Jew who accepts Jesus Christ doesn't convert to christianity, but becomes a completed Jew. \n\n \n You were holding on barely, but holding on until this. So when Christians converted Jews by torture what do you call that? How about when they said they were not permitted to read from the Torah or the systematic siezure of property, the forced wearing of markings to identify Jews, (not Hitler's Germany either) the expulsion from their homes and relocation to specific locations (again not referring to Hitler's Germany) The middle ages was a real fun time to be Jewish you should read up on some of the things that happened from about 600 to 1800's\n \n \n \nYou act like the Crusades were a biblically based born again christian war against Israel when the moslems were a major player in the events that transpired. Here, educate yourself: Saladin &#8212; Salah al-Din al-Ayubbi\n In 1174, Saladin began his expansion of his territory. In just twelve years he conquered Damascus, Alleppo, and Iraq. Saladin united the efforts of Egypt and Baghdad, and preached to the Muslim world to rise in a Jihad, a Holy War, a counter crusade, of all the Muslims against the Christians. Gathering a large force of Muslims of various groups, called Saracens by the Christians, Saladin set out to attack the Christians. Saladin attacked the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187, and after three months of fighting he gained control of the city.\n \n When Jerusalem fell to Saladin, all of Christendom called for a new crusade. In 1189, the nations of western Europe launched the Third Crusade to win back the holy city. During the Third Crusade, led by King Richard the Lionhearted, the King arranged for supplies to be accumulated and ships used to deliver them to his troops as they marched along the coast; however, when the King finally marched inland to besiege Jerusalem, he found that Saladin had stripped the countryside of food and fodder. The wells had been poisoned and Richard realized that his army would fall apart from starvation if he tried to besiege Jerusalem. The crusaders had to settle for a treaty with Saladin that guaranteed Christian pilgrims access to the Holy Places.\n \n The death of Saladin in 1193 led Pope Innocent III to inaugurate the Fourth Crusade, but they could not defeat the empire that Saladin had established. The Ayyubid dynasty, founded by Salah al-Din ibn Ayyub, ruled Egypt and Syria from 1169 to 1250 CE. In some regions of upper Mesopotamia and Yemen, their rule continued until the end of the 15th century.\n\n \n I could care less about the crusades. I didn't mention them but if you want we can, although I don't see how they could possibly help you.\n \n \nThe verses above prove we are not being deceived since we possess the Holy Spirit of God Himself according to His promise of personal salvation through Jesus sacrifice on Calvary's Cross. We are saved by grace and not by works so that no man may boast. It is you who is the pawn of satan and is being deceived by him every second that you oppose Gods plan for your life and accuse His gospel of salvation of being the problem.\n \n In conclusion, we believers are never alone since the Holy Spirit of God dwells within us every moment of our lives and convicts us of Gods truths. It is you who can only hope that your denials of the gospel will pay off when you pass through the veil from life to death.\n\n \n Of course the bible is true because it says it is true. You believe it is true because you want to believe it is true which was my whole point thank you again for showing exactly what I was talking about.",

   "Trebor's theology - Reform Judaism\n \n Judaism, Reform Judaism, Reform Jews, What Reform Jews Believe, About Reform Judaism- Beliefnet.com\n \n Belief in Deity\n Beliefs vary among adherents, including that of nonbelief or questioning belief, and all are welcome and considered personal, but the official stance is that there is one God Almighty--Creator, all-powerful, ever-present, and all knowing--formless, incorporeal spirit. \n \n \u0095 Incarnations\n None, as only God is worshipped. Moses was the greatest of all prophets. \n \n \u0095 Origin of Universe and Life\n Most believe that Genesis is to be understood symbolically. God created and controls all phenomena revealed by modern science. \n \n \u0095 After Death\n Reform Jews believe in the world to come and a messianic age (but no individual Messiah). Personal beliefs in the details of afterlife are diverse, as there is no official position. Some believe in heaven and hell but only as states of consciousness; some believe in reincarnation; some believe God is all-forgiving; and some may not believe in an actual afterlife. Regardless, Judaism generally focuses on living a virtuous life, rather than working toward reward after death. \n \n \u0095 Why Evil?\n No original sin. Most often, Satan is interpreted symbolically to represent selfish desires that are inherent within all. God gave people free will, and people are responsible for their actions. \n \n \u0095 Salvation\n The main emphasis is on living the kind of life that God commands, which will surely be rewarded if there is an afterlife. Most believe God is forgiving of all; there is no hell to which some are condemned. Salvation is achieved through faith and prayer to God, good works, concern for the earth and humanity, and behavior that does no harm to others. The extent to which one follows Jewish Law is an individual decision. \n \n \u0095 Undeserved Suffering\n God gave humans free will to feel pleasure and pain, and his purpose in allowing deep suffering of the innocent must be good even if mysterious. It is generally believed that God suffers along with the sufferer. More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need. \n \n \u0095 Contemporary Issues\n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth. Most believe potential human life should never be terminated casually, but it is generally regarded as a personal decision, especially within the first 40 days of pregnancy. Homosexuality: Homosexuals are God's creation, and Jewish instruction is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have a long history of support for homosexual rights. \n \n So, what we have here is Trebor's hodgepodge of beliefs that are all over the board, including even non-belief! Some say there is a Creator and some say there is no creator. There is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah. If there is an afterlife, it's based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary (note \"Belief in Deity\" paragraph above). This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those works if God doesn't exist?). \n \n As noted in their beliefs, \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" One has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? In addition, rather than embrace traditional Judaism which teaches that Homosexual relations are a sin, Reform Jews openly endorse gay sex, saying such behavior is God-created! What's more, reincarnation is in too if they want, which is a documented pagan belief contrary to reason and traditional Judaism. In short, Reform Judaism is pretty much whatever people want to believe, based on their man-made whims.  Questions such as, \"What happens to you if you are not a Reform Jew,\" and, \"How many works, and what kind of works, does it take to be rewarded with the afterlife\" are obviously anyone's guess. IMO, Reform Judaism is a hodgepodge philosophical structure which is ill-defined, often contradictory to traditional Judaism, etc., man-created, and can certainly incorporate and embrace pagan beliefs and subjective, politically-correct dogma.  \n \n ROTFLOL!!\n \n Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, trebor. Jump off into eternity with that and see what happens next.\n\n Let's try this again pappi, this time don't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and hope we don't notice it isn't on point in the least to what Easyrider posted. Besides, you wrote this:\n \nWhat is profoundly sad about this is you actually think your religion has one upped reform judaism. Talk about the son getting uppity with the father, this is it. For every point you raised above there is an entire Christian denomination that adheres to it, not a group within the same denomination, but a completly distinct group seperating themselves from the rest. \n\n Now, deal with each point in this jewish survey specifically, and show me the specific christian denominations that stand by those tenets. You may find a few of the tenets as general doctrinal points, but you wont find all of them.",

Do Not Resent, Do Not React, Keep Inner Stillness, 2-3\n \n Original sin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \u0095 Salvation\n The main emphasis is on living the kind of life that God commands, which will surely be rewarded if there is an afterlife. Most believe God is forgiving of all; there is no hell to which some are condemned. Salvation is achieved through faith and prayer to God, good works, concern for the earth and humanity, and behavior that does no harm to others. The extent to which one follows Jewish Law is an individual decision.\n \n Pick just about any mainstream form of Christianity.\n \n The holiness movement\n \u0095 Undeserved Suffering\n God gave humans free will to feel pleasure and pain, and his purpose in allowing deep suffering of the innocent must be good even if mysterious. It is generally believed that God suffers along with the sufferer. More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need.\n \n \u0095 Contemporary Issues\n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth. Most believe potential human life should never be terminated casually, but it is generally regarded as a personal decision, especially within the first 40 days of pregnancy. Homosexuality: Homosexuals are God's creation, and Jewish instruction is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have a long history of support for homosexual rights. \n \n To this I replied with \n \n Homosexual Behavior\n \n Undecided. (Int'l Anglican Communion) (CofE)\n \n The Anglican Communion has been divided over the issue of homosexuality. The Church of England, the mother church of the Communion, currently maintains (according to the statement Issues in Human Sexuality) that same-sex partnerships are acceptable for laypersons but gay clergy are expected to be abstinent.[2] The Lambeth Conference of 1998 called homosexuality \"incompatible with Scripture\" but this remains a purely advisory guideline as there are no communion-wide legislative bodies in the Anglican Church.[3] On the other hand, in 2003 the Episcopal Church, which is the American body (province) of the Anglican Communion, approved Gene Robinson to the bishopric of the diocese of New Hampshire. Bishop Gene Robinson is the first openly gay (non-celibate) clergy to be ordained to the episcopate.[\n \n Contraception\n \n Reformed/ Presbyterian accepted\n \n CofE - accepted \n \n \n \n \nNow, deal with each point in this jewish survey specifically, and show me the specific christian denominations that stand by those tenets. You may find a few of the tenets as general doctrinal points, but you wont find all of them.\n\n \n There is some more for you, but before I continue and I will you have yet to provide your evidence that was requested of you. I would also like to see the survey this is based on\n \n Prove this \n \n As for one upping Judaism, that is also horse dung since true christians fully accept that \"salvation came to the world by way of the Jew\".\n \n And you neglect to appreciate or are oblivious to the fact that the complete first church in Jerusalem was made up of loyal and faithful Jews, except for Dr. Luke who was a Greek/gentile, I believe. \n \n Prove this\n \n And we believer and followers of Christ our Lord believe the same Gospel message that they preached and adhered to. So get your facts right about what is true before you misrepresent the historical and gospel roots of our faith. \n \n And then respond to my comments regarding the above.\n \n \n Prove this\n \n The bolded is more evidence that you are steeped in spiritual darkness and have idea what the gospel promises are to believers or what we personally receive from God through the salvation experience. You don't understand the promise that Jesus made that we would receive the comforter, the Holy Spirit of God Himself as our indwelling guide for life once we accept Jesus as our Savior.\n \n And this\n \n Also, to reiterate, The Apostle John, a Jew is the inspired author of this repeated promise from the gospel with his name on it. \n \n \n I expect a response to my comments regarding this\n \n More lies and misinformation. True born again believers have never taken anything from Israel or the Jew. We/I totally support Israel and understand very well that Messiah came from her and that any Jew who accepts Jesus Christ doesn't convert to christianity, but becomes a completed Jew. \n \n \n And this\n \n Of course the bible is true because it says it is true. You believe it is true because you want to believe it is true which was my whole point thank you again for showing exactly what I was talking about. \n \n So by all means let's try it again and stick to the points, not just yours. If you want an answer expect to give one.",

Then the usual pattern was to follow them around in threads and talk about them to other posters, sort of acting as a peanut gallery. Then he got downright paranoid and started thinking every poster who came along that had similar arguments against his views were all mostly 'sockpuppets' of one or two posters, even though it was many, many posters that would post there for both sides of the aisle. The guy was absolutely off his rocker. Reason was thrown completely out the window, in practice. Luckily most who view reason as important don't act that way; but religion and reason aren't juxtaposed.

   "You never answered the question, pappi. Did it stump you?\n\n \n Yes that is it. It stumped me. How about it's 6am the sun is just rising, your going to stuff flowerers in every orifice of your brutally executed Lord and you walk into where he is supposed to be and out pops some freak saying look he isn't here he is risen. \n \n Here is one more posssiblity. According to Matthew the priests were aware of Jesus' claim and were still hostile towards him. They remove the body and prepare it for the criminal grave as is their responsibility and in walks Mary. A young priest or helper is there collecting anything that was left behind and makes a smart remark.\n \n Now this would elicit the response that is described and fits perfectly with the abrupt ending of Mark.\n \n In the other Gospels when she see's Jesus she is happy and is not terrified or trembling or runs away. The others have her go and tell people, why would she run away terrified and say nothing to no one if it was Jesus or an Angel telling her he has risen. That response is not consistant with the other Gospels or what would be expected in that situation.\n \n \nThat's my question to you - what terrified or amazed them? I asked it first.\n \n I'll even help give you a clue: God and angels often scare the dickens out of people when they appear.

   "Thomas Paine, on the subject of the resurrection:\nThe tale of the resurrection follows that of the crucifixion; and in this as well as in that, the writers, whoever they were, disagree so much as to make it evident that none of them were there.\n \n The book of Matthew states, that when Christ was put in the sepulchre the Jews applied to Pilate for a watch or a guard to be placed over the septilchre, to prevent the body being stolen by the disciples; and that in consequence of this request the sepulchre was made sure, sealing the stone that covered the mouth, and setting a watch. But the other books say nothing about this application, nor about the sealing, nor the guard, nor the watch; and according to their accounts, there were none. Matthew, however, follows up this part of the story of the guard or the watch with a second part, that I shall notice in the conclusion, as it serves to detect the fallacy of those books.\n \n The book of Matthew continues its account, and says, (xxviii. 1,) that at the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn, towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. Mark says it was sun-rising, and John says it was dark. Luke says it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women, that came to the sepulchre; and John states that Mary Magdalene came alone. So well do they agree about their first evidence! They all, however, appear to have known most about Mary Magdalene; she was a woman of large acquaintance, and it was not an ill conjecture that she might be upon the stroll. \n \n The book of Matthew goes on to say (ver. 2): \"And behold there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it\" But the other books say nothing about any earthquake, nor about the angel rolling back the stone, and sitting upon it and, according to their account, there was no angel sitting there. Mark says the angel [Mark says \"a young man,\" and Luke \"two men.\" --Editor.] was within the sepulchre, sitting on the right side. Luke says there were two, and they were both standing up; and John says they were both sitting down, one at the head and the other at the feet.\n \n Matthew says, that the angel that was sitting upon the stone on the outside of the sepulchre told the two Marys that Christ was risen, and that the women went away quickly. Mark says, that the women, upon seeing the stone rolled away, and wondering at it, went into the sepulchre, and that it was the angel that was sitting within on the right side, that told them so. Luke says, it was the two angels that were Standing up; and John says, it was Jesus Christ himself that told it to Mary Magdalene; and that she did not go into the sepulchre, but only stooped down and looked in.\n \n Now, if the writers of these four books had gone into a court of justice to prove an alibi, (for it is of the nature of an alibi that is here attempted to be proved, namely, the absence of a dead body by supernatural means,) and had they given their evidence in the same contradictory manner as it is here given, they would have been in danger of having their ears cropt for perjury, and would have justly deserved it. Yet this is the evidence, and these are the books, that have been imposed upon the world as being given by divine inspiration, and as the unchangeable word of God.\n \n The writer of the book of Matthew, after giving this account, relates a story that is not to be found in any of the other books, and which is the same I have just before alluded to. \"Now,\" says he, [that is, after the conversation the women had had with the angel sitting upon the stone,] \"behold some of the watch [meaning the watch that he had said had been placed over the sepulchre] came into the city, and shawed unto the chief priests all the things that were done; and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept; and if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. So they took the money, and did as they were taught; and this saying [that his disciples stole him away] is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.\"\n \n The expression, until this day, is an evidence that the book ascribed to Matthew was not written by Matthew, and that it has been manufactured long after the times and things of which it pretends to treat; for the expression implies a great length of intervening time. It would be inconsistent in us to speak in this manner of any thing happening in our own time. To give, therefore, intelligible meaning to the expression, we must suppose a lapse of some generations at least, for this manner of speaking carries the mind back to ancient time.\n \n The absurdity also of the story is worth noticing; for it shows the writer of the book of Matthew to have been an exceeding weak and foolish man. He tells a story that contradicts itself in point of possibility; for though the guard, if there were any, might be made to say that the body was taken away while they were asleep, and to give that as a reason for their not having prevented it, that same sleep must also have prevented their knowing how, and by whom, it was done; and yet they are made to say that it was the disciples who did it. Were a man to tender his evidence of something that he should say was done, and of the manner of doing it, and of the person who did it, while he was asleep, and could know nothing of the matter, such evidence could not be received: it will do well enough for Testament evidence, but not for any thing where truth is concerned.\n \n I come now to that part of the evidence in those books, that respects the pretended appearance of Christ after this pretended resurrection.\n \n The writer of the book of Matthew relates, that the angel that was sitting on the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre, said to the two Marys (xxviii. 7), \"Behold Christ is gone before you into Galilee, there ye shall see him; lo, I have told you.\" And the same writer at the next two verses (8, 9,) makes Christ himself to speak to the same purpose to these women immediately after the angel had told it to them, and that they ran quickly to tell it to the disciples; and it is said (ver. 16), \"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them; and, when they saw him, they worshipped him.\"\n \n But the writer of the book of John tells us a story very different to this; for he says (xx. 19) \"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, [that is, the same day that Christ is said to have risen,] when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst of them.\"\n \n According to Matthew the eleven were marching to Galilee, to meet Jesus in a mountain, by his own appointment, at the very time when, according to John, they were assembled in another place, and that not by appointment, but in secret, for fear of the Jews.\n \n The writer of the book of Luke xxiv. 13, 33-36, contradicts that of Matthew more pointedly than John does; for he says expressly, that the meeting was in Jerusalem the evening of the same day that he (Christ) rose, and that the eleven were there.\n \n Now, it is not possible, unless we admit these supposed disciples the right of wilful lying, that the writers of these books could be any of the eleven persons called disciples; for if, according to Matthew, the eleven went into Galilee to meet Jesus in a mountain by his own appointment, on the same day that he is said to have risen, Luke and John must have been two of that eleven; yet the writer of Luke says expressly, and John implies as much, that the meeting was that same day, in a house in Jerusalem; and, on the other hand, if, according to Luke and John, the eleven were assembled in a house in Jerusalem, Matthew must have been one of that eleven; yet Matthew says the meeting was in a mountain in Galilee, and consequently the evidence given in those books destroy each other.\n \n The writer of the book of Mark says nothing about any meeting in Galilee; but he says (xvi. 12) that Christ, after his resurrection, appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked into the country, and that these two told it to the residue, who would not believe them. [This belongs to the late addition to Mark, which originally ended with xvi. 8.--Editor.] Luke also tells a story, in which he keeps Christ employed the whole of the day of this pretended resurrection, until the evening, and which totally invalidates the account of going to the mountain in Galilee. He says, that two of them, without saying which two, went that same day to a village called Emmaus, three score furlongs (seven miles and a half) from Jerusalem, and that Christ in disguise went with them, and stayed with them unto the evening, and supped with them, and then vanished out of their sight, and reappeared that same evening, at the meeting of the eleven in Jerusalem.\n \n This is the contradictory manner in which the evidence of this pretended reappearance of Christ is stated: the only point in which the writers agree, is the skulking privacy of that reappearance; for whether it was in the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or in a shut-up house in Jerusalem, it was still skulking. To what cause then are we to assign this skulking? On the one hand, it is directly repugnant to the supposed or pretended end, that of convincing the world that Christ was risen; and, on the other hand, to have asserted the publicity of it would have exposed the writers of those books to public detection; and, therefore, they have been under the necessity of making it a private affair.\n \n As to the account of Christ being seen by more than five hundred at once, it is Paul only who says it, and not the five hundred who say it for themselves. It is, therefore, the testimony of but one man, and that too of a man, who did not, according to the same account, believe a word of the matter himself at the time it is said to have happened. His evidence, supposing him to have been the writer of Corinthians xv., where this account is given, is like that of a man who comes into a court of justice to swear that what he had sworn before was false. A man may often see reason, and he has too always the right of changing his opinion; but this liberty does not extend to matters of fact.\n \n I now come to the last scene, that of the ascension into heaven.--Here all fear of the Jews, and of every thing else, must necessarily have been out of the question: it was that which, if true, was to seal the whole; and upon which the reality of the future mission of the disciples was to rest for proof. Words, whether declarations or promises, that passed in private, either in the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or in a shut-up house in Jerusalem, even supposing them to have been spoken, could not be evidence in public; it was therefore necessary that this last scene should preclude the possibility of denial and dispute; and that it should be, as I have stated in the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' as public and as visible as the sun at noon-day; at least it ought to have been as public as the crucifixion is reported to have been.--But to come to the point.\n \n In the first place, the writer of the book of Matthew does not say a syllable about it; neither does the writer of the book of John. This being the case, is it possible to suppose that those writers, who affect to be even minute in other matters, would have been silent upon this, had it been true? The writer of the book of Mark passes it off in a careless, slovenly manner, with a single dash of the pen, as if he was tired of romancing, or ashamed of the story. So also does the writer of Luke. And even between these two, there is not an apparent agreement, as to the place where this final parting is said to have been. [The last nine verses of Mark being ungenuine, the story of the ascension rests exclusively on the words in Luke xxiv. 51, \"was carried up into heaven,\" -words omitted by several ancient authorities.--Editor.]\n \n The book of Mark says that Christ appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat, alluding to the meeting of the eleven at Jerusalem: he then states the conversation that he says passed at that meeting; and immediately after says (as a school-boy would finish a dull story,) \"So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.\" But the writer of Luke says, that the ascension was from Bethany; that he (Christ) led them out as far as Bethany, and was fiarted from them there, and was carried up into heaven. So also was Mahomet: and, as to Moses, the apostle Jude says, ver. 9. That 'Michael and the devil disputed about his body.' While we believe such fables as these, or either of them, we believe unworthily of the Almighty.\n \n I have now gone through the examination of the four books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; and when it is considered that the whole space of time, from the crucifixion to what is called the ascension, is but a few days, apparently not more than three or four, and that all the circumstances are reported to have happened nearly about the same spot, Jerusalem, it is, I believe, impossible to find in any story upon record so many and such glaring absurdities, contradictions, and falsehoods, as are in those books. \n",

   "[QUOTE=Zorba;417460]The tale of the resurrection follows that of the crucifixion; and in this as well as in that, the writers, whoever they were, disagree so much as to make it evident that none of them were there.\n \n .......\n I have now gone through the examination of the four books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; and when it is considered that the whole space of time, from the crucifixion to what is called the ascension, is but a few days, apparently not more than three or four, and that all the circumstances are reported to have happened nearly about the same spot, Jerusalem, it is, I believe, impossible to find in any story upon record so many and such glaring absurdities, contradictions, and falsehoods, as are in those books.\n \nGot a link to the source of this lengthy quote? Or isn't that SOP on the internet anymore? Also, who in their right mind determines their personal belief in Christianity or the resurrection based on Thomas Paine's opinion? In other words, in what world is he considered a trusted theological representative of absolute truth that I should respect his explanation?\n\n \n Your funny. I bet the ones you respect happen to believe as you do, but here are some with views that are not so mainstream\n \n In the excellent book Christ or Paul?, the Rev. V.A. Holmes-Gore wrote: Quote:\n \n \"Let the reader contrast the true Christian standard with that of Paul and he will see the terrible betrayal of all that the Master taught....For the surest way to betray a great Teacher is to misrepresent his message....That is what Paul and his followers did, and because the Church has followed Paul in his error it has failed lamentably to redeem the world....The teachings given by the blessed Master Christ, which the disciples John and Peter and James, the brother of the Master, tried in vain to defend and preserve intact were as utterly opposed to the Pauline Gospel as the light is opposed to the darkness.\"\n \n \n \n The great theologian Soren Kierkegaard, writing in The Journals, echoes the above sentiment: Quote:\n \n \"In the teachings of Christ, religion is completely present tense: Jesus is the prototype and our task is to imitate him, become a disciple. But then through Paul came a basic alteration. Paul draws attention away from imitating Christ and fixes attention on the death of Christ The Atoner. What Martin Luther. in his reformation, failed to realize is that even before Catholicism, Christianity had become degenerate at the hands of Paul. Paul made Christianity the religion of Paul, not of Christ Paul threw the Christianity of Christ away, completely turning it upside down. making it just the opposite of the original proclamation of Christ\"\n \n \n \n The brilliant theologian Ernest Renan, in his book Saint Paul, wrote: Quote:\n \n \"True Christianity, which will last forever, comes from the gospel words of Christ not from the epistles of Paul. The writings of Paul have been a danger and a hidden rock. the causes of the principal defects of Christian theology.\"\n \n \n \n Albert Schweitzer, winner of the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize, has been called \"one of the greatest Christians of his time.\" He was a philosopher, physician, musician, clergyman, missionary, and theologian. In his The Quest for the Historical Jesus and his Mysticism of Paul he writes: Quote:\n \n \"Paul....did not desire to know Christ....Paul shows us with what complete indifference the earthly life of Jesus was regarded....What is the significance for our faith and for our religious life, the fact that the Gospel of Paul is different from the Gospel of Jesus?....The attitude which Paul himself takes up towards the Gospel of Jesus is that he does not repeat it in the words of Jesus, and does not appeal to its authority....The fateful thing is that the Greek, the Catholic, and the Protestant theologies all contain the Gospel of Paul in a form which does not continue the Gospel of Jesus, but displaces it.\"\n \n \n \n William Wrede, in his excellent book Paul, informs us: Quote:\n \n \"The oblivious contradictions in the three accounts given by Paul in regard to his conversion are enough to arouse distrust....The moral majesty of Jesus, his purity and piety, his ministry among his people, his manner as a prophet, the whole concrete ethical-religious content of his earthly life, signifies for Paul's Christology nothing whatever....The name 'disciple of Jesus' has little applicability to Paul....Jesus or Paul: this alternative characterizes, at least in part, the religious and theological warfare of the present day\"\n \n \n \n Rudolf Bultman, one of the most respected theologians of this century, wrote in his Significance of the Historical Jesus for the Theology of Paul: Quote:\n \n \"It is most obvious that Paul does not appeal to the words of the Lord in support of his....views. when the essentially Pauline conceptions are considered, it is clear that Paul is not dependent on Jesus. Jesus' teaching is -- to all intents and purposes -- irrelevant for Paul.\"\n \n \n \n Walter Bauer, another eminent theologian, wrote in his Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity: Quote:\n \n \"If one may be allowed to speak rather pointedly the Apostle Paul was the only Arch-Heretic known to the apostolic age.\"\n \n \n \n George Bernard Shaw, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925; in his Androcles and the Lion, we read: Quote:\n \n \"There is not one word of Pauline Christianity in the characteristic utterances of Jesus....There has really never been a more monstrous imposition perpetrated than the imposition of Paul's soul upon the soul of Jesus....It is now easy to understand how the Christianity of Jesus....was suppressed by the police and the Church, while Paulinism overran the whole western civilized world, which was at that time the Roman Empire, and was adopted by it as its official faith.\"\n \n This is a good one also, this has the blessing of the The Vatican\n \n http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Christian_Credibility_Letters.htm\n \n raymond Brown Credentials\n \n Brown was appointed in 1972 to the Pontifical Biblical Commission and again in 1996. He was the Auburn Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies at the Protestant Union Theological Seminary in New York where he taught from 1971 to 1990, when he became professor emeritus. He served as president of the Catholic Biblical Association, the Society of Biblical Literature (1976-7) and the Society of New Testament Studies (1986-7). He was a Roman Catholic priest in the diocese of Baltimore, Maryland. Widely regarded as one of America's preeminent biblical scholars, Brown was awarded 24 honorary doctoral degrees by universities in the USA and Europe, many from Protestant institutions.[4]\n \n Views\n \n Specifically, in his book Biblical Exegesis and Church Doctrine (1985), Fr. Brown again put the Virgin Birth - a central dogma of the Catholic faith - in the category of \"doctrines for which there is slender basis in Scripture.\"\n \n Fr. Brown and many of those Catholic exegetes who followed him hold that it is \"very uncertain\" that angels appeared to Mary and Joseph; that there appeared a star interpreted by magi from the east as a sign of the birth of the King of the Jews, and that they followed it to Bethlehem; that angels appeared to the shepherds; and that Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth.\n \n Also on the Raymond Brown \"doubtful list\" was that Herod learned about Jesus' birth and then ordered the slaughter of children in Bethlehem, and that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus fled to Egypt to escape slaughter.\n \n * The stories of Christ's birth are dubious history.\n \n * Early Christians understood themselves as a renewed Israel, not immediately as a new Israel.\n \n * We must nuance any statement which would have the historical Jesus institute the Church or the priesthood at the Last Supper.\n \n * In the New Testament we are never told that the Eucharistic power was passed from the Twelve to missionary apostles to presbyter-bishops.\n \n * Only in the third and fourth century can one take for granted that when \"priests\" are mentioned, ministers of the Eucharist are meant.\n \n * The Twelve were neither missionaries or bishops.\n \n * Sacramental powers were given to the Christian Community in the persons of the Twelve.\n \n * Presbyter-bishops described in the New Testament are not traceable \"in any way\" to the successors of the Twelve.\n \n * The episcopate gradually emerged, but can be defended \"as divinely established by Christ\" only if one says it emerged under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n \n * Peter cannot be looked upon as the Bishop of the early Roman Church community. Succession to his Church fell to the Bishop of Rome, the city where Peter died. However, that concentration of authority produces, says Brown, \"difficulties such as those we are now encountering within Catholicism.\"\n \n * Vatican II was \"biblically naive\" when it called Catholic bishops successors of the Apostles.\n \n * It is dangerous to assume that second century structures existed in the first century. \n \n just google him or wiki him and you can find all this info\n \n Are any of these people credible enough?",

The bible is very clear in its message and I don't attempt to corrupt the simple gospel salvation message at all.\n\n \n But translators over the last 2000 years have. It is the unquestioning insistence that the concept of God is what you expect it to be. There exists almost no possibility for the correction of any errors, even so much as voicing doubt regarding the accuracy of scripture is met with strong opposition regardless of the credibility of the claimant or the evidence.\n \n Historically any attempts to make changes to more well known verses have been dealt with unfavorably, yet publishers make slight changes every year. They build upon each other and over time and combines with other slight alterations things change and very few notice or realize.\n \n Oddly it is religion who is most guilty of corrupting scripture. For most of it's existence it was controlled by the church and at certain points in time doubt in the Bible was a sure way to a miserable and/or short life. \n \n \n \nI only try to clarify the message of the personal relationship between God and Man that Jesus came to complete/accomplish through His death on Calvary's Cross, which He accomplished to a T. \n\n \n A T seriously? A lower case t would have been just tacky, but still a capital in this context is a little ugh. \n \n You tell me that you don't place limitations on God and you only clarify the message, but does this not go against so many of what God commanded and what is attributed to Jesus. You shall not murder, but the act that gives you salvation is an act of murder. God commands not to drink blood or eat each other and so Christians do so symbolically.
