I think it is a cowedly thing to do to protect Bush because Bush him self said that prices will increase until Nov. Now we all know that Bush is not doing any thing about the issue at least Clinton did. We all know that Bush's Dad has a big investment in the oil industry so what I am saying is a frivolous issue until Bush gets off his high horse and start to do some real politicking like he should. So whats the big deal because he said they said it realy makes a differents here. Big deal........",

More mandates to add ethanol and other additives to fuel, VERY expensive.\n 3. OPEC playing with production\n \n Remember... adjusted for inflation, gas prices are not high, and we have reached no records. They've just been extremely low.\n\n \n 1. Demand is increasing, but the supply is not dwindling. Former UUSR states are just beginning production with reserves expected to exceed those identified in the ME. It's currently believed that Iraq and other ME countries have as many unidentified reserves as known reserves. All they have to do is poke a hole and oil gushes out, so exploration has been long neglected.\n 2. True, but this is a refining cost, not a crude oil cost\n 3. OPEC is currently exceeding planned production by 1.5mm barrels/day, with Saudi Arabia pressing other members to increase that by 2mm barrels/day to facilitate market demand, including increased US consumption, a surefire method of bringing Bin Laden down on them even harder\n 4. Oil is a commodity with demand and pricing greatly currently affected by conditions in the ME. Iraq and Israel's new policies drive fear of supply shortages (like a dirty bomb in Saudi Arabia or Iraq) and the market adjusts accordingly.\n 5. US consumed crude oil, including unregulated domestic production, is subject to the dollar's purchasing power. A soft dollar requires more dollars to buy the same barrel of oil. The US consumer is paying more for anything imported as the administration continues to let the dollar drop in an effort to increase export values as a sleazy means of polishing GDP numbers for public consumption. Unsuccessfully I might add. \n 6. US gasoline is, when adjusted for inflation, dirt cheap. When compared to other developed countries, very, very cheap as they tax everything associated with vehicles while US politicians take it out of other pockets to perpetuate the perceived American birthright of cheap gas.",
