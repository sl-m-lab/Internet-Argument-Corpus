It was both a theological statement and a protest against discrimination, said the Rev. John H. Thomas, the president and general minister of the denomination, which has 6,000 congregations and 1.3 million members.\n \n \"On this July 4, the United Church of Christ has courageously acted to declare freedom, affirming marriage equality, affirming the civil rights of gay - of same-gender - couples to have their relationships recognized as marriages by the state, and encouraging our local churches to celebrate those marriages,\" Mr. Thomas said at a news conference after the vote by the General Synod.\n \n The synod's decisions are not binding and the vote will not require pastors to provide marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples. Some United Church of Christ ministers already perform such ceremonies.\n \n While the United Church of Christ has not had the widespread divisions other major denominations have experienced over homosexuality, some member churches had said that such a vote could prompt them to leave the denomination, and one group called for Mr. Thomas's resignation when he announced his support of the resolution.\n \n One amendment offered on the synod floor, and accepted, added a phrase acknowledging the \"pain and struggle\" passage of the resolution would create.\n \n Yet the resolution, submitted by the church's Southern California-Nevada Conference, appeared to have overwhelming support on the synod floor, where the vote was done by a show of hands among the roughly 800 delegates after about 45 minutes of debate. . . .",

And don't confuse political conservatism / liberalism with Biblical conservatism / liberalism. Jesus is God. As God, Jesus is the one who gave Moses the Levitical law against gay sex to begin with; and he's the one who inspires all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), including Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10. He's the one who knits together babies in their mother's wombs (Psalm 139:13) that you liberals love to butcher. He's the one who said to the adulteress, \"Go and sin no more'. Liberals often say there is no sin, and they'll do whoever they want, any way they want, whenever they want, and will do them with pride. Jesus is the one who says a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberals' \"redistribution of wealth\" scheme (a concept centered in greed for other people's money), which says that people should reap what other people sow. In addition, the inspired Word of God says that if a person does not work, they shall not eat. And you want to feed them and send them to college free too! LOL! And Jesus is the one in the Book of Revelation who judges wicked sinners and sends them to the Lake of Fire. Liberals would never cast judgments, unless they're talking to a conservative, and then they turn into Mr. Judgmentalism themselves. And if liberals recognize evil at all, they'd either show tolerance towards it, endlessly debate it at the U.N., or appease it until the cows came home. \n \n Jesus a liberal? Get real.\n \n And for the record, Jesus \"conserved\" the law of God in his day. It was the corrupt pharisees, etc., who took (liberal) \"liberties\" with it to begin with.",

Now Paul does not single out the homosexual as a special offender. He includes fornicators, idolators, adulterers, thieves, covetous persons, drunkards, revilers and extortioners. And then he adds the comment that some of the Christians at Corinth had been delivered from these very practices: \"And such were some of you: But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God\" (I Corinthians 6:11). All of the sins mentioned in this passage are condemned by God, but just as there was hope in Christ for the Corinthians, so is there hope for all of us.\n \n Homosexuality is an illicit lust forbidden by God. He said to His people Israel, \"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination\" (Leviticus 18:22). \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them\" (Leviticus 20:13). In these passages homosexuality is condemned as a prime example of sin, a sexual perversion. The Christian can neither alter God's viewpoint nor depart from it.\n In the Bible sodomy is a synonym for homosexuality. God spoke plainly on the matter when He said, \"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel\" (Deuteronomy 23:17).

If one takes these Scriptures seriously, homosexuality will be recognized as an evil. The Romans passage is unmistakably clear. Paul attributes the moral depravity of men and women to their rejection of \"the truth of God\" (1:25). They refused \"to retain God in their knowledge\" (1:28), thereby dethroning God and deifying themselves.

What ticks me off about Bible thumping homophobes like you is that you take your own personal prejudice against gays and use the Bible to back up your discrimination.\n \n The Bible also does not condone you making judgment calls for God when you have your own sin to worry about, nor does it endorse forcing adhearance. You do both. And you do it pretty exclusively around the subject of homosexuality.

Attempt some honesty and admit it.\n \n And by the way my point about the story of Sodom - when people come around looking to make people have sex against their will it's called RAPE. It's not sex.

If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.

And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n And you want to try to tell me to be quiet while people are trying to justify gay sex sin and saying God approves of it?

You not only followed their ways, and acted according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.

So that others can be led astray into perdition? Forget it, Jito.\n\n \n You can be a vocal as you like. I support your freedom of speach. You are not just being vocal. You are demanding everyone towe the line as you see it should be towed for your faith. REGARDLESS of whether they share that faith. It's makes you a persecuter. Just like the Romans.\n \n Just how are you supposed to treat foreigners and those that don't believe? It's not like this - I assure you.\n \n \nThat's your spin, not mine.

Where's your outrage over that, lady?\n\n \n Because I am more outraged by the damage you do. Once you stop demonizing and hurting gay people. Once you stop imposing your faith through law. Then maybe I will find outrage over them calling you names because you hurt them. Sorry - I only have so much energy.\n \n \np.s.

It's ok to bash real Christians, but make sure you defend the Sodomites. \n \n Saying gays should turn from their gay sex sin is evil? Not in the Bible I read.\n \n \nMy son's gay mentor - loving, kind, generous, dedicated, loyal, intelligent, giving. You - snipping, nasty mean.\n\n \n Has your son's gay mentor repented of his sin and surrendered to Christ? If not he should. Does he teach your son that illicit gay sex is okay? If so he's indoctrinating your son into the carnal ways of Satan. I'd send him packing if he hasn't repented and come to Christ. \n \n \nThink you are a saint?\n\n \n By the blood and grace of Jesus Christ, yes!! Not only that, but I've already crossed over unto eternal life (John 5:24). \n \n \nJust in the hell are YOU to usurp our GOD-given free will?\n\n \n I am a voice of one crying in the cyber-wilderness, saying \"Come out of Sodom, come out of Gomorrah...flee from the coming wrath.\" \n \n Just who are you to defend gay sex sin in defiance of God's Word? Can you show me in the Bible where Jesus said defending sin is okay?\n \n \nYou are demanding everyone tow the line as you see it should be towed for your faith. REGARDLESS of whether they share that faith. It's makes you a persecuter. Just like the Romans.\n\n \n I'm not here to play \"Let's make a deal.\" I'm here telling you, \"This is the deal.\" If that makes you feel persecuted then go tell it to Barbara Boxer and have her dial me up. I'd love to talk to her.\n \n \nOnce you stop demonizing and hurting gay people. Once you stop imposing your faith through law. Then maybe I will find outrage over them calling you names because you hurt them. \n\n \n Saying they should repent and turn from their gay sex sin is wrong? If they get their feelings hurt over that then good. It can start them thinking. \n \n \nIs Jesus Christ your Lord God and Savior for the remission of your sins?\n\n \n \nMind your own business....\n \n \n A real Christian would have answered in the affirmative, so I recommend you give up defending iniquity and start preaching some Gospel - i.e that unless people have Jesus as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins, they're in big trouble.

   "Trying to save gays and others from perdition is hating them? \n\n \n Oh you hate gays. No question. You aren't interested in saving anyone either. You just like playing holier than thou. It's your own little big fish in little pond popularity contest. Not fooling me, no siree. If it quacks like a hate-monger....\n \n \nLike I said previously, you're the one encouraging / defending their sin and directing them down the path down to the Pit. How vicious is that?\n\n \n First of all - I don't believe in hell. I will share that much with you. You actually expect me to believe that a loving God tortures anyone for an eternity? What's the point of free will? Why bother? It's like pointing a gun at my head and then telling me I have a \"choice\" as to whether or not I give you my purse. What a joke! Plus there is the fact that the three words that have been translated into \"hell\" - have been mistranslated, but I would hate to ruin your fun. Imagine me burning if you gets excited. We all need our cheap thrills.\n \n I don't encourage or dicourage anything. These people are full grown adults capable of feeling and expressing feeling with or without my encouragement. \n \n \nWatching you shrill liberals belch out venom and lies always tickles me to no end.\n\n \n You ARE Fred Phelps, aren't you?\n \n \nHa! You just said, \"I hear there all kinds of militants in the middle east who might even let you kill homosexuals. I bet you have that sweetie Phelps on your speed dial don't you?\n \n Obviously you don't have a clue what demonizing is, Snicklefritz.\n\n \n Well - let's see - you insult and condemn a whole group of people that you don't know. Here - I am plain and simple interacting and making fun of ONE - YOU. Just you. Petty and not nice, I admit - but you inspire me! It's all from the loving Christian example you set.\n \n \nQuote: Originally Posted by Easyrider: If you believe God is as wonderful as you say why aren't you preaching salvation in Jesus Christ and helping your gay mentor-friend get saved, so he can be happy forever? Instead you coddle his sin. \n\n \n Who says I believe in the God that is in your Bible? Maybe I believe in a GODESS. Maybe I am not sure. Maybe I believe in no God. I have yet to tell you. Maybe you should refrain from asking me why I am not acting on my faith if you don't know what it is? \n \n \nAnd your pro-Sodomite intentions are honorable? LOL! Get out of town. They're born of Satan, no doubt. Defending sin is right down Satan's alley.\n\n \n Let's try this one more time and I will try to make it simple. I am defending the right of gay people in the USA to NOT have to follow anyone's religion if they don't want to.\n \n I don't defend sin. I also don't judge it. \n \n \nYou don't share your faith because you can't justify it or substantiate it with any credible evidence.\n\n \n I don't share my faith because I don't trust your sorry rear with information that private. Really. I don't want to talk to you about it. I don't TRUST you with it.\n \n \nYou're obviously a bleeding heart liberal.\n\n \n Yep, I bleed. If you don't, you might want to cosider checking in with your physician.\n \n \nYou people usually create a carnal vision in your minds about how you want the world to be, and in the process are blind to history, the Word of God, and reality. \n\n \n People? <looks around< Just me here. I can't speak for 'people' - however, a place where we live in peace with each other's differences, where we influence but not impose - I do dream of such. The Word of God is for those who choose to follow it, it is for you to share your love and faith, but that is not what you do. There isn't a drop of love in your voice or your intent. My defenses are up with you because I don't trust you - not with my heart, what I think, how feel, where my faith and doubts lie. You speak with a viscious tongue and leave no room for anything outside your own realm of understanding. And you are mean.\n \n And I am not blind to history - my knowledge of it is what keeps me fighting you. The overly zealous have consistently hurt their fellow man.

It's your own little big fish in little pond popularity contest. Not fooling me, no siree. If it quacks like a hate-monger.... \n\n \n Her lips are still moving....Just like Satan's in the Garden of Eden. \"Did God really say....?\"\n \n \nFirst of all - I don't believe in hell. I will share that much with you. You actually expect me to believe that a loving God tortures anyone for an eternity? What's the point of free will? Why bother? It's like pointing a gun at my head and then telling me I have a \"choice\" as to whether or not I give you my purse. What a joke! Plus there is the fact that the three words that have been translated into \"hell\" - have been mistranslated, but I would hate to ruin your fun.\n\n \n That's garbage. I suppose all the Scholars and Greek Translators of the NIV Study Bible, the Life Application Study Bible, the MacArthur Study Bible, and many more, all have it wrong and you, because of your want to revise the Word of God to match your political correctness, have it right. Not likely, Jito. You libs always try to dismiss justice for wrongdoing (i.e. \"A loving God wouldn't...\"). Oh yes he would, and he already has.\n \n \nWell - let's see - you insult and condemn a whole group of people that you don't know.\n\n \n The Bible brings to light the sins of many so they might be saved through Jesus Christ. You seek to sweep them under the rug so they will think they don't need salvation.\n \n \nMaybe I believe in a GODESS. Maybe I am not sure. Maybe I believe in no God.\n\n \n Maybe you should gather some guts and come out of the closet and try to justify your beliefs with some evidence. I don't think you can. You can try to bash the Bible and those who profess it all day long but you're too chicken to come out and try to substantiate your own beliefs. Quite convenient. I have more respect for Devil worshipers. At least they are willing to bring their (so-called) evidence to the table. \n \n \nLet's try this one more time and I will try to make it simple. I am defending the right of gay people in the USA to NOT have to follow anyone's religion if they don't want to.\n\n \n Who's forcing them? I'm just calling them to repentence and telling them what the Word of God says, so they can get saved through Jesus Christ.\n \n \nI don't share my faith because I don't trust your sorry rear with information that private. Really.\n\n \n Nope. You just know you can't bring sufficient credible evidence to bear to defend your false religion. You've got nothing credible. \n \n \nYour faith in a creator should not lead you to hurt the creation.\n\n \n Again, you pat gays on the back and coddle their sin so they will go on down to the Pit. YOU HURT THE CREATION, and you do it for all eternity.\n \n Gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.",

My challenge to you was, using jewish scripture, show me where the concept that the Messiah would be \"God made flesh\", in context. It doesn't have to be a bunch. Even ONE incident that you can jsutify, in context, using a piece of writing, and backing it up within that writing, or a writing the same age or older. \n \n So far, I don't see you doing that. My point is that the Jewish religion is different than the Christian religion. There are certain concepts that are not the same. \n \n What I am looking for is rather than a whole bunch of quotes from all over the place, taken out of context, is just ONE quote, taken in context, properly translated, that demonstrates the concept that the Messiah would be god.\n \n I want that to be from Jewish writings from before the time that Jesus was supposed to be around. I want a serious discussion, not a quote fest of quotes taken out of context. In this particular case, the question if Jesus is the messiah or not is irrelavent. I want the basic assumption of 'what is the messiah' to be answered. \n \n Is that negative? I am making a very important point. Are you up to those conditions? It doesn't have to be a messanic prophecy. It has to deal with the basic concept.. did the jewish faith ever expect that the messiah would be god made flesh??\n \n Do you see the difference?",

   "If God stated in words that He would become flesh (stating it as you and I would) then there would be just as great a confusion to who Christ was then as it is today. So, God knew that it would do no good to spell it out. Now, as far as becoming human (not flesh) - that is having a full-grown figure of a man, then He did that in the form of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. (I agree that there is much conflict over that, however)\n But, if we look at who Christ really was (and is) then we have to look at what the name (Jesus) is - *Yeshua.

   "If God stated in words that He would become flesh (stating it as you and I would) then there would be just as great a confusion to who Christ was then as it is today. So, God knew that it would do no good to spell it out. Now, as far as becoming human (not flesh) - that is having a full-grown figure of a man, then He did that in the form of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. (I agree that there is much conflict over that, however)\n But, if we look at who Christ really was (and is) then we have to look at what the name (Jesus) is - *Yeshua. In that way we see that Isaiah was saying that God would become his salvation (Jesus) - and Jesus was flesh.\n Isaiah 12:2 Behold, God [is] my salvation (*Yeshua or Jesus); I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH [is] my strength and [my] song; he also is become my salvation(*Yeshua or Jesus).\n \n *Reference: Strong's Concordance for the word salvation - Hebrew root form #03444: y@shuw`ah\n\n \n \n Well, the problem with Strongs is that he did translations based on Christian values, using christian translations, via the KVJ.

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider: I highly recommend you bring your \"evidence\" for your personal religious beliefs to the table here to have them properly vetted.\n \n \nNot only is this statement highly rude, but also unrealistic. People's beliefs may not have evidence. They are based on individual spirituality. You cannot expect people to bring tangible evidence to the table of what they say are their beliefs. You could ask that they SHARE with you the basis of their beliefs and they may choose to discuss it with you or they may choose to share the in generals.\n\n \n Of course that's how you see things. I think there should be some kind of evidence to back up one's beliefs. If people can't produce some then I think they're dingy for going into eternity with nothing substantive. If you think I'm rude then what would you call waking up in hell for falsely believing in some pagan goddess for salvation?\n \n \nYou posts have this array that you are the all-knowing person when it comes to spirituality or Christianity. You seem to have this claim that your interpretation of the bible is the only and right one. You have to admit two things. One is that others may have studied and come to different beliefs and those may be very valid for them. Two, you have to admit that you are really arrogant to think you are so righteous and that no one else's beliefs are as \"correct\" as yours..\n\n \n Like I told Jitobear a while back: I'm not here to say \"Let's make a deal,\" I'm here to tell you, \"This IS THE DEAL\". Jesus is the Christ and the only way to salvation. If you reject his free gift of salvation then you're screwed for all eternity. \n \n There's only one version of the truth, and that's the truth.

Yes, you took my bait hook line and sinker, becuse I know that the Jewish writing from before the first century do not promote the concept of the Messiah being 'god made flesh'. That was introduced AFTER Jesus, by Christians. \n \n My specific point is that the Jewish religion is NOT the Christian religion. It has different concepts, and different assumptions. Because of those different concepts and different assumptions, how the various passages in the Tanahah are interpreted is different that those same passages are interpreted by Christians. Judaism is not Christainty, and Christainity is not Judaism. Often, to try to impose the concepts of one upon the other is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n \n I personally think that a lot of CHristians could benefit from the method that the Jewish faith uses to study the Torah and the Talmud. It seems many Christians faith is based on sound bites, with out any true understanding of the passages that surround those sound bites. It might lead to a little less intra-christainty conflict. Good scholarship would also elminate many of the quacks that are in it for the money, and put on a good show to awe the faithful for personal gain.",

Yet you are making the claim that \"IF\" Jitobear brings you the evidence of her beliefs, you will show her the error of her ways. You are only a little man who doesn't possess the evidence that god exists or that one persons beliefs i god are more right than someone else's.....\n \n I suggest you read this page....http://www.angelfire.com/pa/greywlf/why.html\n \n Here is a little sample of how you self-righteous born agains are MADE!\n \n The Dynamics of Becoming \"Born-Again\"\n \n Becoming a born-again Christian usually entails the following: (1 )A person is consciously or sub-consciously concerned with the direction of his life. This may include a recent traumatic happening in his life such as a death, loss of a job, divorce mortgage foreclosure or any number of events which may cause one to look closely at the specific causes and effects in his life.\n \n There may be a \"spiritual hunger\", a strong desire to know \"Why am I here?\", and \"What's the purpose of my life on this earth?\". The realization that one is mortal and that at some time, death will overtake and this earthly existence will cease often plays a big role in \"seeking God\". There are many factors and these are only a few.\n \n (2)The person is in some manner exposed to the born again teaching. This may occur in church, at an evangelistic service, on television, by reading, or other media.\n \n (3)At some point, the person is told that (a) all humans have sinned (transgression or the breaking of divine law) and are therefore sinners. (b)That the bible is the word of God and it states that sinners cannot go to heaven and will suffer some sort of spiritual death forever and that (c)God has, however, provided a way for the sinner by placing the guilt of the sinner on his son, Jesus Christ, who came to the earth as a human and took the sins of all humanity on himself by suffering death by crucifixion.\n \n (4)The individual is strongly encouraged to \"accept\" this sacrifice by Jesus, and ask God to forgive his past sins. When the person does this, God grants him forgiveness and he may now enter into heaven or God's presence when he dies. He is taught that he is a \"new person\" or a \"new creature\" and that the spirit of Jesus Christ is imparted to him - something he didn't have before. He is now a \"spiritual\" being as well as a human being.\n \n The procedure I have described may vary according to different churches and their interpretations of the bible and its requirements for salvation but these are the basic guidelines for salvation. I say this for my Christian friends who may dispute the exact requirements.\n \n The \"new\" Christian is encouraged to become involved with others who have like beliefs. Once other Christians become aware that the person has become \"saved\" or \"born again\", they encourage him to attend fundamentalist churches. The attendance allows the new Christian to be exposed to older Christians who begin their indoctrination and conditioning.\n \n The new Christian is encouraged to attend classes and fraternize only with those who hold the same beliefs. Scripture is used to reinforced these ideas. The new Christian is then 'trained' in the ways of the Lord according to the beliefs of the particular church.\n \n There are many inherent problems with the \"prescription for salvation\" I have described above.",

   "Ok. If you don't want ot discuss the passages IN CONTEXT... but would rather use cut/pastes from christian sources , that don't even DEAL with the jewish concept of the Messiah, I will take that as a consession you can't. Yes, you took my bait hook line and sinker, becuse I know that the Jewish writing from before the first century do not promote the concept of the Messiah being 'god made flesh'. That was introduced AFTER Jesus, by Christians. \n \n My specific point is that the Jewish religion is NOT the Christian religion. It has different concepts, and different assumptions. Because of those different concepts and different assumptions, how the various passages in the Tanahah are interpreted is different that those same passages are interpreted by Christians. Judaism is not Christainty, and Christainity is not Judaism. Often, to try to impose the concepts of one upon the other is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n \n I personally think that a lot of CHristians could benefit from the method that the Jewish faith uses to study the Torah and the Talmud. It seems many Christians faith is based on sound bites, with out any true understanding of the passages that surround those sound bites. It might lead to a little less intra-christainty conflict. Good scholarship would also elminate many of the quacks that are in it for the money, and put on a good show to awe the faithful for personal gain.\n\n For years people, including Christian groups, have been searching for empirical evidence that proves Christ was/is God. First of all, faith cannot be broken down into a simple form - such as reason or observable science. That's why Jesus had to explain things better to his disciples in parables and the like. Still, they didn't quite understand. Even after His resurrection He had to expound what the scriptures told of Him.\n \n To your point: No, the Jewish faith and the Christian faith is not the same, but they are based on the same principles - if you wash out all the religious nonsense. To put it in simple terms: Those things that were done in the Old Testament were a reflection of what Jesus did, who He was, and what He came to fulfill. There is no literal description of \"Jesus of Nazareth who was really God in the flesh\" in the OT. If a person insists, for instance, that the birth of Jesus was foretold in Isaiah 7:14 and requires evidence to the contrary, all his opposition can do is declare that it was a local or near-term prophesy. But even those defending that Jewish proclamation would have trouble, for each belief holds its own measure of faith. However, if we align the scriptures correctly, which no one is able to do without constant opposition, we find that indeed these many prophetic verses do point to Jesus of Nazareth for there has been no other person - born of a virgin or otherwise - that fits the bill.\n \n BTW - Generally when a person declares that someone is \"cutting and pasting\" his or her replies, they need to present (via displaying the website, etc.) that proof for all to see. The post that you say I cut and pasted is in the Bible, in magazines, in Sunday school books, and web pages, etc., etc., but not exactly as I presented it - unless by coincidence...which I highly doubt.",

On the Boy Scouts, in school curriculums, trying to push gay marriage down our throats, etc., etc. Guess that doesn't bother you folks. After all, that would be their IMPOSING THEIR IRRELIGIOUS BELIEFS ON US. So pardon me if Christians and mainstream Americans vote according to our religious and moral beliefs. After all, that is legal and Constitutional. \n \n I'm also curious about what lie or lies you bought into when discounting Jesus Christ and the Bible? Of course, this isn't about your beliefs per se, but about something you apparently bought into a lie about. So, what was it? Care to take your best shot and defend it?",

Who does the Bible say Jesus is? GOD!! (John 1:1, Titus 2:13, etc., etc.). As God, Jesus already gave the gay sex prohibition to Moses on homosexual sex (Lev. 18:22, 20:13).

   "I am posting this again for Easyrider's sake......it is the reminder that words do incite actions.....\n \n The religious right says you're an \"anti-Christian bigot\" if you find their hate speech offensive. They argue that Matt's [shepard's] killers probably didn't read their anti-gay press releases, so it's unfair to say that their vocal bigotry led to violence.\n \n But the simple fact remains that religious extremists vilify gays on a regular basis, creating and feeding a culture that inadvertently gives comfort to those who choose to express their hate in violence. The religious right calls gays diseased, perverted, immoral, and abomination. They say on TV and radio that gays deserve to lose their jobs, their children, their families and their homes. They prepare studies for Congress \"proving\" gays are unfit teachers, parents, ambassadors, and soldiers. They liken gays to pedophiles, adulterers, murderers, kleptomaniacs, and alcoholics. And they accuse gays of being anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-America, and anti-God.\n \n It is simply not possible to constantly preach the inhumanity of man, then blithely skulk away when principle meets practice. It is simply not moral to give a child a gun, then feign ignorance when someone gets hurt.\n \n If words do not inspire actions, then why did the top religious right organizations spend $500,000 on an ad campaign to inspire gays to 'convert'? They know words have consequences, and their words are nothing less than the subjugation and dehumanization of gay and lesbian Americans. While most on the far-right don't preach violence, it is no wonder that decades of their disdain eventually led to murder.\n http://www.hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/hate.html",

   "The dodge is on you, Kronus. Who does the Bible say Jesus is? GOD!! (John 1:1, Titus 2:13, etc., etc.)....all Scripture is inspired by God / Jesus (2 Timothy 3:16)..\n\n \n \nDo you even own a Bible? Have you ever read one? Seriously! John 1:1, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. No mention of Jesus. Titus 2:13, awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and our Saviour Jesus. Two beings....\n\n \n You're theology is pathetic, Kronus. Every major Study Bible in America recognizes Jesus as God (i.e. The NIV Study Bible, the MacArthur Study Bible, the Life Application Study Bible, and others). So do the Baptists, the Methodists, the Catholics, the Presbyterians, Assemblies of God, The Seventh Day Adventists, the Church of Christ, and tons of others. So do most Seminaries. Here's some more info to demolish your liberal theology side-show:\n \n \"Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said the he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself as Allah; and nowhere will you find Zoroaster claiming to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen Him (Jesus) has seen the Father. (John 14:9)\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 5:17-18). Jesus claimed the ability to forgive sins (Mark 2:5-7), which the Bible teaches was something that God alone could do (Isaiah 43:25).\n \n The New Testament equated Jesus as the Creator of the Universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The Apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.\" (John 10:33, NASB). This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings--not the teacher--are all important.\n \n Confucianism is a set of teachings. Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Muhammad being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder.\n \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching the truth; He claimed that He was\n the truth. (John 14:6) What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God?This was the claim He made for Himself.\n \n Suppose this very night the president of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the vice-president. Anybody who would dare to make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30-31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV) In another place He said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 2 KJV). The ability to raise His life back from was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived.\n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection.Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God.\"\n \n From the Josh McDowell book \"Answers to Tough Questions\", pp. 72-75.\n \n Nice try, Kronus....",

   "Strawman. No one here is advocating attacking gays. \n \n p.s. Check out \"gay on gay violence\" on the web. They're beating each other up.\n\n \n \n Why don't you check this out!\n \n http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/intrep.jsp?iid=31\n \n \n then this...\n \n http://www.hatecrime.org/subpages/hitler/hitler.html\n \n then read this statement from hatecrime.org\n The religious right says you're an \"anti-Christian bigot\" if you find their hate speech offensive. They argue that Matt's killers probably didn't read their anti-gay press releases, so it's unfair to say that their vocal bigotry led to violence.\n \n But the simple fact remains that religious extremists vilify gays on a regular basis, creating and feeding a culture that inadvertently gives comfort to those who choose to express their hate in violence. The religious right calls gays diseased, perverted, immoral, and abomination. They say on TV and radio that gays deserve to lose their jobs, their children, their families and their homes. They prepare studies for Congress \"proving\" gays are unfit teachers, parents, ambassadors, and soldiers. They liken gays to pedophiles, adulterers, murderers, kleptomaniacs, and alcoholics. And they accuse gays of being anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-America, and anti-God.\n \n It is simply not possible to constantly preach the inhumanity of man, then blithely skulk away when principle meets practice. It is simply not moral to give a child a gun, then feign ignorance when someone gets hurt.\n \n If words do not inspire actions, then why did the top religious right organizations spend $500,000 on an ad campaign to inspire gays to 'convert'? They know words have consequences, and their words are nothing less than the subjugation and dehumanization of gay and lesbian Americans. While most on the far-right don't preach violence, it is no wonder that decades of their disdain eventually led to murder.",

But only now is their crusade reaching biblical proportions.\"\n \n In response, the spokesman for one pro-family group said it's the SPLC that is guilty of \"engaging in hate speech.\" Another conservative said his group wears the criticism from the SPLC as a \"badge of honor.\"\n \n Along with an article on \"Curious Cures\" for homosexuality and a feature on the myth that homosexuals helped mastermind the Holocaust, the SPLC's latest Intelligence Report contains a timeline of the \"anti-gay movement\" from Anita Bryant's efforts to repeal a \"gay rights\" ordinance in Florida in 1977 to the present.\n \n In an editorial, SPLC spokesman Mark Potok asserted that \"the religiously based crusade against homosexuals in America\" reached a turning point in 2003, when the U.S. Supreme Court's Lawrence v. Texas decision struck down state anti-sodomy laws.\n \n Since then, the Christian right has increased fund raising and poured millions of dollars into TV, newspaper and radio ads, including during last year's successful campaign to pass constitutional amendments in 13 states to define marriage as between one man and one woman. More such measures are set to go before voters in November of 2006.\n \n Potok in his editorial also charged that leaders of the religious right were guilty of using \"bully-boy tactics\" such as \"cruel name-calling.\" The contention of many Christians, that they hate the sin but love the sinner, is \"a hard one to swallow,\" according to Potok. \"When perpetrators of hate crimes against gays use identical words to describe their victims, you have to wonder where it began,\" he states.\n \n Under the heading, \"A Mighty Army,\" the SPLC's Intelligence Report lists \"a dozen of today's most influential anti-gay groups\" that it claims \"help drive the religious right's anti-gay crusade.\" The list includes the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America, the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family.\n \n \"Fundamentalist Christians have every right to their views of religion,\" Potok states. \"But when they use that right to launch vicious personal attacks on an entire group based on characteristics that most scientists see as immutable, they poison the political debate and subject the objects of their scorn to the very real possibility of violence and even death.\n \n \"And that can only damage a healthy democratic society,\" Potok adds.\n \n According to its website, the Southern Poverty Law Center \"was founded in 1971 as a small civil rights law firm.\" Today, the Montgomery, Ala.-based organization \"is internationally known for its tolerance education programs, its legal victories against white supremacists and its tracking of hate groups.\"\n \n 'Badge of honor'\n \n Cybercast News Service contacted representatives of several organizations on the SPLC's list, and most agreed with Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, that \"the company looks pretty good to me from here.\n \n \"I would use different terminology\" than the center does, he said, \"but to the extent that we oppose the homosexual social and political agenda and were named by this group, we wear it as a badge of honor.\" Hear MP3 Audio Clip\n \n Wildmon stated that the list represents \"the pro-family movement in America today\" and added that the AFA \"joins those groups in standing up for traditional marriage and traditional family values.\"\n \n Robert Knight, director of the Culture & Family Institute for Concerned Women for America (CWA), accused the SPLC of \"engaging in hate speech\" against people they disagree with because they're \"less concerned with poverty than in advancing a radical left-wing agenda on all fronts.\n \n \"They seek to discredit groups like CWA precisely because our message is resonating with the public,\" he said, \"so they have to smear us, put words in our mouths and liken us to the Klan and Nazis to direct attention away from the fact that their radical agenda is being exposed and repudiated by the American people.\"\n \n Melissa Fryrear, gender issues analyst for Focus on the Family, took a different view of her organization's inclusion on the SPLC's list.\n \n \"The real issue is what we're for,\" Fryrear said, \"and we're for marriage being what it's been for 6,000 years -- a man and a woman for a lifetime and not being redefined by judicial activists.\"\n \n Fryrear also disagreed with the contention that homosexuality is an immutable characteristic. \"I'm a former homosexual,\" she noted. \"There are tens of thousands of men and women who have overcome homosexuality, who know first-hand that it's not an immutable characteristic, so it cannot be equated to race or gender.\"\n \n Knight from CWA conceded that the SPLC will probably benefit from taking on the religious right. \"They're vilifying pro-family groups in order to energize their base of washed-up hippies and tree-hugging environmental extremists,\" he added.

How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?\" He said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.

   "Demonizing Gays\n In this issue, the Intelligence Report takes a look at the religiously based crusade against homosexuals in America - a \"thirty years war,\" as the story points out, that has intensified since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state anti-sodomy statutes in the 2003 Lawrence decision. Key points in the report include the religious right's repeated use of bogus \"science\" and the bully-boy tactics of its leaders.\n \n These leaders angrily rebut charges that their cruel name-calling - public descriptions of gays as \"perverts,\" \"child molesters,\" \"deviants\" and \"evil\" people - has led anyone to violence. They say they \"hate the sin, but love the sinner.\"\n \n That is a hard one to swallow. When perpetrators of hate crimes against gays use identical words to describe their victims, you have to wonder where it began.\n \n When Lou Sheldon reportedly tells a journalist that if given the chance gay men will kidnap people's sons and convert them to gay sex, it's hard not to recall the infamous \"blood libel\" against the Jews - the accusation that Jews kidnap Gentile children, kill them and drain them of blood to be used in making matzohs.\n \n When religious leaders describe gays as voracious sexual beasts trying to \"recruit\" in the schools, it's difficult to forget the way that 19th century racists ranted about \"lust-crazed\" and \"demonic\" black men intent on raping white women.\n \n Fundamentalist Christians have every right to their views of religion. But when they use that right to launch vicious personal attacks on an entire group based on characteristics that most scientists see as immutable, they poison the political debate and subject the objects of their scorn to the very real possibility of violence and even death. And that can only damage a healthy democratic society.\n http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=521",

   "\n You can brattle on all day about my allegedly hating gays. Again, if I really hated gays I wouldn't warn them to repent of their sin. I'd just egg them on and let them go down to the Pit like you're doing.  \n \n\n \n So, EZ says he doesn't hate gays. Wait, I tell I lie. He implies he doesn't hate gays, he doesn't actually come out and say it, now does he? In fact, despite several posts similar to the above, and dispite the fact that I've pointed this out before, he has yet to actully state that he doesn't hate gays.\n \n It was a project, but I've gone through this thread and compiled everything that EZ has said about gays. I've broken them down into two categories; hatefull/attacking and helpful/saving. If a statement could possibly be construed as an attempt to \"save\" someone I put it in the latter category. If it's just name calling, or worse, I've put it in the former.\n \n First, the attacks:\n Gay sex is a sin and shouldn't be legitimized. The UCC is quickly becoming a Synagogue of Satan. \n Shacking up in an ungodly relationship is a sin and will be addressed at the Judgment\n Gay sex is a sin.\n Many in the gay community have an idol in place of God. It's gay sex.\n I will continue to oppose your illicit gay sex agenda\n Your Pro-Sodomite agenda is offensive to mainstream Americans. \n But I'm not having gay pride parades to flaunt sin \n And your pro-Sodomite intentions are honorable? ...They're born of Satan, no doubt.\n Gay sex is a sin\n Go ahead and toss your Bible in the trash so you can justify your gay sex sin.\n Gay sex is a sin\n Gay sex is a sin. Gay marriage would then just be institutionalized sin.\n Gay sex is an abomination.\n There's nothing righteous about illicit gay sex operatives.\n \n Now, the non-attacks\n If I really hated gays like you do I'd be silent about trying to turn them from their sin so they won't go down to the Pit. \n Where's the repentence for illicit gay sex around here?\n Then Jesus can deliver them from their homosexual sin through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. \n Has your son's gay mentor repented of his sin and surrendered to Christ? If not he should. \n I recommend you bring your gay mentor friend to Christ before he perishes.\n If I really hated gays I wouldn't tell them to repent of their sin.\n no one HERE is advocating attacking gays.\n \n \n I'm sure I missed some from both lists, but the trend is obvious. The attacks and name calling are pretty viscious at times, and the tone is consistent throughout the thread. EZ does, on occasion, mention that gays should repent, but he never actually makes the least effort to bring this about, and most of the quotes are from just a couple of posts. Unless EZ believes that calling someone a Satanic, abomination of a sinner is likely to bring around repentance I think we can safely say that his claim to be trying to save anyone is a sham. \n \n EZ, I believe that your claim that you want to save gays is a lie. I think you're just a homophobe. If, however, I'm wrong, then heed my advice. You're converstion skills stink. You will never save anyone by insulting them and calling them names. It is not possible for a gay person to read you posts and think that you don't hate them, and if they think you hate them then why would they listen to you? If you think about nothing else, think about that.",

An act in which no one gets hurt is at worst morally neutral.\n\n \n Romans 1:26 - Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. 28 Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.\n \n The wages of sin is death! But Christ can save people from their sins if they will repent and receive him.\n \n \nAnd before you say anything stupid about AIDS, let me point at that whatever your argument is, it would lead to the conclusion that gay sex was moral 30 years ago and will become moral again once a cure is found, and that heterosexual sex was immoral for millenium until they discovered pennicillin.\n\n \n Gay sex was never morally acceptable in the eyes of God.",

If you were true to what you claim, then you wouldn't waste a second with gays, but would instead be trying to \"save\" those which you must consider heathens. Do you? I'm sure the answer is no, but I'll allow you the courtesy of answering for yourself. Do you call followers of other religions followers of Satan, evil, seducers of others?

Gay men were shown pictures of naked men and then administered electric shocks through electrodes attached to their testicles, or made to ingest drugs that made them vomit. \n Not surprisingly, these brutal, \"Clockwork Orange\"-like methods proved to be totally ineffective - yielding not one credibly documented case of a \"cured\" homosexual - and had been discarded by all but lunatic fringe psychotherapists by the late 1970s. \n \n But even now, more than 30 years after American Psychiatric Association deleted homosexuality from its official list of mental disorders, religious-right \"ex-gay\" ministries across the country propagate the myth that homosexuality is a curable disease. \n \n The largest of these, San Rafael, Calif. -based Exodus International, is an umbrella group, funded largely by Focus on the Family. The group refers adult gays and lesbians, as well as teenagers whose parents are pushing them into counseling, to \"ex-gay\" ministries throughout the United States and Europe that have names like Straight Path Ministries, Breaking Free, and Straight Ahead. \n \n Exodus' self-stated mission is, \"Freedom from homosexuality through the power of Jesus Christ.\" In practical terms, that translates to support groups, pastoral counseling, intense Bible study, arranged \"dates\" with members of the opposite sex, and the occasional use of ammonia inhalers in conjunction with gay and lesbian porn. \n \n The claims of ex-gay ministries that homosexuality can be deprogrammed are supported in propaganda disseminated by Exodus and the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality with the same brand of discredited pseudo-science that in recent decades has been cited as proof that homosexuals are more prone to be child molesters than heterosexuals and, more recently, that adopted children are worse off with gay or lesbian parents than with a heterosexual couple. \n \n \"There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of 'reparative conversion therapy' as a treatment to change one's sexual orientation,\" the American Psychiatric Association has officially stated. \n \n \"Clinical experience suggests that any person who seeks conversion therapy may be doing so because of social bias that has resulted in internalized homophobia, and that gay men and lesbians who have accepted their sexual orientation are better adjusted than those who have not done so.\" \n \n Perhaps the most famous case study in the failure of reparative therapy is that of two founders of Exodus International, Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper, who helped start Exodus in 1976 and worked to \"convert\" gay people for three years, until they fell in love and left Exodus in 1979. In 1982, they held a marriage ceremony and lived together until Cooper died nine years later. \n \n \"The desires never go away,\" Bussee said. \"After dealing with hundreds of people, I have not met one who went from gay to straight. Even if you manage to alter someone's sexual behavior, you cannot change their true sexual orientation.\" \n \n http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=327",

   "I don't know of any scripture in the entire Bible that says it's okay to legitimize any kind of sin. Conversely, God says not to do it and that sin is a reproach to nations. That's your answer.\n\n \n \nNo - it does not answer the question I asked you. I sepcifically asked for scriptural evidence that you get to force other people to adhear to God's will. Find it or admit your action is not a Biblical expectation or demand.\n\n \n Do you ever vote? Is a vote in favor of a particular bill / law \"forcing\" someone to do something? Do you want it both ways, where you guys can vote your gay agenda in and we can't vote against it? \n \n As for your question, the Bible says in Romans chapter 13 that the state is the agent of God, and that it can levy judgment against wrongdoers it it wants. If it wants to pass laws against gay marriage it can, as God's agent. So we Christians render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's. \n \n \nI have never denied Christ - I have refused to discuss my faith with you.\n\n \n If you were a Christian you'd have a spiritual understanding of God's laws against gay sex (Lev. 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26-27; I Cor. 6:9-19; Jude 7, etc.). You'd also be preaching / defending Christ around here. \n \n \nI don't want your religion imposed on others. I don't mine imposed either. Unless you can come up with a reasonable non-religious argument for your wanting to deny gays marriage and even sexual intimacy, you are violating freedom.\n\n \n As one of our Founding Fathers said, \"There can be no freedom without virtue.\"\n \n Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings.\n \n And why should I bother with a non-religious reason? There's a higher power than the state that I report to. I have religious reasons, and the Constitution also says that there shall be no laws made against the freedom of religion or free speech. Forget it. \n \n Gay sex is a sin and shouldn't be legitimized (see scriptures above).",

I found the comments and personal stories contained within the forum to be quite fascinating. \n \n Walk Away from Fundamentalism - Forum\n\n \n For example...\n \n It's an interesting question . . . who is responsible for our succumbing to fundamentalism? ... I think part of the recovery process for all of us is to recognize what it was about fundamentalism that sucked us in. Yes, there were people or websites out there trying to suck us in, but we still didn't have to swallow it. I don't think it's a matter of being able to blame others or needing to blame ourselves. It's simply what happened when our personalities were introduced to a certain paradigm at a less mature or weak stage of life. \n \n If I blame others for evangelizing me, then I am equally to blame for evangelizing others. Instead I choose to chuck the idea of blame out the window. I am sorry for my attempts to suck others in, and I hope that nobody suffered because of it. I am saddened that others were brain-washed before me and as a result tried to brainwash me. But given the same stage of life and circumstances, I probably would have found some kind of extreme belief to adopt. I can't say it's the fault of a particular person or organization. I can just pinpoint my susceptibilities and move on. With self-knowledge comes self-power.\n \n .....\n \n \n I have been to a few funerals since I walked away. One was for a mother of my daughter's friend whom I knew because of their friendship. She was a member of the AoG church and the preacher used the occasion to not only teach us about the plan of salvation but to harp on the importance of women being submissive to men. I would liked to have paid my respects to a very sweet woman and to have shown her family that I cared without having had to sit through that. \n \n When my brother-in-law died his Baptist sister commented on what a nice service it had been and how it was more about him than about hell fire and damnation, which was what she was used to in her own church. She said that her pastor's thinking was that some people will only go to a church for a funeral so that might well be the only chance they get to save their souls. Thus the hell fire and damnation sermon at funerals.",

Although I wouldn't say that adapting to a political/cultural landscape is necessarily the highest criteria that one should use to guide these changes. Any system developed by people will, inevitably, have flaws. Refusing to admit the existance of flaws is hubris. However, saying that the system has flaws and must be discarded entirely is, to my mind, foolishness. If you look at almost any religious system there's some good in it; I wouldn't advocate throwing any of them out entirely. However, I also don't believe that any of them embody \"The Truth\", in its entirety. If people of good conscious want to take an antique value system and, after carefull consideration, decide that some part of it is no longer appliable, then I commend them. That's the way of growth. Refusing to admit the possibility of change lead to stagnation, and throwing out the old system entirely means that you have to reinvent the wheel, over and over.\n \n \n \n I think you misunderstand me.

Some steadfastly strive to follow God's will, but recognize that their understanding of God's will is imperfect. Frankly, that's the only reasonable postion to hold when talking about the will of an infinite being, as far as I'm concerned. So, they want to follow God's will, they understand that they have an imperfect grasp of what it is, and so if they think they got something wrong, they correct themselves. This sort of religion may not be as \"sexy\" as one that cliams to be based on a transcript of an interview with God, but I think it's alot more honest.

Don Peter Corleone chides him for holding out (you can almost hear Brando breathing the words), whereupon Ananias is liquidated.

My point is, and always has been, that you are not in fact following any consistent set of religious beliefs, and are just cherry picking the Bible for quotes to support your homophobia. You know this, and have been completely unable to refute it. That's why you keep throwing up this red herring of other people's religions. It's just a trasnparent attempt on your part to try to escape responsibility for your antagonism towards gays. You're fooling nobody, not even yourself I suspect. You've lost the debate here, you've lost the debate with yourself. So show some integrity and just admit to yourself that you were wrong. I don't even care if you admit it here, just acknowledging it to yourself is good enough.",
