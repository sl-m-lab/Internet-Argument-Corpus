   "My brother went to China a few months ago and he picked up a suitcase full of pirated movies and CDs. Watching some of the movies is hilarious. I don't understand why they even bother trying to put English subtitles on a movie already in English and meant to be seen by people who do not speak English.\n \n I think Lord of the Rings was the best. I was in tears with some of the subtitles.\n They never make sense but they are always funny.\n \n I came across this blog that illustrates what I'm talking about perfectly.\n \n This one is pretty funny. I'm dying of laughter.\n \n If anyone has any good screen shots or can come across any, please post them in this thread.\n \n http://www.winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html#ha",

   "haha...wow...i totally agree. The Lord of the Rings trilogy (chinese version) is hilarious!!!...when i saw the pirated version from China, i was laughing so hard i didn't even pay attention to the movie's plot...haha. but then i saw the english version which i rented and it was all good. haha. i still by the pirated movies from china mainly because they are so cheap and because i'm born in china but now am a canadian citizen, i can understand the english so the subtitles don't do any harm towards my entertainment. haha. :p",
