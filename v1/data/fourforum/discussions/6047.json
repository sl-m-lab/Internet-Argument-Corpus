   "\"Chipko\" means \"tree-hugger\" in Kerala. That's where the original tree-huggers started, when clear-cut logging practices destroyed local communities and especially women (whose livelihoods depended on the bounty of the forest). The suicide rate amongst married women soared - when that happens you know you have a serious social problem. And so the women used their own bodies to prevent the logging, wrapping their armys around trees to protect them.\n \n The 'Deep Ecologists' think that there's some intrinsic value to nature that should prevent us from plundering it. 'Eco-feminists' know better. They know that the degradation of the environment affects those poorest and most vulnerable, those women and the families that depend on the labour of those women. Here's a reminder:\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050721/sc_nm/environment_mexico_dc",

   "There are so many things to be said against clear cutting forests, I don't know where to start. Suffice to say for now that the greed of the paper and wood companies is horrible. Instead of replanting where they have already removed the forest, and treating the new growth as a crop, they go into virgin forests and destroy them.",
