   " It is not the body which makes one a human being, but the mind. A fetus doesn't have a higher brain and thus is not a person.\n\n \n This is a very common argument. I have asked this questions several times, and not one person has given me a straight answer. My questions are: Since when does personhood define life? The other question is: Do you have any scientific support that personhood defines life? The answer is that it doesn't. The definition of human life is to be part of the human species, not the human mind. If a child was born with the brain of an ape, but biologically was human, the child would be a human being. If a child was born with the brain of a fly, the infant would still be a human being. \n \n What is most interesting in this argument is that there have always been variations of intellect in humans. The elderly are Wise; adults are intellectuals; adolescents are experimental; children are curious; toddlers are uncaring; fetuses are indifferent; the zygote doesn't think. If you define humanity from the mind, then does that make an adult more human than a child, because his mind is greater? What about an adolescent? What about an infant? What about a toddler? What about a later-term fetus? Are they all less of human beings because the adult has a greater mind?\n \n Further, this brings me to another question; what exactly does a person do? If you ask me, all human beings have different forms of personhood. Adults males have one form, young teenager girls have other forms, and retarded people have another form. In fact, one could easily compare the mind of an ape as smarter than the mind of a retard. Does that make the ape more human than the retard? Of course not. Reason being, biologically the retard is human, while the ape is not. What about infants and dogs? I remember when I was 11 our family decided to get a dog called a \"Labradoodle\", which is a mixture between a Labrador and a Poodle. The shelter where we adopted the dog said that the dogs have an intelligence level of a five-year-old. Does that mean that the Labradoodle is more human than an infant? Of course not.\n \n As a final point, the zygote may not have a mind, but it is building it. Just as an infant is building up it's mind, the zygote is as well. The only problem is there's nothing to build to it. The zygote doesn't have senses yet, so if it had a mind there wouldn't be any use of it.

Although brain development doesn't truly begin until about six weeks, all the pre-brain development happens at conception. However, you're straying from my points. In fact, I think you're avoiding them. \n \n \n The mind has everything to do with it. This is one important factor which differentiates us from the other animals.\n\n \n What is? Having the mind? Or having the capability to have a mind? Because the fetus has the capability to have a mind, you have to right to kill it. \n \n \n And what if the Moon was made of green cheese would we have to swim to Mars?\n\n As always, another red herring.",

   "This is nice. It's funny that I used to debate with pro-death people all the time, and it's nice to see their arguments are still as weak as ever. First off, if anyone *anyone* thinks partial-birth abortion is OK, then just give me your address and I'll come suck YOUR brains out of YOUR head! Must be a horrible feeling, considering the fetus during this time can feel pain, don't you think? Better yet, maybe I'll just mail you the bag with the brains in it. Oh but they should have the right to murder! err... I mean choose, right?\n \n Ok done with my rant, I'll move on to logic\n \n For all of those who choose not to believe in God, let me show you logic, and may God willing, your eyes be opened.\n \n For those of you who do believe in God, let me show you Heavenly logic, marked at the bottom.\n \n --------------Non-Christians-------------\n \n Logically, your parents made the choice of life. We know this for a fact because you are sitting here reading this message. What would the world be like if everyone of these pro-death people had exactly what they want to do done to them? Well... this wouldn't be an issue then would it? I'm saying this to say, by aborting, you are wasting a (great?) mind. Besides, you may not have been classified under law as a human being then, but let me ask you, are you a human being now? If the answer is yes then abortion must be wrong. \n \n If you hack up a plant before it grows, would it not have grown to be a strong, healthy plant? Maybe not, but then again, you killed the plant, so how would you know? When we go into the fields and sow crops, we are expecting and yearning for them to grow. So we tend and nurture them, so that they may grow and feed us. So why treat a human life any differently? Oh! Oh! Oh! I know this one, \"The baby will kill the mother,\" \"I can't afford her/him,\" or wait the best one, \"Let's keep a baby from suffering in this horrible life, 'just' abort.\" I'll discuss all of these\n \n \"The baby will kill the mother.\" Look at the flaw; do you not see it? You don't know that the baby will kill the mother. Secondly, who are you to choose who dies? Furthermore, for all of the mothers who choose their own life over that of an almost newborn, isn't fit to be a mother, or a mammal for that matter. Stop and think, that baby has yet to experience and contribute to society, and you've had much more time than she/he. A true mother would willingly sacrifice her life for her daughter/son after their born, so why should the time of their birth be any different? \n \n \"I can't afford him/her, and she/he would just grow up to be <insert social abnormality here<.\" Well, isn't this just the last ditch argument. Might I for a second, call you God? Because obviously you already know how this child is going to turn out. Let me be an example for this one; I have turned out completely different on all bad accounts from my parents. Everyone I have talked to said this, and no one has ever said otherwise. This was because I continually sought to rise above what I was \"brought up.\" There has been so many people that have came from nothing to everything, who are you to say this child isn't another one? \n \n \"Lets keep a baby from suffering, 'just' abort.\" Yes, let's just take a life, I mean why not, they're going to suffer, right? Your argument is weak and flawed; let me show you. How many times in your life have you broken down into tears and just wept? How many times have you wished you were never born? Now, how many times have you been grateful to be alive? How many times have you said, \"Wow, that's beautiful?\" How many experiences have you had that you wouldn't trade the world for? Now, aren't you glad you were able to think about your answers? I bet that baby would have been grateful too.\n \n Every time you abort, you rob a child of IT'S right to choose, think of it that way. Just because YOU wouldn't want to live doesn't give you the right to kill... oh I'm sorry... abort a life. Besides, why don't you be a real parent/grown up and give it up for adoption. When that child is 20, I promise you he/she will tell you that you made the right decision.\n \n ----Christians----\n \n This segment is for all of those Christians who believe in abortion: repent. I know right now you're all mad at me, but I wouldn't be a Christian if I didn't speak what God wanted me to speak. Our God loved us enough to *not* abort us, so how could we take that for granted? Of course the scripture that everyone knows and hates also applies about him knowing you in the womb. When that sperm meets that egg my Christian Brother or sister; that's when you're born.\n \n Furthermore, Christian's who believe in aborting for saving a mother. Shame on you, don't you know that God is bigger than that? God can create/destroy nations as he pleases, bring the beggars and homeless to absolute power, and control every element known to man (and those unknown). Yet you can still say he can't save a woman's and child's life? You need to leave it in God's hands, and instead of them sucking the brains out of your baby inches before he is born, spend that time in earnest prayer, and ask everyone else to pray. God will move if you have faith.\n \n -------Closing (for both)----\n In closing, anyone who still believes in partial birth abortion needs to check out this sight. I want you to look at the pictures. Just imagine for a second that you are that baby. Oh man I bet the cold steel scissors hurt as they penetrate his neck and spine. I bet if he's not dead by the time that vacuum goes into his skull that he wishes he were. \"OH BUT HE'S ALREADY DEAD!\" Oh that's a much finer way to look at it, isn't it now? Look and realize that is what you're doing to YOUR BABY! \n \n http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html",

   "We are all blobs of cells, aren't we?\n\n \n Ah but you fail to see that the sum of our blob of cells sums up to something which I like to call human life. This in itself wouldn't be important except for the fact that we believe it is and we probably only believe it is because we can relate to it. This in turn provides the reasoning as to why grass and bug life isn't important to us while fetus life is important to us. We can all relate to fetus life as it pertains to human life.\n \n I'm going to cut short of saying more as I want to hear your response on this first.\n \n \nIf I was doing dishes and my son behind my had something in his hand and said \"Can I kill this?\", what would you ask?

The pro-choice debate is based on a value system just as a pro-lifer's debate is. Basically we all value human life but not bug life. So the question arises as to whether a fetus is human life or not. Neither side really feels sympathy towards the DNA or the cells or the logic behind it all. What we feel sympathy towards is our own relation between our sacred human life and the fetus. The pro-lifer's will feel that human and fetus life are closely related and give greater value to the fetus life because of it. The pro-choicer's will do the opposite and claim that while fetus life has more value than a bugs life it still isn't valuable enough to be treated as human. Neither side will probably use those words but in their minds they will be basing their decisions on a value system of sorts that relates to our own relation and understanding of human life. Sure DNA and logic and every other physical aspect does play a role in this debate but in the end it is all about individual feelings. We only know it is wrong to kill another human because we feel that it is.",

   "Parcum and I have been having a similar debate on another thread. He has requested that we continue the debate on this thread so he will not have to respond to two places. I am posting my last post from the other thread. Of course anyone is welcome to respond.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Parcum\n If two cloned humans are truly one human, or separate. Obviously they're separate, but biologically have the same DNA. \n\n \n Which violates your definition since they are not \"independent\". So when do they become separate, or when does the cloned individual become a human being?\n \n \n \nThis is all just a red herring. I don't care what one zygote does to another zygote. The point is the mother has no right to kill the fetus because the fetus is human.\n \n \n One zygote doesn't do anything to another zygote. They can't even think. And you can say the mother has no right to kill the fetus, but it's just your opinion. \n \n \nCloning and identical twins have my same argument. I don't know how the first humans were created. \n\n \n Well the Bible says God formed Adam and then breathed the breath of life into him. That means he became a human being after he became a human. I can see why you don't want to go there.\n \n \nI didn't make it up. Other people have concluded it- scientists, mainly. Even if I made this up or not, there obviously is no scientific evidence against it, is there? I am putting together scientific points, and you are simply dismissing them. Since when does personhood define like? The brain is a very important part of the body, but it isn't the factoring part. \n\n \n Well there's no scientific evidence that you haven't fathered illegitimate children that I know of. Does that mean you have?\n \n You are only stating that zygotes have DNA and they are alive. I don't know of anyone that would disagree with you on that. But then you make the unilateral jump that therefore zygotes are human beings. I know a lot of people that disagree on that. I'm not dismissing your scientific points, I'm pointing out that the jump you make is not scientific.\n \n So if we get to the point where we have brain transplants, it's actually already being considered in some places, then you apparently think the new individual will have the personality of the person in the body instead of the person who donated the brain. I think that would make sense to about two people on the planet, you and the person that got left without the brain.\n \n BTW that brings up an interesting point. When someone has a transplant, does that make them a non-human according to your definition since they do not have a \"unique\" DNA. \n \n \nCan you read? It had two definitions that \"species\" was biological! \n\n \n Yes I can read. That's why I know you gave the definition of a \"kind,sort\" and not the definition of a species. And why I know my original comment is correct which was \"Nothing in even the definition you gave states or implies that a zygote is a human being\". Can you think? \n \n \nThe truth is not obvious. It's not that everyone who disagrees with me is stupid, it's that everyone who has disagreed with me have no valid points to make. So far, every single person I've debated about this issue tells me that personhood defines life. When I ask if the have any scientific evidence, they dismiss my question by saying they don't need it. \n\n \n Personhood does not define life. But it does define a human being. The only point you have made is that a zygote has human DNA and is alive. That doesn't mean it is a person.\n \n Every point I have made you have responded that either you don't care, or that it's just a red herring. \n \n If a person is defined as when God places a soul into a body as I believe, then there is not scientific evidence that can be discovered since science does not deal in the supernatural. \n \n \nWe can disagree- but when people are being killed, time is important. Should I argue that infants and children aren't human because they aren't fully developed yet? Should I argue that handicapped people aren't human because they aren't perfectly made humans? \n\n \n You can argue anything you want. However this argument is not about handicapped people or infants or children. It's about when a fertilized egg becomes a human being.",

Now the woman of modern society seems to have an opinion that her womb is something that holds her back, or is something to revile.

Surely it is intended to be human but it hasn't developed to that point yet. In my view it shares more common traits with a kidney than it does a human being. But that is just my opinion.\n\n \n The Kidney is not alive, and it is not its own species. It is obviously part of the mother. However, the fetus has three things: first, it has its own DNA. A woman cannot have two different DNAs. Second, it occasionally has its own blood type. A woman cannot have two different blood types. Finally, half the time the zygote has a different sex. Does this mean that the mother has both a penis and vagina? Does this mean genetically the mother's sex is both male and female? Does this make the mother a temporary hermaphrodite? No. Obviously, the fetus is NOT part of the mother, and is independent. It is also alive. So my question to you is, what is it? It's alive, it's not part of the mother, so what is it?\n \n \n \n A fetus is no more a baby than you or I are. It is a stage of developement, even early stage.\n\n \n The fetus is not an infant; it is a fetus, but it is still at a very early stage of development. I would agree to call the later-termed fetus a \"baby\", as it has characteristics of a baby, but as for the zygote and embryo, not really. \n \n \n It is a potential human being, a fetus. And you're quite wrong when you say that it is independent from the mother. If you remove a fetus during the time when most abortions are performed it will die on its own. There are no artificial wombs to place it in. It may be alive but it is not yet a life or a person.\n\n \n Actually there are artificial wombs to place it in. Many people do that. There was on case where a woman tried very hard to get pregnant, but she kept having miscarriages, so she tried artificial insemination, and had three embryos fertilized in a test tube. They were frozen. She used two of the embryos, but at the last of the two gave up, and committed suicide. The woman's sister then implanted the embryo into herself and gave birth to it. Hence, yes, there are aritificial ways to have the fetus survive.\n \n What about an infant? An infant can't survive without a parent. If you leave an infant alone, it will die. The fetus is a completely different entity from the mother. Dependency does not define life in humanity. As I've said to AMD, if the fetus is part of the mother, does that mean the mother has four arms, four legs, two brains, two hearts, two different blood types (impossible), two genetic codes, occasionally two sexes, and if the fetus is of a different sex, a penis and vagina? Of course not.\n \n \n I wonder how many times you are going to ask this question? At least you and I have already had this conversation at least a few times and my answer is still the same. Like Charchuk has said, it's a potential human being if it's not aborted or naturally aborted, or the mother doesn't die, or the mother doesn't get too sick or any number of circumstances. An egg from a woman is also a potential human being under the right circumstances, fertilization and attachment to a woman's womb, etc.\n\n \n I've asked it once, and when I brought my arguments against your you ignored them or changed the subject. Read what I said to Charkuk and AMD4ever. \n \n What Montalban is trying to say is that if you leave the kidney alone in the woman, it wont become anything. It'll just stay there until the woman dies. However, if you leave a fetus in the woman, it will grow, and come out. The same goes for the sperm and egg. Both alone cannot become a full-grown human. However, the fetus can become a full-grown human. \n \n AMD4ever, a Caterpillar and butterfly are both the same species. So is an Acorn and an Oak tree. \n \n \n Lets be reasonable here. The fetus is not a speices of any sort. It is a fetus. It means to become human but that doesn't make it part of the human species.\n\n \n It is alive; it is not part of the mother; it has to be part of some species.

If it is part of the mother, then everything the fetus is is part of the mother. Hence, the arms, legs, penis or vagina, brain, head, heart, blood types, et cetera, are all part of the mother. Right?

   "The Kidney is not alive, and it is not its own species. It is obviously part of the mother. However, the fetus has three things: first, it has its own DNA. A woman cannot have two different DNAs. Second, it occasionally has its own blood type. A woman cannot have two different blood types. Finally, half the time the zygote has a different sex. Does this mean that the mother has both a penis and vagina? Does this mean genetically the mother's sex is both male and female? Does this make the mother a temporary hermaphrodite? No. Obviously, the fetus is NOT part of the mother, and is independent. It is also alive. So my question to you is, what is it? It's alive, it's not part of the mother, so what is it?\n\n \n Could you repeat that? I must be getting hard of hearing + blind. The kidney is not alive? What in the world is your definition of alive? Do you believe that a single cell is alive? Do you believe that a collection of cells are alive? If this collection of cells is given a name are they still alive? What is the difference between a collection of cells called \"human\" and the collection of cells called \"kidney\" as it relates to them being alive? Is anything not human alive?\n \n Next you try to make the case for why the fetus is different than the kidney. You state it has DNA and can possibly have its own blood type and sex. Basically this is what makes it a fetus and the kidney a kidney. Now let me give you a list and tell me why my list makes no sense and yours does. This list is a comparison between born humans and fetuses and shows why we are so different. A born human is often able to carry on life outside of a womb. A born human is often able to breathe, eat, and see things of this world. A born human can often communicate with other humans.\n \n Does this mean that the mother has both a penis and vagina?\n Absolutely not. The fetus has the penis.\n Does this mean genetically the mother's sex is both male and female?\n No, the mother is female and the fetus is male.\n Does this make the mother a temporary hermaphrodite\n Clearly not.\n what is it?\n It is a fetus.\n It's alive, it's not part of the mother, so what is it?\n It is a fetus. The fetus is part of the mother just as an egg would be. You do believe the egg is part of the female correct? So why does a transformation of the egg make it not part of the mother?\n \n I see what you are trying to get at here so I better say now else I will have to do it later. If the kidney was to grow a penis inside of a woman would you agree that she had a penis? Would you agree that she is both male and female? Would that make her a hermaphrodite? If you answer yes I hope you are specific as to why you believe the answer is yes.\n \n \nAs I've said to AMD, if the fetus is part of the mother, does that mean the mother has four arms, four legs, two brains, two hearts, two different blood types (impossible), two genetic codes, occasionally two sexes, and if the fetus is of a different sex, a penis and vagina? Of course not.\n\n \n First of all I believe that if a heart grew an arm inside of a person it would be said that the heart grew an arm, not the woman. An arm is externally visible as far as most people are concerned. No one would suggest that a woman with an arm growing off her heart has three arms. People know what an arm is. This is the same reason that a fetus having two arms growing inside a woman is said to have two arms of it's own. The woman would not be said to have four arms.\n \n Some questions. If a parasite entered a woman and it has 800 legs would you accuse the woman of having 802 legs? If it had 50 hearts would you accuse the woman of having 51 hearts? If it had 10 blood types would you say it is impossible for that woman to be alive as she has 11 blood types?\n \n \nAMD4ever, a Caterpillar and butterfly are both the same species. So is an Acorn and an Oak tree. \n\n \n Can you name the species that includes both caterpillar and butterfly.\n \n \nIt is alive; it is not part of the mother; it has to be part of some species. Scientifically, it's part of the human species, but I'm going to ask you this; if we for some reason don't know the species of the fetus, what would you conclude the species is?\n\n \n Let's consider that the fetus is part of the human species which even I believe but like debating just for the sake of seeing the other side. Where are you going with this argument?",

   " The question was answered and there is no reason for you to be sorry. It's part of the human species. But again, it's not a human being.\n\n \n Let's look at the dictionary terms of \"being\":\n \n 1 a : the quality or state of having existence b (1) : something conceivable as existing (2) : something that actually exists (3) : the totality of existing things c : conscious existence : LIFE\n 2 : the qualities that constitute an existent thing : ESSENCE; especially : PERSONALITY\n 3 : a living thing; especially : PERSON \n \n Hence, most likely what you mean is asking if the fetus is a person, not if it's a being. It being a \"being\" is quite obvious. It exists. Anything that's alive is a being. \"Human Being\" simply means \"being human\". So is your argument that the fetus is a living, independent, human, but it isn't a human person? \n \n \n Only the human being that was cloned had a conception not the cloned individual. Therefore there is no point at which the cloned individual was conceived. So I ask again, at what point is a cloned individual a human being?\n\n \n I honestly don't know enough about cloning to opinionate on the matter. I would assume whenever the being has the genetic code. However, go along with your point.\n \n \n At what point are identical twins a human being?\n\n \n Conception. \n \n \n What is the difference between human beings and the other animals?\n\n \n We are intelligent; animals are dumb, of course. \n \n \n Could you repeat that? I must be getting hard of hearing + blind. The kidney is not alive? What in the world is your definition of alive? Do you believe that a single cell is alive? Do you believe that a collection of cells are alive? If this collection of cells is given a name are they still alive? What is the difference between a collection of cells called \"human\" and the collection of cells called \"kidney\" as it relates to them being alive? Is anything not human alive?\n\n \n My definition of alive is what it means; a life, meaning, an independent life. The Kidney is living through the mother. Cells are living, yes. \n \n \n It is a fetus. The fetus is part of the mother just as an egg would be. You do believe the egg is part of the female correct? So why does a transformation of the egg make it not part of the mother?\n\n \n You're comparing two very different parts. The egg is part of the mother; it has the mother's DNA, the mother's cells, the mother's blood type, and is ultimately the mother. The fetus, however, has both the father's and mother's DNA, it's own cells, and usually it's own blood type. You're doing two things; you're calling the fetus a separate entity, but at the same time the same entity. You're saying that the fetus is it's own being biologically, but physically is part of the mother. Well, I suppose one could say that it is physically attached to the mother, but that doesn't make it part of the mother. Because it is biologically independent, it is it's own being.\n \n Let me ask you this. If for some revolutionary invension, a 3-year-old was to be placed into the mother's womb and reattached, would it be part of the mother? Of course, you're answer is going to be \"No, because it has a brain\". You cannot differ the fetus with a brain attached to the mother with a fetus without a brain attached to the mother. They are both attached to the mother the same. Physically, they are attached, biologically, they are not (An undeniable fact. A mother cannot possibly have two blood types). \n \n Have you ever heard of Siamese twins? They are born attached to each other. Would they be entities of each other? Could they kill each other and claim \"it's okay it's part of me\"? \n \n \n I see what you are trying to get at here so I better say now else I will have to do it later. If the kidney was to grow a penis inside of a woman would you agree that she had a penis? Would you agree that she is both male and female? Would that make her a hermaphrodite? If you answer yes I hope you are specific as to why you believe the answer is yes.\n\n \n Actually yes as that is what being a hermaphrodite is. The disease of hermaphrodite is real- it's not fictional. If a woman was to grow sexual organs naturally, yes, she would be both male and female. If, however, it was unnatural and the sexual organ was surgically placed into the woman, the answer is no, because she biologically is a female. \n \n \n First of all I believe that if a heart grew an arm inside of a person it would be said that the heart grew an arm, not the woman.\n\n \n WRONG. The mother would have three arms. This is not an \"I believe\" matter, it is a matter of fact. If you have a tumor grow out of your liver, YOU have a tumor. Sure, it is on your liver, but that doesn't mean just your liver has a tumor, YOU have the tumor as well.\n \n \n If a parasite entered a woman and it has 800 legs would you accuse the woman of having 802 legs? If it had 50 hearts would you accuse the woman of having 51 hearts? If it had 10 blood types would you say it is impossible for that woman to be alive as she has 11 blood types?\n\n \n No, because a parasite is a different entity. The parasite isn't PART of the mother, it simply is inside of her. Picture the parasite like at tick. A tick attached itself into your skin. Does that mean that you have 12 limbs? No, because the tick is a different life, a different being. \n \n \n Can you name the species that includes both caterpillar and butterfly.\n\n \n Well, there are many kinds of butterflies, but I'll name one.

   "Let's look at the dictionary terms of \"being\":\n \n 1 a : the quality or state of having existence b (1) : something conceivable as existing (2) : something that actually exists (3) : the totality of existing things c : conscious existence : LIFE\n 2 : the qualities that constitute an existent thing : ESSENCE; especially : PERSONALITY\n 3 : a living thing; especially : PERSON \n\n a fetus isn't conscious nor does it have personality. this is what the \"being\" in \"human being\" means.\n \n \nI honestly don't know enough about cloning to opinionate on the matter. I would assume whenever the being has the genetic code. However, go along with your point.\n\n a clone is an exact copy of a person. now you can answer the question.\n \n \nWe are intelligent; animals are dumb, of course.\n\n so you think we should be able to treat the mentally ill like animals? some dolphins and monkeys are smarter than some humans. does this make the monkeys and dolphins humans and the \"some humans\" animals?\n \n \nYou're comparing two very different parts. The egg is part of the mother; it has the mother's DNA, the mother's cells, the mother's blood type, and is ultimately the mother. The fetus, however, has both the father's and mother's DNA, it's own cells, and usually it's own blood type. You're doing two things; you're calling the fetus a separate entity, but at the same time the same entity. You're saying that the fetus is it's own being biologically, but physically is part of the mother. Well, I suppose one could say that it is physically attached to the mother, but that doesn't make it part of the mother. Because it is biologically independent, it is it's own being.\n\n you can inseminate a mother with her own dna. no separte person is needed.\n \n \nLet me ask you this. If for some revolutionary invension, a 3-year-old was to be placed into the mother's womb and reattached, would it be part of the mother? Of course, you're answer is going to be \"No, because it has a brain\". You cannot differ the fetus with a brain attached to the mother with a fetus without a brain attached to the mother. They are both attached to the mother the same. Physically, they are attached, biologically, they are not (An undeniable fact. A mother cannot possibly have two blood types).\n\n it has a brain. the only reason you said we \"can't\" is because it disproves you.\n \n \nHave you ever heard of Siamese twins? They are born attached to each other. Would they be entities of each other? Could they kill each other and claim \"it's okay it's part of me\"?\n\n when they are born, they develop different personalities and have 2 separate brains.\n \n \nActually yes as that is what being a hermaphrodite is. The disease of hermaphrodite is real- it's not fictional. If a woman was to grow sexual organs naturally, yes, she would be both male and female. If, however, it was unnatural and the sexual organ was surgically placed into the woman, the answer is no, because she biologically is a female.\n\n um, no.\n \n \nWRONG. The mother would have three arms. This is not an \"I believe\" matter, it is a matter of fact. If you have a tumor grow out of your liver, YOU have a tumor. Sure, it is on your liver, but that doesn't mean just your liver has a tumor, YOU have the tumor as well.\n\n no.\n \n \nWell, there are many kinds of butterflies, but I'll name one. The Monarch Butterfly is call a Danaus plexippus.\n \n From the site: \n \n  As a butterfly caterpillar grows it must molt its skin. Each stage between molts is called an instar.

   "Some of my post along with the questions have already been responded to but I&#8217;m putting in my two cents worth anyway.\n \n \nLet&#8217;s look at the dictionary terms of &#8220;being&#8221;:\n \n 1 a : the quality or state of having existence b (1) : something conceivable as existing (2) : something that actually exists (3) : the totality of existing things c : conscious existence : LIFE\n 2 : the qualities that constitute an existent thing : ESSENCE; especially : PERSONALITY\n 3 : a living thing; especially : PERSON \n \n Hence, most likely what you mean is asking if the fetus is a person, not if it&#8217;s a being. It being a &#8220;being&#8221; is quite obvious. It exists. Anything that&#8217;s alive is a being. &#8220;Human Being&#8221; simply means &#8220;being human&#8221;. So is your argument that the fetus is a living, independent, human, but it isn&#8217;t a human person? \n\n \n You can play with words and definitions forever but we are talking concepts. Everyone debating here has a general concept of living. It has a scientific definition that I think everyone would agree with. Most people would understand independent to mean not dependent on something else. You have a strange concept that it means what most people refer to as &#8220;different&#8221;. I don&#8217;t agree with your use of the word in that context but I do understand what you are talking about so I&#8217;ll just leave it alone when you say independent. Human in the context you seem to want to use it means that it has human DNA and is alive. I think you mean by that, that it could be any part of a human body but I might not understand what your concept of human is. I think I can generally speak for the ones that are arguing against you that for us, human being means a biological organism that has human DNA and that in general has some form of what is called an individual personality that represents that person. So for us, the transposition that you are trying to make that human being simply means being human is not true in the sense you are trying to make. In fact you know that and we know that. You are just trying to prove a point by playing with words and no one is going to fall for that. So repeat it as many times as you want, but it won&#8217;t work. The answer is still that a human being must have some qualities of a human being before it should be considered a human being. And that means more than human DNA in a cell.\n \n \nI honestly don&#8217;t know enough about cloning to opinionate on the matter. I would assume whenever the being has the genetic code. However, go along with your point. \n\n \n If you don&#8217;t know enough about cloning to have an opinion then your argument about when a human begins is going to be difficult to defend. The genetic code was established when the egg and sperm united in the person that was cloned. The cloned individual has the exact same genetic code since the DNA was placed in an egg. So again, at what point is a cloned individual a human being? If you can&#8217;t answer that question, your argument is dead on arrival.\n \nAt what point are identical twins a human being? \n\n There is only one egg and one cell of DNA at conception. It certainly can&#8217;t be at that point unless you consider identical twins the same person. Is that what you are saying you believe?\n \nWe are intelligent; animals are dumb, of course. \n\n \n For some, that&#8217;s debatable in itself. LOL However intelligence is a relative term. As has already been pointed out, some animals are more intelligent than some human beings. Since we are trying to establish what a human being is and when it becomes a human being, what establishes enough intelligence to make a biological organism a human being? And what part of a human being makes a person intelligent?\n \n If Steve&#8217;s brain is transplanted into the body of John, which memories and personality will be maintained in the new human being, Steve&#8217;s or John&#8217;s?",

   "My definition of alive is what it means; a life, meaning, an independent life. The Kidney is living through the mother. Cells are living, yes. \n\n \n So a single cell is alive regardless as to whether it depends on other cells or not. A group of cells is only alive if they do not depend on other groups of cells to survive? Of course this failed thought is shadowed by your conclusion that only independent life is alive and since a fetus is very dependent you must believe it is not alive.\n \n \nYou're comparing two very different parts. The egg is part of the mother; it has the mother's DNA, the mother's cells, the mother's blood type, and is ultimately the mother. The fetus, however, has both the father's and mother's DNA, it's own cells, and usually it's own blood type. You're doing two things; you're calling the fetus a separate entity, but at the same time the same entity. You're saying that the fetus is it's own being biologically, but physically is part of the mother. Well, I suppose one could say that it is physically attached to the mother, but that doesn't make it part of the mother. Because it is biologically independent, it is it's own being.\n\n \n The egg evolved to be something different. I could debate here that cancer can be introduced to our body and radically change parts of it yet both the cancer and the changes being made are still part of our body now. Same is true with viruses.\n \n You complain that I'm calling the fetus a separate entity and the same entity as the mother as well. I do the same to a kidney by calling it a separate entity and part of the mother as well.\n \n A kidney is as biologically independent as a fetus is.\n \n \nLet me ask you this. If for some revolutionary invension, a 3-year-old was to be placed into the mother's womb and reattached, would it be part of the mother? Of course, you're answer is going to be \"No, because it has a brain\". You cannot differ the fetus with a brain attached to the mother with a fetus without a brain attached to the mother. They are both attached to the mother the same. Physically, they are attached, biologically, they are not (An undeniable fact. A mother cannot possibly have two blood types). \n\n \n If this was possible you are correct that I would agree the 3-year old is still separate. Not only because of the mind but also because I believe the fetus is separate as well. Clearly the mother would be growing a 3-year old in side of her and once again it would be part of her system and therefore be part of her. It would be idiotic to do such a thing but even the common onlooker would agree that the woman has a baby or a child inside of her and is therefore not very different from being preganant.\n \n You keep coming back to the two blood types. I think what you mean to say is that it is impossible for a single circulatory system to contain two blood types. That is far more accurate than what you are saying. What you are basically saying is that if the fetus is part of the mother and has a different blood type then I must have just been proven wrong in my argument since that means the mother has two blood types. Your assumption is wrong and your original statement is not stated as a scientist would state it. So lets be clear. The two blood types statement only is true for circulatory systems, not for individual people made up of more than one circulatory systems.\n \n \nHave you ever heard of Siamese twins? They are born attached to each other. Would they be entities of each other? Could they kill each other and claim \"it's okay it's part of me\"? \n\n \n The Siamese twins are separate systems as well in many ways including with their minds. Since they are separate systems I find it hard to believe that you can assume they are just one person. And actually you are the one who would have made the case for them not being alive since they are not independent life.\n \n \nActually yes as that is what being a hermaphrodite is. The disease of hermaphrodite is real- it's not fictional. If a woman was to grow sexual organs naturally, yes, she would be both male and female. If, however, it was unnatural and the sexual organ was surgically placed into the woman, the answer is no, because she biologically is a female. \n\n \n So by your definition you have to believe that a woman can be both male and female and have two blood types if I am correct. By my definition I believe that the woman and fetus are two different systems. They are not independent from each other in every way but they are still two systems.\n \n Just to go back to the siamese twins I also believe they are separate systems so if one is male and the other female they are not hermaphrodites. They are one male and one female.\n \n \nWRONG. The mother would have three arms. This is not an \"I believe\" matter, it is a matter of fact. If you have a tumor grow out of your liver, YOU have a tumor. Sure, it is on your liver, but that doesn't mean just your liver has a tumor, YOU have the tumor as well.\n\n \n If a tumor grew out of the liver it is your tumor. This is because the tumor is something that can be defined as a living thing inside of you just as the fetus is. The tumor is separate from the liver instead of being part of it. An arm growing out of the heart would not be named as such. An arm has a specific definition making it impossible for one to grow out of the heart and therefore even if one did grow out of the heart it would not be called an arm.\n \n Arm - technically the part of the superior limb between the shoulder and the elbow but commonly used to refer to the whole superior limb.\n \n This is why the tumor can be recognized as part of you while a third arm growing off a heart wouldn't be recognized as a third arm for you. Perhaps you would be said to have a heart arm but that would indicate that the heart has an arm and you have a heart with an arm.\n \n \nNo, because a parasite is a different entity. The parasite isn't PART of the mother, it simply is inside of her. Picture the parasite like at tick. A tick attached itself into your skin. Does that mean that you have 12 limbs? No, because the tick is a different life, a different being.\n\n \n Going back to your last argument about the tumor, you must that if you have a parasite inside of you then YOU have a parasite. Try to tell me how this is wrong and your \"YOU\" have a tumor statement is correct. I would simply fall back on the fact that they are separate systems completely even more so than the fetus and the mother systems.\n \n \nWell, there are many kinds of butterflies, but I'll name one. The Monarch Butterfly is call a Danaus plexippus.\n \n From the site: \n \n  As a butterfly caterpillar grows it must molt its skin. Each stage between molts is called an instar. All five instars of the Monarch are shown in the caterpillar photo. From left to right, they are #2 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 1. \n source\n\n \n You do realize that you never answered my question. Name a species that includes both caterpillars and butterflies. I didn't ask for just the species name of a single butterfly. You stated earlier that caterpillars and butterflies are both the same species and I'm calling you on this statement. Show me a species that includes both butterflies and caterpillars.\n \n And please quit trying to play childish word games. The butterfly caterpillar is a type of a caterpillar, not a type of butterfly. Therefore this name does not imply that they are part of the same species.\n \n \nIf you say it's a human being, then I win the debate, as the killing of a human being is murder. If you say that it's not a human person, because it doesn't have personal traits, then you're sliding from the issue. No matter what, the killing of a human being is murder. Even people who are brain-dead, killing them is murder. \n\n \n My debate extends further than just a fetus being human. I see the fetus as human because of it's genetic make up.\n \n I am also not sliding from the issue. The issue of abortion contains many sub-issues only one of which we have debated here. I would be switching issues to begin debating personality traits but I would not be sliding from the abortion issue as a whole.\n \n Brain-dead people have the plug pulled on them everyday essentially murdering them. Who do you think will stand trial for this murder? At least try to make the debate that brain dead people have no chance of survival therefore letting them die is not just an option, it is an only option while fetuses can survive therefore the option of life does exist.\n \n \n*phew* I'm done.\n\n \n I hope you are not going to abandon the debate before it's completion.",

   "Sorry for taking so long. This took my about an hour to respond. Also excuse any grammatical or mechanical errors, as I did not check. \n \n Please understand that I am debating three or four more times as you, and so I may accidentally or purposely skip posts due to my attention span and time. It would be my pleasure to respond to your arguments, but just remind me. Thank you for your patience. \n \n \n Most people would understand independent to mean not dependent on something else.\n\n \n I am not independent. I still have to obey my mother. Does that automatically make me part of my mother? Of course not. What if for some reason I was attached to my mother surgically. Would that make me part of the mother? Or rather, would that make the mother part of me? Why is the fetus part of the mother? Can the mother be a satellite to the fetus? The mother cannot control the fetus; the fetus cannot control the mother. Both of them control themselves. Both of them are individuals. \n \n \n You have a strange concept that it means what most people refer to as \"different\". Human in the context you seem to want to use it means that it has human DNA and is alive. I think I can generally speak for the ones that are arguing against you that for us, human being means a biological organism that has human DNA and that in general has some form of what is called an individual personality that represents that person. \n\n \n Au contraire! You're the one who claimed your concept was different! At any rate, I don't solely define humanity on DNA and being alive. As I will explain shortly, there are two kinds of individuality; Physical individualism and Biological individualism. Moving on, humanity isn't defined by personality, but I'll work with this. You see, the fetus has a potential of being a person. Only the fetus has this potential if left alone; the sperm doesn't have this potential; the egg doesn't have this potential. Only does the fetus have this potential to be a person. Only do humans have the capability to grow a human brain- no other species can. It may not have this brain yet, but it is growing it; that is evidence enough of it's life in humanity. The sperm and egg are simply products of another person's body. Those left alone cannot become anything; they simply die. However, the newly conceived human being has complete potential to be a full grown adult- just as an infant does, just as a child does. \n \n As a matter of fact, there are many things children don't have that adults have. One of them is the ability to have a sexual intercourse. Does that make them not human, because they aren't complete? Of course not. \n \n \n \n If you don't know enough about cloning to have an opinion then your argument about when a human begins is going to be difficult to defend. The genetic code was established when the egg and sperm united in the person that was cloned. The cloned individual has the exact same genetic code since the DNA was placed in an egg. So again, at what point is a cloned individual a human being? If you can't answer that question, your argument is dead on arrival.\n\n \n There are two kinds of individuality. The first is physical, the second is biological. The trait of physical individuality  is that the fetus cannot possibly be part of the mother because of physical properties. Hence, that one cell in the mother's body cannot possibly be part of the mother because it is growing it's own physical things that the mother can't have. For instance, the mother can't possibly have four arms, four legs, et cetera. Even if the fetus was cloned, the assertion that the fetus is physically part of the mother is ridiculous as the mother cannot have twice of what she has. The second individuality is biological individuality. Biological individuality is a definite, and a definition of individuality from the conception. Aside from cloning, the mother in this case has a different genetic code, usually a different blood type, and a different future. \n \n Biological individuality and Physical individuality are both necessary in defining the fetus. If one cannot be possible, then the other is always possible. This one is usually the biological individualism. Physical individualism is quite obvious, but biological individualism is not always obvious.\n \n You're either saying the following: That the mother would have her own genetic copy put inside of her, or that at an early age when the eggs are split and then fertilized. In both cases, fertilization are nessecary, so fertilization (conception) is when life begins. Although the genetics are older, conception is still the defining point of humanity, through physical individualism.\n \n I hope I understand your case clearly. I did a bit of basic research on cloning to understand my opposition. :-)\n \n \n There is only one egg and one cell of DNA at conception. It certainly can't be at that point unless you consider identical twins the same person. Is that what you are saying you believe?\n\n \n Actually identical twins are conceived when the egg splits and then is conceived. The embryo doesn't split. If you split the embryo it simply speeds up the embryo's process of growing. Yes, they have the same DNA, but as I've said, there's Physical individualism and Biological individualism. \n \n \n For some, that's debatable in itself. LOL However intelligence is a relative term. As has already been pointed out, some animals are more intelligent than some human beings. Since we are trying to establish what a human being is and when it becomes a human being, what establishes enough intelligence to make a biological organism a human being? And what part of a human being makes a person intelligent?\n\n \n The brain of course. Through you're last post, I already knew what you're doing. However, this argument isn't going to work. The reason why we as humans are smarter than animals is we have the capability to be intelligent. Animals also have the capability to be intelligent, but their maximum intellect is much less than the human capacity. Consider the following; all humans and only humans have the capability of achieving full human intellect. The fetus has the capability of achieving full human intellect. Therefore, the fetus is human. \n \n \n If Steve's brain is transplanted into the body of John, which memories and personality will be maintained in the new human being, Steve's or John's?\n\n \n John's. And John will still be John, not Steve. \n \n \n So a single cell is alive regardless as to whether it depends on other cells or not. A group of cells is only alive if they do not depend on other groups of cells to survive? Of course this failed thought is shadowed by your conclusion that only independent life is alive and since a fetus is very dependent you must believe it is not alive.\n\n \n The problem is, the cells are different from the mother's cells. There of course is the case of cloning, but we cannot automatically assume that the fetus is not independent due to cloning. Is the fetus then only independent when the genetics are different, and part of the mother when they are the same? No. The genetics being different are simply to paint a picture in our minds that the fetus is independent in a different way. What is also important to understand is the fetus is a parasite. It doesn't help the mother in any way, and it's living and growing off the mother's health. Therefore, it's not part of the mother.\n \n \n The egg evolved to be something different. I could debate here that cancer can be introduced to our body and radically change parts of it yet both the cancer and the changes being made are still part of our body now. Same is true with viruses.\n\n \n The egg only evolved because of the sperm. So the egg didn't evolve at all. \n \n \n A kidney is as biologically independent as a fetus is.\n\n \n No it isn't. The kidney is the mother's body part; a necessary organ that the mother needs for survival (she has two). The fetus simply a parasite, or a satellite of the mother. The fetus is also biologically independent from the mother. One example; a kidney could never have a different blood type from the mother, while a fetus can. \n \n What is interesting about this tumor thing is that cancer is not contagious. It is only contagious to its setlines' body. The fetus cannot get cancer during the pregnancy because it is only contagious in it's mother's body, not in it's own. Therefore, the fetus is not part of the mother. \n \n \n You keep coming back to the two blood types. I think what you mean to say is that it is impossible for a single circulatory system to contain two blood types. That is far more accurate than what you are saying. What you are basically saying is that if the fetus is part of the mother and has a different blood type then I must have just been proven wrong in my argument since that means the mother has two blood types. Your assumption is wrong and your original statement is not stated as a scientist would state it. So lets be clear. The two blood types statement only is true for circulatory systems, not for individual people made up of more than one circulatory systems.\n\n \n There is no such thing as a person with two circulatory systems, let alone two blood types. It is simply impossible.\n \n \n The Siamese twins are separate systems as well in many ways including with their minds. Since they are separate systems I find it hard to believe that you can assume they are just one person. And actually you are the one who would have made the case for them not being alive since they are not independent life.\n\n \n They sort of have different systems. Occasionally they share one or more organs. They also have the same nervous systems in some cases. Most importantly, they have the same DNA. Hence, it one commits suicide, they will both die. Does that mean they are the same person? No. As you said, they have different personalities, and different futures. The fetus also has a different mind from the mother- the mother has a mind, while the fetus doesn't. Eventually, the fetus will grow a completely different mind from the mother. \n \n \n So by your definition you have to believe that a woman can be both male and female and have two blood types if I am correct. By my definition I believe that the woman and fetus are two different systems. They are not independent from each other in every way but they are still two systems.\n\n \n No, they cannot have two blood types. That's impossible. Once again, you're comparing two issues. The genetic disorder (thank you Hank) happens by genetics, not by being pregnant. And from what I know about human sexuality, none of us can change our sexes, let alone change back to our original sex. This simply doesn't happen. No, the woman is not male and female. She is female. It is ludicrous to call pregnant women hermaphrodites. \n \n \n Just to go back to the siamese twins I also believe they are separate systems so if one is male and the other female they are not hermaphrodites. They are one male and one female.\n\n \n They cannot be male and female. They only can be one sex. \n \n LOL. I just realized how ridiculous your two previous statements are. LOL.\n \n \n Arm - technically the part of the superior limb between the shoulder and the elbow but commonly used to refer to the whole superior limb.\n\n \n It doesn't matter where the arm is coming from, what matters is what the arm is. If the arm comes out of the heart and is skin and bones, then it is a third arm. I think most people would agree with this.\n \n \n Going back to your last argument about the tumor, you must that if you have a parasite inside of you then YOU have a parasite. Try to tell me how this is wrong and your \"YOU\" have a tumor statement is correct. I would simply fall back on the fact that they are separate systems completely even more so than the fetus and the mother systems.\n\n \n You have a parasite inside of you. You didn't grow this parasite, it went inside of you. The tumor, however, grew out of your DNA. The fetus is like the parasite. It was created inside of you. If a bug were to lay eggs in your womb, and they would hatch, would that mean the parasites in your womb are part of you? No. The parasites are their own being. \n \n \n You do realize that you never answered my question. Name a species that includes both caterpillars and butterflies. I didn't ask for just the species name of a single butterfly. You stated earlier that caterpillars and butterflies are both the same species and I'm calling you on this statement. Show me a species that includes both butterflies and caterpillars.\n\n \n Umm... I just did. Okay, if you insist...\n \n  Birds are probably the worst threat, but because of the toxicity built up in the monarch caterpillar's body from eating milkweed, most birds cannot tolerate eating them. Likewise they avoid eating the adult butterfly as wellSource\n \n  This neat looking fellow is the larval stage (caterpillar) of the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) feeding on Asclepias curassavica or Butterfly weed (milkweed). source\n \n \n And please quit trying to play childish word games. The butterfly caterpillar is a type of a caterpillar, not a type of butterfly. Therefore this name does not imply that they are part of the same species.\n\n \n It wasn't a word game. You just want it to be. Poor you. \n \n \n Brain-dead people have the plug pulled on them everyday essentially murdering them. Who do you think will stand trial for this murder? At least try to make the debate that brain dead people have no chance of survival therefore letting them die is not just an option, it is an only option while fetuses can survive therefore the option of life does exist.\n\n \n Having the plug pulled isn't murder. If you leave the braindead alone, nothing is going to happen to it. This human has no potential to have a mind, and we are allowing him or her to live. However, the fetus has a full potential to grow up to an adult.\n \n \n I hope you are not going to abandon the debate before it's completion.\n\n \n Um no.",

   "I am not independent. I still have to obey my mother. Does that automatically make me part of my mother? Of course not. What if for some reason I was attached to my mother surgically. Would that make me part of the mother? Or rather, would that make the mother part of me? Why is the fetus part of the mother? Can the mother be a satellite to the fetus? The mother cannot control the fetus; the fetus cannot control the mother. Both of them control themselves. Both of them are individuals. \n\n \n I never said you were independent. I simply said &#8220;Most people would understand independent to mean not dependent on something else.&#8221; BTW you don&#8217;t HAVE to obey your mother, I&#8217;m assuming you are a grown person, but you may chose to obey your mother.\n \n \nAu contraire! You&#8217;re the one who claimed your concept was different! At any rate, I don&#8217;t solely define humanity on DNA and being alive. As I will explain shortly, there are two kinds of individuality; Physical individualism and Biological individualism. Moving on, humanity isn&#8217;t defined by personality, but I&#8217;ll work with this. You see, the fetus has a potential of being a person. Only the fetus has this potential if left alone; the sperm doesn&#8217;t have this potential; the egg doesn&#8217;t have this potential. Only does the fetus have this potential to be a person. Only do humans have the capability to grow a human brain- no other species can. It may not have this brain yet, but it is growing it; that is evidence enough of it&#8217;s life in humanity. The sperm and egg are simply products of another person&#8217;s body. Those left alone cannot become anything; they simply die. However, the newly conceived human being has complete potential to be a full grown adult- just as an infant does, just as a child does. \n\n \n I agree with most of what you said. I&#8217;m not sure what &#8220;life in humanity&#8221; means to you.\n \n \nAs a matter of fact, there are many things children don&#8217;t have that adults have. One of them is the ability to have a sexual intercourse. Does that make them not human, because they aren&#8217;t complete? Of course not. \n\n \n I&#8217;m not sure why you are having trouble with this concept. It&#8217;s that they don&#8217;t have a personality because they can&#8217;t think because they don&#8217;t have a brain that makes it not a human being. You keep bring up things like the inability to have sexual intercourse as if someone has said that doesn&#8217;t make them a human being. Can you stick to the concept that a brain/thinking/personality is the dividing point I am arguing?\n \n \nThere are two kinds of individuality. The first is physical, the second is biological. The trait of physical individuality is that the fetus cannot possibly be part of the mother because of physical properties. Hence, that one cell in the mother&#8217;s body cannot possibly be part of the mother because it is growing it&#8217;s own physical things that the mother can&#8217;t have. For instance, the mother can&#8217;t possibly have four arms, four legs, et cetera. Even if the fetus was cloned, the assertion that the fetus is physically part of the mother is ridiculous as the mother cannot have twice of what she has. The second individuality is biological individuality. Biological individuality is a definite, and a definition of individuality from the conception. Aside from cloning, the mother in this case has a different genetic code, usually a different blood type, and a different future. \n\n \n Okay, why do you continue to bring this up? It&#8217;s not part of the mother, it&#8217;s attached to the mother.\n \n \nBiological individuality and Physical individuality are both necessary in defining the fetus. If one cannot be possible, then the other is always possible. This one is usually the biological individualism. Physical individualism is quite obvious, but biological individualism is not always obvious.\n\n \n Okay again, what in the world is your point?\n \n \nYou&#8217;re either saying the following: That the mother would have her own genetic copy put inside of her, or that at an early age when the eggs are split and then fertilized. In both cases, fertilization are nessecary, so fertilization (conception) is when life begins. Although the genetics are older, conception is still the defining point of humanity, through physical individualism.\n \n I hope I understand your case clearly. I did a bit of basic research on cloning to understand my opposition. :-) \n\n \n You need to do more research on cloning since fertilization (conception) is not only not required for cloning, it would negate the cloning if outside DNA was introduced into the cells. That blows your argument that fertilization is when life begins.\n \n \nActually identical twins are conceived when the egg splits and then is conceived. The embryo doesn&#8217;t split. If you split the embryo it simply speeds up the embryo&#8217;s process of growing. Yes, they have the same DNA, but as I&#8217;ve said, there&#8217;s Physical individualism and Biological individualism. \n\n \n Actually you are wrong and it&#8217;s easy to show. The fertilized egg (zygote) splits up to 13 days after conception. It the egg splits after about 13 days, it will result in Siamese twins. There can even be identical triplets where the egg splits into 3 zygotes after fertilization. Do a search on the net of \"conception of identical twins\" and you'll find out. So this is another case where your argument is blown. Better come up with another definition of when a human begins.\n \n \nThe brain of course. Through you&#8217;re last post, I already knew what you&#8217;re doing. However, this argument isn&#8217;t going to work.

And John will still be John, not Steve. \n\n \n Now that is about the most ludicrous thing you have said since the debate started. How will John have any memories since memories are stored in the brain and only Steve&#8217;s brain is left? That&#8217;s like saying you take your hard drive out of your computer and put it in another computer and you still have the memory of the other computer.",

If you are trying to suggest that the DNA link causes a life link then look no further than what would happen if the two were separated and one committed suicide. Using your logic this would still result in the death of both.\n \n When the two systems are linked their lives are linked to some extent. However this is different than the fetus/mother link.

However, personhood does not define life. As stated before, if the fetus is a life, and not part of the mother, then it has to be something. It only can be a human being.

Better come up with another definition of when a human begins.\n\n \n You seem to be a bit more of a biology wiz then I am :-) Then, during the split, you've got two humans. Conception is when the life began, but then they split later on. If a human were to split up and grow another human identical to it, when did it's life begin? I would assume it began at conception for the both of them, and later they split. I don't see where you're going with this though. \n \n \n Only some humans are smarter than some animals. And only some fetus have the capability of achieving full human intellect.\n\n \n All of them do. They have the capability of attaining full human intellect to their capabilities. Are you trying to say retarded people are really humans?\n \n \n Now that is about the most ludicrous thing you have said since the debate started.

I had an emachine a while back and put it's hard drive into my new computer, which I built on my own, so let's call it a NFORCE system. My computer is still an NFORCE system- it's not an emachine.

   "You use an excellent analogy; the computer. Let's say I have a PC and you have a Macintosh. Both computers are made completely differently. Mine has a PC NVIDIA ti 4200 graphics card, 3dfx soundcard, 512 MB RAM memory (PC133), while your Mac has different cards, different everything. If you switch hard drives, and you put the PC hard drive in the Mac, and the Mac hard drive in the PC, would the Mac with a PC hard drive be a Mac or a PC? It would be a Mac. I had an emachine a while back and put it's hard drive into my new computer, which I built on my own, so let's call it a NFORCE system. My computer is still an NFORCE system- it's not an emachine. Emachines are crappy computers and my computer is not crappy.\n\n \n The only reason that it will be a Mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain. You have to remember that the human mind is not just a hard drive. It is also the processor (brain) as well as the motherboard (connector of inputs and outputs) and the RAM (short term memory). There is nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four components. This is also the core of what determines if a computer is a Mac or a PC. If you take all these pieces from your PC and put them in a Mac then you have a PC. This is the case since you will be able to run PC-only applications and not Mac-only applications.",

No. It would be the same computer.\n\n \n The personality is in the memory of the hard drive but that personality is not controlled by the hard drive. The hard drive has no say at all on what happens. It remembers the personality but doesn't do anything else. The processor/user/conscious, whatever you want to call it, will make the decisions on what is done with the information of the hard drive.\n \n RAM is a notebook? OK, if the human body had a notebook what part of the human body would be the notebook? Clearly the mind. Anyways RAM is temporary storage while a notebook is more perminant. RAM is fast access while a notebook would be slow access in most cases. RAM requires little to process while reading from a notebook requires much.\n \n The motherboard is not a nervous system. The motherboard is the link between all the senses as well as the memory and the perhipherials. The nervous system is connected to the rest of the components (sight, memory, sound) by the motherboard of the mind. Can you provide any good example of how the motherboard is like the nervous system.\n \n The mind is the processor, hard drive, RAM, and motherboard plain and simple. As a computer geek I think you will have a hard time debating me in this as I do understand the purposes of these devices.\n \n If you try to replace a P3 with an AMD XP you will have no success. Pentium motherboards are different from AMD motherboards. Therefore trying to replace a P3 with an AMD of any kind will have limited success especially since the XP's run at much higher speeds than a P3. Basically you will have a dead computer and that is a big difference but if you were to get it to work you would have a much faster computer and it would gain a laundry list of advantages as well as disadvantages because of the change in processor brands.",

Yes, they are connected, yes they are interdependent- at a particular stage. \n \n For those who argued that unlike a liver, if you remove it the mother will not die- actually that is not true. \n \n I happen know a bit about pregnancy and birth. The placenta is attached to the womb and as we know feeds nutrients/blood, etc to the baby. Should the placenta disattach prematurely you have a medical emergency on your hands, as the fetus could die and the pregnant woman will hemmorage. This is because without the placenta, you have essentially open veins, the same way a dismembered arm would bleed, so does the uterus if the placenta disattaches prematurely. \n \n Hemmoraging after having birthed the baby occurs if the disattachment and expulsion of the placenta is incomplete.\n \n In order to understand the complexity of pregnancy and birth you have to be able to grasp dualities- pregnant woman and developing fetus are one but seperate.\n \n All this talk about whether a fetus is human makes no sense to me.

You're defining humanity by personhood. However, personhood does not define life. As stated before, if the fetus is a life, and not part of the mother, then it has to be something. It only can be a human being. Remember the theory of biogenesis? Dogs make Dogs; cats make cats; human reproduction only makes humans. It doesn't make a \"potential\" human, it makes a full-fledged human. \n\n \n Yes I am defining a human being by personhood because I'm saying a human being is more than a clump of cells with DNA. Now you might not agree that personhood defines a human being but that doesn't make you right, it just means we disagree.\n \n \nSo it's independent, meaning, the fetus is a different being? \n\n \n I'm not sure why we are repeating this over and over. It's a being but not a human being until it has brain waves in my opinion.\n \n \n\"fertilization\"=fusion of the DNA into the egg. \n\n \n No it's not the fusion of the DNA into the egg.

Conception is when the life began, but then they split later on. If a human were to split up and grow another human identical to it, when did it's life begin? I would assume it began at conception for the both of them, and later they split. I don't see where you're going with this though. \n\n \n I'm probably not more of a biology wiz than you. I did know that the split occurred after fertilization or I would not have posted it. The rest came from a simple net search.\n \n Well life began about 3.5 billion years ago. But we are talking about when a human being begins. If your body split and grew another body identical to you, then where was this other human all the time you were alive? And would you stay in the same body or move into the other body while this other being inhabited the original body? Are we in the twilight zone yet?\n \n \nAll of them do.

As well as the fact that we now realize that when the brain dies, the human dies, even though the other bodily functions may be fully operating. So before the brain starts functioning, it's just a collection of cells. You can call it anything you want to. In the English language we call it first a zygote, then an embryo.

No human fully thinks and feels the characteristics of a human being. But each human has the capacity to fully think and feel, and have the characteristics of a human being. The zygote is in a completely normal human stage of development. It thinks and feels like all humans it's age do- they don't. \n \n \n Okay I don't care what you call it, but let's take it back to the human being part. If your brain was transplanted into Steve's body, would the new person have your memory and your life experiences and your reasoning powers? For instance, you believe a human being begins at conception. If Steve believed a human being began at birth, would this \"new\" individual believe that a human began at conception or at birth?\n\n \n The mental person would be in Steve's body, the physical person in John's, and vice versa. However, the human being in Steve's body would be Steve, and the human being in John's body would be John.",

   "I&#8217;m sorry for repeating this over and over again, but I&#8217;m not sure if you understand it. Humans only reproduce human beings. We don&#8217;t produce non-humans through sexual intercourse. \n\n \n That&#8217;s right. And I understand that perfectly.\n \n \nSo if you weren&#8217;t a human, you were a &#8220;potential human&#8221;, right? But you were obviously alive, you were obviously something, so what is it? It has to be a species. I&#8217;m speaking scientifically here. \n\n \n I&#8217;m don&#8217;t know what you want. I said it is part of the human species. What are you asking for? To say it is a species is incorrect language because an individual is not a species. A species is the name of a GROUP of individuals. So an individual can not be a species since it is not a group. It is only a part of a group.\n \n \nBut they have to be part of a species, don&#8217;t they? Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genes, Species- don&#8217;t you remember that from biology? Homo Saepens is a species. What is this species? It is the human species. Remember, humans only make humans! \n\n \n Yes it is part of the human species. What else do you want me to say? Genes is not in the list you just gave.\n \n \nBecause that&#8217;s when the cell begins to grow. That&#8217;s when the cell has a complete genetic code. That&#8217;s when the cell is a human being. \n\n \n Well that is were we disagree about what a human being is. All cells have a complete genetic code except sperm and eggs. The cloned cell we have been discussing has a complete genetic code but it doesn&#8217;t start growing just because it has a complete genetic code.\n \n \nIt&#8217;s not that we can&#8217;t tell, it&#8217;s that they both have had the same past. They both are the same people- they just split up. If I were to get a stick, and break it in half, which stick was the original stick? They both were the original stick. \n\n \n Well a clone does not have the same past as the person it was cloned from. It will have a completely different life experence.\n \n \nSo? That&#8217;s not reason enough to call them a non-human. No human fully thinks and feels the characteristics of a human being. But each human has the capacity to fully think and feel, and have the characteristics of a human being. The zygote is in a completely normal human stage of development. It thinks and feels like all humans it&#8217;s age do- they don&#8217;t. \n\n \n It is enough reason for me and many other people agree. No human may fully think and feel, whatever you mean by that. But the have SOME thinking and feeling. The zygote has none. To say that something thinks and feels and then turn right around and say it doesn&#8217;t is an oxymoron. \n \n \nThe mental person would be in Steve&#8217;s body, the physical person in John&#8217;s, and vice versa. However, the human being in Steve&#8217;s body would be Steve, and the human being in John&#8217;s body would be John.\n\n \n You completely avoided my question so I&#8217;ll ask again. If your brain were transplanted into Steve&#8217;s body, would the new person have your memory and your life experiences and your reasoning powers? I was assuming the reason for a transplant was that John&#8217;s body was badly damaged and Steve&#8217;s body was brain dead but on a respirator to keep his body alive.

I have clearly stated what I think is required to be a human being and yes I believe a fetus is a human being.

I didn't debate with you because you started talking about computer technicalities, and I didn't see the link with the technicalities and abortion.\n \n \n \n The motherboard is the link between all the senses as well as the memory and the perhipherials.\n\n \n Yes! That's what the nervous system is!\n \n  Main Entry: nervous system\n Function: noun\n Date: 1740\n : the bodily system that in vertebrates is made up of the brain and spinal cord, nerves, ganglia, and parts of the receptor organs and that receives and interprets stimuli and transmits impulses to the effector organs -\n \n \nThe nervous system is connected to the rest of the components (sight, memory, sound) by the motherboard of the mind. Can you provide any good example of how the motherboard is like the nervous system.\n\n \n Yes, I can. The nervous system is what communicates with the brain to determine what the body's going to do. If I wanted to play a high-graphics game, my brain would tell my nervous system to double-click the mouse and open Doom 3, and the processor would tell the motherboard to use the video card's memory to play the game or what not. \n \n \n If you try to replace a P3 with an AMD XP you will have no success. Pentium motherboards are different from AMD motherboards.\n\n \n Example of computer-talk. Like this has anything to do with abortion?",

I seen that you were wrong and I called you on it. I'm sorry if this upsets you but I've had things I didn't understand and tried to make points on thrown back in my face too. It is part of the learning experience that you can either enjoy or dispise on these forums. I for one enjoy them.\n \n \nYes! That's what the nervous system is!\n \n  Main Entry: nervous system\n Function: noun\n Date: 1740\n : the bodily system that in vertebrates is made up of the brain and spinal cord, nerves, ganglia, and parts of the receptor organs and that receives and interprets stimuli and transmits impulses to the effector organs -\n\n \n Let me get this straight. You are debating that the nervous system, which includes the mind, is the motherboard. Let me simplify this for you. You do not need the entire nervous system when defining the motherboard of the human body. All you need is the mind and that alone. Can you give me one good reason why you would need the entire nervous system in order to create the inner workings of the motherboard for the human body? I sure cannot think of one. Discounting the mind the nervous system is a peripherial like a force feedback joystick. It does not facilitate any communication between different systems.\n \n \nYes, I can. The nervous system is what communicates with the brain to determine what the body's going to do. If I wanted to play a high-graphics game, my brain would tell my nervous system to double-click the mouse and open Doom 3, and the processor would tell the motherboard to use the video card's memory to play the game or what not. \n\n \n The nervous system does not communicate with the brain to determine anything. The nervous system communicates information to the brain and the brain determines what the body will do and then communicates information to the nervous system.\n \n To make this clearer ask what would happen if you just had a mind in a vat and nothing else. Would that mind still be a functioning system? As long as it is kept 'powered up' it would be able to function without the rest of the body. It would have no outputs or inputs other than what is self contained inside of it. What are those components? Well memory for one both short and long term. That would be hard drive and RAM. It would have a processor to compute with. All this would be linked together by the remainder of the mind which in turn means that the mind is the motherboard. Does this make sense?\n \n \nExample of computer-talk. Like this has anything to do with abortion?\n\n \n Sorry if I got too technical on you but you did not state a fact in your post. However this debate has everything to do with our computer analogy which has to do with our abortion debate and therefore is more than relavant. I was turned off by your assumption here that you could change the processor of the body without changing the motherboard. You can see where it would be impossible to do such as thing just as it is with computers. A motherboard is specially made to work with the type of processor that is put into the computer. I have serious doubts that you could take the processor of one mind and simply integrate it into another persons 'motherboard' and have no problem with it. For instance, lets say that my mind records the color red as binary code \"0010\" or whatever. That \"0010\" needs to be run through the compiler of my processor to be understood properly. If you stick in a type of processor that is foreign to mine you may risk not being able to understand what \"0010\" means. So basically \"0010\" on the hard drive means nothing without the proper processor to decode it. I think you will understand what I mean by this. Now extend that to the processor and motherboard. The processor will want to tell the motherboard that it sees the color red. It will have decoded the \"0010\" and now it is \"11011110001010\" and it sends a request for the motherboard to send the information to a certain component. The motherboard and processor have to be made to understand each other so if you were to put a processor with a motherboard that doesn't speak the same language basically you will have an end result of nothing getting completed correctly. You will have a failed connection between the motherboard and processor. I have no reason to believe this would be any less true with the human mind than it does with a computer, wouldn't you agree?\n \n I think the more important question here is does it even make sense that the processor of the mind would not be able to communicate with the motherboard. The processor wants to send out information and it needs a middle man to send it from one area to the next. So what can it send this information through to connect to lets say the eyes? The eyes are directly connected to the mind so all the processor has to do is tell the mind to route the information to the visual parts of the mind so that it could be perceived. It doesn't matter whether this information came from a memory or whether it came from the eyes or anything else. It would still be processed and routed into the mind without using any other medium. If you want to use the sense of touch as another example lets say that a finger feels a XXXXX. Information is sent up the spinal cord and to the brain where it is routed to the processor. The processor then evalutes it, asks for information from the hard drive or RAM as to what the information from the nervous system means, processes that, then routes information to the sensory parts of the mind as well as the nervous system control parts of the mind in order to get the necessary reaction from the nervous system. The information will then be processed into the short term RAM and the \"user\" (consciousness) will be able to see this information for themselves in extreme detail. At the same time the information to the nervous system will get routed from within the mind back down the spinal cord to result in the automated reaction of the finger pulling away from the location of the XXXXX.\n \n All the routing and connecting necessary to get the human body to work together is already done in the mind. The nervous system has hardwired links where once information is sent from the mind into the nervous system it is one it's way to the only location that it can possibly go. It is not redirected to another area after this point as there is nothing to tell the information to change directions once it has left the mind and been sent into the spinal cord. In this way I would say the nervous system is very much like a monitor in the way that output is handled. A bit of information is sent from the processor, through the motherboard, into the video card, and after that point it is told what pixel on the monitor it will affect and after that point it nothing can change where that information is going. It will inevitably hit the point on the monitor that it was intended to. This is because it is simply dumb circuitry once it leaves the confinds of the video card. The nervous system minus the mind is very much the same way. It is hardwired dumb circuitry that only does what it is told and only reports without any consideration as to what the reports mean.\n \n In short it is clear to me that the mind is the motherboard. The nervous system may include the mind in science but as far as it relating to a computer the nervous system is just cabling coming off of the motherboard. You can take all that cabling away and still have a functioning motherboard.\n \n \n BTW, thanks for continuing this debate but you still didn't respond to just this one little thing that I was especially looking for. You failed to defend your RAM assumption + personality - harddrive assumption which I responded to in post #100 so I was hoping that you could muster up the strength to either try debating that fact again or admit you were wrong about it.",

It&#8217;s still just one cell with DNA information. It doesn&#8217;t have any of the characteristics that I consider necessary to be a human being.\n \n \nBiogenesis states that humans reproduce other humans. They don&#8217;t produce non-humans, they produce humans. Hence, the zygote only can be a human being. You know perfectly what my question is, but you seem to be avoiding it. \n\n \n I am in no way avoiding it. I just don&#8217;t know what you want me to say. I know that humans reproduce humans. That doesn&#8217;t mean that a zygote is a human being. The only thing I know to say is what others have already said. An acorn is not a tree.

Take your time. At this time it is a hypothetical situation but it may not be for too long. However it&#8217;s the thought experiment that counts. We have come to the point in this debate where this question is relevant because it directly relates to what you call a human being. You are arguing that a human being is determined by a cell or a group of cells and has nothing to do with mind/personality/memory. If you are going to make that argument, you have to be able to tie down a definition of which cells make the human being when cells from different human beings become intermixed.\n \n \nWherever the guts go, it is. \n\n \n Well I&#8217;m sure you know where the next question is headed.

   "Well, if humans were conceived in such a fashion you'd probably have a good analogy.\n \n The DNA of a human embryo will lead any compentent scientist examining it to be able to tell that it's not a frog embyo, or a pine cone or what ever. It is unikely(sic) human.\n \n Excepting that it can't vote or choose Pepsi.\n\n \n Now really, montalban, I wasn't saying that a fetus is a pine cone. I was responding to Parcum's line of logic, which seems to go like this-\n -a zygote/embryo/fetus is a creature, not a part of either parent's body\n -it is neither sperm or egg\n -it has unique DNA\n -it must be a member of a species\n -there is no such thing as the species \"potential human\", and it is not a mineral, vegetable, dog, cat or trout, etc.\n -ergo it is human\n -ergo to kill a zygote/embryo/fetus is to kill a human, the equivalent and no different from killing an adult human\n \n Similarly, a pine nut, aside from tasting lovely with pesto pasta,\n -is not part of either \"parent\" tree's body\n -is neither pine pollen nor \"female\" pinecone\n -has unique DNA\n -is of the pinaceae family, genus pinus, etc. (is uniquely pine...)\n -ergo, by Parcum's logic it is a pine tree\n -ergo, by Parcum's logic to eat a pine nut is to cut down a pine tree\n \n The pine nut, like the fertilized egg sticking to the uterus, finds a place to \"root\" itself, then begins sprout and grow until it breaks through the soil (not unlike birth). Finding a precise point at which it becomes a pine tree is no easier than defining when a fetus becomes human. Nonetheless, the fact that it is obviously still pinaceae pinus etc., like how a fetus is still Homo Sapiens Sapiens, does not make it a pine tree.\n \n Whether or not a fetus is human is therefore irrelevant to the issue of abortion.\n \n BTW montalban, I think it's overboard to call Charchuk \"anti-religious\" because they found something that some religious groups do problematic.

For some reason Parcum feels it has tremendous importance so I just said okay let&#8217;s call it human while being careful to distinguish between what he wanted to define as human and what I considered a human being. I have also been careful to point out that the point where the developing human becomes a human being can not be scientifically determined since people can not agree on what constitutes a human being. Many people believe it begins at conception because that is when the genetics is determined.

   "BAh!! I thought I already replied to this post, but either it got deleted or I forgot to post it yesterday!\n \n AMD, I'm not going to read your entire post. Since you seem to know more abut computers then I (I've only built a computer once), I'll assume your points are correct. However, I will address your thesis, and this goes for Hank as well. I believe that my first approach to debating is not working, so I'm going for what I call debate B. I'm also going to add in a few things from debate C, which is basically a list of random quotes from medical embryology books. \n \n Hank, I'm sick of quoting, so I'm simply going to debate with you essay-style. \n \n Your thesis is as follows:\n \n The fetus prior to the first trimester is not a person because it does not think. Therefore, it is not a human person (It est, human being), and it is OK to kill it.\n \n We must first address a few points.\n \n A) The zygote is human.\n B) The zygote is alive\n C) The zygote is not part of the mother\n \n Keep this in mind. What is important to know is that there is no defining point of when the brain begins to function. Sure, the brain has brainwaves, but that doesn't mean much. The life before brainwaves isn't \"brain dead\", is it? Some scientists even say conciousness continues after the brain is dead. It is ridiculous to believe that brainwaves are the defining point of human life. As a matter of fact, quite a few parts of the brain do not become functional until sometime after birth to adolescence. There is no defining period where the brain suddenly begins to work. We also must remember that brain development is controlled by the DNA, so DNA is definitely a defining matter in the argument of personhood. To attack a possible argument before it is made, what is a personality? \"Personhood\" is when we have a history of performing personal acts. Hence, the early unborn isn't a person (a being). Fetuses who are born in comas are then not humans are they?\n \n By the way, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, 80% of abortions happen after brain waves are made. \n \n Back to points A, B, and C, I will say a few things. A is true. The fetus is part of the homo sapiens species. B is also true. The zygote is a life, as it is growing on it's own (it doesn't even connected or get any nourishment from the mother until implantation! Not to mention, it metabolizes, has the capability to reproduce, grows, and stimulates, which is the biological criteria for life. You can find it in any high school college text book. My BYU textbooks says: \n \n \n In order to study biology (the study of living things) accurately, we must first understand what the term \"living things\" includes. If an object does not have the following five abilities then it is not considered a living thing:\n 1. Reproduce \n 2. Respond to the environment \n 3. Be made of cells \n 4. Grow and develop \n 5. Obtain and use energy \n \n\n \n So obviously, it's a life, and human, which makes it a human life, a human being. \n \n AMD, Hank, when do you believe human life begins (that is, human-being-life)?\n \n Hank, an Acorn is not a tree, but it is an oak. Both the Acorn and Oak Tree are Oaks.\n \n \n Like someone else has already asked, where is the dividing line between how much of the guts it takes to make the change over?\n\n \n I need more thinking time. :-)",

I have two premises. The first premis is that the fetus is biologically human. Let me address your points on the matter.\n \n A) The zygote/embryo/fetus is not part of the parent's body because it is simply impossible. The mother cannot have four arms, four legs, two different genetic codes, two different blood types, two different brains, two different hearts, two different sexes, et cetera. \n B) The zygote/embryo/fetus is NOT like the sperm or egg, because the sperm and egg is part of the father/mother, and has only half a genetic code. \n C) Most people have unique genetic codes, with the exception of clones and twins.\n D) It HAS to be a member of a species if it is a life. \n E) This was completely wrong. I said that the fetus therefore is not a potential human, but has to be a potential human because of biogenesis. Biogenesis says that all life comes from preexisting life, and all life reproduces after it's own kind. \n F) Hence, the only possibility is that the zygote/embryo/fetus is a human being.\n G) Hence, the killing of a zygote/embryo/fetus is murder.\n \n \n Similarly, a pine nut, aside from tasting lovely with pesto pasta,\n -is not part of either \"parent\" tree's body\n -is neither pine pollen nor \"female\" pinecone\n -has unique DNA\n -is of the pinaceae family, genus pinus, etc. (is uniquely pine...)\n -ergo, by Parcum's logic it is a pine tree\n -ergo, by Parcum's logic to eat a pine nut is to cut down a pine tree\n\n \n Here, you're misunderstanding my premises. The pine nut is not a pine tree, but both are pines.

Does that clarify my belief?\n\n \n The problem is, Hank, that bran waves isn't when the mind begins. There is no sudden beginning of the mind; it slowly comes together during the fetal age. In fact, the brain's development is completely dependent on it's genetic code. Hence, the genetic code is the definer of human life.",

Since people do not agree on when a human being begins, and science can not tell us when a human being begins, a definite determination of when a human being begins can not be tied down.

   "AMD, I'm not going to read your entire post. Since you seem to know more abut computers then I (I've only built a computer once), I'll assume your points are correct. However, I will address your thesis, and this goes for Hank as well. I believe that my first approach to debating is not working, so I'm going for what I call debate B. I'm also going to add in a few things from debate C, which is basically a list of random quotes from medical embryology books. \n \n Hank, I'm sick of quoting, so I'm simply going to debate with you essay-style. \n \n Your thesis is as follows:\n \n The fetus prior to the first trimester is not a person because it does not think. Therefore, it is not a human person (It est, human being), and it is OK to kill it.\n \n We must first address a few points.\n \n A) The zygote is human.\n B) The zygote is alive\n C) The zygote is not part of the mother\n \n Keep this in mind. What is important to know is that there is no defining point of when the brain begins to function. Sure, the brain has brainwaves, but that doesn't mean much. The life before brainwaves isn't \"brain dead\", is it?\n\n I don't see anything any different in what you are arguing now than what you have argued before. Something can't be dead before it exist. \n \nSome scientists even say conciousness continues after the brain is dead.\n\n That may be true but it has nothing to do with science so the belief of scientists in that area have no more validity than any one else.\n \n It is ridiculous to believe that brainwaves are the defining point of human life. As a matter of fact, quite a few parts of the brain do not become functional until sometime after birth to adolescence. There is no defining period where the brain suddenly begins to work.\n\n You saying it is ridiculous does not make it ridiculous. I believe it is the defining period when the mind begins to work.\n \n We also must remember that brain development is controlled by the DNA, so DNA is definitely a defining matter in the argument of personhood. To attack a possible argument before it is made, what is a personality? \"Personhood\" is when we have a history of performing personal acts. Hence, the early unborn isn't a person (a being). Fetuses who are born in comas are then not humans are they?\n\n You are the one that keeps bring up personhood. I don't even know what that means. I have tried to tie that in to when brainwaves start. If you are going to now define personhood as something else, then some of my previous statements won't be correct with that concept of personhood.\n \nBy the way, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, 80% of abortions happen after brain waves are made. \n\n That has nothing to do with when a human being begins.\n \n \nBack to points A, B, and C, I will say a few things. A is true. The fetus is part of the homo sapiens species. B is also true. The zygote is a life, as it is growing on it's own (it doesn't even connected or get any nourishment from the mother until implantation! Not to mention, it metabolizes, has the capability to reproduce, grows, and stimulates, which is the biological criteria for life. You can find it in any high school college text book. My BYU textbooks says: \n Quote: \n \n In order to study biology (the study of living things) accurately, we must first understand what the term \"living things\" includes. If an object does not have the following five abilities then it is not considered a living thing:\n 1. Reproduce \n 2. Respond to the environment \n 3. Be made of cells \n 4. Grow and develop \n 5. Obtain and use energy \n \n \n So obviously, it's a life, and human, which makes it a human life, a human being. \n\n \n You have already said those things numerous times. I still don't agree with your conclusions.\n \n \nAMD, Hank, when do you believe human life begins (that is, human-being-life)?\n\n \n If you don't know when I think a human being begins, I'm going to take back those things I said about you being intelligent. :)\n \n \nHank, an Acorn is not a tree, but it is an oak. Both the Acorn and Oak Tree are Oaks. \n\n \n I think when people talk about an oak, they are talking about a tree. \n \n \nI need more thinking time. :-)\n\n \n Okay but it is very pertinent to the debate.",

I believe it is the defining period when the mind begins to work.\n\n \n But it doesn't all of a sudden start to work! It takes years for the brain to function. Do you think the fetus just all of a sudden wakes up and say \"Oh, what a nice world!\"?\n \n \n You are the one that keeps bring up personhood. I don't even know what that means. I have tried to tie that in to when brainwaves start. If you are going to now define personhood as something else, then some of my previous statements won't be correct with that concept of personhood.\n\n \n \"Personhood\" is what is defined as having personal abilities. If you are a person, you are a being. Hence, we are human beings because we are persons.

As stated, brain waves mean nothing. You still don't think when you have brain waves. That just means there is some brain activity. It's nothing more. And brian waves don't suddenly begin, as I've said before. DNA controls the brain. Hence, DNA defines human life- both mentally and biologically.\n \n \n I think when people talk about an oak, they are talking about a tree.\n\n \n Of course, but that doesn't mean anything. As stated earlier, a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, but they are both the same species. \n \n \n Okay but it is very pertinent to the debate.\n\n \n Of course it is. I'm not going to ignore it.

If you are uncomfortable with something, perhaps you should check into why? Perhaps delving into the pro-choice sites and see what they say instead of arguing against prolifers? Just an idea :) Abortion providers don't only care about women and when brainwaves start (as some may say), they publicly advertise abortions up to 21 weeks in phone books and do later abortions.

   "Yup, I know that. Science is getting better and better. We have ultrasounds even, now, and we didn't always have them. It'll be known to all sooner or later when life begins. \n\n \n There&#8217;s a lot of evidence that life began about 3.5 billion years ago.

My upbringing and culture has taught me that it is immoral to kill human beings.\n \n \n Perhaps delving into the pro-choice sites and see what they say instead of arguing against prolifers? Just an idea Abortion providers don't only care about women and when brainwaves start (as some may say), they publicly advertise abortions up to 21 weeks in phone books and do later abortions. I think the reasons they keep on going with later abortions gives excellent reason to check into whether they really care about the women and their situations, or if they have other things on their minds too. Yeah, this isn't exactly on the brainwave subject, but I felt like replying on what you said above \n\n \n I&#8217;m arguing against the dogmatic view that some people have the answer and everyone that doesn&#8217;t agree with them is wrong.\n \n \nOh, I have talked to quite a few women who've had abortions, and I never said that they didn't have hard situations.

   "I&#8217;m just recapping my argument. \n\n \n Well you said you were going for debate B. Why are you recapping? Is there something you think I don&#8217;t understand about your argument?\n \n \nBut it doesn&#8217;t all of a sudden start to work! It takes years for the brain to function. Do you think the fetus just all of a sudden wakes up and say &#8220;Oh, what a nice world!&#8221;? \n\n \n Of course it does start working. When brain waves start. It doesn&#8217;t suddenly become 20 years old but it does start. I could say the same thing about your argument. A zygote doesn&#8217;t just all of a sudden wake up and say &#8220;Oh, what a nice world!&#8221; It&#8217;s just the beginning of the physical part of an individual.\n \n \n &#8220;Personhood&#8221; is what is defined as having personal abilities. If you are a person, you are a being. Hence, we are human beings because we are persons. Person and Beings are synonyms. \n\n \n Well maybe it is but the first time I saw you use it I tried to find it in a dictionary and couldn&#8217;t. So I tried to deduce what you meant by the word from your post.\n \n \nI never said it did, did I? \n\n \n Then why bring it into the debate?\n \n \nBut it&#8217;s fact! You can&#8217;t just say &#8220;Oh I don&#8217;t agree with science&#8221;! Don&#8217;t just say &#8220;I disagree&#8221;, give me something to work with. \n\n \n I&#8217;m getting bored with this same thing over and over. You continue to state A, B, and C are true, therefore D is true. Then you point out that A, B, and C are scientific facts so you are arguing scientifically. I know exactly what you are saying but when you make the jump that therefore D is true, that&#8217;s where it falls apart. Just because all horses have 4 legs and all rabbits have four legs, doesn&#8217;t mean that horses are rabbits.\n \n \nI was assuming that you would change your view at this point. As stated, brain waves mean nothing. You still don&#8217;t think when you have brain waves. That just means there is some brain activity. It&#8217;s nothing more. And brian waves don&#8217;t suddenly begin, as I&#8217;ve said before. DNA controls the brain. Hence, DNA defines human life- both mentally and biologically. \n\n \n For some reason you continue to think that because you state something, that makes it true. And I&#8217;m talking about the mind, not the brain. \n \n \nOf course, but that doesn&#8217;t mean anything. As stated earlier, a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, but they are both the same species. \n\n \n And as I stated earlier, I&#8217;m not talking about the word species, I&#8217;m talking about when a human being starts.\n \n \nOf course it is. I&#8217;m not going to ignore it. However, since it such a hypothetical situation, and science has never dealt with it, you can&#8217;t expect me to come up with a good answer.\n\n \n You are debating that human beings start and are determined by the physical only. I am saying that I believe that human beings are more than the physical. I believe that they are determined by a mind and spirit. That the body is simply a device that houses the mind and spirit. Now if human beings are just physical, and parts of that physical body can be replaced, that means you are going to have to come up with just what part of that physical body determines the human being. The only &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; as you call it is the brain transplant and that is being worked on and tested in animals now. So a lot of scientist think it is only a matter of time before that happens. I don&#8217;t know if you can come up with a good answer or not but if you can&#8217;t come up with a good answer, your argument falls apart. You have already stated that if you replace the &#8220;guts&#8221; of a computer it&#8217;s now the computer with the &#8220;guts&#8221; and you have said that a computer is an excellent analogy. So at some point computer A becomes computer B according to you. So what is it that you replace in Steve that makes him John?\n \n Do you go to BYU?",

Something that is routine for the most part.\n\n \n Is that all you have? Oh comon, a 3 year old could come up with something more elaborate and articulate than that. I thought my immaturity was showing in my post; thanks for topping me. \n \n Secondly, The pictures are not altered. You're right though, pulling legs and arms off are \"just routine for the most part.\" What about the consequences to some of the parents? Some go sterile, and others have major health problems. If you're going to say something, at least make it worth while.\n \n You know as anyone else does (and it scares some and worries others); that the \"fetus\" is a baby, and it's being killed. You know this, but you refuse to admit it. You think, \"yeah, if a fish is a baby.\" Just keep thinking that; you'll never fully believe it. \n \n Lastly, a Corporation is considered a human being, but the human being inside of a woman isn't? Hypocritical, don't you think? Also, this will all come around in the end. You see, eventually this will all lead to killing the elderly, because they are of no use to us. Then all of the people who have had abortions... well let us just say it will be poetic justice.\n \n I beg once again to all pro-choicers to look at your child (if you have one). Look at him/her and say, \"could I have killed him/her?\" If you don't have a child, just go out to *anywhere* and watch a little 2 year old run around with that funny waddle they all seem to have... You would have made them not exist. Think about it like that. It being a child or not is not truly the issue. The issue is what that \"fetus (unborn child)\" becomes... it becomes a little waddling 2 year old... it becomes your son or daughter... it becomes something precious... or would have, if you hadn't stopped it from happening.\n \n \n What good would a hunger strike do to stop abortion?

I can just as easily say that if I transplanted piece by piece of the brain into Steve's body, and ask \"At what point does Steve become Bob?\" We don't know. I certainly don't know. Do you know? You could say that when the brain is mostly or half Bob's, it's part of Bob. You can also say when the body is half or mostly Bob's, it's Bob. But there's no evidence for those conclusions.

   "The pine nut is not a pine tree, but both are pines. It est, an acorn isn't an oak tree, but both the oak tree and acorn are oaks.\n\n \nOf course, but that doesn't mean anything. As stated earlier, a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, but they are both the same species. \n\n \n Yes, but the question is, so what? The fact that a caterpillar is of a butterfly species, a pine nut is of a pine tree species, or a fetus is of the human species is irrelevant. A fetus is a fetus, it is not yet an organism able to survive on it's own being physically seperate from the womb. A pine nut is not a pine tree, a fetus is not a grown human, so if you eat a pine nut you are not chopping down a tree and if you kill a fetus you are killing a fetus. Argue to me why we shouldn't be killing fetuses, but don't ask for people to suspend their ability to discern the difference between an embryo and a baby.\n \n \nF) Hence, the only possibility is that the zygote/embryo/fetus is a human being.\n G) Hence, the killing of a zygote/embryo/fetus is murder.\n\n \n When you say murder, do you mean in a legal sense? Because killing any other human wouldn't necessarily be considered murder, so why would it be any different for a fetus?\n \n Just because something is human doesn't mean it is wrong to kill it. That doesn't make sense as a moral code- anything can be killed, animal, vegetable or mineral can be destroyed, as long as it isn't like us? \n \n \nIf you are asking my opinion, I believe all abortions are wrong in the sense that it goes against nature. But then I'm also weird enough to believe that birth control and modern health care is against nature and is also wrong.\n\n I don't want to get sidetracked, but whoa!\n \n I guess I don't get this at all- animals self-medicate with herbs, and people have been using herbal emmenagogues and abortificients for as long as we've cultivated plants. So sure, modern health care sucks, but linking birth control, one of the first things people used herbs for, with CAT scans is a little confused, in my book. \n \n \n...Mother THeresa are all pro-life?\n\n \n Er, yeah, it figures you'd love Mother Theresa. When handed the Nobel Peace Prize, she commented that the biggest threat to world peace was abortion, and has said that contraception is the same thing as abortion. She also took all the money people sent her to help the poor of Calcutta and used it to convert people to Catholicism, her \"clinics\" were just places people went to die. When she got sick, she was flown to a Californian private clinic. Yet, she insisted that poverty and misery were gifts from god. \n \n Great spokesmodel. Did I mention she also liked to hang out with dictators?\n \n \nWhy is it irrelevant? Because you say so. \n\n Or maybe because it's the woman that has to go through it, either way. I think you'd object to other people making difficult life decisions for you, since you're the one who has to live with the consequences, which in this case involves a potential child's life.\n \n \nAre you a woman? If not, then your opinion on this issue is irrelevant also!\n\n Charchuk said \"the woman\", implying that it is the person carrying the pregnancy who gets to decide what happens in her womb.",

   "Firstly, it is also a moral term, and instinctual. In the bible, the fifth (?) commandment is \"thou shall not murder\". If a bear eats me, he's not guilty of murder; he's guilty of being hungry and killing prey.\n\n \n Sixth commandment.\n \n In the original Hebrew version it is thou shall not murder to an Israelite. Killing a gentile was not considered to be murder.\n \n http://www.dutchpal.com/yuddha/shalt.htm\n \n In the Christian version it is kill, not murder , and that is what Christians are taught.\n \n \nYes, there is murder in nature. Humans instinctually know killing another human is wrong.\n\n \n We do? Gee, I guess that all of those wars didn't happen either.\n \n \nSo a Caterpillar is a monarch, but not a monarch being?\n\n \n Different concept.\n \n \nSo, in 1950, a 6-month-old fetus was not human, but now it is human? What lunacy!\n\n \n Your head must be quite thick. We keep telling you and telling you that we never said that it wasn't human, only that it isn't a human being. A person.\n \n \nI wouldn't say the USSR was a third world country 30 years before it fell. It was always a third world country, from its conception!\n\n \n What I meant was that it really wasn't the threat that the USA had made it out during that finally period. Yes, it had nukes, but not nearly as we were lead to believe.\n \n \nIt was always collapsing! However, it was still a powerful nation because of its nuclear power. Hence, nobody wanted to mess with it.\n\n \n You seem to not know what sort of society it was even right up to the start of the 20th century. It had been a feudal society right up to the Revolution and only really entered the Industral Revolution after the Communists took over. From what I've seen any system except what they had for centuries was doomed to failure from the start. Even democracy and capitalism will fail. As my father would say, a peasant will always be a peasant. His parents were weathy land owners in the Ukraine and left with him as the Soviets were invading.\n \n \nHowever, Pope John Paul II, Polish nationalist, had phone conversations with the USSR President (and of course they wouldn't kill the Pope), and Reagan had introduced the missile defense program. The time was perfect to collapse the USSR, and eventually, with the help of people like Gorbechev, it did. Reagan and Pope John Paul II will always be the duo who collapsed communism in Europe.\n\n \n The collapse started before that in Eastern Europe when people begin to stream out and one by one the Eastern Block countries fell. Gorbechev, himself quite moderate, could see the writting on the wall. Reagan only took advantage of the situation.",

   " In the Christian version it is kill, not murder , and that is what Christians are taught.\n\n \n That's irrelivent. The Hebrew translation was simple \"thou shall not murder\". Yes, the Hebrews thought I was OK to kill a Gentile, but that didn't change the translation. Christians took that commandment and follow it. It is thou shall not murder. Jesus never said \"thou shall not kill\". \n \n \n We do? Gee, I guess that all of those wars didn't happen either.\n\n \n Wars and murder are two completely different things, Charedcock. \n \n \n Different concept.\n\n \n Actually, it isn't. A caterpillar is a Butterfly in a larvae, or fetal stage. \n \n \n Your head must be quite thick. We keep telling you and telling you that we never said that it wasn't human, only that it isn't a human being. A person.\n\n \n It is a person! It has personal characteristics- a DNA is a personal characteristic. If you say because it's not a person it's OK to kill it, you're saying that we can kill people in comas or people who are asleep. Going back to the subject, so you're agreeing that in 1950 any 6-month-old fetus wasn't human, but nowadays, since it's very possible for a 6-month-old fetus to survive outside of the womb, the 6-month-fetus is human?\n \n \n What I meant was that it really wasn't the threat that the USA had made it out during that finally period. Yes, it had nukes, but not nearly as we were lead to believe.\n\n \n Russia had nuclear power that was very great. Ours wasn't greater until later. But at any rate, they still had nuclear bombs, and nukes were still a threat. They could have easily defended the USSR by using their nuclear power. \n \n \n You seem to not know what sort of society it was even right up to the start of the 20th century. It had been a feudal society right up to the Revolution and only really entered the Industral Revolution after the Communists took over. From what I've seen any system except what they had for centuries was doomed to failure from the start. Even democracy and capitalism will fail. As my father would say, a peasant will always be a peasant. His parents were weathy land owners in the Ukraine and left with him as the Soviets were invading.\n\n \n Communism in Russia was always falling though. With democracy, our failures and rebirths of the economy went up and down. However, with Communism, it started falling from the beginning. Lenin and Stalin both tried their 5-year-plans, but they all failed and caused the killing of 25 million people. I understand what was going on in Russia at that time very well! Sure, democracy and capitalism in America will probably fail eventually, but the USSR was always economically and governmentally always in decline. \n \n \n The collapse started before that in Eastern Europe when people begin to stream out and one by one the Eastern Block countries fell. Gorbechev, himself quite moderate, could see the writting on the wall. Reagan only took advantage of the situation.\n\n \n I could just as easily say that Gorbechev took advantage of the situation as well. Do I honestly know? Of course not. Did Reagan? We can never know. However, if it wasn't for Reagan and Pope John Paul II communism would still be around today. Reagan built the missile defense program, supported the eastern European nations, and condemned the leaders of the USSR. Pope John Paul II promoted peace among it, and talked to the leaders of the USSR to convince them to back out. \n \n \n Why are we discussing this is an abortion topic?",

I certainly don&#8217;t know. Do you know? You could say that when the brain is mostly or half Bob&#8217;s, it&#8217;s part of Bob. You can also say when the body is half or mostly Bob&#8217;s, it&#8217;s Bob. But there&#8217;s no evidence for those conclusions. You could argue when certain body parts or certain brain parts are in the body, but again, there&#8217;s no evidence. \n\n \n Okay then you are agreeing that at some point John becomes Steve.

Biologically speaking, there is no point when the mind, let alone the brain, suddenly functions.\n\n \n We disagree on that. I believe the mind starts when brain waves start.\n \n Okay a few more questions to clarify what you believe.\n \n Are you saying that a human is only physical? If not, what else determines a human being?\n \n Exactly what part of the fertilized egg makes a human?

LOL\n \n \nI find it interesting that you and Charchuk argue so much for abortion, and yet, neither of you really like the idea of abortion. I have problems with abortion, so I'm prolife. I agree that especially in the first couple months of a pregnancy, what I call a baby doesn't look very recognizable. But a life started either way, and even if it doesn't have brainwaves, to take away the life is something I can't abide with very well. \n\n \n The debate between Parcum and I started on another thread and he asked that it be moved to this thread because it would keep him from replying to two different threads. If you will look carefully at everything I have posted, I don't think I have said anything about abortions except what I have talked to you about. And that was to say I was opposed to them.

I don't understand why people find this confusing. \n \n \nShe is affecting other people with her decision.\n\n \n Fine. Except that the other creature isn't yet able to make decisions. As you say, it doesn't have a voice. So the pregnant woman makes the decision, because she's the one who has to live with either path. Not the father, who does not carry the baby, and probably won't be the primary caregiver. Not you, or your Church. \n \n If she happens to have bad judgement, she might make a bad decision. That's terrible. It's also part of life. Deal.\n \n By the way, if you are so concerned with the fact that fetuses and embryos are humans exactly like born humans, why aren't you equally insistant about health care for the unborn? After all, some half of all pregnancies don't last the first few weeks. Shouldn't these embryos be receiving medical care to prevent their death, like a newborn baby would?\n \n \nI'll just say that I am talking about modern medicine creating a defective breed of humans and leave it at that.\n\n \n That's an awfully loaded thing to \"just say\". \n \n \nFirstly, according to your own argument, you as a man, have no right to comment on this issue. \n\n \n There's a difference between a) having an opinion and b) telling other people what to do and working to put in place laws to prevent them from having access to health care.\n \n \n'It' continues to be so dependant for several years.\n\n \n Actually, part of the birth process is the expulsion of the placenta, after which the infant is able to breathe on their own, and digests for themself for the first time.

Yes, I suppose.\n\n \n The current Pope has often supported dictators and openly opposed democratic leadership. Nicaragua is just an example I know of personally so it comes directly to mind, but there are others. Shall I list them?\n \n \nYes, there is murder in nature. Humans instinctually know killing another human is wrong.\n\n \n It is a moral dilemma to kill a human, as it should be to kill any creature. That doesn't make it unilaterally wrong. Humans will \"instinctively\" kill other humans in certain circumstances. \n \n \nA caterpillar is a Butterfly in a larvae, or fetal stage.\n\n \n So if you smush a caterpillar, are you killing a butterfly? \n \n \nThe United Kingdom has found the ability to grow embryos in artificial wombs.

   " Parcum has argued this before quite well, if the unborn is part of the woman, she has two brains, two heads, four arms, may have 2 different blood types, and so on.\n\n \n \n Well, it's more like she has a fetus growing in her uterus. I don't understand why people find this confusing.\n\n \n You are confused. It is growing in her, and it will grow arms and legs. If it is a mere extension of her, then you are saying she has four arms, four legs etc. But it isn't her. It's a being within her.\n \n \n She is affecting other people with her decision.\n\n \n \n Fine. Except that the other creature isn't yet able to make decisions. As you say, it doesn't have a voice.\n\n \n Yes, and people with mental and learning problems also don't always have a voice either. Should we discard them? Or, if they're still living at home leave all decisions up to the parents? After all, they're still 'dependant' which seems to you a rather demeaning and dehumanising state.\n \n \nSo the pregnant woman makes the decision, because she's the one who has to live with either path. Not the father, who does not carry the baby, and probably won't be the primary caregiver. Not you, or your Church. \n\n \n Indeed the woman makes the decision. That is the problem. It negates the rights of all other parties, the father, the unborn, society as a whole.\n \n How do you know the mother will be the 'primary care-giver'? It's nice to see you using these terms that lessen the role of all other parties except the mother. In the nuclear house-hold (which seems to be the model of family you are using), while the husband is away earning a living, a necessary task, he is sacrificing time he'd probably rather spend with his family.\n \n \n If she happens to have bad judgement, she might make a bad decision. That's terrible. It's also part of life. Deal.\n\n \n So, you're now excusing bad judgment. I'll make a mental note of that and bring it up again next time you have a go at the Church. It would also be an interesting defence in a murder trial...\n Mizmaxx: \"I'm sorry you're honour... I shot to death the wrong person\"\n Judge: \"Oh, that's okay, everyone makes errors of judgment. Case dismissed.\"\n \n The problem is she's making a decision and you're giving her wrong information. You're there saying \"It's okay to kill it, it's just like removing an appendix\"\n \n \n By the way, if you are so concerned with the fact that fetuses and embryos are humans exactly like born humans, why aren't you equally insistant about health care for the unborn? After all, some half of all pregnancies don't last the first few weeks. Shouldn't these embryos be receiving medical care to prevent their death, like a newborn baby would?\n\n \n I am concerned with the state of health and welfare of all humans. You have categorised people into sub-people, and people. Even delineated family along traditional lines with your 'primary care giver' labels. Where did you pick-up any notion that I'm not concerned about other young humans?\n \n \n Firstly, according to your own argument, you as a man, have no right to comment on this issue. \n\n \n \n There's a difference between a) having an opinion and b) telling other people what to do and working to put in place laws to prevent them from having access to health care.\n\n \n Yes, but he's telling other men that they have no right to give his opinion. That is his opinion. It is his opinion that men shouldn't give their opinion. He is a man, therefore the opinion that he can't give his opinion is, in his opinion worthless. It's not a paradox I created.\n \n \n 'It' continues to be so dependant for several years.\n\n \n \n Actually, part of the birth process is the expulsion of the placenta, after which the infant is able to breathe on their own, and digests for themself for the first time. This is a very specific type of dependance. Is this news to you?\n\n \n No. Is parenting a child news to you? The baby relies on its parent(s) for some time after it is born. The baby might be dependant for years, as I suggested. Or, do you think we're like snakes who just give birth, then leave our offspring to fend for themselves. Dependency exists before and after birth. You seem to believe that because it exists before birth that lessens the child in human terms. What about handicapped people? Are they less human?\n \n This is what the Nazis did. They categorised people, and divided them into those of use, and those not.",

The reality for most women is that they will get little or no support in the care of this child once born, not to mention the fact that they are the only one who can carry it for the next few months.\n \n \nSo, you're now excusing bad judgment. \n\n \n I believe I said it was terrible. I don't think that is excusing it. Lots of terrible things happen in the world, and I prefer to worry about the things I can control. For example, I actively work to create a world which would make it easier to raise a child. I probably will prevent more abortions than people outside clinics harrassing women with posters of dead fetuses.\n \n \nYou're there saying \"It's okay to kill it, it's just like removing an appendix\"\n\n \n I don't think I ever said that. You are assuming, and you happen to be incorrect. I have supported several people going through the decision of whether or not to abort. I would certainly never say that it is \"just like removing an appendix\". I supported both the women and the men involved by the way, and I found that there was a lack of resources to support both people emotionally. I know certain people have the opinion that it is a \"simple medical procedure\" and that is all, but I disagree. \n \n So you are wrong to assume that I would tell someone it is simple and easy.

The baby relies on its parent(s) for some time after it is born.\n\n \n As I said, this is not the same kind of dependance as a fetus. The baby relies on someone feeding it though it's own mouth and digestive system, the fetus relies on the nutrients directly from the pregnant woman's body.\n \n \nThis is what the Nazis did. They categorised people, and divided them into those of use, and those not.\n\n \n I'm not deciding which fetuses should live, or that fetuses should unilaterally be aborted. The metaphor doesn't stand.\n \n \nI am concerned with the state of health and welfare of all humans. \n\n \n So, what are your suggestions for prevention of embryonic death?

   " I was responding to Parcum and we have been having this conversation for a while. We have already discussed this and agreed that neither of us know of a case where someone has been brought back to life after being declared brain dead based on the accepted test that doctors use to determine if someone is brain dead. This includes more than just testing for brain waves.\n\n \n Actually there are stories of being having near death experiences and their brain waves had ceased to exist for a while. \n \n \n An article from november 2001 written by Christopher Hitchens, the author of a book on Mother Theresa. He was also asked to give testimony on the subject of her sainthood for the Roman Catholic Church. Are you questioning the RCC's judgement of his scolarity?\n\n \n Give me the actual source. I don't know how much of it you're creative mind is inventing. \n \n \n Okay I will do this one more time and then that's it. I believe that a human being begins when brain waves start. Before that, it is a group of cells that has human DNA and is developing into a human being. It is dependent on the mother for substance. This is as clear an affirmation of my beliefs as is possible. And I have said that from the very beginning.\n\n \n Is it independent from the mother? Is it a life? \n \n \n The brain is physical. Are you saying it is physical plus something else? If so, what is the something else?\n\n \n My definition of brain means the mind. \n \n \n Call it anything you want to. If a scientist takes the DNA from a sperm and splices it into the DNA of an egg, would you say that is a human being?\n\n \n Naturally. Automatically this zygote will begin to grow. But enough of your hypothetical questions. \n \n \n So it has nothing to do with the material in the egg that is supporting the DNA?\n\n \n I'm sorry? Please be more explicit. \n \n \n Does anyone with an IQ in the double digits believe that the fetus is not attached to the mother? It's called an umbilical chord. I didn't change anything, I just made a statement.\n\n \n Of course it's \"attached\" to the mother, but it's not an organ. An organ is something useful to the mother; the fetus isn't useful. It's a parasite. \n \n \n There is no scientific fact of when a fertilized egg becomes a human being. If that was true, we wouldn't be having this debate and the Supreme Court would not have made the ruling it did and all scientist would agree about when a fertilized egg becomes a human being. I have repeated this many times. You just state some facts, then say \"see, that proves me right\". And this is just not true. All horses have four legs. All rabbits have four legs. Both those statements are facts. The statement that all horses are rabbits is not a fact. And this is what you are doing and trying to pass it off as scientific.\n\n \n The Supreme Court has made pleanty of laws that are unscientific. They said that blacks weer 3/4 human; they said that the fetus isn't human. They're not exactly the most trustful people. Yes, there is scientific fact that the fetus becomes human. I will shortly show you sources. My argument isn't that all horses are rabbits, my argument goes like this:\n \n The fetus is a living thing.\n \n The fetus is a human.\n \n Therefore, the fetus is a human being.\n \n It's not A=B, B=C, A=C, or A=B, and C=D, A=D, it's A+B=AB. It's very simple. \n \n  \"In this text, we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes, which will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual. ... Fertilization takes place in the oviduct ... resulting in the formation of a zygote containing a single diploid nucleus. Embryonic development is considered to begin at this point... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.\" \n  Larsen, W.J. 1998. Essentials of Human Embryology, Churchill Livingstone, New York, pp. 1-17. \n \n  \"Fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... Fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... The zygote ... is a unicellular embryo... \"The ill-defined and inaccurate term pre-embryo, which includes the embryonic disc, is said either to end with the appearance of the primitive streak or ... to include neurulation. The term is not used in this book.\" (p. 55).\" \n  O'Rahilly, R. and F. Muller. 1996. Human Embryology & Teratology, Wiley-Liss, New York, pp. 5-55.\n \n \"Zygote: this cell results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo). Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.\" \n  Moore, K. and T.V.N. Persaud. 1998. The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology (6th ed.), W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, pp 2-18. \n \n Obviously, there is scientific facts that the fetus is human. Even Embryologists are teaching it!",

Many do. For those who cannot communicate at all, people do the best they can to make certain decisions for them.\n\n \n So, if I am in charge of such a person, as the 'primary care giver' and I decide it's too inconvenient to continue, it's okay to 'abort' (read 'kill') this person. You'll stand by me won't you whatever decision I make?\n \n \nIndeed the woman makes the decision. That is the problem.

The reality for most women is that they will get little or no support in the care of this child once born, not to mention the fact that they are the only one who can carry it for the next few months.\n\n \n Well, herein is the problem. You recognise that the woman carries the child. How would I as a male help directly feed an unborn child? You yourself have established that its 'totally the woman's responsibility because it's her body' \n \n \nSo, you're now excusing bad judgment. \n\n \n \nI believe I said it was terrible. I don't think that is excusing it. Lots of terrible things happen in the world, and I prefer to worry about the things I can control.

The baby relies on someone feeding it though it's own mouth and digestive system, the fetus relies on the nutrients directly from the pregnant woman's body.\n\n \n Again, your side raised the issue of 'dependence' as being a factor. Just because the dependence has lessened, matters not. Otherwise you're inventing a sliding scale of humanness, starting with non-human at full dependence to totally human at total independence.\n \n There are many people in hospital who don't feed through their own mouth, nor breathe through their own efforts. Should they be 'aborted' if their primary carer decides so?\n \n What if my child is dependant upon regular donations from my white blood cells. It's my body. Would you support my efforts to kill my child?\n \n \nThis is what the Nazis did. They categorised people, and divided them into those of use, and those not.\n\n \n \nI'm not deciding which fetuses should live, or that fetuses should unilaterally be aborted. The metaphor doesn't stand.\n\n \n That's right, you've abrogated that responsibility, by laying it all on the woman. So, your conscience is clear. You give them misinformation by saying that the unborn is not really a human being. You're the one who invented some kind of scale on which life is more human and which isn't then you hand this misinformation to women. Just because it's not you personally pulling the trigger, you're off the hook, as far as guilt.\n \n \nI am concerned with the state of health and welfare of all humans. \n\n \n \nSo, what are your suggestions for prevention of embryonic death? Does your Church have a position on this? After all, more pregnancies end this way than by abortion, by a long shot.\n\n \n So? Just because most old people die of disease doesn't mean it's okay for you to kill some of them because they're too much time/effort. What's the connexion you're trying to establish? That because some die by natural means it's okay to kill by unnatural means?\n \n My church has no stance on the unborn dying by natural causes, as far as I'm aware.",

Sure, democracy and capitalism in America will probably fail eventually, but the USSR was always economically and governmentally always in decline.\n\n \n I see that you're yet another victim of Cold War propaganda.\n \n \n \nI could just as easily say that Gorbechev took advantage of the situation as well.\n\n \n Isn't that what I had said?\n \n \nDo I honestly know?

This is also excluding all the human rights problems ALL these communist nations have.

It was a complete failure and was one of the reasons why youe national debt had quadrupled.\n\n \n It wasn't a failure at all, and I don't know where you get the idea that we went further into debt. The program was simply not used, as left-wingers wouldn't support it. However, this is not the point. The point is by having the missile defense program, the USSR realized that it was in trouble, as if they sent a nuke to the US it would have gone into the ocean or into space, and in the mean time the US can always send a nuke to the USSR with no problem. So communism was forced to finally make the fall everyone was waiting for. \n \n \n I don't know. You brought it up.\n\n \n I brought it up? You did! You were saying that Mother Theresa was this evil dictator-loving woman, so I said this:\n \n \n One could say that the Pope too liked the hang around dictators. He had a relationship with the USSR leader, and helped to convince him to break down the union (along with Reagan)... does that mean the Pope liked to chill out with dictators? Yes, I suppose. But that doesn't do anything for public opinion.\n\n \n You automatically switched the topic to communism, and responded with this:\n \n \n I've got news for you. It was too late for the former USSR before the Pope or Reagan did or said anything. It is like going up to a tree which is rotted all the way through and then saying, \"This tree must come down\" and when the tree finally falls you take credit for it. The USSR was little more than a 3rd world country for the 20 to 30 years before it fell. Technally, the Pope is a dictator as well who is appointed for life and everyone, under his rule, has to do as he says. It is irrelevant if he is a benevolent dictator.\n\n \n No, I didn't bring it up. You did.",

She still had stitches and was healing from the labor. She ran to her home where the police were waiting, and they grabbed the newborn child and drowned it in a puddle of mud. Oh how kind! \n \n \n FRONT ROYAL, Virginia, June 5, 2003 (pop.org/LifeSiteNews.com) - In its June 4 Weekly Briefing, the Population Research Institute warns that UNFPA supporters are attempting to gut the 1985 U.S. law which forbids U.S. funds from going to any organization or country that participates in a program of forced abortion or sterilization.\n \n Recent PRI investigations in China have revealed that the gruesome forced abortion policy is still being enforced in the Communist country. \n \n PRI reports, \"One former Chinese official, now residing in the U.S., said that at provincial hospitals, pre-born babies are often delivered alive then killed. The policy is \"for the nurse to take the baby as soon as the baby came out, alive or dead, and place her hand over the baby's mouth. [t]hen. place the baby into a garbage can filled with water, to drown the baby.\"\n \n Also, says PRI's Steve Mosher, \"According to another Chinese doctor, China's health bureaucracy regularly \"slaughters infants\" while carrying out the one-child policy.\n \n According to this witness, the babies of one-child policy victims are also delivered alive, then \"taken back from the Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital. When the infant is born, the nurse will take it away right away, and won't let its mother see it and know if it's living or dead.\"\n \n More is revealed about callous harvesting of organs on demand from born babies who are immediately killed when organs or cells for experimentation purpose are requested.\n \n PRI and its local Chinese witnesses insist that, despite the usual government denials, these atrocities are \"part and parcel of national policy. All hospitals and abortion facilities in China are subject to what one witness termed 'the same national program involving coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization today without change.'\"\n \n UNFPA claims that its \"model family planning counties\" are free of such abuses, says Mosher, but the evidence is that the UN organization is once again engaging in information manipulation in order to protect its star population control nation. A Senior Chinese health official told PRI that the Coercive regulation are enforced throughout the nation which would indicate that UNFPA is not telling the truth, as it rarely does anyway.\n \n The population watchdog organization concludes, \"The U.S. should not fund groups that are working hand-in-glove with China's population control machine. This is why the effort to gut Kemp-Kasten should be turned back\"\n\n \n Communism is so great! The only reason why their killing newborn children is because the Americans are stealing their food and so they have to resort to inhumane measures! Yes! Kill America!\n \n \n And of course the USA didn't try such things as well with the native population already here?\n\n \n A) we didn't kill 25 million.\n B) We didn't illegalize religion\n C) We didn't force people to have abortions or kill their newborn children or abandon their older ones.\n D) That was over a hundred years ago, where such things were the norm in many nations, including China.\n \n \n Many of the successful tests shown were later found to be staged. Well, when your national debt goes from around $1 trillion to about $4 trillion I call that a failure\n\n \n Source?\n \n \n Please. Now that is being silly.\n\n \n That's exactly what happened in the 80s. Fortunately, Bush Sr. still kept the program going along with his son and Clinton.

   "Actually there are stories of being having near death experiences and their brain waves had ceased to exist for a while. \n\n \n I believe I replied to montalban in post #237 and explained that exact thing.\n \n \nIs it independent from the mother? Is it a life? \n\n \n This was your reply to my statement that \"It is dependent on the mother for substance'. Then you ask me \"Is it independent from the mother?\". Hello, is anybody there? This is getting redundant and boring.\n \n \nMy definition of brain means the mind. \n\n \n When you say mind, do you mean something that is not physical?\n \n \nNaturally. Automatically this zygote will begin to grow. But enough of your hypothetical questions. \n\n \n Let's get something straight. If you can't answer the question, then just say so. If you don't want to answer the question, then just say so. But you trying to tell me what to do is totally irrelevant to me. One of the ways that science and knowledge expands is to ask hypothetical questions. And this is not a hypothetical question since it can be done.\n \n If a scientist takes the DNA from an egg and splices it into the DNA of a sperm, would you say that is a human being?\n \n \nI'm sorry? Please be more explicit. \n\n \n Forget it.\n \n \nOf course it's \"attached\" to the mother, but it's not an organ. An organ is something useful to the mother; the fetus isn't useful. It's a parasite. \n\n \n Nowhere did I say it was an organ. You said \"You said the fetus is part of the mother, except you changed words around and said it was \"attached\".\" Now you are agreeing that it is attached to the mother. What the heck is your point?\n \n \nThe Supreme Court has made pleanty of laws that are unscientific. They said that blacks weer 3/4 human;\n\n \n Where did they say that?\n \n \n they said that the fetus isn't human.\n\n \n Where did they say that?\n \n \nYes, there is scientific fact that the fetus becomes human. I will shortly show you sources. My argument isn't that all horses are rabbits, my argument goes like this:\n \n The fetus is a living thing.\n \n The fetus is a human.\n \n Therefore, the fetus is a human being.\n \n It's not A=B, B=C, A=C, or A=B, and C=D, A=D, it's A+B=AB. It's very simple. \n\n \n Well for once we can agree on something. You state that your argument is the same as A+B=AB. I will agree that that is your argument. Problem is that A+B do not = AB. Here is the somewhat technical proof. It may be hard to follow but spend some time studying it.\n \n A=3\n B=2\n A+B=5\n AB = 6\n LOL\n \n \n\"In this text, we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes, which will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual. ... Fertilization takes place in the oviduct ... resulting in the formation of a zygote containing a single diploid nucleus. Embryonic development is considered to begin at this point... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.\" \n Larsen, W.J. 1998. Essentials of Human Embryology, Churchill Livingstone, New York, pp. 1-17. \n \n \"Fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... Fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... The zygote ... is a unicellular embryo... \"The ill-defined and inaccurate term pre-embryo, which includes the embryonic disc, is said either to end with the appearance of the primitive streak or ... to include neurulation. The term is not used in this book.\" (p. 55).\" \n O'Rahilly, R. and F. Muller. 1996. Human Embryology & Teratology, Wiley-Liss, New York, pp. 5-55.\n \n \"Zygote: this cell results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo). Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.\" \n Moore, K. and T.V.N. Persaud. 1998. The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology (6th ed.), W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, pp 2-18.\n \n Obviously, there is scientific facts that the fetus is human. Even Embryologists are teaching it!\n\n \n You state that Embryologists are teaching that a human being begins at fertilization. And you support that by quoting from ONE Embryologist and conclude from that that it is a scientific fact. What a joke. For all I know he may be the most pro-life person on the planet. Or maybe he meant that it's just when the process starts, not when it is a human being. Like a car starts with an idea someone puts on paper. Then a concept, drawings, designs, dies, manufacturing and finally a car. But it is not a car until it rolls off the assembly or some critical time right before that when it is capable of functioning as a car. Either case, it's not a scientific fact.\n \n I design structures for a living and for pleasure. Some people might consider me an expert in the field because I have designed quite a few that have so far never failed. I could write a book as an expert and in there I could make the statement \"All concrete bridges can support a 20 ton truck\" Does that make that statement a scientific fact? Of course not. Now if test of all concrete bridges were done or even design reviews of all concrete bridges were preformed and it was found that all of them would support a 20 ton truck, then it would be a scientific fact. Until then it's just me making a statement. And you are trying to use a statement by someone as a scientific fact. Where is the evidence that what he has said is true?\n \n This morning I did some research online concerning fetal development. It was quite interesting. I found pro-life sites and pro-choice sites that heavily biased the \"facts\" towards their view. I also found a site that sure seemed to me to be unbiased and tries to present both sides of the argument. I was amazed at how closely it paralleled our discussion. If you take a look, and I encourage your to do so, you might even accuse me of plagiarizing the information. However I can assure you that if I had known of this site earlier I would have simply copied and pasted and given them the credit instead of spending all this time composing my post. \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/abortion1.htm",

China was granted \"most favored nation\" status because of Clinton, who was such a hypocrite and seemed to adore communism. \n \n \n What has happened to many other Communist nations which the USA has mostly left alone? They have gradually adopted many capitalist practices. Not with Cuba.\n\n \n Look where Cuba is at now- on the brink of their collapse. I predict that within the next 5-10 years there will be no more Fidel Castro running Cuba, and communism will be abandoned. They have a negative GDP real growth, they have a high unemployment rate for a communist nation (there isn't supposed to be unemployment), they have people making LESS money than what they had when Spain controlled it over a hundred years ago. It's awful!\n \n How many people are dead because of America selling WMD to other nations, sometimes to both sides at the same time?\n\n \n It wasn't our fault they screwed up. We gave them the weapons because they said they would help us. They aren't retarded. If they screw up and start getting into WMD wars, it isn't our problem, it's theirs. Should we attack the Chinese for inventing gunpowder and sharing it with the Europeans? Of course not. \n \n \n But you want to force her not to.\n\n \n I force her not to kill any human life! \n \n \n The government had nothing to do with that. It is the Chinese culture itself. Look at India, they are now the world's second most populous nation in the world at around 1 billion people. Soon they won't have the resources to feed all of them. The third most populous nation is the USA with around 280 million people.\n\n \n The only reason India isn't able to feed it's people is because half their country is below poverty line and they have a corrupt government. We have pleanty of resources to feed everyone. As a matter of fact, if we wanted to, the whole would would be able to fit in all the coastal states from North Carolina up to Maine (plus Vermont and West Virginia) and each person would get 1320 sqaure feet of space... which means that every family of 5 would get 6600 square feet of living space! Yes, it would be a giant suburb, but the rest of the world would be used for agricultural needs! We have plenty of resources and space, we just need better governments! \n \n Secondly, the government absolutely had everything to do with it. This site has articles from the Washington Post, BBC, CNN, Wall Street Journal, and more. To not blame the government is ludicrous. Secondly, ever heard of Mao Zedong? He was the communist dictator! \n \n [quote] And many poor women go without pre-natal care in the USA as well. The only time many poorer women see a doctor is when they are having their baby in the ER./quote]\n \n Poor pre-natal care? Murdering a newborn is quite different from having poor pre-natal care, my friend!!!\n \n \n Tell that to the American government when they suppose other nations with WMD.\n\n \n Even if you blame America for the no more than two times we gave WMDs to nations, the death tolls do not add up nearly to 25 million. It wouldn't even be a million- probably no more than 500k (really conservative estimates too! I say it's probably around 100k!).\n \n \n Tell take to the Muslim Americans and why they are being scrutinized so much. Plus there are some comments by some high up Americans are saying that the current war is a religious war against Islam.\n\n \n We don't illegalize their religion! This is a Judeo-Christian nation! If you don't like it, deal with it or leave!\n \n \n But you do conduct experiments on people without their knowledge or informed consent. \n http://www.thetalkingdrum.com/tus.html\n\n \n That website is a load of XXXX. \n \n \n Irrelevant. The USA was suppose to be different from these other nations, even back then.\n\n \n Back then, when every single nation was doing quite worse than America? Please! Don't be ridiculous!\n \n \n \n http://www.ustrek.org/odyssey/semes...adstarwars.html\n\n \n 87 Billion dollars isn't a 4 trillion dollar deficit, my friend. And so what if we broke a loosely-made treaty. It's better that way; communism ended. I would certainly brake all rules to end the suffering of millions of innocent lives who have no say in how they will live. \n \n \n This was your reply to my statement that \"It is dependent on the mother for substance'. Then you ask me \"Is it independent from the mother?\". Hello, is anybody there? This is getting redundant and boring.\n\n \n Sure it's dependent on the mother as most infants, small children, and handicapped people are. If I was on a respirator, would that mean the respirator is allowed to kill me? \n \n \n When you say mind, do you mean something that is not physical?\n\n \n Yes. Brain waves aren't a mind. They are physical. \n \n \n If a scientist takes the DNA from an egg and splices it into the DNA of a sperm, would you say that is a human being?\n\n \n YES, as I already stated. This is what cloning does; it's fusion. The egg will naturally grow. \n \n \n Nowhere did I say it was an organ. You said \"You said the fetus is part of the mother, except you changed words around and said it was \"attached\".\" Now you are agreeing that it is attached to the mother. What the heck is your point?\n\n \n It is attached, but not part of the mother. I can be attached to a respirator- does that mean I'm part of the respirator? Is the mother actually part of the fetus, or is the fetus part of the mother?\n \n \n Where did they say that?\n \n \n I apologize. I'm confusing two different things. The Dred Scott Descision said blacks were \"a subordinate and inferior class of beings\". The Legislature had decided that blacks were 3/4s human. At any rate, my point is still made. \n \n The Roe Vs. Wade descision...\n \"As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life,\"\n \n \"...and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\"\n \n I can't find the actual quote, but yes, there was one made that the unborn child was only a potential life. \n \n \n Well for once we can agree on something. You state that your argument is the same as A+B=AB. I will agree that that is your argument. Problem is that A+B do not = AB. Here is the somewhat technical proof. It may be hard to follow but spend some time studying it.\n\n \n Fine, I'll be more clear.\n \n A=C\n B=D\n A+B=E=C+D\n \n Happy?\n \n Religious tolerance is a very liberal site and is not to be trusted. They don't state anything to the right as fact. Their \"pro-life\" pages are especially ludicrous.",

   "Okay. Most likely I missed someone's reply to this in all the other posts, but I find one. You speak for the woman's right to choose, while you reduce the male down to just a donor. I don't think it'll be women who have to worry about their rights being taken away.\n Listen, I'm a female, and I have no such worries. Now, say, if I went to get a tattoo (I'm over 18, so that wouldn't be a problem), and I was told, \"sorry, no, you can't; it'll disrupt the public and harm them,\" then yes, I'd be furious! There are certain types of rights that shouldn't be banned in any way. There are others that should be and shouldn't have been made into \"rights\" in the first place! And I, as a women, have alot of say in something like that!\n\n \n That post I made wasn't answered yet. Also, Charchuk, two times, at least, you've mentioned something to back up what you said that was either said by Parcum (whom it doesn't seem like you like that much anyway) and a _t-shirt_! I'm a female, and I have NO problem with this certain \"right\" being taken away!",

You think that being human is the same thing as being a human being.\n \n \nIt hit us hard, but not as hard as Russia. Although in the middle of the crisis Russia did better than the US (early 1930s), later on when FDR was in office the economy ended up being much more stable than Russia's.\n\n \n Russia has a very different culture, plus they didn't have the infrastructure the USA had either. Remember, they only came into the Industral Age at the start of the 20th century.\n \n \nAlso, the USSR had sacrificed the starvation of millions of people to get where they were, which really wasn't much of an accomplishment. The US got in a better state than the USSR in the end.\n\n \n Again, that had more to do with Stalinism than anything else.\n \n \nOf course not. But there's always one who runs everything and kills members of the committee who don't agree with him, such as what Stalin did to Trotsky.\n\n \n Like I had said, not true Communism, but Leninism and Stalinism. Under a true communist system there is no central level government, nor leader. each communitity has its own co-op and share responsibility.\n \n \nEnough of your BS. China does this. Cuba does this. Vietnam does this.\n\n \n Never said that they were, only that they were a bit more successful. Like Capitalism, there can not be a pure form of an ideal. The Robber Barons of the 19th century would roll over in their graves to see just how socialist the USA has become. :) Plus, the form of Communism used by China is called Maoism.\n \n [quore]PLEASE shut up! I don't give a XXXX about what Corporate America thought. Why are you introducing this topic? You seem to just be ranting about nothing![/quote]\n \n I just wanted you to know what you'll soon be giving you life up for when they get the draft returned to protect Corporate America. You'll be 18 in a couple of years, right? :)\n \n \nYou talking about Sweat Shops? Most people are happy about it.\n\n \n You've got to be kidding?

Haven't you been watching Lou Dobbs' on CNN and his series \"Exporting America\" and \"Selling America\"?

Look at Saudi Arabia. 15 of the 19 terrorist on 9/11 were Saudis, Bin Ladin was a Saudi, in fact the Bushes had been personal friends of the Bin Ladin family, and the Bin Ladins even own shares in some of Dubya's companies. There is much you aren't being told.\n \n \n \nShould we attack the Chinese for inventing gunpowder and sharing it with the Europeans? Of course not.\n\n \n They didn't exactly share it with Europe.

Plus, most of that $87 is going to companies like Haliburton. When Bush was appointed to office he inherited a large surplus from Clinton. Now he has turned it into a hugh deficit which is so far is in the 100's of Billions. He still has some time. Especially when you brings back most of Reagan's economic policies if he gets second term.\n \n \n \nAnd so what if we broke a loosely-made treaty.\n\n \n I don't think that something which helped save the world from nuclear war is something to so easily dismiss. But, then again you Americans are use to breaking treaties. Just ask your native population.\n \n \nIt's better that way; communism ended.\n\n \n Communism didn't end. Who told you that?\n \n \nI would certainly brake all rules to end the suffering of millions of innocent lives who have no say in how they will live.\n\n \n That old saying, \"Better dead than red\" comes to mind when I hear such an unthought through comment. Yet another victim of the Cold War.\n \n \nSure it's dependent on the mother as most infants, small children, and handicapped people are.\n\n \n Anyone can take care of a child.

They get paid several times more than working in other countries. In places where most people make around $1 a day, getting $0.50 an hour for labor is great! Imagine, working 10 hours a day and getting five times as much money as you were getting being a farmer. We must also understand that everything in those countries are cheaper than in the US.

Now you're repeating the same nonsense you said before.\n\n \n Anyone can take care of an embryo. Many people grow their zygotes in a tube and can place them into many bodies. Do you think an embryo can only live in ONE mother? No. It can live in many mothers. \n \n \n Is it doing your thinking for you?\n\n \n No, neither is the mother doing the thinking for the fetus. The fetus is in it's own sac and doesn't need to do any real thinking. It sleeps, grows and metabolizes. \n \n \n Wrong, coherent brainwaves are a mind. A fetus during the time of most abortions doesn't have either.\n\n \n 78% of abortions happen AFTER brain waves begin. \n \n \n But it doesn't have unique DNA, or blood type so, by your definition it is not a human being.

Obviously, communism has been tried several times and has failed. \n\n \n Because most of these nations had cultures which were already like that to begin with. Any system they would use would reflect that as well.\n \n \nCan't you see the pattern? China- Maoism. Russia- Stalinism and Leninism. Cambodia- Pol-Potism. Vietnam- Ho Chi Mihnism. Cuba- Castroism... why have these\" isms\" been in every single communist nation? Why have all the communist nations led to disaster and depression?\n\n \n McCarthyism, Bushism.\n \n \nIronically enough, most people working in Sweat Shops are HAPPY that they have jobs!\n\n \n \"Oh, please, master please beat me some more.\" \n \n They're glad to get some money, but not how they get it. In Brazil, a federative republic, children are expected to go to work with their parents, in the banana plantation, but are not paid. If they miss any work their parents must make up their slack. But hey, they're glad to have work in order to provide you with cheap bananas.\n \n \nThey get paid several times more than working in other countries.\n\n \n Maybe that is why so many American corporations are starting to move to those countries which pay even less.\n \n \nIn places where most people make around $1 a day, getting $0.50 an hour for labor is great!\n\n \n In most of these places that make even less than that. And the working conditions are usually quite dangerous and sometimes quite deadly. Really no different than a galley slave ship where they used slaves to row, but hey they got plenty of exercise..\n \n \nImagine, working 10 hours a day and getting five times as much money as you were getting being a farmer.\n\n \n They should be lucky to only have to work 10 hours. A lot of the time they have to bring some of the work home, for no extra pay. \n \n \nWe must also understand that everything in those countries are cheaper than in the US. For twenty-five cents one individuals can have a very filling meal for him and a friend. If sweatshops are so bad, why are there people crowding to work for them?\n\n \n And of course they don't have those pesty human rights laws to get in the way as well. It is still better than straving to death, but only barely.\n \n \nI didn't say worse, I was saying that they were the same. Europeans were stealing land from the Africans and killing them as well. Yes, it was the norm.\n\n \n That is how America was created as well, by Europeans, before it was formed into the USA. \n \n \nAgain, just blame it on Bush and Reagan. As you can see in the chart below, it was during Clinton's administration that the trade began to be \"six times as much\".\n\n \n He was just continuing Aerican policy. \n \n \nAlso, was it not Clinton who gave China the MFN status?\n\n \n Didn't say that he didn't. Even though he was a good president (Repubs. Sex bad, war good). He was still beholding to Corporate America to some extent.\n \n \nsource?\n\n \n History books.\n \n \nBin Laden was the \"rebel\" of his family. His family was not terrorists.\n\n \n Irrelevant. They could have provided information about him. When 9/11 happened and all of the airways were closed to commerical traffic the American Governement rounded up all of the family members who were studying in the USA an flew them across country in a private jet then out of the country without once questioning them.\n \n \n \nBut I would like to see a source for that anyway. Nonetheless, it's very true. We give nations some WMDs to use. If they hide them away and start using them for their own wars, that's not our problem. It happens all the time.\n \n \n Even when they start them with you? Talk about your past coming back to bite you in the XXX. :)\n \n \nFine, should we punish the Spanish and French for introducing guns and cannons to England? Of course not.\n\n \n Apples and oranges arguement. Plus, they didn't have international laws back then either. \n \n \nWhen does human life begin?\n\n \n According to the Church at birth when it draws its first breathe..\n \n \nThey aren't able to feed their people. It's been like that for a while.\n\n \n From a recent docuementry on population they had said that they still could. Though, to you and me it would seem to be at a starvation level. Many Indians are vegetarian as well.\n \n \nThat doesn't mean anything at all. We've got plenty of arable land- especially if we all were in one area.\n\n \n You are paving over your arable land, at an ever increasing rate, to put up shoppingmalls and other \"necessities\" of life. The world is losing over 1 hectare of arable land every 7.67 seconds. That is around 10,000 square metres, or in terms you can understand that is 2.4711 acres.\n \n \nWe would brake the third amendment right and break into people's homes, torture and kill 819 people, for doing peaceful protests for inhumane police brutality? I doubt it!\n\n \n Kent State. Ask your parents about that.\n \n \nWhy don't you prove your statement?\n\n \n I don't have to it is docuemented history. Why do you think Ollie North was put on trial as a scapegoat?\n \n \nThey have a right, yes, but they must understand that in this nation we have Judeo-Christian principles.\n\n \n Wrong. http://www.internetcampus.com/fog25.htm\n \n \nYou said Reagan put us into a 4 billion dollar deficit! Why not Clinton? Why not Bush Sr.? You just like to blame people you don't agree with.\n\n \n Trillion. Clinton had a hugh surplus. Bush Jr. has already surpassed his father's national debt. Dubya's current debt level for the nation is around $450 billion and this from a large surplus. But, hey, Clinton was evil because he had SEX.\n \n \nWhy am I not surprised that a Canadian is so anti-American?\n\n \n We are your only true best friends in all of the world, and remember what I had said about real friends elsewhere. :) As a former Prime Minister once said, \"When sleeping with an elephant any unexpected twitch or movement could prove to be fatal...\"\n \n \nThat's totally out of context. I meant communism in Russia.\n\n \n Then you should have said the Soviet Union. \n \n \nAnyone can take care of an embryo.\n\n \n Wrong.\n \n \nMany people grow their zygotes in a tube and can place them into many bodies.\n\n \n Irrelevant. In these cases that is for a wanted baby, plus once the zygote is implanted it can't be removed and attached elsewhere.\n \n \nDo you think an embryo can only live in ONE mother? No. It can live in many mothers.\n\n \n Not once it has been implanted.\n \n \nNo, neither is the mother doing the thinking for the fetus. The fetus is in it's own sac and doesn't need to do any real thinking. It sleeps, grows and metabolizes.\n\n \n In this case it is only the mother who is capable of any thought process. Also irrelevant since you can do the same with a clump of cells in a Petri dish as well. \n \n \n78% of abortions happen AFTER brain waves begin.\n\n \n Coherant brainwaves of the higher brain? \n \n \nMy argument isn't that because it is unique it's human. My argument goes much further than that!\n\n \n No, you keep giving the example of why a finger isn't a life because it doesn't have unique DNA, or blood type. That is your whole arguement. \n \n \nI don't even know why I'm responding to you, Charchuk. You're loony.\n\n \n That is because deep down you know that you're wrong.",

   "That one. And then my question still stands, are you pro-abortion? But you said that was irrevelant, and that it wasn't your choice. Dude, it is!\n\n \n It's not my body, so it is not my choice. Far too many men have the atitude which was expressed by that man in Quebec, \"My woman, my baby.\"\n \n If I could get pregnant as well, sort of like in that early 90's SF show, \"Alienation\" where the males shared the pregnancy as well, then it would be a different matter. Though, they had a third gender so unwanted pregnancies were impossible for them. :)\n \n It has really only been recent that women had a say about their own lives and bodies. Before this they were nothing more than property, they couldn't own property and not even their children were theirs as well. Livestock was of more value. You didn't even have a choice wheither you actually wanted to have children or not. If your husband wanted children and you didn't that was not your choice. In most times you couldn't even choose who wanted to marry either. There was no such thing as rape if your husband forced sex on you, afterall it was his right with you being his property and all. \n \n Marriage originally was a bill of sale with you as the merchantise. In some cultures the groom would have to provide the fee and he asked your father if he could marry you, not you directly. Your wedding day was usually the first time you would have seen him. In others it was the lead male in your life, either your father or a brother, etc. who paid the groom to take you. Even today it is traditional for the father of the bride to pay for the wedding. And where would you be in all of this? That wasn't important.\n \n There are still some far and middle eastern cultures which practice arranged marriages. Marrying mainly for love is a very recent idea as well.\n \n You may not realize this, but if a woman's right to choose is taken away than it wouldn't be long until those \"Good old Days\" come back.\n \n Like was said on the T-Shirt, \"If you can't trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a baby?\"\n \n Just because you have a choice doesn't mean that you have to choose to have an abortion.

If that doesn't qualify as \"part of her body\", what does?\n \n This is also my reply to all of parcum's absurd \"hypotheticals\" about artificial lungs, \"dependance\" and such- that is not the same thing as an organism which literally grows from the cells of a host organism.\n \n \nSo, if I am in charge of such a person, as the 'primary care giver' and I decide it's too inconvenient to continue, it's okay to 'abort' (read 'kill') this person.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nWhy is it only the woman's decision?\n\n because-\n \nYou recognise that the woman carries the child.

Do you think it's wrong? \n\n \n No. I don't think killing animals for eating is wrong either, but I don't want them to suffer, and I don't think it's fun for anything to die, no matter it's state of cellular complexity.

I said repeatedly that I believe it is human, I just believe that under certain circumstances people have to kill other people. I don't think I'm representative of pro-choice people, I have some very unusual opinions about many things.\n \n \nJust because most old people die of disease doesn't mean it's okay for you to kill some of them because they're too much time/effort. What's the connexion you're trying to establish? That because some die by natural means it's okay to kill by unnatural means? My church has no stance on the unborn dying by natural causes, as far as I'm aware.\n\n \n When an elderly person is ill and it seems they might die, would you support them receiving medical attention? I would. I don't think most people would say, \"oh, let him die, he's had 70 good years\" about their parent or grandparent. If you hear of an elderly person dying of a curable infection, don't you find that abhorrent that he didn't receive treatment because of shoddy or unaffordable medical care?\n \n Therefore, shouldn't someone be preventing the death of zygotes- giving them organ transplants (except for that they don't really have organs yet), medication, whatever is necessary to keep them alive? Why do we let all these babies, many of them very much wanted, to die?\n \n Why are you only concerned with embyonic/fetal death when it is explicitely by the pregnant woman's choice?\n \n \n \n When I bring up the Canaanites being exterminated by the Israelites many Jews tell me that it was justifed\n\n Just wondering - how does that come up in conversation?

And we keep giving him the same answers again and again.

Just like the USA recently had itself excused from a world-wide agreement on war crimes, and crimes against humanity which would be able to prosecute any nation (Including the USA) if they ever committed such crimes. Now, it is who will police the police? The USA could execute every single prisoner, excuse me detainee, at Guantanamo Bay without due process and the World Court wouldn't be able to do anything to the USA.\n \n \nWhat was the native population before colonisation, exactly? I guess if it wasn't exactly 25 million, then it's ok.\n\n \n When Columbus \"discovered\" America there was an estimated 80 to 145 million natives in the new world. Some estimate that between 20 and 40 million were in North America alone, now there is an estimated 2 million left in NA. Before anyone accuses me of my ancestors being part of this I should remind you that I'm also part MicMac.\n \n \nNo, you let the local authorities do that in the fun sweatshops that US capitalists fatten their wallets with.\n\n \n There are also the sweatshops in the USA itself which use illegally smuggled in laborers from Asia and treat them like slaves many times not even paying them much and keeping them in debt with the \"Company Store\" as well. BTW, if Parcum hasn't realized it yet, but ALL of these sweatshops take jobs away from American Citizens. That most of these sweatshops are owned or leased by American Corporations as well. They don't have to pay benefits, they don't have to pay taxes. Much of it is pure profit.\n \n In other words they are being good capitalists in the spirit of the Robber Barons of 19th century America. When most Americans worked under the very same conditions until the country got ruined and became all socialist and a nicer place to live. It is up to Corporate America to put a stop to that now. It is working already. Only around 13% of Americans are members of a union now.\n \n \nGlobal capitalism. Why have all the capitalist nations led to disaster and depression? Lemme guess- communist threats?\n\n \n Any system is only as good or as bad as the people behind it. If he would look at the culture before Communism took over, many times by the people themselves, he would see that it wouldn't have made any difference which form of government they took.\n \n \nGee, I dunno. They must be stupid. Why don't they go back to community farming, after all their land is so fertile- oh, wait, I remember, it's because Dole and Nestle stole all their land. Silly me.\n\n \n It is also like asking why a battered wife will stay with her abusive husband. It is like Parcum is saying that she likes being beatened because the husband also provides her with a shelter, food, and some money. Parcum doesn't realize this is the sort of thing which happens when you take someones free choice away from them.",

Secondly, if the fetus is part of the mother, that means the mother has four arms, four legs, two brains, and if they fetus is a boy, a penis and vagina. Isn't that sort of ridiculous? Third, the zygote isn't connected to the mother until implantation. Otherwise, it's within the mother, but isn't receiving nutrients. With your analogy, a tick is part of the mother. Tape Worms are part of the mother. Are they?\n \n \n This is also my reply to all of parcum's absurd \"hypotheticals\" about artificial lungs, \"dependance\" and such- that is not the same thing as an organism which literally grows from the cells of a host organism.\n\n \n I didn't say artificial lungs.

   "Charchuk, I'm not debating with you anymore.\n\n \n Of course not. You just know that you're in over your head. \n \n \nFirst of all, mothers cannot have two different blood types. Secondly, if the fetus is part of the mother, that means the mother has four arms, four legs, two brains, and if they fetus is a boy, a penis and vagina. Isn't that sort of ridiculous? Third, the zygote isn't connected to the mother until implantation. Otherwise, it's within the mother, but isn't receiving nutrients. With your analogy, a tick is part of the mother. Tape Worms are part of the mother. Are they?\n\n \n Don't forget to rewind your tape afterwards.\n \n \nWe're not talking about capitalism and socialism; we're talking about authoritarianism and freedom. Since the conception of communism, we have only gotten negative results. When democracy was conceived, we got positive results.\n\n \n Communism is an economic system, not a politicial one. You have a socialistic country as your very close neighbor and it is not Cuba. Canada uses a Socialistic Capitialistic system and we've not an authoritarian nation. Hell, we ever got a few more freedoms and rights than you. And no one is out to kill us just for who we are. Just about everyone trust Canadians in the world as well. :) \n \n \nI assure you, it wasn't even remotely near to 25 million.\n\n \n And you'd be quite wrong, yet again. Even if it were lower it doesn't matter because when you compare on a per capita basis what happened before is much worse.\n \n \nSun Dance was simply a religious ceremony that was controversial. WE didn't ban their religion, as communists do!\n\n \n Same difference.\n \n \nOh yes, we force these people to work for us like slaves... right.\n\n \n Maybe not, but Corporate America does and if they could get away with it they would do the same to you. Did you know that many American companies have something called \"Peasant's Insurance\"? What it is is that a big company takes out a life insurance policy on their employees (Without telling the employee BTW.) and makes the company the beneficiary. Here is the kicker, even if you move on to another job or even retire when you die they still collect on it. In many cases you are worth more to them dead than alive.\n \n \nAnd they HATE working for us... sure... don't be stupid. If they were really as bad as you say there are, nobody would work there.\n\n \n No one would, if they actually had a real choice or other real options. Have you ever wondered why so many peoples in the world hate you AMericans? It is not because they are jealous of you, that is a lie, it is because of how you see them and use them. You aren't being told everything you should know about your country and government. Bin Ladin is a multimillionaire, he can live even better than you can.\n \n \nNo, depending on the species, a caterpillar is a monarch.\n\n \n Press play.\n \n \n200 years. This nation isn't 500 years old. Oddly enough, most Indian tribes are Christians.... Hmmm...\n\n \n The nation maybe, but it has been occupid by Europeans for around 500 years.\n \n As for the Natives being Christian, they really didn't have a choice in that matter eiither. What with you destroying their way of life and forcing your beliefs on them. Is it any wonder that so many of them are at the bottom of society now. Except for the one's who sell out.",

   "It's not my body, so it is not my choice. Far too many men have the atitude which was expressed by that man in Quebec, \"My woman, my baby.\"\n \n If I could get pregnant as well, sort of like in that early 90's SF show, \"Alienation\" where the males shared the pregnancy as well, then it would be a different matter. Though, they had a third gender so unwanted pregnancies were impossible for them. :)\n \n It has really only been recent that women had a say about their own lives and bodies. Before this they were nothing more than property, they couldn't own property and not even their children were theirs as well. Livestock was of more value. You didn't even have a choice wheither you actually wanted to have children or not. If your husband wanted children and you didn't that was not your choice. In most times you couldn't even choose who wanted to marry either. There was no such thing as rape if your husband forced sex on you, afterall it was his right with you being his property and all. \n \n Marriage originally was a bill of sale with you as the merchantise. In some cultures the groom would have to provide the fee and he asked your father if he could marry you, not you directly. Your wedding day was usually the first time you would have seen him. In others it was the lead male in your life, either your father or a brother, etc. who paid the groom to take you. Even today it is traditional for the father of the bride to pay for the wedding. And where would you be in all of this? That wasn't important.\n \n There are still some far and middle eastern cultures which practice arranged marriages. Marrying mainly for love is a very recent idea as well.\n \n You may not realize this, but if a woman's right to choose is taken away than it wouldn't be long until those \"Good old Days\" come back.\n \n Like was said on the T-Shirt, \"If you can't trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a baby?\"\n \n Just because you have a choice doesn't mean that you have to choose to have an abortion. No one is forcing you to here.\n\n \n \n Wow.... If I didn't know better, I'd say you're a female whose gotten on the wrong side of her husband/boyfriend, father, and other males in her life enough that they totally hurt her and she no longer likes males. Seriously. You being a male, it sounds like you've been around one too many overly liberal females in your life! \n Also, I quoted you in one of my posts as saying that the male was a \"donor.\" A DONOR! I _know_ how women have been treated before, as well as still in other countries! But abusive husbands treating women as property and abortion are two totally different things. Actually they aren't now that I think of it..... They both kill life. Anyway. Abortion kills the life growing, and the abusiveness and all, I totally agree with you on. But hey, it's the 21st century, and we can find a way to have some \"rights\" not be \"rights\" while it doesn't backslide into women as property.\n And might I try again? I don't care if you don't ever get pregnant, you can still have a choice/opinion on abortion! You said that pro-choice doesn't mean pro-abortion. I've got it. I then asked if you are pro-abortion. Not saying would sound like you are hesitant to reply for fear that you'll go against what you want to believe and talk about.",

If I was on a respirator, would that mean the respirator is allowed to kill me?\n\n \n I have never said anything about killing anything.

   "\n It is not her.\n\n \n \nIt is a part of her body. The growth of the organism comes directly from the intake of the woman, ie her nutrient intake feeds it's cells, her oxygen is it's oxygen, it's waste is expelled through her system. If that doesn't qualify as \"part of her body\", what does?\n\n \n No, that just describes dependence. Like a seed might be dependent upon soil. It doesn't make the seed = soil. She feeds it, yes. She is not it. She continues to feed the child after it is born. Your logic is not actually based on DNA or brainwaves or anything else like other people are arguing, but on it's stomach! If it uses its own stomach, it's a human! A unique gastro-dependency theory you've developed.\n \n There are Siamese twins born with a shared heart and stomach. For you then one of them is not a proper person.\n \n \nThis is also my reply to all of parcum's absurd \"hypotheticals\" about artificial lungs, \"dependence\" and such- that is not the same thing as an organism which literally grows from the cells of a host organism.\n\n \n Come come, what sort of world do you live in? It's not absurd. They are real occurrences. People are out there now dependent on artificial lungs. Have you never heard of these things? So, they are valid. You are talking about one kind of dependence relating to gastro-use, and I raise another just as real. The absurdity of your own argument forces you to dismiss all other parallels as unreal.\n \n And you were arguing about dependence too!\n \n \n\n So, if I am in charge of such a person, as the 'primary care giver' and I decide it's too inconvenient to continue, it's okay to 'abort' (read 'kill') this person.\n\n \n \nSee above.\n\n \n Ditto.\n \n \nWhy is it only the woman's decision?\n\n \n \nbecause-\n\n \n \nYou recognise that the woman carries the child. How would I as a male help directly feed an unborn child?\n\n \n \nSee, you know the answers, you just have to think about it logically instead of theologically.\n\n \n A quick reversal of yours. So ...\n As I said, then, if I am responsible for the breathing etc of another; if I pay for the lung machine, then you say it is my decision if the person lives or dies? You can't have it both ways. It's attractive to do so, but it's illogical.\n \n \nWhy do you 'prevent more abortions'? Do you think it's wrong? \n\n \n \nNo. I don't think killing animals for eating is wrong either, but I don't want them to suffer, and I don't think it's fun for anything to die, no matter it's state of cellular complexity. I don't like to kill slugs in my garden, but if it's me or the slug, I will fight for myself.\n\n \n That's all nice, but what have slugs to do with abortions?\n \n \nYou give them misinformation by saying that the unborn is not really a human being.\n\n \n \nI never said that either. I said repeatedly that I believe it is human, I just believe that under certain circumstances people have to kill other people. I don't think I'm representative of pro-choice people, I have some very unusual opinions about many things.\n\n \n Ahem. You just referred to it as a 'growth' of the woman's body that's next to zilch because it's dependent on her.\n \n \n\n Just because most old people die of disease doesn't mean it's okay for you to kill some of them because they're too much time/effort. What's the connexion you're trying to establish? That because some die by natural means it's okay to kill by unnatural means? My church has no stance on the unborn dying by natural causes, as far as I'm aware.\n\n \n \nWhen an elderly person is ill and it seems they might die, would you support them receiving medical attention? I would. I don't think most people would say, \"oh, let him die, he's had 70 good years\" about their parent or grandparent. If you hear of an elderly person dying of a curable infection, don't you find that abhorrent that he didn't receive treatment because of shoddy or unaffordable medical care?\n Therefore, shouldn't someone be preventing the death of zygotes- giving them organ transplants (except for that they don't really have organs yet), medication, whatever is necessary to keep them alive? Why do we let all these babies, many of them very much wanted, to die?\n Why are you only concerned with embryonic/foetal death when it is explicitly by the pregnant woman's choice?\n\n \n You've changed focus. Before you were asking me about my concern for non-aborted foetuses. Now the elderly. Why indeed do we let all these babies die? What part of my statements about the concern of all life escapes you?\n \n I don't know why you're rabbiting on about old people. I'm against euthanasia, but I guess you're not... especially if they are 'dependent' upon others.\n \n \n\n When I bring up the Canaanites being exterminated by the Israelites many Jews tell me that it was justified\n\n \n \nJust wondering - how does that come up in conversation? BTW, have you read the OT? Apparently God is a big fan of genocide...\n\n \n Yes, then why do you bring it up too? It's always good to kick a Christian huh?",

Let me ask you; is a tick part of you? Is a tape worm part of you? Is a mosquito part of you? The fetus is like the tick; it is a life, it is part of a species, and it is not part of the mother. The fetus is a life, is part of the human species, and is not part of the mother. Simply said. \n \n \n Okay but what part of a human being are you referring to as not physical?\n\n \n Consciousness is not physical. Somebody who is unconscious is without mind.

Everyone knows that the north and the south had a disagreement on if the slaves were human. The south wanted the slaves to be human, and the north didn't, so they said slaves were three-quarters human. You probably learned this in American History. I did. I'm sure most people in this board will agree that this happened. The point, however, is not if this happened, but that the government has a bad history of legislating morality, and has done an especially bad job on defining human life. \n \n \n And that is why this is a debate, because people don't always agree with each other. And sometimes the right answer can't be determined.\n\n \n Of course! So don't bring it up as an argument!\n \n \n that was true, we wouldn't be having this debate and the Supreme Court would not have made the ruling it did and all scientist would agree about when a fertilized egg becomes a human being.

It doesn't sound coherent.\n\n \n A) It is biased to the left\n B) They get information wrong.\n C) They're Canadian.\n D) They're Muslim. \n \n Look at what they say about Christians:\n \n Historical treatment of Jewish people (Prior to World War 1): Prolonged and widespread anti-Judaism, anti-semitism, oppression, and mass murder.\n Additional taxation, but otherwise general tolerance.\n \n \n Um, sure there was oppression, but mass murder? Islam founded their religion by murdering 600 Jews in the Jewish region of Medina, and sold families into slavery. This is one example of many. Christians did have the Inquisition, but very few Jews were killed. It was always Muslims and Protestants. Muslims would often go into Christian villages, kill the families except for the boys, make them slaves, and later make the Janissaries. \n \n They also say things like \"722: Leo III outlawed Judaism. [They don't mention that he wasn't a Pope, or that he was an Emperor... they just say \"Leo III\", when they were finished talking about popes] Jews were baptized against their will.\", but fail to show sources. Later, I found the actual source which was also very biased, and they also avoid calling him emperor. They want people to think it was the Pope Saint Leo III who was born around that time. On the site, they fail to mention the persecutions of Muslims. The site is not to be trusted.",

I would agree.\n\n \n Yes, it does. Marx was quite naive. He didn't account for human nature. :)\n \n \nHowever, communism in practice hasn't been so rosy. Stalin did murder 10's of millions, and every communist state I've ever heard of has done similar mass murders, been religiously intolerant, etc etc... I've heard that after the Chech Republic was taken over, they held mandatory classes in atheism.\n\n \n As I had said. that has more to do with the pre-existing culture more than anything as well. It seems that Communism was adopted in places like this because the people were fed up with how they were being treated before and revoted (sp), by it seems that they should have been more careful of the leaders they chose to replace the old ones. :)\n \n It seems that communism would work better if it were adopted by a culture which hadn't been based on authority as those were. Maybe that is why Socialism works better here than over there?\n \n \nThat is very misleading. 'Better' is the operative word, I think. We got along with the Hurons, because we we needed Native allies. In other words, because we were smarter and weaker - not because we were nicer.\n\n \n We were nice enough since one of my great-great-great grandmothers was a Micmac (On my mother's mother's side. :) ) \n \n \nThat's awful!\n\n \n Of course it is.

   "Funny how man don't have any right to say whether the child lives or dies... since he put the sperm there in the first place. In that aspect she did choose; she chose to have sex. Which in turn of course, produced the baby. So there you go pro-choicers, she made her choice. \n \n Now let's speak of something we all dread, responsibility and consequences. We are not on the playground any more people; it is time to quit blaming everyone and everything else, and start accepting what we have done. To say that the woman has the right to choose is true. She has the right to choose whether to have sex or not. GOD gave her that choice. Oh, cry the nay-sayers, \"But what if they were raped!\" Well I'd be willing to hear that argument, except for that only 2% of abortions are done by mothers who have been raped. So that point is extraneous. So let's say the other 98% did choose to have sex. Oh no, now they have a burd.... err baby. What to do? I know! Let's just kill him/her, right? I mean, I didn't want the thing; it wasn't my fault the condom broke! Or it's all that jerk man's fault, right? The plain and hard truth is that they made the choice (just as the man did) and they (together) have to bear the consequences. This means the man has made his choice too. Meaning now he has to support that child, and has to now figure out what kind of relationship he wants with the mother. That is so hard for people to accept though in this day in age. Where the media is always telling us, \"Oh abortion is fine! Those stupid conservatives just won't vote for it! Vote liberal instead!\" yeah... right. Why can't we just all say, \"Hey look, it was a mistake, but what a plethora of wonderful roads this can lead me down!\"? \n \n Furthermore, all of you pro-\"choice\" people need to get your arguments right (especially you charchuk). You are arguing for the right to kill babies (or fetus again in latin). You are saying, \"No, I'm arguing for the right to choose!\" Let me finish. By saying you are arguing on the right to choose, you are saying, \"Let wrong rein free!\" This nation will of course jump at the chance to have an abortion. It won't be those 2% of rape people either, and you know it. \n \n We as a nation were founded on Christian Principals. If only the media would label Christian with some other word society would jump at the chance to make this a \"Christian\" Nation again. Why you ask? Oh that's easy. Because being a Christian nation means having the freedom to do what is RIGHT. Which we all could use a little more of (all of us.. including me). Oh but that's not true freedom right? So basically you're saying you want to do what is wrong? Oh but who defines what is wrong?! Your head. God gave us this little thing called a conscious (or whoever you want to label him as). You are truly aware of what is right and wrong,. If you try to go against your conscious you have to constantly fight at it and state, \"that's not really wrong.\" But you never really believe it; not deep down. You spend your whole life fighting with yourself, and you die old and miserable. When you do what is right, you truly do feel free. So how are you advancing the cause of doing what is right by saying we all have the right to do what is wrong?\n \n Now you're probably saying, but the majority of people believe in abortion to some extent. This is true, but how about we show them what a *true* abortion is on TV, and let the American people decide for themselves. How about we state some side effects. We even have to put those on cigarettes now! Somehow I think you all know we would rally behind what is RIGHT. Why don't we just show a partial-birth abortion? Because it would never happen again after it was televised.\n \n Charchuk, you need to be a true man and take responsibility for your stance. You ARE and DO make a decision everytime you speak for pro-choice. There has never been a neutral side in any debate, and you certainly haven't been the first to create one. \n \n You, Charchuk, will respond with strong words -- but I want you to know I respect you as a person, and I respect your opinions (although I don't like them). If you ever needed any help I would help you (as long as the cause was right). I mean that. That is what being a true Christian, as well as being a true American is all about.\n \n Thank you for reading through this gargantuan post.\n \n shade",

   "I asked you &#8220;Okay but what part of a human being are you referring to as not physical? &#8220;\n \n \n\n Consciousness is not physical. Somebody who is unconscious is without mind. Simply because the zygote has brain waves doesn&#8217;t mean it has a mind. The mind is much later into pregnancy. The zygote to early fetus is unconscious; without mind. All the things going on in the brain are purely neurological. \n\n \n Since you are saying that the part of a human being that is not physical is consciousness, and everyone knows that a zygote has no consciousness, then you have just admitted and confirmed by your own words that a zygote is not a human being.\n \n You stated in post #11 in the Rabbi Brickner: You&#8217;re Wrong! Thread:\n \n \nThe conditions for human beings are to first of all be alive, be biologically human, and to be independent. The fetus is alive, biologically human, and independent. The sperm, however, is not independent- it&#8217;s part of the father. If you take it&#8217;s DNA it will match with the father&#8217;s DNA. \n\n \n I asked you this question:\n \n &#8220;I am asking if a scientist takes the DNA from an EGG and splices it into the DNA of a SPERM, would you say that is a human being&#8221;\n \n That would meet all of your conditions for human beings because:\n \n 1. It would be alive, no argument there.\n 2. It would be human since it has human DNA and came from a human.\n 3. I would be independent even according to your weird of independent being different since it would have exactly the same DNA as the reverse which you admitted was a human.\n \n But when I asked you if it was a human being you replied:\n \n \nNo, because you need the egg to grow. If you go into the nucleus of the egg and put it into the nucleus of the sperm, you&#8217;re not going to get a human (I would imagine). \n\n \n So again by your own definitions and statements, a cell with the same DNA as a zygote and meeting all the conditions you stated are necessary for a human being, you have denied it is human. \n \n You lose by your own words. Nothing left to debate.\n \n BTW you are pretty ignorant of American History. It was three-fifths, not three-quarters, and it is in our constitution which was written by our founding fathers, not enacted by legislation.\n \n For someone that was not going to debate with Charchuk any more, you sure do seem to be debating him a lot. :)",

You called males the \"donor.\" Women have the \"rights\" and men are donors. Yay! Women rule!\n\n \n In this case women have more rights. As I had said if the pregnacy were shared than it would be a different story. Your part in the pregnancy is much bigger.\n \n \nThree things: #1: I got your point about the t-shirt! #2: I could quote t-shirts too! #3: I \"can't\"?? What if I said pro-choice people \"can't\" about something?\n\n \n ???\n \n \n*mutters* And I thought I was stubborn.... *mutters*\n\n \n Wait until you get to know me better and then you can say that. :)\n \n \nWell, thank you! Since it's my choice, can I say I totally don't like abortions??\n\n \n That is your right.\n \n \nAlso, PLEASE explain why it's irrevelant! I know you won't get pregnant, you believe it's the woman's choice, and all that. But for someone who is spending so much timeon an abortion thread, for goodness sakes....! What would you do if I answered a question from you with \"it's irrelevant\", and the question was pretty important to you and the conversation?\n\n \n That is your right as well.

   "No unconscious means without, or below, awareness, not completely without a mind.\n\n \n Um, I haven't had a chance to wade through all 200 and some posts, but I am going to assume that you are arguing that a baby in vitro doers not have consciousness. This is wrong. We do not deveolp memories until about the time we acquire language. Because of this correlation, I believe that when we talk about things they furthur cement the pathways that retain memories. Every new experience creates these pathways, for example, we know that when we feel the urge to defecate we need to head to the restroom, but since most of us weren't able to call our friends and say \"Hey, I was just potty trained\", we don't remember the day and time. The repetition of our parents and our dislike of soiled clothes created the memory. In vitro, science knows that babies go through separate waking and sleeping cycles. Also, babies not only respond to stimulus outside of the womb but in different ways to different stimulus. At about four months when the doctor pins the baby in a corner of the womb to get its heartbeat, for example, it squirms with all its might to get away. But if you gently rub you stomach and talk to the child, it begins trying to respond back. I would imaging if a woman could carry a camera inside of her for nine months we could even see them playing with their first ball (the remains of the yolk sac).",

The main reason why I had said what you should have quoted is that for many centuries it was only the man who had a say in the pregnancy and not the woman at all. The reason behind this is because they had believed that all a woman did was to provide the \"soil\" for the man to plant his \"seed\" in so that it could grow. That it was ALL his and not the woman's at all so therefore she had no say. The man had all of the responsibility of a farmer in this regard. You still get a bit of a hold over on this mistaken belief even today.\n \n The woman is the one who has the biggest say in a pregnancy. She is the one who has to take all of the risks and dangers inherent in being pregnant. All us males do is provide a bit of DNA and that is it. And today a woman doesn't even need the male directly to get this either. If all of the human males disappear from the face of the Earth the human race still wouldn't be in danger of extinction either since there are other ways to provide the need DNA. The Ovm doesn't really care ( A figure of speech for those of you hung up on sementics. :) ) where the DNA comes from as long as it has the correct number of chromosomes. It could even come from another woman.\n \n \nGreat logic there!\n\n \n Men have always had mostly guilt-free sex. :)\n \n \nOr ignorance of what the result would be; for your side is arguing that nothing is produced but a little ball of cells.\n\n \n No, ignorance of sex since if properly educated the chances of an unwanted pregnancy are very low and thus no need to have an abortion.\n \n \nNot an issue, at least as far as the man is concerned. Why raise it? A man needed worry about the consequences of such an act; according to your world.\n\n \n According to the real world. Men have always had the instinct to have as many different mates as possible. Monogamy isn't exactly natural to humans. In fact only around 3% of all animals are truly monogamous. \n \n We're hard-wired for this since it insures that our genes get passed on. The only reason why the Church pushes monogamy is because it is much easier to control a man when he has just one family.\n \n The main reason why our females have hidden estrous (Breast always full and hips aways rounded, etc.) is to keep the male around longer and interested in her. Females who did this also got to pass their genes along more than the females who didn't. And another reason why there is a good chance that our offspring will look like the father than a the mother is to show that male that the female is \"loyal\" to him and thus his genes are protected. Both are a form of natural selection. A man isn't going to hung around for long to help raise another man's child. There is a very good reason for the high divorse rate in North America.\n \n Plus, incest makes for poor genetic survival.",

It's a red herring to the argument. I'm not going to argue the technicalities of abortion. The truth is by biogenesis and by biology the zygote is biologically, scientifically, medically, embryologically, and quite frankly logically, a human being. There is no other answer. Not to mention just having DNA doesn't make you human. My skin cells have my DNA. My organs have my DNA. My organs are \"alive\". \n \n \n So again by your own definitions and statements, a cell with the same DNA as a zygote and meeting all the conditions you stated are necessary for a human being, you have denied it is human.\n\n \n You see, you're confusing the issue. It's not just DNA that makes you human. If you just have DNA, and do not grow at all, you're not human. However, fusion and fertilization are different.

But what about? Just how not to pick up diseases? Mizmaxx would have young adults educated that the foetus is nothing but a collection of amalgams of cells. And this is the real world. As we don't yet have the education then men are committing acts based on lack of information.\n \n If men aren't responsible then again you've put more pressure on women as you're making a case to negate paternity cases; in court the judge would say \"No, the man doesn't need to pay up, as it's the woman who accepts 90% of the risk\"\n \n \n \nMen have always had mostly guilt-free sex.\n\n \n This is true. Why does that mean that women must continue with the burdens and decisions alone?\n \n \nNo, ignorance of sex since if properly educated the chances of an unwanted pregnancy are very low and thus no need to have an abortion.\n\n \n Not necessarily! Japan has a very high educational system, and so did the former Soviet Union. Both had/have high levels of abortion.\n \n In Japan there is a high degree of government resistance to contraceptives.\n \n \nAccording to the real world. Men have always had the instinct to have as many different mates as possible. Monogamy isn't exactly natural to humans. In fact only around 3% of all animals are truly monogamous. \n\n \n Maths arguments are your specialty.* There are more insects than mammals. Should we now eat our prey live?\n \n What has ?monogamy? got to do with abortions? Married women have abortions. Polygamous societies don?t necessarily practice abortion.\n \n \nWe're hard-wired for this since it insures that our genes get passed on. The only reason why the Church pushes monogamy is because it is much easier to control a man when he has just one family. \n\n \n We are more than mere collections of chemicals. Even for those who don?t believe in a soul.\n \n \nThe main reason why our females have hidden estrous (Breast always full and hips aways rounded, etc.) is to keep the male around longer and interested in her. Females who did this also got to pass their genes along more than the females who didn't. And another reason why there is a good chance that our offspring will look like the father than a the mother is to show that male that the female is \"loyal\" to him and thus his genes are protected. Both are a form of natural selection. A man isn't going to hung (sic) around for long to help raise another man's child. There is a very good reason for the high divorse (sic) rate in North America. \n\n \n There are lumps of truth here thrown together.\n \n Your a priori assumption is that we are simply being that act according to instincts. Again you?ve removed any notion of personal responsibility; that men react simply to boobs; if this were the case, then most women would lose out as the average cup size is only a ?B?.\n \n What has the fiction of ?natural selection? got to do with abortion? What is ?natural? about a decision of a human? isn?t that ?artificial??\n \n There is a very good reason for the high divorce rate? What is it?\n \n \n \n *I've added this in later...\n as you're so interested in demographics go look at http://www.adherents.com/\n knock yourself silly!",

It was three-fifths, not three-quarters, and it is in our constitution which was written by our founding fathers, not enacted by legislation.\n \n For someone that was not going to debate with Charchuk any more, you sure do seem to be debating him a lot.\n\n \n He did use the phrase \nAssuming he was correct, I stated that the legislative branch had passed it.\n\n \n Hank, Parcum seems to have got your blood boiled as you're pretty intent on sinking the boot in.\n \n Well he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword. \n \n You said on another thread...\n \n\"Survival of the fittest\" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified.\n\n \n And I showed you two sites that refute this (and they're by evolutionaries). Did I make then a big deal that you were wrong? No. Did you recant? No. \nYou just said I?m not sure what your point is. You seem to be upset that the term ?natural selection? is used when discussing evolution.\n You made it out that you didn't understand why I was talking about it. You made a statement. You were wrong.\n \n You made a mistake and won't admit it. Something you're accusing Parcum of doing. Yet, he made the mistake and admitted it. Did you gracefully accept this? No. You wanted to rub-it in a wee bit more.\n \n When on another forum I told you that in evolution there are several competing theories to the rise of man, some mutually exclusive you replied\n \n \nHowever the scientific community does not accept them in general. I could point out some crackpot Christian theorist.\n\n \n I gave YOU ample time to research this, and you didn't. I told you I'd discussed it earlier on this forum; did you bother to read it? No! You pass this off as crackpots. They're not 'crackpot' scientists. They are textbook examples.\n \n Did you admit your mistake? No.\n \n So, it's a laugh now you're putting the boot into Parcum, you who has scampered away from the debate we were having because rather than deal with the issues at hand, wanted to muddy them by raising new issues; re definition of 'kind' which\n a) I told you was already defined by me\n b) was not part of our current debate.\n \n So what'ya going do now? Say LOL and (yet still) sink the boot in again?\n \n Actually, you've already hit and run on this issue too! I believe you're circling around like a fly till you think you've found rotting meat.

Abortions before they were legal were often lethal to the mother as well. \n \n And in places and times where women couldn't induce them they would usually leave unwanted children (Usually girls) out on some hillside to die, usually from exposure (if they were lucky) or to be eatened by wild animals.\n \n Now tell me that what we do now isn't far more humane?\n\n \n So I replied so now's the time to legally kill unwanted children. Before it was legal, unwanted children were still getting killed by leaving them somewhere to die, to be eaten, etc. So now we just solved that problem by making the whole getting-rid-of-the-unwanted by making it all legal. \n \n \nThat's the problem, they don't want the children who are waiting to be adopted just because they aren't babies.\n\n \n I must agree.

In that way, you treated me as if though I was sixteen, and in many ways younger. If you were to treat me as an adult, you didn&#8217;t need to give me that post. You knew what you were doing. You were treating me as if though I was twelve or thirteen. And even now that you&#8217;ve lost, you can&#8217;t accept the fact that you&#8217;ve been beaten by somebody five or ten years younger than you. \n\n \n \n So in you next reply when you stated,\n \n \nThank you, Hank., I'm flattered. I will use your advice.\n\n \n that was basically a lie, right?\n \n \nIt&#8217;s an option; you have every right to leave the debate. But when the debate is far from finished, and there are many issues that you have ignored or refused to answer, and you leave, expect criticism. \n\n \n You haven&#8217;t brought anything new into the debate in a while. It&#8217;s not that I haven&#8217;t addressed every issue you have raised, it&#8217;s that you don&#8217;t like the answers. Well the answers aren&#8217;t going to change so it&#8217;s now just repeating the same thing over and over again. That makes it a waste of time and I&#8217;m interested in other debates where I can learn something.\n \n \nI don&#8217;t mind Hank criticizing me that I&#8217;ve been repeating my argument, or that I have no right to tell him he&#8217;s running away; it&#8217;s quite normal for those who have abandoned debates. However, to make such a generalizing statement as &#8220;You are ignorant because you mistook the 3/5ths Compromise with the 3/4ths compromise&#8221; is a last-minute ad hominem.\n\n \n You have every right to tell me I&#8217;m running away. That doesn&#8217;t mean you are correct, just that you have the right.\n \n I didn&#8217;t say you were ignorant because you mistook the 3/5ths compromise with the 3/4ths compromise. I said you were ignorant OF AMERICAN HISTORY because you mistook the 3/5ths compromise with the 3/4ths compromise, you said the Supreme Court was the one that said that, and then came back and said the legislature passed that. In the two sentences you made about American history, there were three errors. Then of all things, you state that you are an expert in history. The compromise was a major issue in American history. What you did was like saying you were an expert on George Washington but didn&#8217;t know he was in the military.\n \n Montalban thinks I&#8217;m trying to dig in the point. I&#8217;ll be glad to drop it but as long as you&#8217;re the one that keeps bumping it up to the top of the thread, I&#8217;ll be glad to accommodate you by commenting on your errors. :)",

Adoption doesn't solve eveything, but abortion certainly doesn't either. (And don't tell me that you agree and that pro-choice doesn't mean pro-abortion, because you refuse to answer whether you are pro-abortion or not.) But there are other problems to consider: girls getting pregnant waaaay too young (they shouldn't get pregnant when they are 14 in the first place!), for one thing. The problems MUST be solved.

She is pro-life, and she was born years before abortion, and she most certainly isn't being told what to do by all the men in her life - and those men aren't just guys working in some old factory or something! And don't tell me about the \"good old days.\" I was raised in a home that probably would have over-qualified for the definition of the \"good old days.\" And I'm not that old even. I had some problems with certain things, so I moved. And I'm still pro-life! By the way, there's a difference between \"women knowing their place,\" and family values.

It drops even further when birth control such as the comdoms (The newer plastic ones are far tougher and puncture proof) and the Pill as well as other devices are used.\n \n My sister put her two daughters on the Pill as soon as they were old enough and they didn't go out and start having sex right away. In fact many girls start the Pill even long before they start having sex because of the benefits of controlling their periods and its affects on acne as well. Modern women have far more periods than women did in the past (That is because in the past women didn't have reproductive rights to their own bodies).\n \n \nI will agree here. And I have a problem with that too. Adoption doesn't solve eveything, but abortion certainly doesn't either. (And don't tell me that you agree and that pro-choice doesn't mean pro-abortion, because you refuse to answer whether you are pro-abortion or not.)\n\n \n You want me to answer an irrelevant question. It doesn't matter at all if I'm for or against abortions since it isn't my body or my choice.\n \n \nBut there are other problems to consider: girls getting pregnant waaaay too young (they shouldn't get pregnant when they are 14 in the first place!), for one thing. The problems MUST be solved. Abortion doesn't solve them; it just gives the problems a temporary, easy way out.\n\n \n If you want to solve the problem then make sure they have proper sex ed. Just saying no won't cut it. BTW, 14 is the age of consent here in Canada.\n \n \nDid you read the names of those people from that link? One is Eunice Kennedy Shriver. She is pro-life, and she was born years before abortion,\n\n \n She was born centuries ago? Man, she's old. :)\n \n \n and she most certainly isn't being told what to do by all the men in her life - and those men aren't just guys working in some old factory or something!\n\n \n I didn't say that being a woman you had to choose to have an abortion. No one is forcing women here to have them.\n \n \nAnd don't tell me about the \"good old days.\" I was raised in a home that probably would have over-qualified for the definition of the \"good old days.\" And I'm not that old even. I had some problems with certain things, so I moved. And I'm still pro-life! By the way, there's a difference between \"women knowing their place,\" and family values. I pity whatever gave you your views.\n\n \n You had the option to move, but in the past you wouldn't of had even that. \n \n Then you pity the right-wing of the USA since that is where I got their idea of what traditional family values were. From the horse's mouth. To them a woman's place was at home taking care of the home and the chiildern.",

I'll be quite honest with you; I don't know too much about the 3/5ths compromise. Does that make me ignorant of American History? Of course not. That's ridiculous. Even further, I was only going to find out who passed it to give you information. In reality, you wasted my time.

   "We are taught that we're an independent nation and that the queen is only a figurehead. That we aren't directly subject to her. That our Constitution supercedes her. If it were otherwise most references would state it as such. We aren't a Constitutional monarchy is the strictest sense of the term. It is mainly a holdover of when we were still a part of the British Empire. Like having the Queen's face on most of our money. \n \n I have nothing to apologise for. I'm only saying what we were taught. At no time were we taught that Canada was a constitutional monarchy. When I was little they had said it was a Dominion, though. Also, the Union Jack is not a part of the official flag of our country either. If it were as close as you are trying to say than it would be. Though, I do see the Union Jack in your flag, so in that part I may have been mistaken. So, Australia isn't as independent as they claim. :) \n \n In all of this I am being quite honest. \n \n http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/as.html\n \n http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ca.html\n \n http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uk.html\n \n Which one of these actually says constitutional monarchy as their primary form of government?\n \n Our current relationship with England is through the Commonwealth of Nations.\n \n Commonwealth of Nations, or British Commonwealth;\n \n An association of nations consisting of the United Kingdom and its dependencies and many former British colonies that are now sovereign states but owe allegiance to the British Crown\n \n This is basically what the UN is as well, but the UN is more far reaching as to who its members are.\n \n If the USA had gradually worked its way to independence like most other British colonies eventually did then it probably would have been a member of the Commonwealth as well.\n\n \n You still don't get it. I said that being a constitutional monarchy, and a federation are not mutually exclusive. Re-quoting the CIA factbook doesn't prove your claim, because you said that we are not a constitutional monarchy, you said Canada isn't either. You are claiming exclusiveness, not I. Thus, you have shown we are a federation, and I agree, yes we are. I have shown you we are a constitutional monarchy. You disagree with this.\n \n I'm sorry you're so slow on the uptake.:)\n \n They are both. I've shown you that they are constitutional monarchies. \n \n Our own goverment says it!\n \n You even quote it yourself you XXXXX, they owe allegiance to the British Crown! Your own quote says it! We own allegiance to the British Crown, because Queen Elizabeth is our Queen! She's the Queen of Canada, and New Zealand.\n \n You need really to apologise for being an idiot; a consistant annoyance as well.\n \n But of course you won't. You'll just wear me out by denying the evidence, no matter how many sites I quote.\n \n \"The office of the Governor-General was established by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia.

The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\"\n \n http://www.dpmc.gov.au/docs/constitution.cfm#A2\n \n Even the movement in Australia to become a republic says\n \"Who is Australia's Head of State? \n Elizabeth II, the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is Australia's Head of State because: \n The Constitution of Australia defines the Parliament as \"the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives\" and vests the Federal legislative (law-making) power in the Parliament (section 1, Constitution). \"\n \n http://www.republic.org.au/ARM-2001/q&a/qa_hos.htm\n \n You quoting the CIA Factbook shows you've absolutely no comprehension of what I write.\n \n I did actually think you were in this for genuine debate. But alas, your so moronic you don't even know something that's so patent you just keep spouting the same mistakes.\n \n If you could actually show a site that says Australia is not a Constitutional Monarchy (instead of them saying its a Federation; which it is also), then you'd have a case. But you're so dense you don't understand that Australia is both. We are a number of things;\n Democracy\n Commonwealth\n Constitutional Monarchy\n Federation\n \n The Queen sits as monarch of Britain\n of Australia\n and as Head of the Commonwealth\n \n Thus India, which is a federation, and a demoracy and a republic (try and keep up with this; it can be more than one), is still in the Commonwealth.\n It is a republic, not headed by the queen, but is in the Commonwealth, headed by the queen! (That should really be above your pea-brain to grasp)\n \n None of these excludes the other. It's such a shame you've wasted so much space based on this fundamental misunderstanding. I had hoped that we would continue this debate on the appropriate thread as many people here are wanting to debate abortion.\n \n I'm sorry you've no wish to apologise for being so totally wrong.\n \n You did say you were taught something. Fine. I gave you ample information saying both\n a) what you were taught is correct, but not the whole story\n b) the rest of the story\n And you still wanted to debate\n Even now you qualify any admission you're trying to make by saying that I should look at the CIA Factbook and show you where is says Constitutional Monarchy.\n \n I had told you a number of times that it's not mutually exclusive, and even here you're still going on with it.\n \n No wonder you feel no need to apologise. You can't. How honest are you!\n \n And having the Union Jack in our flag has no direct relation to our type of government.\n Because;\n Canada doesn't have it, and is a Constitutional Monarchy\n Australia has it, and is a Constitutional Monarchy\n Fiji does have it, and is a Republic.\n Hawaii has it, and is a US state.\n \n You're making even more errors rather than apologise for the ones already made.",

   "If I tell a girl that she's pretty when she's really ugly, does that make me a liar? \n\n \n There is a program on the radio called the Phil Henri show that I can pick up late Saturday nights. He has someone that works for him that disguises his voice somewhat for different characters. They start with some scenario like he is one of those people that found parts off the shuttle when it crashed several months ago and because of that he is part of the space program. People that have never heard the program before call in and debate this guy as Phil Henri pretends to get more and more upset with him. The people calling in get terribly irate as the guy makes more and more outlandish claims. It&#8217;s hilarious as he continues to just jerk their chain and they never seem to catch on no matter how ridiculous it gets. You are asking if you tell a lie, does that make you a liar.

   "Quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n So we support it anyway? Criminals will rob banks with or without laws. So should we make robbing banks legal? Of course not. That's ridiculous. Secondly, women are always having backalley abortions. They're having them right now, and in reality it isn't much different from legal abortions. Many women die from legal abortions as well as illegal ones. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n This is the worst comparison ever. First of all, robbing banks is detrimental to society (people get hurt, finacial losses, funds more crime), while abortions are not. Fetuses are a dime a dozen. We can always make more of them. It doesn't matter if we abort a few of them. Secondly, I dont think you are understanding my arguement judging by the way you refuted it. If we outlawed abortions, we would leave no choice but for women have illegal ones. Therefore, this would increase the number of dangerous and unsanitary illegal abortions. \n \n Quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Yes, we should. Although it was invoulentary manslaughter, it is still manslaughter.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Parcum is right. Not under the law. After every miscarriage are we going to have a criminal investigation? What about people who will go into Canada or Mexico to get rid of their fetus. Are they going to be subpeoned into court? This law would never stand. Useless laws like this one would weaken the others that are actually needed.\n \n Ill post more later\n PEACE",

You gave me a part of the definition that you liked, and took out the one that supported my argument! \n \n \n I only support her right to choose, all else is irrlevant. You support a person's right to have a firearm, does this also mean that you support them using it to shoot anyone they please as well?\n\n \n Although I could easily play your game and say \"apples and oranges', I wont, because I'm not a XXXXX. I support the right for people to have a gun. Therefore, I am pro-gun. I always say that. Many people define themselves as \"pro-gun\", and sometimes \"anti-gun control\".

For instance, robbing a bank is illegal. Having an abortion would be illegal. The robber has a risk of getting shot. The mother has a risk of dying. Under your argument, you're saying that because the woman could die, abortion should be legal. Should we then make robbing banks legal, so save the lives of robbers \n \n \n How many of them also were drug addicts and worse?\n\n \n Red herring. The point is that they do happen.

   "savagism is simply a behavior.\n\n \n What exactly about the behavior of your ancestors made them more \"savage\" than the Spanish who massacred them? Have you read Las Casas?\n \n Besides, the invaders called all First Nations savages, regardless of their behavior.\n \n \nThat wasn't the reason. They killed them because they were Catholic and foreign. You know this. Don't try to make up history and state excuses that never were issues.\n\n \n Um, what are you talking about? What do you mean \"I know this\"? I'm making up history? Have you read the Jesuit Relations? I have, and I can assure you that the Jesuits admit to infecting Deer People (Huron) who would not convert with smallpox. They were also aware that the Deer people wanted them to leave them alone, to leave their villages, because their presence meant certain death-\n \n \nComplaints are surfacing in France against the Jesuits. \n The Jesuits do damage control by writing to France. The Jesuit say that a few French colonists have written to French relatives saying the Savages (The People) say:\n \n \"Thou sayest one must not steal, and yet the French have taken such and such things\".\n \n \"Thou sayest drunkards will go into the fires of hell, then such and such a one will be damned, for he is always drunk\".\n \n The contagion caused a great many Huron to die, imagined the French were the cause of their death. An Algonquian reported that Monsieur de Champlain had told Montagnez just before he died, that he would take away with him the whole country of the Huron. \n Epidemics are attributed to the Jesuit vengeance, saying that we only went up to the country in order to sacrifice every one of their bodies to the soul of Estienne Brusle (I)-Etienne Brule (1592-1732), whom they had wickedly assassinated. \n The French had bewitched a cloak or robe (infested with smallpox), and had buried it at Three Rivers, but in such a place that they suspected, and rightly, that the Huron, as they were great thieves, would take it away, which they did. Having carried it to their own country, they bore thither at the same time the pestilence and contagion. (It is noteworthy that Europeans were aware that blankets used by smallpox patients can spread the disease.) \n (...)\n The first two of six boys recruited into the first Jesuit Residential School in Kebec died mysteriously. It is said that it is the result of a beating by the Jesuit. The Jesuit admit a blow was struck against both children but not sufficient to cause death. The Jesuits claim they died because of a change of occupation, change of air and overindulgence of good food. One of the boys was Satouta grandson of Tsondechaaouanouan a leader of fishing. Tsiko was the son of Ouanda Koca a great speaker. Three young Huron girls are sent to France and the Huron (Wendat) request some Frenchmen come to the Wendat Country but are denied based on transparent excuses. The Wendat wonder if the Wendat and French are one people like the French so often have said. An Algonquin brought the news to the Wendat of the death of the two boys at Kebec. \n The Jesuits say the Savage Barbarians (The People) have the law of asses. They are born, live and die in liberty. They do not know what is meant by bridle and bit. The Jesuit's believe they must place a yoke on the Barbarians (The People's) neck. A yoke of obedience and submission like the French peasants. The Jesuit believed if the 'Savages' (People) stopped wandering and gave authority to one of them to rule the others, we would see them converted and civilized in a short time. (...)\n \n The Jesuits are astonished that if you offend one Barbarian (People) the least among them, they consider themselves all equally offended.\n \n The Jesuits are teaching the children of the People that their parents practice ridiculous abominable ceremonies that are demoniac. They say the Wendat practice gluttony. Father (I)-Jean de Brebeuf (1593-1649) however says the food offered by the savages (People) appears too much to eat but when one becomes somewhat accustomed to it, there is not too much. The children are taught that any act of rudeness, they should attribute that action to the Huron (Wendat) culture. \n \n An elder attempted to convince the Jesuit to return to France, and restricted them from giving the dying children sweetmeat as a pretext to baptism. \"The cry is raised on all sides that our presence is unendurable, and that our heads must be split.\" (The Jesuit don't realize that the greatest sin among the People, is lying.) \n \n A Montagnez elder said; before the Black Robes came to this country, many of the French died; but since these came they do not die, and, on the contrary, we die. \n\n \n What if I came to your town, insisted that you all convert to paganism, taught your children that you were evil, beat them, converted them behind your back, tried to overthrow your leaders, and if you didn't comply, infected you all with a horrible deadly illness? Frankly, that the Jesuits lasted as long as they did can only be a testament to how tolerant and amiable the Wendat were.\n \n \nIf your assertion was the case, the Jesuits wouldn't be proclaimed martyrs by the Church, but they were. \n\n \n LOL. Why? Do you think the Catholic Church's policies in the 1670s concerning First Nations people would have given them a second's pause to wonder whether it was really a good idea to send people off to annoy, harrass, and eventually murder First Nations people? I seriously doubt it.\n \n These people came to their villages, imposed to stay with them as guests, and were in every way possible rude, disrespectful, and dangerous. They admit that the elders repeatedly entreated them to leave, because of the disease they spread, and because of their behaviour, but to no avail. They caused their own deaths.\n \n \nThey make it seem as it though millions practiced it, when it was probably more like a few thousand. It was such a minor issue, and has been completely bloated.\n\n \n Yeah, well, not that many people were actually in Auschwitz. I guess people should just shut up about that little Holocaust thing, stop blowing it out of proportion... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n People still practice the Sundance, BTW. \n \n I guess you think it's ok that your ancestors were massacred, and your people continue to suffer the effects of colonization, but other people actually care about their people, and have some pride in who they are.",

And at any rate, if an Indian stood by a white man, it doesn't mean they're going to get small pox! \n \n Here are some Jesuit MARTYRS\n \n  John de Brebeuf was born in Normandy in 1593. He was one of the first three Jesuits assigned to the Canadian mission. He preached among the Hurons, beginning in 1625, at first with no success. In 1633, he made another attempt, which lasted for nearly sixteen years, and was slightly more successful. In 1648 he was joined by Gabriel Lalemant. Lalemant had been born in Paris in 1610, and joined the Jesuits in 1630, but because of bad health was not sent to Canada until 1646. After two years in Quebec, he joined de Brebeuf on the Huron Mission in 1648, the following spring, the two priests were captured in an Iroquois raid and taken to what is now the village of Saint-Ignace in Ontario, where they were horribly tortured. De Brebeuf survived only a few hours, and died 16 March 1649. His frailer companion, Lalemont, lived through the night and died the following day. A contemporary wrote, \"There was no part of his body that was not burnt, even his eyes, for the villains had forced burning embers into the sockets.\"\n \n Clearly, this wasn't about small pox. \n \n \nWhat if I came to your town, insisted that you all convert to paganism, taught your children that you were evil, beat them, converted them behind your back, tried to overthrow your leaders, and if you didn't comply, infected you all with a horrible deadly illness? Frankly, that the Jesuits lasted as long as they did can only be a testament to how tolerant and amiable the Wendat were.\n\n \n I said Jesuit MARTYRS, not Jesuit BEATERS. Don't confuse them. Sure, Jesuits did some bad things. But again, that was later. \n \n \n LOL. Why? Do you think the Catholic Church's policies in the 1670s concerning First Nations people would have given them a second's pause to wonder whether it was really a good idea to send people off to annoy, harrass, and eventually murder First Nations people? I seriously doubt it.\n \n \n Most of the Jesuits weren't proclaimed martyrs or canonized until the 20th century. Secondly, the Jesuits never listen to the Pope. They listen to their superiors. Sure, the Pope can send them, but usually it was the Kings of France and Spain who sent Jesuits off to convert the American Indians. It was never the Catholic Church's policy to annoy, harass, and murder. It was corrupt leaders who did that, very rarely the popes, and never the Church. \n \n \n Yeah, well, not that many people were actually in Auschwitz. I guess people should just shut up about that little Holocaust thing, stop blowing it out of proportion... People still practice the Sundance, BTW. \n\n \n Sundance and Auschwitz are two different things. People practice Sundance now because it's legal, now. \n \n \n I guess you think it's ok that your ancestors were massacred, and your people continue to suffer the effects of colonization, but other people actually care about their people, and have some pride in who they are.\n\n \n Mizmax, I completely understand that many Native Americans were treated badly, but at the same time it's very true that many Native Americans were cruel people. The Cherokees were very cruel, and I showed, the Iroquois were very cruel as well. You can't just say that the Europeans were the only cruel ones, because that was simply not the case.",

You can't just post some little Catholic bedtime story as evidence. Again, you should read the Jesuit Relations. Do you know what I'm talking about?\n\n \n I know precisely what you're talking about. Those quotations are out of context- firstly, those weren't the Jesuits martyred. Quite frankly, I very much dislike the modern day Jesuits, and in the past they have done hideous things. But as I've said before, the Indians were nonetheless very cruel to the missionaries:\n \n  \"Walk ahead,\" growled one of the tall warriors as he motioned with his finger to Ondessonk. Father Jogues took a few steps and turned around. He saw the Iroquois draw out a tomahawk from beneath his blanket. Instantly the savage swung it high in the air and brought it down with a crash into the head of Goupil. Rene' staggered a step and calling out, \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!\" he fell to the ground. Two more vicious blows from a crimsoned hatchet extinguished the last breath of life in Rene' Goupil.\n \n  When the Mohawks discovered that their [Jesuit] prisoner was gone, they flew into a rage. They threatened the Dutch that they would burn down their homes and slaughter everyone in them if Ondessonk were not returned.\n \n \n  In the almost deserted village of Ossernenon, meanwhile, a small violent group of the Bear clan secretly plotted to kill the captives before any decision could be reached by the council. They cunningly sought out Ondessonk and invited him to enjoy a meal at their lodge. To refuse an invitation was a grievous offense. He placed his confidence totally in Divine Providence, and courageously proceeded to the Bear cabin. As he lifted the door flap and stooped to enter the lodge, an assailant within raised his hatchet. An Iroquois who had accompanied Father Jogues tried to ward off this assault, but a fierce blow sliced the protector's arm and struck the head of the saintly priest, felling him to the ground. In an instant, the martyrdom of Father Isaac Jogues had been completed. The Group of murderers immediately cut off his head and stuck it on one of the palisade posts of the village. His venerable body was then thrown into the Mohawk River.\n \n From the exultant cries of the warriors John de Lalande suspected what had happened. Shortly, word was brought to the Wolf cabin where John had remained....Father Jogues was dead. The young donne' prayed for the strength he needed to likewise suffer whatever God willed him to endure. he longed to search for the blessed martyr's body before it was completely mutilated or lost, but while in the custody of his sympathetic Iroquois guards, this was for the moment impossible.\n \n When the evening's clamor had subsided and all in his lodge were asleep, John silently made his way out the door to find his beloved Father Isaac. But his first step from the cabin was his last step toward eternity. An awaiting savage of the Bear clan split his head with a mighty stroke of his tomahawk. His head was cut off and placed on the palisade next to Father Jogues' and his body was also thrown into the river.  The Eight North American Martyrs\n \n \n  1657.-One hundred Mohawk warriors set out from their country in the spring of 1657 to carry out the agreement, thirty of who enter the town of Quebec, and in the presence of the French Governor summon the Hurons to follow them. A day and the following night were passed in deliberation. The Clan of the Cord, former inhabitants of the mission of Teanaosta\u00efa\u00e9, or St.-Joseph II, in old Huronia, positively refused to leave Quebec and thus separate themselves from their French allies. The Rock Clan, or Arendarrhonons, the former mission of St-Jean Baptiste, reluctantly chose the Onondaga country for their future home, while the Bear Claw half-heartedly resolved to throw in their lot with the Mohawks (Rel. 1657: Queb. ed. 20; Clev. Ed. XLIII, 187, 191), and Father Simone Le Moyne, the \"Ondesonk\" of the Indians, volunteered to accompany them. On 2 June fourteen Huron women and many little children embarked in the canoes for the Mohawks, and set out with them for their newly adopted country (Journ. des J\u00e9s., 215; Clev. ed., XLIII, 49). About fifty Huron Christians of the Rock Clan left Quebec on 16 June for Montreal, where they were to await the arrival of the Iroquois flotilla which was to transport them (Rel 1657: Queb. ed., 23, 2; Clev. ed. XLIII, 207). On 26 July this same party, with Father Ragueneau, set out with a band of fifteen or sixteen Senecas and thirty Onondagas for the country of the latter. On 3 August, while on the way, seven Huron Christians were treacherously set upon and murdered, and the women and children were made captives (Rel 1657: Queb. ed.,54, 55; Clev. ed. XLIV, 69, 73). Elsewhere it is said that all were massacred, meaning, probably, all the men in the party (Rel 1658: Queb. ed., 15, 2; Clev. ed. XLIV, 217).For other mention of this treacherous act, see passim, the same Relation (Queb. ed., 2, 2; 5, 1; 10; Clev. ed. Id, 155, 165, 191). On 21 August a party of Hurons, of the Bear Clan, left Quebec to join the Mohawks under the impression that they were to be adopted into the tribe (Rel 1658: Queb. ed., 9, 2; Clev. ed. XLIV, 189). On 26 August Father Le Moyne followed with the second party of the Bear Clan. Both these bands, in violation of the most solemn pledges, were reduced to the vilest and most oppressive slavery (Id: Queb. ed., 13, 2; Clev. ed. 205). Catholic Encyclopedia\n \n \n  In the meantime the Iroquois were making constant raids upon the Huron missions about Georgian Bay, as also upon the partly missionized tribes of the lower St. Lawrence. In 1648, a grand army of invasion of at least 1500 Iroquois warriors, largely armed with guns, swept over the Huron country, and within a few months had practically destroyed the tribe, burning the towns and missions, slaughtering hundreds upon hundreds of their people, carrying off 700 captives in one body and whole town populations later, and killing the missionaries, Daniel, Garnier, Lallemant, and the great Brebeuf. Between then and 1675 they wiped out in the same way the Tionontati (1650), Neutrals (1651), Erie (1655), and at last after a long and hard conflict the Conestoga (1675), all of their own kindred stock, those left alive being incorporated into the Iroquois towns. At the same time they were carrying on almost equally desolating warfare with the Mohican on the east, the Algonquin and Ottawa in the North, the Illinois in the far distant West, and the Cherokee, Tutelo and Catawba in the South, while keeping the whole French colony of Canada under a constant terror. They were careful, however, to maintain friendship with the Dutch and the later English, from whom they obtained their war supplies. A careful estimate by Greenhalgh in 1677 gave them then about 2150 warriors-perhaps 8000 souls-of whom, according to Jesuit authorities, nearly one-half were incorporated captives. In 1656, during a brief truce with Canada, a Jesuit mission colony was established among the Onondaga at their own request, with Father Le Mercier as superior, but two years later, upon the discovery of an intended massacre and general descent upon Canada, the mission was secretly abandoned. Another truce, consequent upon a successful expedition by De Tracy, gave brief opportunity for re-establishment, and in 1668 there were three missions in the Iroquois country.  Catholic Encyclopedia\n \n \n \n \n Auschwitz is in Poland. What aside from location is the difference between First Nations reserves and Jewish work-camps? Hitler did actually use the reserve system as inspiration for his plans for the extermination of Jewish peoples, as did the Afrikaners use the reserves as a model for the South African Apartheid township system. So what's the difference? Genocide is genocide, the where and when are irrelevant to that.\n\n \n Our reserves are not required here; all Indians can merge into society as much as they want. The reserves the Nazis invented were extermination reserves, while the ones the Americans invented were so that Indians have their own land and laws. It has absolutely nothing to do with racism, it's simply giving land to the Native Americans. The Germans never did that! The whites in South Africa didn't do that! \n \n \n Everybody can be cruel. It's one thing to be a jerk in your own house. That's not good, but it's still not the same thing as going uninvited to someone else's home, robbing, torturing, infecting and massacring them, then accusing them of cruelty when they try to get rid of you.\n\n \n You must understand that this is simple what happens. Bigger nations take over smaller nations. Everyone has done this and is doing this. IF this never happened, France would never exist, Italy would never exist, Israel, Iraq and all the Middle Eastern nations, many African nations, Spain, the UK, India, none of these nations would exist. When the colonists first came to America, the Indians were not welcome. It is simply a fact (Roanoke Disaster, Potomac, et cetera).\n \n \n Let's face it, the Europeans were like world's worst houseguests. If they ended up dead, maybe they should have thought twice about invading other people. It's dangerous business, and they're bound to retaliate.\n\n \n One could easily say the same about the Japanese and Muslims. It's just in recent history, the Europeans have been more powerful.",

Especially during the winter when the island is deserted except for locals, there used to be a great, lonely, almost bleak feel that made the tragedies that occurred there that much more vivid. I liked that - it's harder to get that feel there lately with so much development. I realized that most of the people who had worked on the problem were British historians/scholars of British history and not Indian experts - yet Roanoke became an Indian story once the colonists left the island and entered the territory of various nations. My expertise is the Indian southeast, so I wanted to tackle the problem to see if I could understand it differently by looking at it from a new angle. What I discovered was shocking! Which is that there was not one mystery, but two and that to claim to solve the mystery of the Lost Colony, fully three questions had to be answered: 1) Why were the colonists lost? 2) Why were they never found? 3) Where were they? \n \n Question number one was never answered by historians, other than to brush the question away with illogical arguments that were too easily refuted.Yet the evidence was there...the colonists (116 men, women, and children) were in trouble from the moment they left England. What had gone wrong? We also know that Jamestown search parties were sent looking for them years later and found them. Jamestown officials and officials in England knew exactly where they were  - yet no rescue was undertaken and instead there was a cover-up.Yet despite this evidence, for over sixty years, historians have preferred to tell us that the Powhatan nation of the Chesapeake Bay killed the colonists. It simply didn't happen. So why have 85% of the original documents - the evidence, the clues - been discarded? Maybe that's another mystery. \n \n Thus the story that emerged directly from the evidence is a chilling story of betrayal and sabotage, mutiny and murder, spy rings and intrigue involving the highest levels of Queen Elizabeth's government. It was clear that someone wanted the Lost Colonists dead and went to great lengths to effect it - but who? And why? \n \n The third and final question took a bit of ethnohistorical detective work and really brings out a very complex picture of the Indian southeast - an area that generally gets skipped over in most history books or, at best, is portrayed in a flat, simplistic manner. But this was a vibrant, multi-layered region with very strong mercantile nations within it with their own systems of power and politics and agendas that were every bit as much a reckoning force as England. \n \n I've since received a whole lot of fan mail from lawyers - and even a comment from someone in the FBI - that Roanoke is a great piece of detective work and were it presented as a case at the bar...would probably win. The praise has been great. But the Lost Colony has never before been approached like the detective story it is: it is America's oldest mystery! It is a missing persons case on a colossal scale and primary evidence (primary documentation) cannot be ignored. From this point forward, solutions can no longer be offered that do not answer all three questions or 'make sense' only by throwing out most of the data. \n\n (emphasis mine, BTW)\n \n \nBut what do you expect the Spanish to think of them when they sacrifice people? \n\n \n We could get into a whole other debate about whether these \"sacrifices\" occured, but suffice to say that based on the history of the Spanish at the time, the Spanish were (at least) just as savage as the Aztecs. Therefore (the question you have still not answered), how can one savage culture \"civilize\" another savage culture?\n \n \nIt's simply a fact. Don't you agree? If the Franks hadn't invaded Gaul, there would be no France(...)\n\n \n As I said, things happened, there is no changing the past. Whether any of it was good is a matter of opinion and perspective. \n \n I do disagree with the statement that such behaviour has \"always existed\", and is inevitable. You use Europe as an example, but the world is large, and the time of colonization is only a tiny blip in the history of the world, especially if you look outside Europe. \n \n As for there being \"no France\", well surely there would be something else, as people lived there and had political systems prior to colonization. Something else would exist in the place of France. \n \n My statement that things would be better was referring to colonization in the historic sense of the \"colonial period\" up to today. Economic colonization is a draining economic system- that's the point of it. The purpose of colonization is the extraction of resources for the enrichment of the wealthy of the invading nation. This impoverishes the invaded nation. Thus, colonized Nations would be much better off had they not been colonized into poverty.",

   "if you don't have a catechism how do you keep track of what you believe?\n\n \n Well, my spirituality has very specific, very strict general guidelines rather than specific enumerated beliefs. The down side of this is that I can't just look something up in a book or a list to see what to do. However, similarly to how you would have a Church elder/priest (I don't remember the Orthodox term), we have Elders. Of course, sometimes even our Elders don't agree, and ultimately it is our choice.\n \n Since you say you're interested, fundamentally the beliefs can be stated as follows-\n \n Life is a cycle/wheel/web, and all parts of the cycle are divine and to be respected. The medicine wheel is a common way to describe many different Nations traditional beliefs, these vary slightly in terms of how they define areas of the wheel, etc., but are essentially the same. The Medicine Wheel teaches us not only about the cycle of our growth (infant/youth/adult/elder), geography (north/east/south/west), but also how to heal psychologically/emotionally/spiritually, and what the path of our lives is. Sometimes animals are ascribed to the different areas of the wheel, according to the characteristics we see from each animal; these animals then become our teachers and we can observe them (meditate on them, etc.) for this purpose. Balance is an integral part of understanding the Medicine Wheel. \n \n The other most important parts of our beliefs IMO are-\n \n -land/\"resources\"/nature cannot be owned, but it is to be shared.\n -land/nature/flora-fauna are life, god, etc. because with them is connected our lives; when they are sick and off balance so are we, if they die, we die.

   "If the ones who civilized the savages were civilized themselves. Not all Europeans were savages- not all American Indians were savages.\n\n \n So then by that logic, the \"non-savage\" First Nations people \"civilized\" the \"savage\" Europeans as much as vice-versa.\n \n \nIt is vital, though, that we here define what is meant by the term \"heretic\". According to Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary, this is a heretic: \"One who holds or advocates controversial opinions, esp. one who publicly opposes the officially accepted dogma of the Roman Catholic, Church.\" Or, as one author has put it, \"Heresy, to a Catholic, is anti-Catholic truth found in the Bible.\"B Another summarized the official stance as this: \"Every citizen in the empire was required to be a Roman Catholic. Failure to give wholehearted allegiance to the pope was considered treason against the state punishable by death.\"C\n \n From 1200 to 1500 the long series of Papal ordinances on the Inquisition, ever increasing in severity and cruelty, and their whole policy towards heresy, runs on without a break. It is a rigidly consistent system of legislation: every Pope confirms and improves upon the devices of his predecessor. All is directed to the one end, of completely uprooting every difference of belief... The Inquisition ... contradicted the simplest principles of Christian justice and love to our neighbor, and would have been rejected with universal horror in the ancient Church.D\n \n Pope Alexander IV established the Office of the Inquisition within Italy in 1254. The first inquisitor was Dominic, a Spaniard who was the founder of the Dominican order of monks.\n \n The Inquisition was purely and uniquely a Catholic institution; it was founded far the express purpose of exterminating every human being in Europe who differed from Roman Catholic beliefs and practices. It spread out from France, Milan, Geneva, Aragon, and Sardinia to Poland (14th century) and then to Bohemia and Rome (1543). It was not abolished in Spain until 1820.E\n \n The Inquisition was a terrifying fact of life to those who lived in areas where it was in force. That domain would eventually include not only much of Europe, but also the far-flung colonies of Europe's Catholic powers.\n \n The Inquisition, led by the Dominicans and the Jesuits, was usually early on the scene following each territorial acquisition of the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the 16th and 17th centuries. The methods used, which all too often were similar to those used by Serra in California or the Nazi-backed Ustashis in Croatia, sowed the seeds of reaction and aversion that have proved to be a barrier for true missionaries ever since.\n \n Albert Close writes of the Jesuit mission to Indonesia in 1559 that \"conversion was wonderfully shortened by the cooperation of the colonial governors whose militia offered' the natives the choice of the musket ball or of baptism.\"\n \n Everywhere it existed, the \"Holy Office\" of the Inquisition spread its tentacles of fear.\n \n When an inquisitor arrived in an area he called for reports of anyone suspected of heresy, sometimes offering rewards to spies who would report suspected heretics. Those suspected were imprisoned to await trials. The trials were held in secret and the inquisitor acted as judge, prosecutor, and jury. The accused had no lawyer. It was often simpler to confess to heresy than to defend oneself, especially since torture was often employed until the accused was ready to confess.\n \n Because church and state had not been kept separate, the church powers could call upon the government to use its power against the convicted heretics. Anyone who fell back into heresy after repentance was turned over by the Inquisition to the regular government to be put to death. Most of those condemned to death were burned at the stake, but some were beaten to death or drowned. \n \n The Inquisition was called the sanctum officium (Holy Office) because the church considered its work so praiseworthy.F\n \n Even after the death of a victim, his punishment was not ended. The property of condemned heretics was confiscated, leaving his family in poverty.\n \n It is important here to emphasize Rome's role in the brutality of the Inquisition. Roman Catholic apologists are quick to point out that it was the state that put heretics to death. This is an alibi meant to excuse the Vatican's role in the atrocities. However, Dollinger, the leading 19th century Catholic historian, stated: \"The binding force of the laws against heretics lay not in the authority of secular princes, but in the sovereign dominion of life and death over all Christians claimed by the Popes as God's representatives on earth, as [Pope] Innocent III expressly states it.\"G\n \n In other words, the secular arm of the state acted only as it was pressured to do so by the popes. Even kings who hesitated to commit genocide on their own populaces were spurred into action by their fear of papal excommunication or subversive Catholic activities within their kingdoms.\n \n Dollinger continues: \"It was the Popes who compelled bishops and priests to condemn the heterodox to torture, confiscation of their goods, imprisonment, and death, and to enforce the execution of this sentence on the civil authorities, under pain of excommunication,\"H\n \n Will Durant informs us that in 1521 Leo X issued the bull Honestis which \"ordered the excommunication of any officials, and the suspension of religious services in any community, that refused to execute, without examination or revision, the sentences of the inquisitors.\" Consider Clement V's rebuke of King Edward II: \"We hear that you forbid torture as contrary to the laws of your land. But no state law can override canon law, our law. Therefore I command you at once to submit those men to torture.I\n \n The methods used by the Inquisition ranged from the barbaric to the bizarre. \n \n When the inquisitors swept into a town an \"Edict of Faith\" was issued requiring everyone to reveal any heresy of which they had knowledge. Those who concealed a heretic came under the curse of the Church and the inquisitors' wrath. Informants would approach the inquisitors' lodgings under cover of night and were rewarded for information. No one arrested was ever acquitted.\n \n Torture was considered to be essential because the church felt duty-bound to identify from the lips of the victims themselves any deviance from sound doctrine. Presumably, the more excruciating the torture, the more likely that the truth could be wrung from reluctant lips. The inquisitors were determined that it was \"better for a hundred innocent people to die than for one heretic to go free\".\n \n \"Heretics\" were committed to the flames because the popes believed the Bible forbade Christians to shed blood. The victims of the Inquisition exceeded by hundreds of thousands the number of Christians and Jews who had suffered under pagan Roman emperors.J\n \n This wanton slaughter of innocent people was justified by Catholic theologians such as \"Saint\". Thomas Aquinas, who said, \"If forgers and other malefactors are put to death by the secular power, there is much more reason for putting to death one convicted of heresy.\" In 1815, Comte Le Maistre defended the Inquisition by advocating: \"The Inquisition is, in its very nature, good, mild, and preservative. It is the universal, indelible character of every ecclesiastical institution; you see it in Rome, and you can see it wherever the true Church has power.\"K Such a viewpoint could only be expressed by one so brainwashed as to think that the cruel, torturous deaths of dissidents to Catholicism is preferable to the survival and propagation of those who would challenge the Vatican's authority.\n \n Yet, not all Romanists have been comfortable with the totalitarian nature of their \"church\". Even Jean Antoine Llorente, secretary to the Spanish Inquisition from 1790-92, was to admit: \"The horrid conduct of this Holy Office weakened the power and diminished the population of Spain by arresting the progress of arts, sciences, industry, and commerce, and by compelling multitudes of families to abandon the kingdom; by instigating the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors, and by immolating on its flaming shambles more than 300,000 victims.\"L\n\n \n The Spanish Inquisition was horrible and tragic. I don't know enough about it to say whether or not it was genocide. My point was that if you kicked someone in the shins, it really isn't your place to say that they're really not as hurt as they say. Your place is to apologise.\n \n What this is about is more your unwillingness to see anything the Catholic Church did or does as genocidal or even problematic.",

   "So then by that logic, the \"non-savage\" First Nations people \"civilized\" the \"savage\" Europeans as much as vice-versa.\n\n \n The civilized Europeans civilized the savage American Indians. \n \n \nIsn't the Pope the Catholic Church?\n\n \n Okay, we must understand that there were several kinds of inquisitions. There were the Albigensian Inquisitions, which had the papal approval, and the Spanish Inquisitions, which had indirect approval, but then the King and QUeen of Spain took over and did it on their own. We get Inquisition from the bible, actually, when God had Moses kill several people during the exodus who decided to create their own Gods. The Albigensian Inquisition, however, was more justified than that. The Catharsists actually THREATENED the Catholics, and KILLED them under two of their Dukes, both named Raymond (the second and third?)*. The Catharists had threatening beliefs- they believed in the \"GOod\" God of the new testament, and the \"evil\" God of the old, who created this world and all the temptations. It threatened society, because the smallest things could be awful sins that were punishable by death- heaven's gate-styled suicide was common. Further, they didn't allow Catholics to go to mass, which was already in France's tradition for a thousand years. So, under the order of preachers (Dominicans) an Inquisition was set out**. \n \n The Spanish Inquisition was simply to stop people from taking high-ranking governmental jobs who were not Catholic. In Spain, you had to be Catholic to have a government job, so many Jews and Muslims would lie, and Isabelle saught to stop this. \n \n But it wasn't really the Pope who was doing all this damage, it was mainly the leaders of Europe. For instance, while France, Spain, and Italy were killing Jews, Slovakia (then called \"Moravia\" under Bohemia, Hungary, Poland), Poland, and several other slavic nations were welcoming them in and giving them high-paying governmental jobs.\n \n *+** Will and Ariel Durant's book, The Reformation",

   "The civilized Europeans civilized the savage American Indians. \n\n \n a) Where is your evidence?\n \n b) Can you prove that the reverse did not occur as well? Logic dictates that if both Europeans and First Nations were in some places savage, and in others civilized, then they would have had equal influence on each other. Thus, the Europeans would have been influenced to be more civilized by the First Nations, and the First Nations influenced to be more savage by the Europeans as vice versa.\n \n You persist in repeating your opinion without answering the logic question or using any supporting documentation (except the antiquated Catholic Encylopedia).\n \n \nBut it wasn't really the Pope who was doing all this damage, it was mainly the leaders of Europe.\n\n \n I've wondered on several occasions whether you actually read other's posts. This is another example. Let's try this again...\n \n \nWhen an inquisitor arrived in an area he called for reports of anyone suspected of heresy, sometimes offering rewards to spies who would report suspected heretics. Those suspected were imprisoned to await trials. The trials were held in secret and the inquisitor acted as judge, prosecutor, and jury. The accused had no lawyer. It was often simpler to confess to heresy than to defend oneself, especially since torture was often employed until the accused was ready to confess.\n \n Because church and state had not been kept separate, the church powers could call upon the government to use its power against the convicted heretics. Anyone who fell back into heresy after repentance was turned over by the Inquisition to the regular government to be put to death. Most of those condemned to death were burned at the stake, but some were beaten to death or drowned. \n \n The Inquisition was called the sanctum officium (Holy Office) because the church considered its work so praiseworthy.F\n \n Even after the death of a victim, his punishment was not ended. The property of condemned heretics was confiscated, leaving his family in poverty.\n \n It is important here to emphasize Rome's role in the brutality of the Inquisition. Roman Catholic apologists are quick to point out that it was the state that put heretics to death. This is an alibi meant to excuse the Vatican's role in the atrocities. However, Dollinger, the leading 19th century Catholic historian, stated: \"The binding force of the laws against heretics lay not in the authority of secular princes, but in the sovereign dominion of life and death over all Christians claimed by the Popes as God's representatives on earth, as [Pope] Innocent III expressly states it.\"G\n In other words, the secular arm of the state acted only as it was pressured to do so by the popes. Even kings who hesitated to commit genocide on their own populaces were spurred into action by their fear of papal excommunication or subversive Catholic activities within their kingdoms.\n \n Dollinger continues: \"It was the Popes who compelled bishops and priests to condemn the heterodox to torture, confiscation of their goods, imprisonment, and death, and to enforce the execution of this sentence on the civil authorities, under pain of excommunication,\"H\n",

   "Firstly, I've been meaning to say this. I have been characterizing them as \"savages\" to make it simpler to define them. They wern't truly savages, but their behavior was. \n\n \n Simpler for you perhaps. Not so for people who expect others to use words based on some kind of common definition.\n \n \nDid you develop this esoteric system for the categorization of human societies into two groups on your own, or do you get it from a book?\n\n \n \nAd hominem.\n\n \n Asking for evidence or clarification is not ad hominem. I was just trying to find out what you are basing this classification system on. So, is there a book or other source you are using?\n \n \nThat wasn't a fact, but an opinion. Of course Will Durant is going to say it was horrible- he isn't Catholic. \n\n \n Of course it was an opinion. I was just pointing out that your historian disagrees with your interpretation of the Inquisition.\n \n \nThe Catholic Church justified it on religious means- just like what Moses did when the Hebrews went pagan.\n\n \n Well, I find that to be a very poor excuse.\n \n \nI don't really care what number of people are slaughtered. I don't think the genocide of 3000 people is significantly less reprehensible than a few dozens of thousands more. I guess my moral system doesn't work that way. \n\n \n \nOdd, because your quoted source DOES care about the numbers. He gives a comparison. \n\n \n In the excerpt I quoted he did not make a numerical comparison. Unless you're talking about something else...\n \n \n\n You either\n a) approve that his idea that the Inquisition is bad, based on the comparison of figures\n or\n b) you don't - so why quote him?\n\n \n See above. I was just showing Parcum that he disagreed with his source.\n \n \nFurther, the Indians who lived in cities, were civilised. That is the nature of the term we are using.\n\n That may be the term you and I are using, but it does not seem that Parcum is using the same term at all. He has described the Aztecs (city-dwellers) as \"savage\" and other nomadic Nations as \"civilized\". I suspect he uses the term \"savage\" to mean non-Catholic and \"civilized\" to mean Catholic. Certainly that was the opinion of the Spanish \"civilizing\" force we are speaking of.\n \n Conjecture aside, he has yet to properly explain his  definition of these terms, other than repeating that it is based on behaviour.\n \n \nI've skimmed through your debate rules. \n\n \n Great, so you'll recognize them as I call you on breaking them here.. ;)\n \n \nI've read some of the entries, such as under \"St.Augustine of Hippo\". It says he lived between certain dates, and in a certain place (North Africa)\n \n Are you suggesting that these facts are false? Which facts are false (driven by propaganda)? If he brought forth the same facts from a non-Catholic source, would that make them correct?\n\n \n This is a great example of logical fallacy.\n \n Just because other sections of the Encyclopedia may contain fact does not make the sections Parcum quoted factual. You've also set up a straw man here. I never said that all material from the Catholic Encyclopedia was false, but it's not all based on fact either. Certainly the parts Parcum quoted were opinion at best, though more likely just fairy tale. \n \n If you'll go back to the posts I'm referring to, you will find the articles he quotes. The one I remember off-hand is a third-person account of the torture of a Catholic missionary- with no author cited, no date, no publishing info. Other quotes he gave further only reiterated opinions on the \"savagery\" of the un-converted. Opinion, not evidence, and opinion based on racism and bigotry.\n \n Whether the facts on St. Augustine are true or not has nothing to do with whether the Encyclopedia is approved by Catholic clergy- I never said it did. I just said if Parcum wanted to start looking for valid sources he should start with ones that use other criterion for selection, such as validity.",

   "See above. I was just showing Parcum that he disagreed with his source.\n\n \n So? You are trying to throw the baby out with the bath-water on this. I don't agree whole-heartedly with every source I quote either. If you are trying to undermine his argument by suggesting that he is selective, then you may. But the fact he quoted is in backed with the source he cited.\n \n Instead of you arguing against this fact, you draw attention to another event earlier on in an effort to embarrass him.\n \n \nThat may be the term you and I are using, but it does not seem that Parcum is using the same term at all. He has described the Aztecs (city-dwellers) as \"savage\" and other nomadic Nations as \"civilized\". I suspect he uses the term \"savage\" to mean non-Catholic and \"civilized\" to mean Catholic. Certainly that was the opinion of the Spanish \"civilizing\" force we are speaking of.\n\n \n I am aware he used 'savage'. I am suggesting that civilised would be a better term.\n \n \nThis is a great example of logical fallacy.\n \n Just because other sections of the Encyclopaedia may contain fact does not make the sections Parcum quoted factual. You've also set up a straw man here. I never said that all material from the Catholic Encyclopaedia was false, but it's not all based on fact either.

I just said if Parcum wanted to start looking for valid sources he should start with ones that use other criterion for selection, such as validity.\n\n \n That's it... validity! You are actually operating under a logical fallacy. You believe that because the encyclopaedia is sponsored by the Catholic Church it is unreliable or invalid. Your basis for rejecting it in toto, was that it was Catholic sponsored. As I showed, it does contain factual evidence. It may contain inaccurate information. I don't know. But it is you who is casting the doubt that it is unreliable, not I.\n \n Quite clearly when you said on Post 544 \nTry an Encyclopaedia that does not require \"approval\" by a Church with an interest in promoting it's own agenda.\n You are implying that the information is wrong, because it is 'biased'. You are simply engaged in a mud-throwing exercise, and hoping that some of it sticks - simply because you use 'Catholic' as a bogey-man; it is an attempt to appeal to pre-conceived bias.\n \n \nIf you'll go back to the posts I'm referring to, you will find the articles he quotes. The one I remember off-hand is a third-person account of the torture of a Catholic missionary- with no author cited, no date, no publishing info. Other quotes he gave further only reiterated opinions on the \"savagery\" of the un-converted. Opinion, not evidence, and opinion based on racism and bigotry.\n\n \n If true, this would hold more validity. However, the idea that Catholic missionaries were tortured is a real event in history. Your only criticism then is that it is unsourced. It is like if I say \"Sydney was founded in 1788\". It is an historic event, my statement is true, it is not mere opinion. I know of Catholic missionaries that were tortured. Does this mean I'm only adding my opinion? I have quite a good recollection for what I was taught in history. St. Isaac Jogues (1607-46) was a Catholic martyred by Mowhaks, after being tortured.",

   "You believe that because the encyclopaedia is sponsored by the Catholic Church it is unreliable or invalid.\n\n \n As I said, not necessarily. It is not necessarily valid either, which is why I recommended a better source for information- one which relies more on reliability and less on trying to make themselves look good.\n \n \n You are simply engaged in a mud-throwing exercise, and hoping that some of it sticks - simply because you use 'Catholic' as a bogey-man;\n\n \n Hardly. Parcum is arguing that his nameless source in the Catholic Encyclopedia is proof that the Mohawk Nation in it's entirety was \"savage\". As I said, the article he quotes is not evidence of anything except the authors' claim, and we don't even know who this is. Moreover, the descriptions of First Nations people in the article are clearly racist, and the story sounds like fiction to me. Whether or not it is is unknown, as there is no author or date cited.\n \n \n\"Walk ahead,\" growled one of the tall warriors as he motioned with his finger to Ondessonk. Father Jogues took a few steps and turned around. He saw the Iroquois draw out a tomahawk from beneath his blanket. Instantly the savage swung it high in the air and brought it down with a crash into the head of Goupil. Rene' staggered a step and calling out, \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!\" he fell to the ground. Two more vicious blows from a crimsoned hatchet extinguished the last breath of life in Rene' Goupil.\n\n \n The only author cited is the notation \"By the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary\". http://www.catholicism.org/pages/cjjangri.htm \n \n \n \nHowever, the idea that Catholic missionaries were tortured is a real event in history. Your only criticism then is that it is unsourced. It is like if I say \"Sydney was founded in 1788\". It is an historic event, my statement is true, it is not mere opinion. \n\n \n Many supposed historical \"facts\" of the past have been disproved. The problem with History books is that people tend to quote each other over and over based on the credibility of the author, few people bother with source documents. Having done a lot of genealogy research I can tell you with assurance that the History books often get things wrong, decades after the truth comes out.\n \n I don't know whether Jogues was \"tortured\", despite your assurance that this is a \"historical fact\" I would like to see the source documents. Certainly this would not prove anything about the \"savagery\" of the Iroquois in comparison with the Europeans, who were torturing First Nations people en masse.",

And they can tell if that will happen... trust me, I'm going through it right now and I have had specialists and geneticists tell me the same thing over and over and over. I'm pregnant and my baby is dying. There are serious, irreversible anomalities with the baby, and if they are prolonged much further, some of them could cause me to die as well. My doctors are advising me to terminate now, and I'm not for abortion at all... I guess I believe that it's a woman's choice, I just knew it was never the right choice for me. But now I am faced with making that decision, and that wasn't by choice. I have had second, and third, and fourth opinions and they have all been the same; there is nothing else they can do. I can put my own life at risk, but it's not going to save this baby; nothing will. If I thought there was a chance, I would take it. But there isn't, and I can't do that because I have a 4 year old daughter that needs me. So if you still want to believe that anyone who makes that choice isn't fit to be a mother, please keep in mind that if I keep this going and things go wrong and I die, I would be dying along with this baby, not saving it, and I would be leaving my living child without a mother. I think that would be worse.

I love my daughter and I love the baby I am carrying, but now I have to choose between the child who isn't going to live and the child who is already alive.

It seems so arrogant to me to assume that you know what is best for anyone else. When we have a child, we hope we know what's best, but we cannot guarantee it. Most parents have regrets- a lot of them have huge regrets. The women I have known who have had abortions regret the circumstances that made that choice the best for them, not the abortion itself. But I hardly ever see one of these vehement protestors trying to do anything about the lives of the women they seek to \"help.\" Sure, some of them might congregate in unlawful protest in front of clinics and such, pretending to be counselors- but they are doing so to soothe their own egos, to make themselves feel better, and to present a good image to their fellow protestors. I do not see them at the clinic on the days abortions aren't being performed- trying to urge women to use birth control. I don't see them standing outside congress with those lovely pictures trying to get wages raised. I don't see them out in the streets making sure that drug addicts are getting birth control- I don't see them at the rehab center trying to make sure these women don't go right back on the streets. I'm sure there are amongst those who actually do these things who do not agree with abortion, but they are spending their efforts in better anmd less harmful ways. There isn't much the average citizen can do for the medical problems you are going through right now, but I think the very least they could do is show a little human compassion for the terrible place you are at and the absolutely horrible choices you are faced with.
