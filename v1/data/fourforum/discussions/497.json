Since Palestine was (and still is) not a country, they resorted to terrorism to try and force Israel to give some of the land back.\n \n \n In response to the question -\n \n I feel that both groups are to blame.

Eventually, someone said \"hey, this isn't fair! the palestineans need a state too!\" So in 1922 the British partioned the territory into two pieces. The partition plan of 1922 divided palestine into two territories: a palestinean state, called Transjordan, east of the Jordan river, and a jewish territory west of the jordan. Today, Jordan is a palestinean state, 66% by ethnicity and around 3x the size of Israel. Theoretically, problem solved, as now we have one Jewish state and one palestinean state. The problems of today are made by palestineans asking for state number 2, which is unwarrented and wholely unjustified.",

If America was in a position where the Indians claimed they should get part of America back and performed terrorist attacks on us to get there way, then I would hate to see us give into their demands.\n \n The arabs/palestinians did hold claim to the land of Israel long before it become the country it is today.

No, and I don't think they would have without additional pressure from around the world.\n \n Will giving in stop the terrorist attacks? No, but the terrorist attacks will no longer be seen as legitimate as they once were.

They already had that in Afghanistan before 9/11. They are people who are jealous of the US. There is nothing they want other than to see the US a 3rd world country. After that, they would or people like them would hate the country who took the place of the US at the top. Those people cannot be negotiated with even if you tried.\n \n I think this is a step towards peace with Israel giving up this land, but peace will not be easily achieved. Hopefully the Iraqi situation will cool down and over the next 20 years the nation can become a successful democracy. Maybe another Middle East nation will go along with that idea as well.

   "I can't identify with any of the four choices in the poll.\n \n The first choice--Palestinians are terrorists who should be eradicated from Israel--is too sweeping in its generalization of Palestinians. Some Palestinians are terrorists; many aren't. Those who commit violence against civilians, including leaders like Arafat who provide sanctuary to terrorists and fund their infrastructure, must be held accountable in order to neutralize their capacity to damage the peace process. Other Palestinians who simply want to go about the ordinary business of daily living--constructive employment, educating their children, etc--should not have to fear 'eradication.'\n \n The second choice--Israel, through ethnic cleansing has backed the Palestinains into a corner in which the only method of retaliation is terrorism--neither reflects history nor today's reality. The charge of ethnic cleansing cannot be substantiated in view of the fact that the Arab population of Israel has blossomed 10-fold, from 125,000 to 1.2 million people, in the 55 years since Israel was founded. Furthermore, if the Palestinians are backed into a corner, it's a self-inflicted consequence of repeated attempts to remove Israel from the map. Though the Palestinian leadership has recently given some lip service to recognizing Israel's right to exist, they have failed to match their words with deeds, and to this day continue to demand that millions of refugees be given the right to settle in the state of Israel rather than settle in their own proposed independent state of Palestine.\n \n The third choice--They're both wrong, one group are terrorists, the other are mini-Nazi's--is too exclusive. Mistakes have been made by individuals on both sides, but painting any large group with such a broad brush is a position prone to error. Under Arafat, the leadership of the Palestinian Authority has long been associated with terrorism and corruption, which makes life difficult not only for Israelis but also many Arabs who might otherwise build a prosperous society in relative peace alongside the Jewish state. Also, the \"mini-Nazi\" label is way out of bounds in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n \n The fourth choice--I back Israel because the US does--seems the least unpalatable of the group, but still it sounds too much like \"my country, right or wrong.\" No thinking person will likely ever agree with their government's position on all issues, which makes this choice somewhat muddled. Besides, the U.S. government \"backs\" the Palestinians as well as Israel, since the Bush administration publicly supports the creation of an independent Palestinian state and has given roughly $400 million in both direct and indirect aid to the Palestinian people in the past two years. It's not very illuminating to say I back Israel--or I back the Palestinians--because the U.S. does. It would be more useful to state specific reasons why one supports one group more than the other.\n \n I cast my vote for 'none of the above.'",

   "[QUOTE: Here's a quick history of the Israel/Palestine conflict - \n Following WWII, the UN took a spot of land in the Middle East from other countries and gave it to Jews who were displaced by Hitler.]\n \n A history book should say something different. The UN didn't take land from \"other countries.\" The land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea was approximately 25% of the British Mandate for Palestine established after WWI when General Allenby defeated the Ottoman Turks who ruled the area for 400 years. (Most of the Palestine Mandate--the 75% east of the Jordan River--was given to the Arabs in the early 1920s and made off-limits to Jewish settlement.)\n \n There was no other internationally recognized sovereign power west of the Jordan R. except the British and certainly not any Arab country. That's why under international law the West Bank and Gaza Strip remain disputed territories to this day. Though the Arabs attempted--and failed--to assert sovereignty by force of arms, these territories remain in legal dispute and subject to negotiation between the two primary claimants, Israel and the Palestinian Arabs.\n \n The UN Partition Plan in 1947 sought to establish two states--one Jewish, one Arab. No resident in either proposed state would be required to move. When the British Mandate ended in May 1948, the state of Israel was proclaimed on land designated for the Jewish state. The Arabs refused to proclaim a state, instead choosing to wage a war of annihilation against Israel rather than establish an Arab state alongside the Jewish state.\n \n Regarding the comment that the UN gave the land to \"Jews who were displaced by Hitler,\" it neglects to note that Jews were living in Palestine continuously for at least 2,500 years before Hitler was born. Early in the 19th century the Jewish population in Jerusalem exceeded the number of Christians or Muslims, as documented by the Ottoman census of 1844. Furthermore, waves of Sephardic and Oriental Jews from Arab and other countries outside Europe made their way to Israel. Though the European Jews were wealthier and better educated and organized, the Jewish state was intended for all Jews, not only those displaced by Hitler.\n \n [QUOTE: The Palestinians, who lived in the areas that were taken away, wanted their land back. Since Palestine was (and still is) not a country, they resorted to terrorism to try and force Israel to give some of the land back.]\n \n At the time of the UN partition plan, one-third of the population were Palestinian Jews. The Palestinian Arabs were given their own state alongside the Jewish state but declined it in favor of taking all the land, including the portion designated as a Jewish homeland. You appear to be trying to justify the Arab decision to resort to belligerence and terrorism. \n \n Perhaps you will recall that for two decades--between 1948 and 1967--Israel posed no barrier to the establishment of an independent Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza, ruled by Jordan and Egypt. The collective goal of the Arab leadership was the total destruction of Israel. To better serve that goal, the Arab leaders kept the Palestinian refugees as a homeless people confined to miserable refugee camps rather than allow them to move out and establish their own state. It's true the Palestinians have suffered, but much of it was deliberately engineered by Arab leaders determined not to settle the issue in a manner that permitted the continued existence of the Jewish state. \n \n [QUOTE: Palestine is to blame for the continued terror, but Israel is also to blame for the military retaliation that has not helped the situation.]\n \n On the contrary, Israel's military retaliation has helped accomplish something extraordinary. The Jewish state still exists--even thrives--despite repeated Arab attempts to destroy it. Why blame Israel for continuing to exist through self-defense? What do you suggest Israel do to help the situation?\n \n The occupation of Palestinian population centers will quickly end when the Arab leadership dismantles the terrorist infrastructure and sincerely accepts Israel's right to exist in peace. Are you aware that the U.S. military occupied parts of Japan for 27 years after WW2 ended. The Palestinian incitement of violence against Israel is yet to cease. Furthermore, unlike the U.S., Israel does not enjoy the protective buffer of two oceans and friendly neighbors.\n \n Most of Israel's population and industrial capacity is concentrated in a narrow region between the Mediterrean and the West Bank that is only nine miles at one point. Have you ever really tried to imagine the serious security concerns of a country that small, in a hostile, undemocratic neighborhood.",

   "QUOTE=Morfos: There was a cease fire, but Ariel Sharon broke it by assasinating people,]\n \n Firstly, the hudna (temporary ceasefire) was merely proclaimed, not really implemented. After the hudna was declared on June 29, terror attacks continued on a daily basis to kill and maim Israelis in ones and twos (and sometimes more.) There were 167 terrorist attacks against Israel in the first four weeks following the declaration of the hudna. It's insincere to argue that a reduction in terrorist attacks from 300 a month to \"only\" 167 constitutes a ceasefire. Since stabbings, shootings, kidnappings, and things of that nature continued to occur almost daily, perhaps you should explain exactly what is meant by 'ceasefire.' To blame Sharon for \"breaking\" the hudna is to excuse terrorism under the guise of a false ceasefire. \n \n Secondly, Israel did not participate in negotiating the hudna 'agreement.' It was an internal matter between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and several terrorist groups. Israel had no role at all. The hudna was simply the ill-fated attempt by Abbas, the PA prime minister, to use \"persuasion\" rather than \"force\" to get the terrorists to stop attacking Jews.\n \n Thirdly, what Israel (and the PA) DID agree to are the terms of the Roadmap put forth by the U.S., UN, EU, and Russia. You might want to read it to learn about each side's obligations under the Roadmap:\n http://www.un.org/media/main/roadmap122002.html\n The Roadmap is \"performance-based.\" At the outset of Phase 1 it specifically calls for the \"dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure\" and \"confiscation of illegal weapons and consolidation of security authority.\"\n \n Abbas claimed he could not abide by the Roadmap without sparking a Palestinian civil war. Given the PA refusal to begin implementing the first and foremost element of the Roadmap, the U.S. (correctly) recognized Israel's right to act against the terrorists and their infrastructure and to do the job the PA is unwilling (or unable) to do.\n \n Unless you can show that there WAS in fact an effective ceasefire, how can you argue that a ceasefire was 'broken' by Sharon or anyone else?\n \n \n QUOTE=Morfos: Ive heard that from a CNN reporter in the Middle East. He makes a good point about why Ariel Sharon actually doesn't want peace.]\n \n Of what value is a nameless reporter, and a 'good point' you neglect to specify? If you mean to argue that Sharon 'doesn't want peace,' then say something specific to support your opinion. Relying solely on rhetoric suggests that you don't have facts to offer. In the context of the Roadmap and peace efforts, try addressing some specific policy decisions that Sharon pushed through his cabinet:\n \n - Israel withdrew its forces from Palestinian population centers in the Gaza Strip and dismantled the checkpoints that were a barrier to north-south travel in the Gaza Strip.\n \n - Israel withdrew its forces from Bethlehem and turned security over the PA.\n \n - Israel released about 400 prisoners as a goodwill gesture, even though the Roadmap didn't call any release of prisoners. The gesture was made in response to a U.S. request to help Abbas in his internal power struggle with Arafat.\n \n - Israel dismantled a handful of isolated settler outposts and forcibly evicted the Jews living there.\n \n - Israel showed restraint in not using massive force to occupy the Gaza Strip to further pressure the terrorist infrastructure. Israel showed restraint in not killing Arafat or sending him into exile, despite U.S. recognition that the PA leader sanctions terror and is an impediment to U.S. peace efforts.\n \n Meanwhile, the PA continues to shirk it's main Roadmap obligation to confront and dismantle the terrorist organizations.",

   "QUOTE=Chai: You're right this time. I just looked it up.]\n \n Where exactly did you look it up that Sharon broke the ceasefire? By such reckoning, the daily attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq also constitute a ceasefire, though I think the soldiers there that are being sniped at would dispute such contention.\n \n After Hamas and Islamic Jihad unilaterally declared the Hudna on June 29, the average number of daily attacks against Israel was between five and six. No one should consider that level of continuing attacks to be a ceasefire. There must first be an effective ceasefire in place before we can properly speak of it being 'broken.'\n \n \n QUOTE=Chai: I do understand that what Sharon did was wrong and totally uncalled for.]\n \n You neglect to explain exactly you find 'wrong' with Sharon's decision not to sit on his hands while the terror attacks continue. You blame the failure of the Hudna on Sharon being \"impatient\", as if killing Jews two or three at a time is acceptable. Care to elaborate on what you think is \"totally uncalled for.\"\n \n \n QUOTE=Chai: Israel's got an overzealous (to say the least) prime minister and a messed up K'nesset,]\n \n Israel's Knesset represents the only parliamentary democracy in the region. What's the mess up? As far as Sharon being 'overzealous,' it rather seems the opposite is true, due to the restraint imposed on him by the U.S.\n \n On paper at least, Israel has both the right and capability to defend itself. But in fact Israel is exerting only a fraction of the military pressure they could otherwise bring to bear on the terrorists. That looks more like 'restraint' than overzealousness. Part of the reason for the restraint is that Israel doesn't want to be blamed for the collapse of Abbas' effort to reach an effective ceasefire with the terrorists. Yet you blame Israel nevertheless for responding to terrorist attacks.\n \n When you assume that there was ever a real ceasefire, you appear to condone terrorism in a way that serves only to magnify it. The appeasement approach rewards terrorism and thereby encourages it to spread. Look at how the incidence of suicide bombings are spreading.\n \n For the record, the Hudna agreement between the Palestinian Authority and the terrorist groups was declared on June 29, 2003. It was welcomed by the U.S., depite falling short of the Roadmap requirement that terrorist groups be 'dismantled' rather than treated with words of 'persuasion.' Israel cooperated by stopping the targeted killing of terrorist leaders to give the 'ceasefire' a chance.\n \n On June 30, one day after the Hudna was declared, a Palestinian shooting attack on a truck near Jenin killed a foreign national from Bulgaria.\n \n On July 7, a suicide bombing in Kfar Yabetz killed an Israeli civilian.\n \n On July 15, a stabbing attack on the Jaffa boardwalk killed an Israeli civilian and injured others.\n \n On July 28, the body of an IDF soldier abducted by terrorists a few days earlier was found buried in an olive grove.\n \n There was also a suicide bombing at a mall in central Israel, a suicide bombing at a gas station in Ariel. There were no targeted assassination attempts during this period. When Israel finally strikes back at the leadership of these terrorist organizations, you say Sharon \"broke\" the ceasefire. Go figure!",

The Jordanians kicked him out in the early 1970s (Black September) when Arafat tried to assassinate King Hussein and take over Jordan. You may recall that King Hussein killed more Palestinians in 1 week than Israel has killed in 3 years.\n \n Arafat next fled to Lebanon where his terrorist forces upset the delicate political balance in that country, sparking a civil war that lasted for 15 years and killed about 100,000 people. That's why the Lebanese initially welcomed the Israeli invasion in 1982 to uproot Arafat's terrorist training bases. The central Lebanese government was too weak to expel Arafat on its own.\n \n After being forced from Beirut, Arafat stayed in Tunisia for years until the U.S. and Israeli blunder in 1993 to invite him and his corrupt cohorts back to Palestine under the Oslo Accord. Expelling him again won't really do much to help his people, since he'll still be pulling the strings of terror and masterminding the killing of Jews in Palesine, even as he parades around the capitals of the world.\n \n So expulsion or relocation would not be my choice, even though there's significant precedent for such action, for example, Slobodan Milosevic, Manuel Noriega, Idi Amin, and (just a few weeks ago) Charles Taylor in Liberia.\n \n If expulsion isn't appropriate, nor do I think Israel should assassinate him outright. If his own people choose to kill him, that would be different than Israel making him a martyr.\n \n My preference would be to arrest him and put him on trial in an Israeli court of law where judicial independence is widely recognized and respected. Let Arafat be forced to confront the people whose lives and families have been disrupted by terror. It would remove him from circulation in a legitimate process that focuses attention on his actions against the cause of peace and confronts him with accountability, justice, and punishment.\n \n Only when Arafat is effectively removed from the world stage will the Palestinians have a real chance to prove themselves worthy of having their own independent state. Thus far, the Palestinian leadership has not shown they are prepared to co-exist with Israel and live in peace alongside the Jewish state.",

The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) recently appointed Mahmoud Abbas to be prime minister, but Arafat wouldn't let him do his job and forced him to resign. There is no democracy under Arafat's executive authority. There is no independent judiciary. The PLC passes laws which Arafat ignores. Parliament members who speak out against Arafat's corruption are subject to beatings and arrest. It has been this way ever since Arafat was brought back from exile in Tunis and given control of the PA. In 1998 he announced an indefinite freeze on elections.

I suggest your first mistake is to assume your propaganda sources are reliable in claiming Israel found Sharon guilty of mass murder. The Israeli inquiry found no such thing. Since the findings were made public nearly 20 years ago, you might ask yourself why you still can\n t get it right.\n \n As for the URL you provided to the trial in Brussels, I suggest you look beyond such leftist, socialist web sites if you want reliable news. Your web site informed you on June 16 that the Belgium lawsuit against Sharon will go to trial, but your source neglected to update you just 10 days later when the Belgian courts ruled that Sharon could NOT be tried in Belgium. You should blame your poor choice of sources for leaving you misinformed.\n \n By the way, the Belgian law that allowed the suit against Sharon to be filed in the first place is a total embarassment to the Belgian government because it's quite clear the trial was politically motivated. There is no basis to your allegations that Sharon committed 'mass murder.'\n \n The Belgian law was also embarassing for the fact that Belgium claimed supra-national jurisdiction that allowed anyone to file charges for war crimes anywhere in the world. To make the law even more outrageous, Belgium granted itself total immunity from its own laws, rejecting litigation on Belgian atrocities in Rwanda and not initiating litigation on Belgian misdeeds in its former colony, Congo (Zaire).\n \n The law may have had good intent, but it was so misguided and abused for political purposes that even the U.S. was suggesting that NATO headquarters might have to be moved from Brussels to another country so that NATO military leaders wouldn't be subjected to politically-motivated trials.

The decision to award him the prize was based on the (false) belief that he had renounced terror and become a sincere partner in the peace process. His continuing complicity in acts of terror has sparked a petition signed by hundreds of thousands of people to revoke his prize. However, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation have no provision for revoking it. Arafat continues to embrace the leaders of terrorist organizations like Hamas.

Israel goes after Jewish terrorist groups, while Arafat provides funding and sanctuary to Palestinian terrorist groups.\n \n \n \n This is who Sharon is:\n http://www.jewishsf.com/bk990507/ijeruselum2jta.shtml\n Trying to bribe a witness for his crimes against humanity in 1982. Note it is Isreali cops charging him for the crime and obstruction of justice... You judge who is on the receiving end of justice. \n\n \n I left your URL so people can check and see you don't understand your own reference. Firstly, since you ask readers to 'judge,' I say it's unreasonable to compare Arafat's known terrorist activity with Sharon's alleged bribery charge. I would not judge murder the same as stealing.\n \n Secondly, your reference does not say Isreali cops charged Sharon with a crime. Those are your words and misunderstanding. You assume the man is guilty even before he is charged, much less convicted. \n \n Thirdly, the news article is four years old. Did you bother to check and see if the police ever charged him? Apparently not. If you understood how political motivation sometimes works in a democracy, you might have viewed the news report in the proper context. Sharon was not the prime minister at the time, but national elections were pending. The police claim they did not leak the report about their investigation of Sharon, but still it leaked out. In the end there were no bribery charges filed against Sharon due to lack of evidence.\n \n As for Arafat, his involvement with terrorism and cronyism is overwhelming. Even his supporters in the European Union are dismayed with lack of transparency in the hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to the PA.",

   "In the last 60 years there has never been any Palestinian that has evicted a Isreali farmer, home owner, or old woman from her appartment.\n\n \n Sixty years ago Palestine was still under the British Mandate. If you wish to look back to Mandatory Palestine, you'll find that during that period of British rule, Jews bought land (at high prices) and developed it. British surveys like the Peel Commission Report in 1937 show that very few Palestinian Arabs were displaced. On the contrary Arab immigration to Palestine increased to take advantage of employment opportunities created by Jewish settlements as well as improved health care and sanitation, which cut the Arab mortality rate for children in half. Palestinian Jews were not 'evicting' Palestinian Arabs.\n \n Some Arabs were no doubt fearful of the impact of Jewish economic development on Arab culture. The first large-scale violence occurred in 1920 when Arabs attacked Jews with rioting and looting. The were more riots in 1921, then things were relatively quiet until 1929 when the Mufti of Jerusalem (Haj Amin al-Husseini) incited the Arabs to wide-spread rioting to keep Jews from visiting their holy shrines. One of the worst massacres was in Hebron where the entire Jewish community was forced to leave that ancient town where they had lived continuously since before the Roman period 2000 years ago. It was the first time in centuries that no Jews lived in Hebron. No one should claim that Palestinian Arabs never forcibly evicted Jews from their homes. The Arabs were doing it two decades before the British Mandate ended.\n http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron#1929_Massacre\n \n After the 1948 War of Independence, the Jordanian-Israeli armistice agreement called for \"free access to the Holy Places\" and \"no hostile act against civilians.\"\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arm03.htm\n Yet Jordan forcibly evicted all Jews from the West Bank and Jerusalem where they had lived for centuries under Ottoman (and later, Britsh) rule. In violation of the armistice, Jews were not allowed to even visit the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, the holiest site of Judaism, until Israel captured the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1967 following a Jordanian artillery attack on the western part of the city. \n \n Regardless of the Arab desire to make the West Bank free of Jews (just like the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the eastern side of the river), there is nothing in international law that restricts Jews from living in their ancient homeland. Jewish settlements have existed there for centuries. Their future is subject to negotiation, as called for in UN resolutions as well as the Oslo Accords.\n \n While smaller, remote settlements will almost certainly be dismantled some day, the larger settlements are really cities, with tens of thousands of people and a well-developed infrastructure. Such 'settlements' as Maale Adumin (which has a Burger King franchise) are too large and sophisticated to ever be uprooted. Contrary to frequent allegations, settlements are established on public lands, not private land belonging to individuals. \n \n \n \nThe Palestinians are surrounded in a number of \"concentration camps\".\n\n \n Those refugee camps were established by the Arabs themselves when Jordan and Egypt controlled the West Bank and Gaza Strip. For 20 years (from 1948-67) Israel posed no barrier to the establishment of an independent Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza. The Arab leaders didn't allow the refugees to move out of the squalid camps because their goal was the total destruction of Israel. Keeping the refugees in camps as a homeless people would better serve that goal. Nor does Arafat care about helping his people escape the miserable conditions in the camps, which are useful for terrorist training and new recruits. Rather than spend the hundreds of millions of dollars that flow in from the U.S. and Europe to improve the quality of life and build new housing for the refugees, Arafat's thugs build luxurious villas for themselves, drive fancy cars and eat plenty of good food.",

Furthermore, as it turned out, the police never even charged Sharon with bribery, etc. There was no trial nor conviction.

In other words, there's was apparently nothing to the alleged charges.\n \n What's even more puzzling about your web link is that you seem to think it has some significance with regard to the 1983 massacre perpetrated by Lebanese Christians at the Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut.

I answered you then, but you seem to ignore the facts. Hitler also came into power in Germany through a democratic process, but will you also argue that Hitler was NOT a dictator. The important point is not whether Arafat was democratically elected, but what did Arafat DO with his executive power AFTER he was elected.\n \n In the free world people understand that the establishment of democratic national institutions requires more than the mechanism of elections alone. To properly ensure justice, peace and respect for human freedom and dignity, there must also be an independent judiciary and the freedoms of opinion, expression, information, assembly, and association.\n \n I noted previously that Attorney General Abu Rahma resigned after just nine months in office, citing Arafat's interference in the judicial process. The PNA judiciary, consisting of criminal, civil, and state security courts, are not independent. Critics of Arafat's government are routinely arrested and beaten. Independent newspapers and private television stations have been closed. Journalists are detained and assaulted. Restrictions on freedom of expression (like the anti-incitement decree #3 of 1998) have silenced the opposition.\n \n Not only does Arafat disregard the rulings of the High Court, he also ignores the elected parliament. For example, the PLC passed a Basic Law in 1997 to outline the separation between legislative and executive authority. Arafat's government has not approved it, presumably because it would curtail his authority. In 1999 a group of legislators signed a petition stating their grievances against the govn't: corruption, abuse of power, misuse of resources, human rights violations, and a dysfunctional political process. Arafat's security forces responded by harrassing, assaulting and arresting those who had signed the petition.\n \n These facts were stated previously, yet you seem to ignore them as you offer nothing more than the repetitious argument that Arafat was 'democratically elected.' In truth, Arafat dashed the hopes of the Palestinian people that democratic institutions would be established and sustained. There is no democracy under Arafat. He has snatched away legislative and judicial independence, thereby concentrating all political power in his executive authority. His rule is dictatorial, plain and simple.",

   "The state of Palestine is a state in name only, they really concentration camps.\n\n \n Palestine is not a \"state\", not even in name only. The Oslo Accords created a semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority, not a state with sovereign power.\n \n You previously wrote:\n \n \nPalestine is a free and sovergin state. Arafat is a democratic elected leader. It is an independant state even recognized by Isreal.\n\n \n Why persist in this misconception? No country in the world yet recognizes an independent state of Palestine. Even the United Nations has not recognized any sovereign power in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the British Mandate ended in 1948. Pretending otherwise won't change the facts. \n \n \nThose camps? They are Palestine, they are the disembodied real-estate of Palestine.\n\n \n No matter how you choose to describe the Palestinian refugee camps, the fact remains that all of them were established on Arab soil. It's shameful the way Arabs have treated their Palestinian brethren for more than 50 years. Even today the vast majority of Palestinian refugees are kept in miserable camps in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan-- all Arab countries. The reason for this is that the Arab leadership is more interested in hurting Jews than helping Palestinian Arabs.",

   "It is absolutly important that peace be achived in Palestine. There was a good chance with Rabin, there is no chance with Sharon.\n\n \n Rabin wasn't the only good chance. After Rabin was killed, Shimon Peres became prime minister. Peres was Rabin's partner in promoting the hopes of the Oslo Accords. Even when Rabin was prime minister, the problem for him and Peres is that Arafat did not act to disarm the terrorist groups and dismantle their infrastructure. Even today, Arafat continues to give money and sanctuary to terrorist groups.\n \n If it weren't for Arafat's latest attacks on the Jewish state, Sharon would not likely have been elected prime minister. Those attacks began when Barak was prime minister. Clinton, Barak, and Arafat met at Camp David to end the conflict once and for all. Arafat refused to negotiate in good faith. He returned home to unleash the violence of the Intifada. Arafat undermined the peace efforts of Israel's Labor party and set back the goal of an independent Palestinian state. The violence promoted by Arafat played a crucial role in bringing Sharon to power.\n \n \n \nThe injustice in Palestine has given the moral authority to convince the Islamic fundamentalist to kill US citizens.\n\n \n You are sanctioning the mass slaughter of innocent civilians. Sorry, but you do not have such \"moral authority.\" If you choose to kill people solely because they are U.S. citizens, that is your choice, but it is still a murderous act. Your attempt to depict it as having some sort of moral authority rather serves to underscore the uncivilized nature of your belief system.\n \n \n \n\"...I swear to God that America will not live in peace before peace reigns in Palestine...\"\n Osama bin Laden\n October 7, 2001\n\n \n The date of bin Laden's quote was October 2001, shortly after al-Qaeda's attack on New York and Washington DC. Bin Laden was hoping for support to shield him from an imminent U.S. attack on his terrorist training bases in Afghanistan. The only reason he mentioned \"Palestine\" is because he was trying to tap the support of anti-Zionists.\n \n Prior to 9-11, bin Laden didn't show any regard for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even if Israel didn't exist, bin Laden would still have targeted U.S. interests because of our presence in Saudi Arabia. Do you know what is meant by 'red herring'? That's when someone introduces a new subject to divert attention from the truth. Bin Laden's reference to Palestine is simply a red herring.\n \n \n \nForget what you see on TV, the Isreali are not our friends:\n\n \n The URLs you provide do not show that Israel is not a friend. They merely show that friendly countries still spy on each other. Do you seriously think the U.S. doesn't spy on our allies in Canada, Europe, Asia, and elsewhere?\n \n Israel is not simply our friend but the BEST friend we have in the region. No country in the Middle East is a more reliable friend to the U.S. than Israel, which explains our shared value initiatives, as well as our economic and strategic cooperation.\n \n \n \nThis country missed an opportunity to be friends with most of the Muslim world.\n\n \n When Soviet Premier Kosygin asked President Johnson why the U.S. supports Israel when there are 80 million Arabs and only 3 million Jews, the President replied simply, \"Because it is right.\"\n \n There has been no fundamental change in that view.",

   "As I have said, Arafat as skillfully managed the conditions so he is always in power.\n\n \n You admit he's \"always in power,\" yet you argue he's not a dictatorial ruler. There's a problem in the Arab world with lack of freedom and democracy. There are 22 member nations in the League of Arab States, and not a single democracy among them. The people who blame Israel for the problems in the Arab world aren't helping solve anything. Israel is merely the scapegoat for Arab leaders to divert attention from dealing with the real problems of how to better the lives of the Arab masses.\n \n \n \nIn power over what? Arafat in power of basically a clubhouse and political disscussion tea party.\n\n \n If only it were true that Arafat was merely a clubhouse leader who discussed politics over a cup of tea. Arafat in fact has billions of dollars at his disposal stashed away in Swiss bank accounts and invested in foreign real estate. Rather than use this money to raise the living standard of his people from their conditions of poverty, he uses it to fund terrorism and to arm the 40,000 men that comprise the dozen or so security services under his control. The U.S. alone has given Arafat's government over $200 million in aid the past two years. Who is watching how it is spent?",

   "(Hey all, my first post)\n \n Gator,\n \n I read your posts which are extremely informative. I am having an Israeli-Palestinian debate on a different forum and just happened to pass by this forum. Do you know of any - very highly detailed - links concerning Palestine before 1948 and of the recent Hudna\\Roadmap? Oddly, I couldn't find too much information of these (if anyone here can show me links it would be great. Pro-Israeli that is. And the Hudna is more important for now).\n \n Edit: I also noticed you said that in 1948 a third of the population of Palestine were \"Palestinian Jews\". Weren't they Palestinian and Zionist Jews?\n \n \n Thanks.",
