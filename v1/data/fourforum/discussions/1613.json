Your post was nothing more than an insult. And now you try to take the high road and pretend that somehow you are more noble. You began with insult and lack the balls to stand up like a man and apologize and then blame me for it.

I at least was responding to someone who began by insulting me without having ever exchanged a word with me. On the other hand, I already knew you were without honor when I answered.\n \n \nNow to get away from attacking the character of another person, lets discuss the topic.\n\n But the topic you started was nothing more than insult. We have been discussing your topic. Sadly, you're not enough of a Christian to apologize with anything more that \"let's pretend.\"\n \nI will simply say that niether creation or evolution cannot be proved.\n\n Duh! Only creationists and XXXXXX use the word proof when talking about scientific theories. Of course it can't be proved. Science isn't about proving anything. Science attempts to understand and to explain.\n \nIt's just that evolution is commonly presented as fact, and I have yet to see evidence of this.\n\n Then, 1) you haven't looked, and 2) you don't understand what science is or how it functions. Evolution is a fact because it has been observed. The facts of evolution are not the theories. The theories explain the facts. And since you seem to believe that evolution is not a fact, you display your ignorance of the topic.\n \nNow if evidence is not the same as proof, I'd just like us to examine the human eye, or the ear, or the brain.\n\n Did you think that that sentence actually made any sense? If you are going to discuss the topic please refrain from gibberish.\n \nA single human cell is more complex than a space shuttle.\n\n Nice assertion. What are you talking about. How do you define \"complex\" so that it applies to reproducing organisms and machines.\n \nThe chances for this to evolve are not good, the space shuttle had to be built.\n\n Really? Your're not going to try to tell me that the space shuttle isn't a living organism that reproduces are you? Since you are trying to compare it to a living cell, shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it have at least some of the characteristics of a living organism?\n \nIt is takes much less \"faith\" in my opinion to believe that the eye was designed by an intelligent being, than that it somehow accidentially formed.\n\n What XXXXX ever claimed that the eye was accidental? And how honest of you to admit how weak your faith really is. But the bottom line is do you have any evidence?\n \nNot, proof, but evidence?\n\n Exactly. Bottom line is that I asked you to present some evidence for creation. I asked you to present some evidence for your position rather than dwell on why you think the theories of evolution are wrong. It seems that you can't. It seems that creationism is nothing more than arguments against a theory that creationists don't like - and don't understand. Rather than present evidence for creation (statement of an empirical theory of creation would be nice), you argue what you beleive evolution cannot accomplish, and in the process you reveal your ignorance of the topic.\n \n Way to go. Now I'm perfectly willing to discuss the topic in a \"friendly\" manner. But you are an ignorant, insulting buffoon who lacks the courage to offer an apology for acting like an ignorant, insulting buffoon. I am quite willing to explain things to you - already I can tell that you get your information from either Mr. Kent Hovind or AIG. You are parroting their stuff and it is quite clear that you don't know what you are talking about.\n \n So either shake the dust off your feet, or stand up and be an honorable person. My bet is that I have had more education in both theology and science than you. I have also had more education in manners but choose to show no respect to anyone who begins by showing disrespect for me. Grow up or bug off.",

If no good existed why wood we exist. Every other planet is just as old as our planet (giving just as much time to evolve) according to big bang theories. Life will find a way is what many evolutionists (social Darwinists) will claim. That life on our planet was just a mathematical equation being completed. In all metaphysics the question is asked: Why something instead of nothing? So the only answer that we can logically use is that something created us, life. We have no evidence in nature of things being created, yet no evidence of pure evolution. Why are there still apes in Africa? When the monkey population evolved into humans, why did not all evolve. In the the jungle man lived alongside with ape. Natural selection would lead one to believe that apes would become extinct, or at least move to another part of land. Neither of these things happened, which would lead logic to believe that evolution is what is it defined as, and for that matter neither is natural selection.
