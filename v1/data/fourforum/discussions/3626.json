   "in other words, he underestimated how deep american gullibility is and how impervious we are to logic.\n\n I have to disagree with this, unkerpaulie. I think the American people looked at the candidates and chose the one they thought would best handle current affairs. It was a tough, very tough choice. I honestly think GW was squirming, going over the things that the admin had done, knowing the foolish acts were bared and knowing that the citizens didn&#8217;t like it.

He was also wondering just how long they were going to put up with it...and in the end was amazed at the outcome.\n \n\n OK I disagree with you on this. Many people look at him and say he looks better than Kerry or they would feel more comfortable talking to him than Kerry, or (I actually heard this from a voter) Kerry didn't have a chance with a first lady like Theresa against Laura Bush. Another quote I heard from some NASCAR driver \"I'm not really an issues kind of guy, but when he shook my hand and looked into my eyes, I knew I could trust him.\" Great reason to vote for him, he'd make a better friend. Not!\n \n \n\n If it would have been anyone other than Kerry, I honestly think we'd have another president.\n \n\n I agree, while I'd rather have Kerry than Bush I honestly think Kerry ran a horrible campaign and didn't define his stance clear enough. People could have done some research on that, but everyone knows Americans are too lazy.\n \n \n\n Which lies these days would a person believe? Campaigns are all about spreading lies and mud and fabricating one story to cover up another.

Unless you're blending political religion into the mix. He didn't fool me with that spiel or anyone else, I don't think.\n\n Are you kidding me? There were so many people in the poles that said the reason they voted for Bush were because of moral values. And everyone knows he's religious and let's his religion influence his policies. And he may not have fooled you, but the average American isn't very smart.\n \n \n \n \n \"You can fool some of the people all the time or all the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time\"\n \"Too bad all Bush had to do was fool 51% of the people for a short amount of time\"",
