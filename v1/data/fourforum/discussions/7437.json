   "I just did a quickie estimate of the income taxes due for me for 2005 income. \n I have essentially the same income as I had in 2004 but I will be paying $400 more in income tax this year. \n \n First of all, take a look at your 2005 Tax return. The individual deduction has been reduced from $7,950 to $5,000.00. Also, I believe that on my 2004 income, if I had turned 65 in that year I might have been eligible for a 2x$7,950.00 deduction but I don't have the tables from 2004 to see if that is true. One can still claim additional deductions for being 65 this year but the requirements for meeting this requirement have become much more stringent and I do not qualify. \n \n So, folks, I just want you all to know that I, individually, am doing a whole bunch to pay for Bushyboy's tax cuts for all those really, really rich folks that he loves so much--and when you do your taxes, just compare your tax returns for the years 2004 and 2005 and see how much more you're paying this year. \n \n Well, geeze, somebody has to do it. Letting these rich guys not pay their fair share of taxes has its costs and we just have to live with it.",
