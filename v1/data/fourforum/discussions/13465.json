What's Jennifer's last name antonia? Which hospital did she go to in what city that denied her care? and you realize don't you that the woman in that video said she let her own daughter in law be denied care, right? Do you think that any hospital would deny anyone care when they were surrounded by loving family members who assured the hospital they would pay they bill? \n \n You people think we are so stupid we will believe your manufactured sob stories just because you tell them. No hospital in this country denies people care because they don't have health insurance, PERIOD!!! It is a massive lie to imply that if a person lacks the magical health insurance card that they wont be allowed to pass through the all powerful and otherwise impenetrable walls of the great healing centers of america. Just because you are emotionally unstable enough and gullible enough to believe these emotionally charged lies, don't expect us to buy it because we actually have a grasp on reality.",

I needn't state the names, dates and locations where the million plus babies are aborted each year because it is unquestionably true common knowledge that over 4000 american babies are murdered each and every workday of the year. Why must I document that which is already documented fact? \n \n \nWhy are you not as interested in the name of Jennifer's unborn child?\n\n \n I am, which is why I am opposing your socialist healthcare take over attempt. This Government can't even control the flu shot program or the cash for clunkers program efficiently. The US Post office loses billions of dollars each year and Medicare and Medicaid are rife with corruption and fraud. So what could possibly make you think this government could follow through on any of the bogus promises it is making regarding a healthcare system which will allegedly increase services and cost us less money at the same time? \n \n The very idea of it is ridiculous to the core as well as an absolutely irrational claim that only a looney lefty who is in complete denial of reality could believe. A high school junior with nothing more than economics 101 can see that the decisions this administration is making can only lead to a complete economic collapse. Nothing Obama is doing has any chance of lifting us out of this recession and can only bankrupt us in a finite period of time. I say that to avoid predicting a collapse date, but most economists believe we wont make it much past christmas before the system completely fails. \n \n Now, since I don't believe the socialists in the whitehouse are actually stupid people, it is obvious to me that they are purposely creating a financial crisis of such epic proportions that they can then appear to be our saviors when they jump in with their socialist solutions to save the day, finally accomplishing their agenda to plunge we the people into a position of permanent subservience to the collectivist state as paupers and surfs to the elites which Obama is putting the finishing touches on his back room deals with, as we speak. It is just a matter of time which is quickly approaching and the rest of the world sees it coming. Only the brainwashed leftist sheeple can't see it coming. Those so called self professed intellectuals who call us \"people of faith in God\" ignorant followers of dead sheep herders can't even recognize the hand writing on the wall. If their blind devotion to evil, and ignorance wasn't so sad and pathetic, it would actually be funny that educated people could be so easily conned. Here's what I mean: The demise of the dollar - Business News, Business - The Independent\n The demise of the dollarIn a graphic illustration of the new world order, Arab states have launched secret moves with China, Russia and France to stop using the US currency for oil trading\n \n By Robert Fisk\n Tuesday, 6 October 2009\n \n In the most profound financial change in recent Middle East history, Gulf Arabs are planning - along with China, Russia, Japan and France - to end dollar dealings for oil, moving instead to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan, the euro, gold and a new, unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council, including Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Qatar.\n Do you think the world will stop using the dollar to buy oil because they hate Obama? Cuz I thought the world loved him. So that can't be why they are abandoning our monetary system. It's because they see the collapse of the dollar coming which is why the Saudi's and others are quietly trading dollars so as not to cause an early panic. The american leftists may want to ignore these realities, but ignoring them wont insulate you from the repercussions of what this reality represents. It's like I said before we elected this enemy of the state, Obama; as americans, we either stand together or we fall together. Except for the super rich 1%, the rest of us are on the same boat and we will all sink into the pauper class once the dollar collapses and our investments are worthless. The only asset I own which I have any confidence in is the gold I have been buying since the 70s. Everything else wont be worth the paper it's written on. \n \n The question I have for you though, antonia, is have you ever considered anything I have said here? Has any of this ever entered your small mind at all? Of course in your usual fashion you will ignore this post as you do all facts which conflict with your preferred self delusions. But it is my hope that at least the questions asked here and the facts revealed will cause you to question the propaganda you are so committed to spreading here, and only God knows where else. emoticon_frazzled",

And there are many more who die because they are underinsured.\n \n But the bottom line is not that they can't get insurance, but that they can't get healthcare.\n\n \n Now to refute this propaganda and the lies it promotes, let me offer the other side of the story. Read it and weep antonia and simone.\n \n  \n Market Failure in Health Care?\n October 2009\n \n Four years ago then-Senate President Peter Welch, now Congressman, declared, not for the first time, that \"the private sector approach [in health care] has failed.\" That assertion has been echoed repeatedly by all of the advocates of increased government control over health and medicine, culminating in a wholly government run health care system.\n \n It never seems to occur to such people that, while there remain private actors in the health care sector, that entire sector has been distorted, restricted, mandated and indeed corrupted by decades of government meddling.\n \n A century ago the American Medical Association, concerned that a glut of new doctors would drive down doctors' fees for service, conspired with doctor-dominated state medical licensing boards to restrict access to medical schools and limit the number of emerging MDs.\n \n Through most of the 20th century - and even still - the physician's guild successfully pressured their state boards to strictly control routine medical duties provided by nurses, deny licenses to doctors working on contract for fraternal lodges and cooperative hospitals, and discipline doctors using new technology that threatened to lower treatment costs and thus fees.\n \n Responding to pressure from interest groups, legislatures have insisted that health insurance policies cover over a thousand specific treatments. These include such things as in-vitro fertilization, hair replacement, pastoral counseling and childbirth - even for single men, infertile women, and couples in their sixties.\n \n Even more premium-inflating are guaranteed issue and community rating. The first of these requires insurers to accept all comers, even those who skip buying insurance until they get sick.\n \n The second requires young people, just at the lower-income beginning of their working careers, and paying for college loans, home mortgages, and child rearing, to pay sharply higher premiums for the benefit of their sixtyish parents and grandparents who are almost inevitably better able to pay health insurance premiums. These \"Robin Hood in Reverse\" features are key provisions of ObamaCare.\n \n Then there is the disparate tax treatment of medical expenses. Thanks to wartime wage and price controls imposed by the Roosevelt administration in 1943, employer-provided health insurance became tax free to the employees. That benefit tied health insurance to employment, gave the power of choice to the employer, and denied portability when employees changed jobs. Individual insurance buyers must pay their premiums out of (diminished) after tax income.\n \n Tax free Health Savings Accounts, authorized by Congress in 2003, unfortunately cannot be used to pay premiums on the associated consumer driven health plans.\n \n Local citizen groups - based on churches, unions, fraternal lodges, and coops - might want to form health insurance buying pools and negotiate with insurers for good rates. State governments have made that illegal since the 1930s.\n \n Why not let Vermonters buy health insurance from carriers in the many states with far more reasonable insurance regulation? Many thousands of younger working people could save over two thirds of the cost of premiums they are now paying to Vermont's two remaining carriers. Forget it. No state presently allows its licensed carriers to accept bargain-hunting out of state customers.\n \n Modern pharmaceuticals can work wonders, but the cost of gaining FDA approval of a new drug runs well over $800 million. That's because the 1962 Kefauver amendment requires new drugs not only to be proven safe, but also effective. This ambiguous requirement dramatically escalates the cost of clinical testing, much of it now done in cheaper Third World countries. The large drug companies are happy with this requirement, however, because it erects an enormously expensive entry barrier to new drugs developed by their smaller competitors. \n \n Government drives health care costs far above market prices by sending millions of Medicare and Medicaid patients to health care providers, and paying far below the actual cost of the services rendered to them. Hospitals, required by the Hill-Burton Act to accept every patient that comes in the door, have no choice but to shift their losses into the price of care provided to patients with private insurance. This is the single most important factor in driving up private health insurance costs - far, far larger than the unpaid bills of uninsured patients.\n \n In most states, many doctors - especially obstetricians, anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons - face staggering medical malpractice premiums. This results from courts and juries imposing extravagant pain and suffering awards. The threat of malpractice litigation also leads doctors to run up the costs (\"defensive medicine\").\n \n The high costs of health care and health insurance are due to market failure? Let's call it what it is: it's the failure of government, politicians and interest groups to allow competitive and efficient markets to satisfy consumer desires.\n \n Get Ready for the Obama Individual Mandate\n October 2009\n \n With President Obama's government-run \"public option\" insurance proposal on the skids in Congress, attention has focused on an even more central part of his sweeping health care plan: the individual mandate.\n \n \"Individual mandate\" means that every person subject to it must buy a government-approved health insurance policy from a government-regulated insurance carrier. Or else what? Or else they must pay the government a \"fee\" for not being insured. This \"fee\", in the most recent Senate bill, amounts to as much as $3,800 a year for a family. If you willfully refuse to pay it, the government has the power to fine you another $25,000 and put you in jail for a year.\n \n Here's a brief tutorial on the issue.\n \n Government (mostly state government) regulates the sale of health insurance policies. Policies must have government-approved coverage and include a host of specific government-mandated terms and benefits.\n \n Many states (including Vermont) require community rating. This means that healthy young people must pay higher premiums to enable the insurance company to pay the health care expenses of their less healthy parents and grandparents.\n \n Many states (including Vermont) require guaranteed issue. This requirement forces the insurance companies to offer coverage to all applicants (except that pre-existing conditions aren't covered until after a waiting period, to discourage people from skipping insurance until they get sick.)\n \n Coverage mandates, community rating, and guaranteed issue drive up the cost of premiums. So many young working people, basically healthy, can't or don't buy coverage. They are the largest component of the uninsured.\n \n When the uninsured do have a health problem, they show up at the emergency room. Federal law requires the hospital to treat them, whether or not they can pay. The hospital factors this uncompensated care into its state-regulated rate structure. This shifts the cost of uncompensated care onto the premiums paid by people with private insurance.\n \n At the same time the two big government insurance programs - Medicare and Medicaid - seriously underpay for those they cover. These underpayments, far larger than non-payments of the uninsured, produce even greater cost shifts to private insurers, making insurance coverage even less affordable for many young workers.\n \n President Obama's solution to this is the individual mandate: \"You will buy a government approved insurance policy, or you will be fined/taxed/jailed until you comply.\"\n \n He also wants to prohibit insurance companies from denying immediate coverage for preexisting conditions. But this is very expensive. The only way to cover such expensive enrollees is to find more people to pay into the insurance pool, who aren't likely to require much treatment - the young and healthy who can't or won't buy insurance.\n \n The insurance companies fear the government will force them to cover expensive pre-existing conditions. Without the premiums paid by young and healthy new enrollees this mandate could put them out of business. So they are strongly in favor of the Obama individual mandate. For them, the individual mandate becomes a pre-emptive government bailout.\n \n What's wrong with this proposal?\n \n In the first place, Congress has no power to force Joe and Betty to buy a product specified by the government, or pay a tax. The taxing power cannot be used to force regulations on Americans, where the federal government has no constitutional power to regulate.\n \n All of the bills in Congress specify that a person can avoid the tax only by buying a government-approved policy. Every special interest - prescription drugs, substance abuse, mental health, in vitro fertilization, pregnancy, abortion - will lobby furiously to make sure the approved policy includes their money making product.\n \n This will of course drive up the cost of that product. President Obama proposes subsidies to people whose incomes are not adequate to pay the inflated premiums, and the taxpayer cost of these subsidies (and resulting deficits) will escalate accordingly. Ending \"uncompensated care\" will come nowhere close to yielding enough savings to cover these subsidies.\n \n The approved policies will clearly not include the increasingly popular lower cost, high deductible health plans coupled with tax-favored Health Savings Accounts. The House bill doesn't repeal the HSA language, but it imposes an accrual requirement designed to make sure that no such policy can be sold on the government-run monopoly insurance exchange, or qualify for the premium subsidies. Eight million Americans with HSA plans are a significant obstacle to expanding government health care, and the liberals in Congress are eager to eliminate their influence.\n \n Obama's protests to the contrary, his proposed \"fee\" on the uninsured is a tax. Even some of his own officials and the Congressional Budget Office recognize that fact. It's a clear violation of his firm campaign pledge not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $250,000 a year.\n \n The September 22 Wall Street Journal poll found respondents opposed 57-38 to an individual mandate. There are more reasons than liberty, constitutionality, cost, taxation, jail, corporate welfare, and reverse Robin Hood economics to oppose an individual mandate, but these ought to be enough.\n \n The Real Message of ObamaCare \n \n The national debate over health care reform has taken some unexpected turns.\n \n As more and more people have begun to grasp the import of the sweeping bills put forth by Congressional Democrats, outspoken resistance has become an epidemic.\n \n Images of uproarious town hall meetings have filled the TV screens. Many Democratic members of Congress seem to have gone into hiding. Surprised and alarmed, the Left has launched an intense counterattack.\n \n n one ludicrous counterthrust, the Left claimed, with zero evidence, that the protesters were paid shills for the health insurance industry (that had just cut a deal with Obama to support his individual mandate proposal.)\u00c2 \n \n President Obama, seemingly startled to learn that the people of this country don't seem to be taking kindly to his efforts to socialize the nation's health care industry, sternly admonished critics to \"don't do a lot of talking\" and \"get out of the way\" That's a bit ominous, coming from the President of the United States.\n \n Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid coined the phrase \"evilmonger\" \u0080\u009dto describe critics of his party's grand plans. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered her view that the same folks were \"un-American\".\n \n It's also amusing to note that suddenly, beginning about ten days ago, the Obama White House has been frantically chanting \"competition and choice\". When liberals extol \"competition and choice\", it means the government will compete against the private sector until it gains a monopoly, and employers will have the choice of scrapping their health care plans and turning their employees over to a government insurance program that the employees don't want any part of.\n \n There is in all this a message that President Obama badly needs to hear.\n Millions of Americans have caught on the scheme that's afoot in Washington. It's a witch's brew of:\n \n a federal mandate on every American to buy an insurance product that the federal government decrees is good for them (or it), with serious penalties for noncompliance.\n a new Medicare-type entitlement for the under-65, when Medicare is $37 trillion out of actuarial balance and will start outspending its revenues next year.\n a national insurance exchange that will allow insurers to offer only policies containing costly Federally-prescribed \"essential benefits\" and mandates, lobbied into the legislation by a host of special interests.\n an effective repeal of the increasingly popular tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts (liberals hate HSAs because they put patients in charge, not government regulators).\n an effective repeal of the ERISA act of 1974, that allows larger employers to control their own insurance coverage.\n a \"public option\" government insurance company that assuredly will undersell its private competitors through a range of subsidies and preferences, impelling employers to drop their plans, pay the new penalty tax, and dump their employees into government health care.\n a government-issued health care card that specifies just what medical services the government has determined that the bearer is eligible to receive.\n over $500 billion in reduced payments to doctors and hospitals over the coming ten years \u00e2\u0080\" with harmful consequences for seniors and the poor.\n a trillion dollars or more in additional ten-year Federal deficit spending, on top of Obama's astounding $1.7 trillion deficit in this fiscal year alone. After 2019, the health care deficit takes off like a rocket.\n increasingly explicit government-mandated rationing that is unavoidable whenever a large bureaucracy with finite tax dollars faces near-infinite demands. As a British National Health Service official observed, \"Money isn't limitless, so we need to make sure the money we have is spent on things which offer more than the care we'll have to forgo to pay for them.\"\n No wonder millions of Americans are up in arms.\n \n The stated reason for all this is to expand insurance coverage, improve health care, and curb deficit spending. But more and more ObamaCare has come to look like a naked grab for total government control over the nation's health care sector.\n \n Above everything else, liberals believe in the wonder-working power of government - regulatory, coercive, punitive, monopolistic - in the service of their approved ends. They cannot tolerate economic and political power widely distributed among free citizens pursuing their own diverse preferences and interests, instead of conforming to the liberal vision of the Greater Good.\n \n For zealous liberals, power must always be drawn upwards to the center. There it must be wielded - ruthlessly, if necessary - to irreversibly push America leftward. Americans are getting that message from the health care debate, and it's beginning to appear that a majority will not stand for it.\n \n I challenge antonia or simone to actually disprove anything said here with actual facts. emoticon_xgood\n Health Care",
