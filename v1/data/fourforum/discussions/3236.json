   "The statement that more people have been killed over religion may not be accurate.\n \n I would wager that more people have been killed over wealth (land, resources).\n \n All the huge wars of history were fought because of power and wealth. That's what empires are all about, and those are the ones who usually went around conquering and killing. They did it for wealth.\n \n \n Islamists are not just going to stay put. Their mission is to convert the world. Nigeria is a good example. There are huge clashes between christians and muslims there, started by both sides. Muslims are trying to spread Islam just like Christians are trying to spread Christianity. They just go about it a little differently. \n \n Anyway, back to the topic.\n I was watching Annan and Bush at the UN today. Annan started talking about all the things around the world that need UN fixin'. Sudan and Iraq were two obvious areas. One thing that he brought up that I guess I never thought about. He talked about the fact that all these world leaders in the UN will sit around and talk about things, draw up resolutions, and wait. But, nobody is rushing to pay the bills. He was basically saying that the UN can't do squat unless somebody pays for it. There hasn't been enough chipping in on the part of interested parties to solve most of these problems. Anyway, that's just one of the reasons why the UN, as an organization, is so ineffectual at times.",
