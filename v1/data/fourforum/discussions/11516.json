   "Alright let's see...what gun laws would I make if I could have my way?\n \n First off, the justice system would undergo a major renovation. Firearms charges couldn't be dropped or plea bargained away in the name of getting a conviction, they'd be a permanent part of the trial and the defendant would have to be found not guilty for them to go away. \n \n If someone is found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm they would receive a five year sentence just for being armed, and another five for every bullet found on their person, and another seven years for every round discharged.\n \n If someone is found guilty of trafficking guns to felons or other criminals, they'd receive ten years in prison for every gun trafficked, and another 20 years for every gun that was linked to a crime.\n \n There would be absolutely no parole or probation for anyone found guilty of federal firearms charges. If they decide to break the law with a gun then they can live out the rest of their days in prison and die there, that way we'd have far fewer people willing to be straw purchasers. You're not gonna look so tough and be regarded with any kind of respect when you're thrown in the hole for the rest of your life for stealing $12 from 7/11.\n \n Furthermore, if the jury returns a verdict of guilty on the firearms charges then the judges would be held responsible for failing to sentence the individual according to the guidelines. There would be no more suspended sentences, no more deciding that the minimum sentence is too harsh to fit the crime, no mercy for first-time offenders, nothing. If you're guilty of gun charges then you're going away for a long time, and if the judge refuses to follow the rules then he's going to prison as well.\n \n Second, the BATFE would receive a massive shakeup in the way they run businesses. They'd be forced to maintain proper records of everything done, everything decided, everything said, etc. Everything would be documented and required to be proven on a regular basis or else federal funding for the fiscal year will be slashed. No longer will FFL dealers be penalized for paperwork errors, nor would the BATFE be able to get away with telling someone that their product is perfectly legal, only to reverse their decision years later and claim that it's no longer legal for sale.\n \n The BATFE would also have much less leeway in determining what qualifies as a \"destructive device\" or is \"without any sporting value\". In short their reign of absolute power would be brought to an end and they'd be regulated just like any other government agency, with plenty of oversight and scrutiny.\n \n Third, the 1986 Machinegun Ban in the Firearm Owners Protection Act would be repealed and new models would be made available for civilian ownership immediately.\n \n Fourth, the \"sporting purpose\" clause governing the importation of firearms would be repealed.\n \n Fifth, the Tiahrt Amendment would be made a permanent law to ensure that nobody but police can ever access firearms trace data, and even then only for official police business and nothing else.\n \n Sixth, the Lautenburg Amendment would be repealed.\n \n Seventh, there would be a preemptive end to any local gun licensing and gun registration laws, effectively ending all state firearms databases.\n \n And that's just for starters.",

And yet you're saying you're against it? Care to examine your contradiction?\n\n \n What exactly is the point of criminalizing the being a victim of crime?

According to you, if you're at the range and somebody steals your gun while you're getting more ammunition from the box that's two feet away, you should have your Second Amendment rights permanently revoked because you didn't ensure that your gun was secured and accessible to only for you. In your mind if a gun is accessible to anybody but its known owner, even for one second, that's a crime that should be punished with the maximum penalty possible.\n \n \nYou want high powered weapons? Sure, you just have greater responsibilities for securing them. Or is that you just want high powered weapons with no liability? :xbanghead\n\n \n I'm beginning to think that the whole \"Lost or Stolen Firearms Act\" was originally your idea.\n \n \nExcept your own laws citations already prove we're on that. At least this way we get more freedoms.\n\n \n How about your prove how your idea grants more freedom, because to me it sounds like nothing but constant fear that explicitly targets gun owners and places an excessive burden on them. Sounds like some new demented form of segregation to me.\n \n \nAgreed. You ****ed up by failing to secure your weapons. That criminal was able to use your weapons which you failed to secure in a crime. If YOU have properly done your CIVIC DUTY to secure your weapons, that weapon could not have been used in a crime.\n\n \n As said before, kindly explain, in detail, exactly how a person secures their gun so a criminal can never, ever, under any circumstances, manage to steal it from the rightful owner. What exactly are we talking about here, leaving it with the police 24/7? Placing it in concrete? Burying under 25 feet of tightly compacted dirt in the back yard behind the garage under a stone slab?\n \n Surely if you're promoting this whole \"secured gun\" idea then obviously you have exact requirements for what qualifies as \"secured\" so let's hear them.\n \n \nLikewise the person who secured their car would have reasonably done their duty.

   "I have always strived to give everyone here the respect their posts deserve. I am about to do so now for you, OC. Let me start with your quote referring to those who disagree with you:\n \n \n but none of you douchebags... \n\n \n Thus sayeth the one who wishes to be thought of as one of the\n \n \n mature people\n\n \n \n How is a gun owner who improperly secures his weapons innocent? How is a person who GIVES a firearms to someone who cannot legally have it innocent?\n You just cited laws that criminalize such behavior. And yet you're saying you're against it? Care to examine your contradiction? \n\n \n I will ignore your many spelling and grammar errors for now, OC, so that I might focus on your arguments. You were advocating the following: \n \n \n As I understand the data, the vast majority of firearms crimes are done with stolen or otherwise illegally acquired weapons (someone buying weapons for felons). Give huge incentives to people to lock their **** up and make sure it never falls into the hands of criminals and we'll cut down firearms used in crimes \n \n \n And you said the way to do this was to make this law:\n \n \n If any of your weapons if used in a crime earns you the same punishment as the criminal who used it \n\n \n My response was to disagree with your proposal to make criminals out of home burglary victims. It is foolish to suggest that a person who comes home to find their house broken into should be held responsible for the latter actions of the thief. Safe storage laws are one thing, but making the crime victim responsible for the subsequent actions of someone he has no control over is quite another. I believe such an argument is devoid of all logic and reason. \n \n I never said, or even remotely suggested, that a person who gives a gun to a known felon is \"innocent,\" or that I am against punishing such a person. The laws I cited were to the contrary. I realize that when faced with an argument you cannot rebut the temptation is great to pretend I also said something additional and irrational so you can find something to blame, but in the end it merely becomes you arguing with yourself, and I would encourage you to avoid such fantasies. What I say in my posts is represented in what I write, not in what your paranoia adds to it when you read it. The contradiction you wish to see is the product of your own imagination, OC. \n \n \nThe vast majority of firearm crimes are done with illegal weapons. People want all kinds of weapons but none of you douchebags wants the responsibility for having such freedoms. \n My idea maximizes your freedoms yet places high responsibility on gun owners. (hint: that's what mature people support, not liberal ideas of maximum freedoms and no responsibility). You want high powered weapons?\n Sure, you just have greater responsibilities for securing them. Or is that you just want high powered weapons with no liability? \n\n \n Again, I am responsible for the ideas and thoughts I write here, and not for those you wish to attribute to me as cover to hide your ignorance of current laws regulating firearms. I have never once advocated for an unrestricted right. I have never advocated for a right unfettered by individual responsibility or without consequences for criminal misuse. In fact I have frequently argued to the contrary. I have posted here far, far fewer times than you. It is not difficult to read what I have said on this topic if you are really interested knowing how baseless your suggestion is. \n \n Now let me turn to how you addressed your error on the current status of the law.\n \n \nIt is a long and dangerous road you would travel if we were to make someone responsible for the criminal acts of another without proof they are working together in concert of action. \n\n \nExcept your own laws citations already prove we're on that. At least this way we get more freedoms. \n\n \n No, OC. The laws I cited all require the aider and abettor to share the common criminal intent with the person illegally possessing the weapon. It is not a crime merely to give a gun to a felon. As I cited earlier, the person giving the gun must share the criminal intent to let an actual felon have the gun-he must give the gun while \"knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person\" is a felon. I refuse to believe you are so blissfully free of the ravages of intelligence to miss this point, but the only other alternative is to believe you are deliberately misinterpreting the statute I quoted to you. And it did not end there...\n \n \nAnd the federal only limits it to 10 years. That's not the same punishment that a criminal could receive...Your own citations refute your argument. They limit in most cases punishment for the accompliance to 10 years. That is not what you argued. \n \n \n I'm sorry, but I can't leave this one alone OC. The word is \"accomplice.\" Calling that person an \"accompliance\" makes him sound like a refrigerator or a stove. \n \n Here is where we are on the statutes, OC. You claimed we needed to make the punishments the same for the felon and the strawman who got the gun for him because doing so would drastically cut down on illegal gun crime. I responded by showing you this was already the law and gave you the code section citations so you could look them up for yourself before you responded to my post. You responded by saying you're still right and the punishment is not the same.\n \n There are only three possibilities for your response. Let me post the actual statutes here for all to see and then ask you which it is: \n \n The portion of 922 (paragraph \"g\") which makes it illegal for certain persons to have firearms:\n \n (g) It shall be unlawful for any person -\n (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;\n (2) who is a fugitive from justice;\n (3) who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 802));\n (4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution;\n (5) who, being an alien -\n (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or\n (B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26)));\n (6) who has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions;\n (7) who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced his citizenship;\n (8) who is subject to a court order that -\n (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had an opportunity to participate;\n (B) restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child; and\n (C) (i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or\n (9) who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\n to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n \n The portion of 922 (paragraph \"d\") which makes it illegal for any person (\"strawman\" or otherwise) to sell or give a firearm to these persons:\n \n (d) It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person -\n (1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;\n (2) is a fugitive from justice;\n (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 802));\n (4) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution;\n (5) who, being an alien -\n (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or\n (B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26)));\n (6) who has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions;\n (7) who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced his citizenship;\n (8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child, except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order that -\n (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate; and\n (B) (i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or\n (9) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\n \n The relevant punishment section of 924(a)(2):\n \n (2) Whoever knowingly violates subsection (a)(6), (d), (g), (h), (i), (j), or (o) of section 922 shall be fined as provided in this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\n \n Listen again, OC: The exact same penalty for the convicted felon who gets the gun and the strawman or other person who sells or gives it to him. I gave you the opportunity to look this up for yourself. Now here are the three possibilities for your response:\n \n 1. You simply refused to read the statutes and continued to assume they said what you want them to say;\n 2. You did read them but were unable to understand them; or\n 3. You read them, understood you were wrong, but you chose to continue to make believe they say what you know now to be untrue rather than admit you were wrong.\n \n Which is it, OC?\n \n \"Mature people\" are capable of admitting they made a mistake. Now you have an opportunity to prove your maturity-or will you simply call me more names for assailing your pride again?\n \n If you are going to be stupid, OC, then you've got to be tough. If you want to post things with little thought and zero research, then you've got to be tough enough to take being shown when you are wrong without getting mad and calling people names. If you want to bait me with more name calling and focus my attention further upon you then fine. But I have demonstrated that I know far more about gun laws than you, and I tell you it is likely that I know far more about the issue of gun crime in general than you. Be prepared for a further beat down if you persist in challenging me with arguments divorced from both logic and fact.",

The reasons for this vary: the power of the gun lobby; the tendency of both sides of the issue to resort to sloganeering and pre-packaged arguments when discussing the issue; the fact that until an individual is affected by handgun violence he or she is unlikely to work for handgun restrictions; the view that handgun violence is an \"unsolvable\" problem; the inability of the handgun restriction movement to organize itself into an effective electoral threat; and the fact that until someone famous is shot, or something truly horrible happens, handgun restriction is simply not viewed as a priority. Assault weapons-just like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearms-are a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weapons-anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun-can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. In addition, few people can envision a practical use for these weapons\n\n http://www.vpc.org/studies/awaconc.htm\n \n \n \n \n\n Sawed off shotguns are regulated under Federal law and require a police chief to sign an approval form so they can be owned.

   "I don't want to put words in your mouth when you are offering to talk specifics, Brady, but when you responded to someone else and said:\n \n \n No Im talking about plastic guns that can fire real bullets \n\n \n I assume you meant a desire to ban guns that can defeat detection by metal scanners. If so then I have no problem with that. \n \n But I do want to ask some questions about the \"assault weapons\" you wish to ban. You say they should be banned: \n \n \n because their designed for criminal purpose and not for practical purposes. \n\n \n I must say I find this a rather vague standard, and indeed the source you cited us to for this standard says this about \"assault weapons\": \n \n \"America's handgun restriction movement has been cautious in its response to the assault weapons debate. Their reticence is understandable. By moving against a category of firearm that is not only a long gun, but difficult to define, they run the risk of appearing to prove the gun lobby right: that is, that handgun restrictions are merely the first step down the aforementioned slippery slope.\"\n \n So let's talk about how your AW ban legislation would be written... \n \n How will the ban/approval process work in your legislation? \n \n When a gun maker sets a new gun on the table for you to look at, what criteria will you use to say \"that one is OK\" or \"that one is not\"? \n \n What will it be about a gun which will help you determine \"designed for criminal purposes\"? \n \n Will there be objective criteria-for example-things like the gun is \"semi-automatic\" or has a \"folding stock\" or \"is less than X inches in length\" or \"is capable of accepting a magazine holding more than X rounds of ammunition\" or \"has a flash suppressor/thumbhole stock\"? \n \n These are the details you must engage in before your idea can be taken seriously. You and I are equally aware that attempting to leave your definition of a prohibited \"assault weapon\" as merely any firearm meeting a vague and undefined standard of being \"designed for criminal purposes\" would allow you to say just about any weapon can be banned. I think you would agree with me that applying this standard \"run[s] the risk of proving the gun lobby right: that is, that handgun restrictions are merely the first step down the aforementioned slippery slope.\" \n \n So why not roll up your sleeves with me and talk specifics and show you are genuinely interested in your AW ban plan?\n \n What do you say?",

To make a receiver that'll work, you'd need to have the blueprints of one with the exact measurements of every contour and groove, as well as the ability to duplicate these measurements to make sure the fit of the parts isn't too tight or too loose.\n \n Then you'd need the tools to make the receiver, which can be gone about two ways. You can either invest in the technology to make a cast receiver from poured molten metals like Ruger does, or you can machine the receiver from a solid billet of steel or aluminum like Smith & Wesson does. Going the machining way would be easier as you don't have to work with molten metals and thousands of degrees of heat, but it's a very slow way when working by hand and much more difficult as the machines need to be exact in cutting away all the excess, or else parts will bind and not work right.\n \n Keep in mind that neither way is something that you can do in your garage, but rather requires a workshop full of the right equipment, which will cost you thousands of dollars.",

   "Congress did use its power to regulate interstate commerce to create a \"tax ban\" on machineguns. This ban survives today and would be treated differently from Chester's proposal because these weapons are not considered within the scope of the protected RKBA. Chester's proposal is indiscriminate, and would impact all firearms.\n \n Chester's tax proposal begins with \"Let all types of guns be freely bought and sold,\" but this creates only the illusion of greater freedom than we have now. Chester's tax would create a de facto ban on the ability of the vast majority of Americans to freely exercise the RKBA. It would limit the right to the mere ability to hang it over the mantelpiece and watch it gather dust. \n \n And this may well be the intent. The clearly intended impact is to severely restrict the possession of a firearm capable of being anything other than a rock of a club. No other justification was offered for the law when it was proposed. The subsequently posted goal of \"Seems to us that it would go a long way toward keeping it out of the hands of the bad guys, who probably couldn't afford it any more\" comes as little more than a justifying afterthought coupled with an assumption of the purchasing power of street criminals. \n \n But here is the key point. Chester's tax argument accepts that the individual RKBA exists. And so the question becomes how does this tax law deal with reality, in which the RKBA has been held to include a right to have a functioning firearm for self defense. The answer is that it cannot, for it is as much a ban on the defined RKBA as the DC \"disassembled inoperable stored separately from ammo\" ban which has been declared unconstitutional. \n \n We can call comparing the RKBA to other rights in the BoR a strawman argument if you want, but bear in mind Chester's tax assumes we don't look at the BoR and count the individual liberty amendments like this: 1,(skip),3,4,5,6,7,8. He merely argues that the RKBA is unique in being the only right subject to an exorbitant user's fee before exercising the right can be realized. In this sense his tax is nothing more than an idea born of a purely personalized preference against the RKBA which makes use of the Orwellian argument that \"all rights are equal, but this one is not as equal as others I like more.\" \n \n Significantly, this personal preference is the only levee offered to shelter the other rights in the BoR from similar treatment. So if I also propose a $50 per word tax on blogging here, how do you answer it? Like Chester's ammo tax it would not amount to an outright ban. In fact here is my answer to that argument:\n \n \"Who here is suggesting banning (blogging)?\n You can have all of it you can pay for.\n Seems to us that it would go a long way toward keeping (blogging out of the hands of malicious teenagers who use it to spread hatred of others and even cause suicides, since these teenagers) probably couldn't afford it any more.\n As for the rest of you, well, you can just adjust your family budget, just as all of us have had to do to pay for the Son-of-a-Bush's $4 gasoline. \n If you want it badly enough, you'll make the sacrifices necessary to get it, right?\"\n \n If it is a strawman to use his same logic against rights others cherish, then explain how the RKBA is to be treated differently than our other rights, beyond Chester wishing it to be so. If there is a coherent argument for treating rights in the BoR differently, then I would like to hear its justification. \n \n Incidentally, if I could get my $50 per word tax passed, then who here could afford to blog post disagreement with my law beyond charging $100 on their VISA card to say \"I disagree\"? My tax would crush blogging as surely as Chester's tax is intended to effectively deny the RKBA to the majority of Americans. His law is intended to largely accomplish by indirect taxation what the government has been prohibited from doing by a direct ban. To pretend that Chester's tax would do otherwise is to engage in an exercise of willful self-delusion.",

And now that SCOTUS has ruled it to be an individual right you want to take it back and redefine the same phrase to exclude ammunition? \n \n Remember back when you argued the 2nd. Amendment was not an individual right, but a collective right of the states to arm their militias? \n \n \n A scholar explains-\n \n Madison rejected all changes to the Constitution that he thought would weaken the federal government, including its control over the militia. As he rhetorically asked, \"For whose benefit is the militia organized, armed and disciplined? for the benefit of the United States.\"[91] He was willing to respond to the fears of the Antifederalists by granting the states, in Carl Bogus's words, \"a concurrent authority [Page 74] to arm their militia.\"[92] The result was a single sentence with a clarifying preamble: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n That's what the second amendment is about. \n\n \n This was your endorsement of the Bogus argument that the 2nd. Amendment phrase \"right to keep and bear arms\" was intended to give the states a right to arm and equip their militias as a counterbalance to a federal standing army.\n \n Here is where the contradiction arises, Brady:\n \n This argument included within it a state's right to also provide ammunition to the militia members to make the provided \"arms\" functional. Bogus has never argued otherwise. You know this. When you accepted the Bogus argument you accepted his belief that the phrase \"right to keep and bear arms\" included ammunition for those arms. \n \n Or are you really prepared to say the founders-wanting to assuage anti-federalist fears about the power of a federal government and its standing army-chose to guarantee a state's right which would be limited to providing their militia members with rifle-shaped clubs? I mean, you're not saying that when you endorsed the collective state's right view you thought Congress could tell the states \"you have the right to keep and bear arms. It doesn't say (your militias) have the right to shoot arms,\" are you? One could well hear Patrick Henry's complaint in response: \"Would your mace bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment?\" \n \n Deny, if you can, that your previous position defined the phrase \"right to keep and bear arms\" as a right of the states to equip the militias with both arms and ammunition. In fact, you really didn't care one way or the other so long as the states controlled the right and limited it to militia service. \n \n And now that SCOTUS says the right is individual you want to take it back and say Congress can ban ammunition after all. \n \n I hear people arguing there is a \"first person who mentions the NAZIs rule\" to debating here. Well there is also a rule of common sense which says people who contradict themselves have no credibility.\n \n ---\n \n Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four, pt. 2, ch. 9 (1949).

   "The TEC-9 ads touted its \"excellent resistant to fingerprints\" and \"high volume of firepower\" and Navegar boasted that news reports of criminals using the TEC-9 were \"good as far as sales go.\" The easily concealed TEC-9 assault weapon was equipped with military features to provide rapid-fire capability including a 32-round ammunition magazine, a barrel designed for an illegal silencer, and was promoted in magazines like \"Soldier of Fortune.\" \n http://www.bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=328\n \n The TEC-9 assault weapon is made with fingerprint resistant finish. There is no legitimate and legal reason for a gun to be fingerprint resistant.

   "Alright, I've decided to pick this entire post apart and give it the abuse that it so richly deserve. I'm gonna go sentence by sentence, statement by statement, even word by word if necessary.\n \n So let's begin with the most erroneous claim.\n \n \nThe TEC-9 ads touted its \"excellent resistant to fingerprints\"\n\n \n I've researched the TEC-9, and found this ad by Intratec: link.\n \n The ads says that the finish is resistant to fingerprints, but in the same sentence it says the finish is resistant to sweat, rust, petroleum distillates, solvents, cleaners, powder residue, sea salt spray and corrosion. Basically there's no substance that you can expose the TEC-9 to that'll cause it damage. This gun wasn't designed for handiness to criminals, it was designed to last, it was designed to take a beating and still function; this is basically Intratec's version of Ruger firearms.\n \n Second is this link, which says that even though the TEC-9 has a \"fingerprint resistant\" finish, prints are still capable of being lifted from one.\n \n Third, one of the key materials in TEC-9 construction is polymers, which is something Glocks are largely made out of. Yet Glock hasn't advertised their handguns as being fingerprint resistant. So obviously somebody's lying here.\n \n \nand \"high volume of firepower\" and Navegar boasted that news reports of criminals using the TEC-9 were \"good as far as sales go.\"\n\n \n I'd like to see some proof that the Intratec of Navegar company actually made this statement, and that they stand by it. I'd also like to see some proof that they were serious when they made this rather than joking around. Who can forget the former presidential candidate who made the claim of \"Vote for me or I'll kill you!\"? To establish guilt you first have to prove motive.\n \n \nThe easily concealed TEC-9 assault weapon\n\n \n Alright, first the TEC-9 is about 13\" long, bulky, heavy, and very wide. Anybody with a concealed carry permit will tell you that trying to hide a gun of average size like the 1911, which is considerably smaller than the TEC-9, is very difficult, which is why specifically built pocket guns which are much smaller in size are very popular for concealed carry.\n \n \nwas equipped with military features to provide rapid-fire capability\n\n \n A barrel shroud isn't a military feature when discussing a handgun, because no military handgun has a barrel shroud on it. Find me a picture of a 1911 or a Beretta M9 with a ventilated piece of steel covering the barrel and I'll concede the point that it's a military feature, but until then you're wrong.\n \n \nincluding a 32-round ammunition magazine,\n\n \n Adding to the difficulty of concealing it.\n \n \na barrel designed for an illegal silencer,\n\n \n Under NFA34 guidelines a silencing device isn't illegal, just restricted. Obtaining a silencer is perfectly legal, and requires a police chief to sign off on the application. Are you saying that the police are incapable of doing their job and that they don't know what they're doing and shouldn't be left to make decisions like this?\n \n \nand was promoted in magazines like \"Soldier of Fortune.\"\n \n \n And the point of this statement is?\n \n \nhttp://www.bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=328\n\n \n The Brady Campaign has absolutely no credibility. They often say that terrorists are buying machineguns and missiles at gun shows, but anybody with an ounce of brain will tell you they're wrong. Somebody with two ounces of brain will ask why, if the Brady Campaign knows this, they're not working with the FBI to obtain these known terrorists and catch them in the act.\n \n \nThe TEC-9 assault weapon is made with fingerprint resistant finish. There is no legitimate and legal reason for a gun to be fingerprint resistant.\n \n \n Even if such a finish was designed not for the purpose of making the gun untraceable (which it wasn't) but rather to keep it from rusting when exposed to the oils and chemicals found in fingerprints?\n \n \nAdditionally, this gun is known for its wild inaccuracy and is constructed to be able to spray large amount of bullets over a large area.\n\n \n When the Colt 1911 first came onto the scene many people complained that it couldn't hit the broad sign of a barn. Today the 1911 is used by many target and exhibition shooters who rely on accuracy.\n \n \nThis does not seem to be a gun made for target practice or hunting.\n \n \n A gun is made by the company for the purpose of being bought by the consumers and to generate revenue to keep the economy going. The ones who buy the product make the determination of what it's suitable for.\n \n \nAdditionally, many guns are made today that are much more powerful than would be necessary for any legitimate use.\n\n \n Any 9mm handgun or carbine pales in comparison to a .357 Magnum revolver with a 6\" barrel, any expert on ballistics can tell you this.\n \n Add to this you fail to mention various uses that you consider \"legitimate\" so it's very difficult to determine what you mean. Going by this and your history of posts it's only safe to assume that in your mind, there's absolutely no legitimate use for having a gun.\n \n \nAmmunition magazines are also imported that can hold enormous numbers of bullets, far more than would be necessary for any purpose other than shooting at people.\n\n \n I present the following video as evidence of the latest shooting sport to emerge in America; Three Gun Competition. A recognized sport where high-capacity magazines are an absolute necessity. Therefore they have a legitimate legal purpose.\n \n \nThe argument could then be made that simply because these guns are not necessary to be used for sporting purposes, there are people who enjoy owning them, so why should they be illegal?\n\n \n The ferrari is a car that has absolute no off-road capabilities, no room for hauling around a family, no use for going around town and to the store; the only purpose of a ferrari is to go as fast as humanly possible and look very pompous doing it too. Obviously this car has no legitimate use. Why should it remain legal when it's obviously designed for people who only want to drive fast, likely those trying to escape the police at 120 mph?\n \n \nThe answer can be best demonstrated by the fact that these same lines of argument can be then extended to even more powerful weapons, such as rocket launchers or SCUD missiles.\n\n \n Except for the fact that rockets and missiles are banned from civilian ownership under NFA34 guidelines and thus this argument is moot and void, and you should feel embarrassed for even considering the use of it to prove a point.\n \n \nBanning such weapons might in fact be an inconvenience to a certain element of the population who enjoys the way owning powerful weaponry makes them feel, but laws are not legislated in this country based on the convenience of the few, rather on the safety of the many.\n \n \n Yet there's no proof that would support the banning of these weapons would provide any measure of safety to anyone other than criminals.\n \n \nThat assault weapon was one of the guns used in Columbine.Truly sickening that people on your side are defending things like this\n\n \n Your side's claim has been that the 1994-2004 AWB that covered a number of weapons, defined solely by appearance and nothing else, was an integral part of saving many, many lives. Yet you're claiming that the TEC-9, which was clearly banned under the 1994 AWB, was used in the massacre of a dozen innocent people.\n \n If the weapon in question was banned from ownership, how was it used in the massacre? If there was a loophole that allowed this to happen, how did the AWB ensure that killings with so called \"assault weapons\" were stopped during that ten year period? Only one position can be the true one, so you have to choose which one you want to support.\n \n You can either support your position that the AWB will keep people safe, or you can support the position that the banned weapon was used for killing; at the same time admitting that the AWB provided no protection to anyone.",
