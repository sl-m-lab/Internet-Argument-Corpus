   "I was reading in The Economist an interesting article about ants and it says : that the success of ants as a species lies in their sophisticated, strictly hierarchical social organisations. Ant colonies are founded on two main &#8220;castes&#8221; of ant: queens, whose sole function is reproduction, and their industrious, sterile, worker daughters. (The only use for males is to inseminate the queen; afterwards they are either driven out of the nest or killed.)\n \n This is similar to the bees where the drones fly to to mate with the queen bee, only one gets lucky but dies soon afterwards (with a smile on his face?)\n and the other drones soon follow his fate. Spiders and praying mantis also seem to consider males as someone to dispense with after intercourse.\n \n How come this dispensing with the male of the species did not become universal?",

Good parenting also increases chances for survival. It's not all about reproduction. Gay and lesbian parents can contribute to the survival in many ways, by raising our own children, reproducing by many different methods, or by contributing to the well-being of our families, like in kin selection.

That is, both the father-at-home and the many-fathers explanations are valid, but they operated at different times in our evolutionary history. Concealed ovulation arose at a time when our ancestors were still promiscuous or living in harems. At such times, it let the ancestral woman distribute her sexual favors to many males, none of whom could swear that he was the father of her baby but each of whom knew that he might be. As a result, none of those potentially murderous males wanted to harm the baby, and some may actually have protected or helped feed it. Once the woman had evolved concealed ovulation for that purpose, she then used it to pick a good man, to entice or force him to stay at home with her, and to get him to provide lots of help for her baby.\n\n \n Sex and the Female Agenda | Sex & Reproduction | DISCOVER Magazine\n \n \nAnd the correct way to counter anti-gay rhetoric is by making false claims about evolutionary psychology?\n\n \n I was playing devil's advocate, as Archangel was saying reproduction is all-important to species survival.

   "The researchers&#8217; analysis of the Neanderthal toddlers&#8217; growth rate lead them to hypothesize that Neanderthal babies grew more quickly in their early years than Homo sapiens, which could have placed a burden on their mothers. &#8220;Neanderthals must have had a rich diet in protein and fat for children to fuel rapid growth in [their] brains,&#8221; said [anthropologist] Holly Smith.

   "That large, faster-growing brain came with a price tag. Neanderthal mothers probably needed to dedicate more resources-food and maternal care-to their infants than modern humans do. From this study [subscription required], Zollikofer concludes that Neanderthal mothers may have had their first child, on average, when they were a year or two older than modern humans and that their time between pregnancies was probably longer. \n \n #8: Cavemen: They're Just Like Us | Neanderthals | DISCOVER Magazine",

Obviously we were one of the few species that has monogamous, life-long pairing. It wasn't always like this in our early evolutionary history(see my earlier like about early strategies related to promiscuity and concealed ovulation). That strategy did evolve, I wasn't denying this.

   "Well Jake, you're arguing 3 things here\n \n 1) Neanderthals reproduce more slowly. You haven't provided any good evidence for this.\n \n 2) Neanderthals suffer from reproducing more slowly, and in fact this is why they died out.\n \n 3) Neanderthals benefit from reproducing more slowly, because their young require more resources. Reproducing more slowly aids their survival as a species.\n \n Either 2) or 3) may be true, but both can't be true at the same time.

   "Well, no Neanderthals don't benefit in the long run, because they were inefficient. Humans evolved more efficient brains, which didn't grow at the same terrifically fast rate early in life. That didn't require more resources, and more breastfeeding, which has an effect on fertility. \n \n Also, the Neaderthals died off more quickly, and failed to replace themselves. They did have to wait a longer interval between reproducing than humans.\n \n Yes, it's true you can say they benefited from not reproducing as quickly, but they still didn't reproduce enough, and not efficiently enough, to keep extinction at bay. I think one can argue both points, in relation to their inferior reproduction outcomes.",
