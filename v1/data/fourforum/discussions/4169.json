As if homosexuals are bad, which they aren't, and it's uneducated stupidity to think otherwise. OH NO \"evil homosexual agenda!\" gonna distort my good christian power. Oh woe is the world--why can't it be like the 50's, a time of nostaliga that never was.\n \n 2. OH no, Atheists are evil and dangerous! They want to destroy us and make everyone atheist! Kinda like how christians want to make everyone christian and stuff proseletizing down your throats and how they attempt to infiltrate education and the government, getting their \"actually dangerous\" agenda's passed.\n \n 3. Murder! Violence! oohhhh must be a modern problem! Even though morality hasn't really changed much since the 50's. In fact, there are higher standards of morality than in earlier history. \n \n \n\n Now we have a gay Spongebob\n\n \n 1. Woe is you! A gay cartoon character! Oh me oh my! What dangers lurk in the corners! Pehraps next they will brainwash you all to be.....GAY! Spare the ********. Who the hell cares if spongebob is gay, as long as it makes people happy and hurts no one else. Spare me the christian-whine line about how everyone's oppresing you and your values. It's been getting old for a century now. \n \n 2. Perhaps I am sick of the putrid christian programming that filles 4 of my channels. You don't see me making a god-damn fuss. Stop whinning.\n \n \n\n ...which is very dissappointing since I enjoyed watching it with my nephew, however now I must go back to Veggie Tales since that is the last wholesome entertainment for a 5 year old. \n\n \n What is your definition of wholesome? Biblical tales of mysogeny, hate, mass-murder/genocide? Rape, onanism? Is that wholesome enough?\n \n \n \n\n Of course you're called a radical conservative or a bible banger if you are one of the few people who has values and morals left on this earth. It's disheartening, but inevitable.\n\n \n The bible isn't fit to be called a book of morals. It's a POS that needs to be flushed. It's simplistic, simple-minded, violent, and based on the reward/punishment philosophy with a sub-set of pain and suffereing. There are many moral systems which blow the Bible out of the water. The Bible isn't moral hardly.\n \n \n\n Sex is viewed as simple socializing behavior. There is no respect for what marriage represents or the sacredness of it any longer. Pornography is running wild all over the internet as the abortion rate increases as well.\n\n \n Sex is a social behavior. THis doesn't take a rocket-scientist. Sex isn't meant only for reproduction. If you actually looked around in nature or studied anthropology instead of the Bible, you would know this.\n \n Marriage isn't sacred. It's not a christian or religious institution. It's an social institution that can be religious. The ceremony is religious, the idea has nothing to do with it. It's not sacred, although people treat it as a sacred cow--quite unnecessarily.\n \n Pornography? Hurts no one as long as it's voluntary. The Bible is filled with as much filth and violence which far outstripps porno. There's nothing inherently bad about seeing naked people, people having sex, or tit and XXX. There is something wrong about reading fantasy stories in which young children are exposed to people bashing tent spikes through people's skulls while they sleep peacefully (found in the bible). So please, spare the \"porno is teh evil\" routine. THe Bible is way worse.\n \n \n\n Drugs have spiraled out of control here in America half the country is on Prozac while the other half is out back getting high. Teenager depresion and suicide rates continue to rise as well.\n\n \n Yea. I agree with you here. Drugs are a problem, but you can't do squat about it. There are casees of drug perscriptions not being needed, but this is also a problem from the educational sphere. Teachers would rather have kids drugged and good than disciplined. It's easier to hit them up.\n \n \n\n Violence is not only condoned but is made a spectacle of now with such horrible things as bums fighting each other for a 12 pack of beer or fraternity initiations beating the kids.\n\n \n The bible condones violence and shows it quite often in gory, bloody detail as well as moral poems. It encourages it.\n \n \n\n The radical left has done everything in its power to stop any resurgance of Christianity and attacks anything that is remotely related to it. \n\n \n Thank the God's of Kobol christianity isn't resurging, or we would see a lot more Bible filth and persecution.\n \n \n\n The Passion of the Christ was passed up for Best Picture of the Year and Best Director when it was the 9th all time grossing film and 3rd hottest box office hit of the year. \n\n \n So what? I went to see it just so see Jesus get beaten. That was the only good part. So what if a bunch of religious lunatics went to see it for the \"christianity?\" Who cares?\n \n \n\n The detailed and accurate portrayl of Christ has never been better, yet still we get some idiot like Michael Moore up on top instead simply because his views coincide with the Liberal Hollywood.\n\n \n Accurate? Eh? YOu mean by Biblical standards? The Bible isn't too reliable as a source of knoweldge.\n \n \n\n The ACLU is a disgusting organization that should be torn apart and put into the dumpster. \n\n \n 1. It does some bad, but it also does a lot of good. If you didn't have it, you would be in a hurt.\n \n 2. Christianity is a disgusting religion, and it shoudl be torn apart and put into the dumpster where Jesus belongs.\n \n \n\n They represent everything and everyone that is against Christian views and for organizations such as Nambla ( North American Man Boy Love Association ). They were also defending a man who had sexual relations with a 14 year old saying that the girl was of an age to say yes. So I think the American Civil Liberties Union should rename theirself into the Anti-Christian Liberties Union.\n \n\n \n 1. NAMBLA is a wacko organisation. Not even I support it. Yes, this is an example of a wrongdoing. \n \n 2. Oh no! They are against christian views! OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Who gives a rats XXX? Christians enjoy persecuting, but they don't like being called on it or controlled. The ACLU will defend anyone and anything they can get their hands on. It's about business. I think there should be an Anti-Christian Liberties union. So what? Christ sucks anyway.\n \n \n\n With society making it's final circles in the drain it's a wonder how much longer God will share his grace before he pours out his wrath on this world. That is my rant for this morning.\n Reply With Quote\n\n \n Don't worry. WHen the moronic christians get ready for the Rapture, everything will be ok! The world will be a paradise! They will be saaaaaaaaaaaaaved!",

Murder! Violence! oohhhh must be a modern problem! Even though morality hasn't really changed much since the 50's. In fact, there are higher standards of morality than in earlier history. \n \n \n \n \n\n It's not our justice. It's God's justice. \n \n Our God is a God of love, but He is also a God of justice. If there were no justice in Heaven, there could be no justice on Earth--there would be no reason why you couldn't kill your next-door neighbor and take his house, or your next-door neighbor take your house! (Forget claims of practicality. Humans are really good at finding excuses for doing what they want to do and claiming it's for a higher moral principle.)\n \n Having a Divine and perfect justice system, God next faces the issue that His creation rebelled against Him. His creatures turned away from Him. He didn't turn away from them. What is He to do? Forgive everyone? He wants to do that, but they have to respond. \n \n I don't know the reasons why God forbade homosexual acts. There are supposedly practical reasons why not, such as promoting families for the protection of children. Furthermore, I believe that marriage is supposed to reflect on Earth the love and intimacy between a man and a woman that is reflected between all creatures in Heaven. This is why angels do not marry, and why Jesus said men and women in Heaven will not marry. \n But that is beside the major issue: God forbade homosexual acts. He also forbade a lot of other acts, such as murder and theft. \n \n This is the time someone points out that the Book of Leviticus also forbids many other acts, such as mixing wool and flax clothing together; if those acts are forbidden, why am I wearing a cotton shirt and woolen socks? Let's get real. Leviticus, as a whole, is instructions for the priesthood of Israel, and as such deals with concrete acts that reflect a mental attitude towards God. What you think about God affects the big things you do and the little things you do. The little things you do, in turn, should help remind you about the big issues, such as God's good intentions for you. One of the things Jesus scolded the Pharisees about was that they mistook obeying the little acts of obedience to God with obeying God's intentions.\n \n So, God has forbidden homosexual acts in a broad context of forbidden acts such as murder and theft.\n \n What, then, do we do when faced with a preference for the same sex?\n \n God understands this. He understands a person's need for love and acceptance. He wants to accept all men and women, and have His love reflected in our lives. Not all love is Eros, though. There are other loves, such as the love we express for our family, our fellow-believers, our community as a whole. Eros is actually a small part of this greater love He calls us to express. God may call people to a state of singleness, but that does not mean He doesn't want the single person to live in a state of loneliness. There are other loves that fulfill your real needs.\n \n The greatest need is a Savior, which is why Jesus died on the Cross, fully God and fully man, knowing what He was doing. He loves gay men and women so much He died with nails in His hands and feet for them. All He wants is your understanding that you can't reach Him because of your sin and to let Him reach you.\n \n When you do, He will give you more than the temporary pleasure of Eros; He will give you peace now and joy eternal. Jesus and God's Holy Spirit say, \"Come to Him!\"",

   "Alright.....wow....some people get a little intense....ha.......Tigerlilly hasn't really read the Bible..or at least doesn't really understand it....oh and where is the part about sticking a tent spike through the skull of someone?.....I'll make another thread about Jesus and see you try to refute the concept that love rules all...the greatest concept ever devised and you will look like an XXX trying to argue it. Jesus's philosophy and teachings can't be refuted. You look today and see that if we followed the basic rules of the Bible like 90% of our problems would be resolved. Now some of you will throw in like oh what about diseases and so forth....well if you followed a decent diet and proper living....like not smoking and drinking yourself into a coma then we would also see a decline in all the diseases out there. \n \n You're passionate, and hostile responses just proves the scriptures to have even more validity. I'll list the stuff when I get home later on tonight. I don't have pity for you...but for the situation that has caused you to come to hate God and the morals and values the Bible teaches. I don't claim to live the perfect life, but simply strive to that perfection. I don't wish to force my views upon anyone, simply just to help people understand where I'm coming from for the fact that Christianity has been distorted when you have pastors who skim from the top for a little extra, when hypocrites in the church tell you to do one thing and do another, when priests who are most trusted steal the innocence of young children away...these are all faults of the church.\n \n However if you ever studied the Bible, it was simply an acculmination of events that led up to Jesus, around Jesus, and after Jesus. The fact that some of you scoff and mock a man who died one of the most brutal deaths known to man is beyond me. The callousness and wickedness of each passing year seems only to increase, or my ignorance of the harsh world deminishes.\n \n As to the pity party for me I'm very content and happy in my life. I don't deserver all the blessings I have and I appreciate all the opportunities. You mistake my sorrow for the world as sorrow for my self. \n \n And where the response about socialism came from was a little odd....but I'll debate you about communism/socialism if you want. Although I think we should move to a different board for that. \n \n Anyways back to work.....",

I found some life on the other side.\n \n Next chapter:\n This is more a comment on the character of Jesus.\n \n 18When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. 19Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" \n 20Jesus replied, \"Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\" \n \n 21Another disciple said to him, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\" \n \n 22But Jesus told him, \"Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.\" \n \n \n What a callous dick Jesus is! He totally insulted a man who's father just died!\n \n \n \n Matt 5:\n 13\"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. \n 14\"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. 15Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. \n \n I am NOT salt and I am not light. Jesus is WRONG!\n \n 22\"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. 23But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! \n \n My eye is NO lamp! \n \n This passage:\n 25\"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? 26Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life[b]?\n \n DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS this:\n \n 17 To Adam he said, \"Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' \"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. \n \n UNLESS this only applies to Adam (then does original sin only apply to Adam too?)",

   "Biblical Morality 101\n \n Lesson 1-A.\n \n Family Values:The wonders of Biblical fatherhood:\n \n \n Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, \"Abraham!\" \"Here I am,\" he replied. Then God said, \"Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.\"\n ...\n Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, \"Father?\" \"Yes, my son?\" Abraham replied. \"The fire and wood are here,\" Isaac said, \"but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\"\n \n Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" And the two of them went on together. When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.\n ...\n The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time and said, \"I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.\"\n\n \n Basically, here God is showing how much love a father should have for his son. He loves his son SOOOO much that he offers to slit his throat and offer him up as a sacrifice. God is actually telling a father of an only child to kill that child just beause God say so. Now, mind you, this directly contradicts the \"thou shalt not kill\" rule on teh 10 commandments, but remember..God's above the law and you may do anything you wish if he command's it. \n \n Apparently it's a family virture to betrey yoru children when God asks you to. \n \n And remember! God is Jesus, Jesus is God. SO if God tells you do to do this, then Jesus told you to do this. THey are one and the same. So if Jesus told you to slaughter your brother, sister, or cousin for a sacrifice to make him happy, would you? Huh? wouldawoulda ya?\n \n If not, you ain't Biblical Godly. If you do, chances are--you're a bible humper.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Family values mark II--the wonder's of womanhood and the female in the family\n \n \n Genesis 19:8 (NIV): Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\n\n \n Father gets to pimp his daughters to anyone he feels like, whether they want to be pimped out or not. Daughters are treated as nothing more than two-bit sluts out for sex-rent. God approved, therefore Jesus also approved. The men may do with the women whatever they like. God's a man, so he probably has some male dominance complex against females that he manifests in his \"morality.\"\n \n THe father in the Bible (as one learns), sees that the males are more important that the safety of his OWN daughters by virture of the fact that no one can do anything to the males, but the woman can be tossed about like yesterday's whore.\n \n \n \n Deuteronomy 21:18-21 (NIV): If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, \"This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.\" Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death.\n\n \n Bible humpers LOVE to quote from Deuteronomy, so let's take a gander and this moral work. Apparently, if your children misbehave or are \"rebellious\" (Hahah that word's almost as amphibolous as the term Terrorist in the Patriot Act), then you get to take them before the law and stone them to death. Parents, as condoned in the Bible, may just have their children executed for being disobedient.\n \n On a funny note, the moral law \"do not kill\" is under \"respect they eldres.\" We can clearly see life isn't as important as respect. How sacred can christian life be?\n \n \n From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. \"Go on up, you baldhead!\" they said. \"Go on up, you baldhead!\" He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.\n\n \n More godly discipline! Make fun of someone and God will slaughter 40 children with a big old nasty bear. If god kills children for making fun of a monk, does God pluck the eyes of Kittens ever time you masturbate? \n \n Remember, Jesus loves children, and Jesus is God, and God kills children for making a joke..... =D I'm lovin' it.\n \n \n Matthew 12:46-49 (NIV): While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.\" He replied to him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" Pointing to his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers.\"\n\n \n Apparently, Jesus (GOd) has no concept of real family, for he thinks that is totally unrelated Disciples (brain trust) is more important than the mother who gave birth to his hippie XXX.\n \n The bible must be big on family loyalty.\n \n \n Numbers 31:14-18 (NIV): Moses was angry with the officers of the army--the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds--who returned from the battle. \"Have you allowed all the women to live?\" he asked them. \"They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a plague struck the LORD's people. Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.\"\n\n \n God Condones rape, pillage, and murder of innocent children and women. How moral and how \"wholesome\" the bible is. I think i see less death in the TExas Chainsaw Massacre.\n \n \n Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death. Then Judah said to Onan, \"Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother.\" But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother. What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also.\n\n \n MOre Wholesome death and even some forced rape condoned by God.\n \n \n Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah--from the LORD out of the heavens. Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities--and also the vegetation in the land. But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.\n\n \n More deaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaath to the evil ones. Who are they? Myriad women and children.\n \n \n When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. Then the LORD said, \"My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.\" The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.\n \n The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. So the LORD said, \"I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth--men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air--for I am grieved that I have made them.\"\n\n \n God kills the world. Nuff said.\n \n \n Did Jesus Fix It?\n \n The Old Testament was obviously not concerned with human rights or the good of mankind, so it has no relation to modern (humanist) morality. Its ethical framework is much different than anything we would consider \"morality\" today; instead of rights, it speaks of rules (which God can override at his whim). Instead of the good of mankind, it speaks of the glorification of God (even if that glorification comes at great cost to mankind, as demonstrated in the Great Flood).\n \n It has often been said that we shouldn't criticize these repugnant aspects of the Old Testament because all of that was, as the fundamentalists say, \"before Christ\". However, in addition to the specific problems outlined with the New Testament in the previous pages, there are 3 serious problems with this argument:\n \n 1.\n \n How many Christians do you know who don't quote the Ten Commandments? The Ten Commandments are the source of Judeo-Christian hatred of other religions, and if Christians continue to quote the Ten Commandments, they must also answer for their inherent bigotry.\n 2.\n \n How many Christians do you know who are willing to throw the Old Testament out the window? I've spent time in churches, and I know how often the Old Testament is quoted in sermons. And it isn't just the preachers; the passage in Leviticus which condemns homosexuality is still widely quoted, even though Leviticus also condemns the eating of pork or shellfish, and it explicitly instructs that any woman found not to be a virgin on her wedding night must be stoned to death.\n 3.\n \n Exactly which portions of the Old Testament were made obsolete by Jesus? He never explained in enough detail to keep people from arbitrarily choosing which sections they wish to obey. He said that you should \"love thy neighbour\" and \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", but even the most cursory examination of Crusade and Inquisition history will show that it has historically been very easy for Christians to classify acts of hatred against other religions as a twisted form of \"love\", ie- it's \"for their own good\".\n \n It's true that Jesus did seem to have a far more humane approach than the Old Testament God, but his instructive method of parables instead of legalism was deliberately vague, which unfortunately gave believers wide latitude to invent their own interpretations and then publicize them in Jesus' name (in fact, Paul wasted no time in doing just that). An even larger problem is that three of Christianity's central tenets can be very easily abused by believers who want to commit atrocities, as we saw in the Dark Ages:\n \n 1.\n \n \"The greatest duty of a Christian is to Spread the Word\". In the Dark Ages, this was the motivation for atrocities: everyone must convert. Those who convert willingly are praised, those who refuse to convert must be tortured into conversion for their own good. This was precisely the rationalization used when the Roman Catholic church officially authorized torture in the 13th century. Contrary to popular belief, this is not typical of all religions. All religions have their various beliefs, but few of them include the drive to recruit others as part of those beliefs.\n 2.\n \n \"Non-Christians deserve, and will suffer horrible pain for eternity\". This is carried over from Judaism, it is the justification for atrocities, and it's basically an ethical appeal to authority: if the kinder, gentler New Testament God still sees fit to condemn unbelievers to an eternity of horrible torture, then how can we, as mere humans, condemn good Christians for using relatively small amounts of torture in a \"good cause\"? Again, the Roman Catholics publicly used this justification for the atrocities of the Crusades and Inquisitions. The notion of Hell has been called the \"poison pill\" by some Christians in the past, because the existence of Hell means that God is still just as vengeful and capricious as he was in the Old Testament, and if this is the God that we are expected to worship, then it's easy to see how Christians were able to convince themselves that it was acceptable to torture others during the Middle Ages: if they believe that Godly behaviour is moral behaviour, then the existence of Hell is tantamount to moral permission for torture!\n 3.\n \n \"We are all born sinners. God does not care about the magnitude of Earthly sin; all sin is equal in His eyes. God also does not care about Earthly nobility or wisdom; there is nothing you can do on this Earth to atone for your sin. Therefore, salvation can only come through allegiance to Christ\". This is the absolution for atrocities. By devaluing and indeed, almost nullifying the importance of joy or suffering in this world, this idea makes it all too easy for believers to commit atrocities, secure in the knowledge that if they are loyal to Christ, they will go to Heaven anyway. After all, if their atrocities help \"save\" more people from Hell, then they are doing God's work, right? And besides, the suffering and pleasures of \"the flesh\" have no real significance in the eyes of God anyway. The deliberate separation of Earthly actions from spiritual salvation is almost unique to Christianity, and by eliminating any notion of what some call \"karma\" and devaluing the importance of worldly actions, it is perhaps the most dangerous religious principle ever introduced. It so easily lends itself to crusades and inquisitions that virtually constant moral vigilance is required in order to prevent abuse.\n \n Must these beliefs lead to atrocities? Not necessarily, but if you examine the history of Christianity in its entirety, you will find that tolerance and pacifism are the exception rather than the norm. It has only been in the last few centuries that we have seen a divergence of sorts, between moral Christians and fundamentalists. The very notion of a Christian who is accepting of other beliefs would have been unthinkable 400 years ago, so the \"kinder, gentler\" Christianity that many modern Christians call their own is really a very recent development in the overall scope of Christian history, and it is one which many fundamentalists denounce as a dilution of \"traditional\" values.\n \n One would think there would be a clash of values between Christian moderates and the fundamentalist lunatics whose overt goal is to take control of the government, remove religious freedom, and convert the nation into a Christian theocracy, but the fundamentalists have numerous advantages in terms of visibility. Their collective fervour means that they can easily raise substantial funds for their publicity campaigns (and make no mistake: creationism is a publicity campaign rather than a scientific research project). Their shrill, hateful rhetoric is florid and makes for controversial television, so the media eagerly flocks to their press conferences. Their political activism can take the form of boycotts, letter-writing campaigns, protests, well-funded local government candidates, etc., and it means that their attitudes spill over into the world of politics and government, which further encourages media attention. And finally, they aggressively punish Christians who dare to speak out against them. For example, John McCain (a devout Christian) made headlines during his presidential bid by blasting the right wing fundamentalist hatemongers, and he was immediately labelled \"anti-Christian!\" (and as we all know, he eventually lost the Republican candidacy to a man who speaks English as if it's his third language, but who has pledged to tear down the wall between church and state). The basic nature of fundamentalism is reactionary; it is driven by fear of progress and it blames societal problems on modern thinking, so it seeks to erase modern thinking in favour of \"old fashioned\" or \"traditional\" values (using the implicit assumption that if something has been around for a long time, it must be superior).\n \n From the standpoint of religious doctrine, Christian fundamentalism is really no different than other forms of fundamentalism, such as orthodox judaism or Islamic fundamentalism. The fundamentalists seek to return to the old ways, under the guise of restoring true faith in their religion. In Islamic fundamentalist nations, we've seen that this results in countless violations of human rights, and that is invariably the result whenever church and state join, hence the American founding fathers' insistence that a \"wall of separation\" should be erected in order to prevent this happening in America. If Christian fundamentalists had their way and restored Biblical inerrancy as a legal principle, it would undoubtedly have the same result as the restoration of religious fundamentalism in places like Afghanistan.\n ---- M.

It doesn't have to be accurate, verifiable, factual or consistent.\n \n But if you want to use it as a blue-print for society, and as a historical document, then I'm going to hold your feet to the coals.\n \n So, lets hear the independant evidence supporting all aspects of the bible.

But important stuff like politics, economics, morality, engineering, science, mathematics, and so on seems to work much better when we minimize the number of things we take for granted.
