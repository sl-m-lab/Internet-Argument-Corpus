   "I have been looking at posts made by religious people here where they submit evidence two support their arguments and found they fall into only two simple categories:\n \n 1 - I have a funny feeling that god exits and that means god exists.\n \n 2 &#8211; The bible says god exists and that means god exists.\n \n I challenge anyone to disprove what I am saying here not because I think I am right but because I am not perfect and would like to know if I missed something.\n \n I don't need to tell anyone capable of rational thought that these pieces of &#8220;evidence&#8221; are woefully inadequate.\n \n The thing I find most amazing is the huge volume of written words that they need to produce to say these two simple things.",
