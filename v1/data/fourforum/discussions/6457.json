   "I thought this would be fun. If you had at Time Machine and the ability to go to any date at all that you wanted to go and anythig you did would not effedct the timeline, what day, month, and/or year would you go and why?\n \n \n For me, some of my choices are...\n October 31, 1939 - I always wondered what it would be like to hear the original radio broadcast of War Of The Worlds\n 1976 - I would like to pick up one of the first copies of Boston's Boston.\n October 1985, early part - I was too young to actually remember seeing the Kansas City Royals win the world series.\n Mid to late October 2001 in Arizona - I'd like to see the Yankees loose their first World Series in a long time like they did that year.\n October last year in St. Louis, just so I could see the Boston Red Sox win the world series in person. (Have I mentioned that I like Baseball.) That's just a few.\n \n \n \n So, do I have any takers?",
