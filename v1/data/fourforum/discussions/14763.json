   "This thread was brought about by a comment in another thread by our resident Religious Guru EZ.. I didn't want to hi-jack Sandy's thread to post this so I thought what the heck, I can easily bust ole EZ in another thread...\n \n \nWhen all four Gospels do agree on something (i.e. the resurrection) you don't believe it anyway. So quit your phony, jack-legged posturing like you need some agreement from another Gospel.\n\n \n You Often hear Christians speak of how all four of the Gospels agree and are in perfect harmony with one another. I would say that the Gospels agree as to the basic account of the man named Jesus and his life. Some scholars believe that Matthew was written first, then the others borrowed from it to form their own version. It's clear that they are not in perfect harmony, they only agree on the fairy tale life and Resurrection... but the actual details about the story are far from being in agreement. here's some proof.. look them up if you don't believe it....\n \n \n Jesus' First Resurrection Appearance:\n \n The resurrection of someone dead is an important event, but the gospels don't seem to know where and when Jesus first appeared.\n \n Mark 16:14-15 - Jesus appears to Mary Magdalena but it's not clear where (in older endings of Mark, he didn't appear at all)\n Matthew 28:8-9 - Jesus first appears near his tomb\n Luke 24:13-15 - Jesus first appears near Emmaus, several miles from Jerusalem\n John 20:13-14 - Jesus first appears at his tomb\n \n \n Who Sees Jesus First?:\n Mark - Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalena then later to \"the eleven\"\n Matthew - Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalena, then to the other Mary, and finally to \"the eleven\"\n Luke - Jesus appears first to \"two,\" then to Simon, then to \"the eleven\"\n John - Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalena, then the disciples without Thomas, then the disciples with Thomas \n \n Women's Reactions to the Empty Tomb:\n \n The gospels agree that the empty tomb was found by women (though not on which women), but what did the women do?\n \n Mark 16:8 - The women were amazed and afraid, so they kept quiet\n Matthew 28:6-8 - The women ran away \"with great joy\"\n Luke 24:9-12 - The women left the tomb and told the disciples\n John 20:1-2 - Mary told the disciples that the body had been stolen \n \n Jesus' Behavior After His Resurrection:\n \n If someone rises from the dead, his actions should be significant, but the gospels don't agree on how Jesus first behaved\n \n Mark 16:14-15 - Jesus commissions \"the eleven\" to preach the gospel\n Matthew 28:9 - Jesus lets Mary Magdalene and another Mary hold his feet\n John 20:17 - Jesus forbids Mary to touch him because he hasn't ascended to heaven yet, but a week later he lets Thomas touch him anyway \n \n Doubting Jesus' Resurrection:\n \n If Jesus rose from the dead, how did his disciples take the news?\n \n Mark 16:11, Luke 24:11 - Everyone doubts and/or is scared at first, but eventually they go along with it\n Matthew 28:16 - Some doubt, but most believe\n John 20:24-28 - Everyone believes but Thomas, whose doubts are eliminated when he gets physical proof \n \n Jesus Ascends to Heaven:\n \n It wasn't enough that Jesus rise from the dead; he also had to ascend to heaven. But where, when, and how did this happen?\n \n Mark 16:14-19 - Jesus ascends while he and his disciples are seated at a table in or near Jerusalem\n Matthew 28:16-20 - Jesus' ascension isn't mentioned at all, but Matthew ends at a mountain in Galilee\n Luke 24:50-51 - Jesus ascends outisde, after dinner, and at Bethany and on the same day as the resurrection\n John - Nothing about Jesus' ascension is mentioned\n Acts 1:9-12 - Jesus ascends at least 40 days after his resurrection, at Mt. Olivet \n \n Who Carries Jesus' Cross?:\n \n In the Passion narratives, did Jesus carry his own cross or not?\n \n Mark 15:21, Matthew 27:32, Luke 23:26 - Jesus gets help from Simon of Cyrene\n John 19:17 - Jesus carries his own cross the whole way\n \n Inscription on Jesus' Cross:\n When crucified, Jesus' cross had an inscription - but what did it say?\n \n Mark 15:26 - The inscription: \"The King of the Jews.\"\n Matthew 27:37 - The inscription: \"This is Jesus the King of the Jews.\"\n Luke 23:38 - The inscription: \"This is the King of the Jews.\"\n John 19:19 - The inscription: \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\"\n \n Jesus and the Thieves:\n \n Some gospels say Jesus was crucified with two thieves, though the Romans never crucified thieves.\n \n Mark - The two thieves are mentioned, but there is no conversation\n Matthew 27:44 - The two thieves taunt Jesus\n Luke 23:39-42 - One thief taunts Jesus and is criticized by the other. Jesus promises the 2nd thief that they would be in Paradise that day, though John and Acts say he did not ascend to heaven until 40 days after his resurrection\n John - The two men aren't described as thieves\n \n Does Jesus Drink Wine or Vinegar?:\n \n Jesus is given something to drink while he is on the cross, but what?\n \n Mark 15:23 - Jesus is given wine mixed with myrrh, but he doesn't drink\n Matthew 27:48, Luke 23:36 - Jesus is given vinegar, but he doesn't drink\n John 19:29-30 - Jesus is given vinegar and he drinks\n \n Jesus and the Centurion:\n \n Romans supposedly witnessed Jesus' crucifixion, but what did they think?\n \n Mark 15:39 - A centurion is cited as saying: \"Truly this man was the son of God!\"\n Matthew 27:54 - A centurion is cited as saying: \"Truly this was the son of God.\"\n Luke 23:47 - A centurion is cited as saying: \"Truly this man was innocent.\"\n John - No centurions say anything\n \n Women Watch the Crucifixion:\n \n The gospels describe several woman as having followed Jesus around, but what did they do when Jesus was crucified?\n \n Mark 15:40, Matthew 27:55, Luke 23:49 - Several women watch Jesus from afar\n John 19:25-26 - Several woman are close enough that Jesus could talk to his mother, contrary to Roman practices\n \n When Was Jesus Crucified?:\n \n The crucifixion of Jesus is the central event of the Passion narrative, but the narratives don't agree on when the crucifixion occurred.\n \n Mark 15:25 - Jesus was crucified on the \"third hour.\"\n John 19:14-15 - Jesus was crucified on the \"sixth hour.\"\n Matthew, Luke - It's not stated when the crucifixion starts, but the \"sixth hour\" occurs during the crucifixion\n \n Jesus' Last Words:\n \n Jesus' last words before dying are important, but no one seems to have written then down.\n \n Mark 15:34-37, Matthew 27:46-50 - Jesus says: \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" (but they use different Greek words for \"God\" - Matthew uses \"Eli\" and Mark uses \"Eloi\")\n Luke 23:46 - Jesus says: \"Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit.\"\n John 19:30 - Jesus says: \"It is finished.\"\n \n Earthquake After the Resurrection:\n \n Was there an earthquake when Jesus died?\n \n Matthew 27:51-53 - At the moment Jesus dies, a massive earth quake strikes and opens tombs where dead people rise again\n Mark, Luke, John - No earthquake is mentioned. No earthquake and no massive influx of formerly dead people is mentioned in any historical records, which is strange given how monumental such an event would be. \n \n Jesus is Taken to the Authorities:\n \n Of course the soldiers who arrest Jesus take him to the authorities, but which authorities?\n \n Mark 14:53, Matthew 26:57, Luke 22:54 - Jesus is taken to Caiphas, the high priest, after he is arrested\n John 18:13-24 - Jesus is taken first to Caiphas' son-in-law Annas, then to Caiphas (after an unknown time)\n \n Jesus has his First Hearing:\n \n Jesus has a hearing on the charges, but when? With whom?\n \n Mark 14:53-72, 15:1, Matthew 26:18-20, 57-68, 27:1-2 - Jesus is charged on Passover eve and taken to Pilate in the morning\n Luke 22:13-15, 54-66 - Jesus' first hearing occurs on Passover morning\n John 18:28, 19:14 - Jesus' first hearing occurs on the day before Passover\n \n Jesus has his First Trial:\n \n Jesus' trial is a central event of the Passion, but before whom was the trial held?\n \n Mark 14:55-64, Matthew 26:59-66 - Jesus is tried by the whole Sanhedrin\n Luke 22:66-71 - The Sanhedrin hold an inquiry about Jesus, but no trial\n John 18:13-24 - The Sanhedrin don't even hold an official inquiry; Jesus just appears before Annas and Caiphas\n \n Jesus is Interrogated by the High Priest:\n \n Jesus is supposed to be interrogated as his trial, but the nature of the interrogation varies.\n \n Mark 14:61 - Jesus is asked if he is the Son of the Blessed and answers \"I am.\"\n Matthew 26:63, Luke 22:70 - Jesus is asked if he is the Son of God and answers \"You have said so.\"\n John - Jesus is not interrogated by the High Priest\n \n Jesus is Interrogated by Herod:\n \n As the man in charge of Jewish affairs, what role did Herod play in Jesus' arrest and trial?\n \n Luke 23:7-11 - Pilate sent Jesus to Herod who questions Jesus then sends him back\n Matthew, Mark, John - No mention is made of Herod at all\n \n Jesus is Interrogated by Pilate:\n \n If Jesus was interrogated by Herod, what happened? The gospels disagree.\n \n Mark 15:2, Matthew 27:11, Luke 23:3 - Pilate asks if he is King of the Jews and Jesus says \"You have said so.\" He doesn't answer any of the charges\n John 18:33-34 - Pilate asks the same thing, but Jesus answers \"Do you say this of your own accord?\" and answers all the charges\n \n \n The scene where Barabbas is released instead of Jesus is famous, but inconsistently described.\n \n Mark 15:11 - The chief priests get the people to demand the release of Barabbas; his crimes are insurrection and murder\n Matthew 27:20 - Priests and elders get people to demand the release of Barabbas; his crimes are unknown\n Luke 23:18-23 - The people demand Barabbas' release; his crimes are insurrection and murder\n John 18:40 - The people demand Barabbas' release; he is described as a robber\n \n Jesus is Given a Robe:\n \n Jesus is often depicted as wearing a robe before being crucified, but what sort of robe and why?\n \n Mark 15:17, John 19:2 - Jesus is made to wear a purple robe by Roman soldiers as a sign of royalty (for which he is being mocked)\n Matthew 27:28 - Jesus is made to wear a scarlet robe by Roman soldiers as a symbol of infamy\n Luke 23:11 - Jesus is given a robe by Herod and his soldiers, not by the Roman soldiers \n \n Wouldn't exactly call that Harmonious --- would you?\n \n Your Welcome to attempt a rebuttal EZ....",

Even after detailing Luke vs. Matthew to him and showing that they disagree on the fact of where jesus first met with the 11 apostles after his resurrection, he refused to admit that they are contradictory in nature. \n \n He likes to claim that the 4 gospels provide independent confirmation of the resurrection, but when obvious contradictions are exposed, he states that they are complimentary to each other. A bunch of double talk BS if you ask me. \n \n I caught him completely flat-footed with this argument, and it really was quite sad to see him try to worm his way out.

Clown.\n\n \n Sorry, you debate just like a woman atheist I knew online at one time. I can't help envisioning you as one. Also, like all of the resident atheists you continue to reject that which you haven't experienced personally, and you don't experience salvation personally because you prefer the darkness to the light of Gods truth which He offers to all of us in equal measure. \n \n You atheists constantly insist that we are somehow brainwashed via religious indoctrination, but I'm here to tell you that I didn't hunger for Gods word until after I accepted Jesus and received His Holy Spirit within me. \n \n You see, you must justify your rejection of Gods word by assuming that we believers are victims of manipulation and coercion when it is you who has been manipulated to believe the big lie regarding our personal God who became flesh and died to redeem us from eternal separation from Him. \n \n You will be a DOA on the spiritual battle field of life which you will ultimately learn one day, was the most important lesson to learn in this life. Here's how the bible puts it, not that you have the spiritual curiosity to even read it. But I promise you that the time will come in your futile existence when you will thirst and hunger for Gods word but it will not be available to you in that place you will reside.\n 2Cr 4:1 Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,\n 2Cr 4:2 but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.\n 2Cr 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled [fn] to those who are perishing,\n 2Cr 4:4 in whose case the god of this [fn] world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving [fn] so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\n 2Cr 4:5 For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants [fn] for Jesus' sake.\n 2Cr 4:6 For God, who said, \"Light shall shine out of darkness,\" is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n 2Cr 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;\n 2Cr 4:8 we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;\n 2Cr 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;\n 2Cr 4:10 always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.\n 2Cr 4:11 For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.\n 2Cr 4:12 So death works in us, but life in you.\n 2Cr 4:13 But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, \"I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,\" we also believe, therefore we also speak,\n 2Cr 4:14 knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you.\n 2Cr 4:15 For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is [fn]spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God.\n 2Cr 4:16 Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.\n 2Cr 4:17 For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,\n 2Cr 4:18 while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.",

You are unmoving in your position of having ultimate truths that are easily understood, but only under specific circumstances otherwise it is impossible to understand.

The question then becomes what is, what isn't and what is, but is misunderstood because of what isn't. As long as you continue to insist that it all is you will never find the answer to what isn't and what is misunderstood, which leaves you with an incomplete and incorrect foundation of belief.\n \n Questioning the Bible should be encouraged, eventually only the truth contained in it will remain. Sure it will be a lot smaller, but the end result will be much better.\n \n \nYou atheists constantly insist that we are somehow brainwashed via religious indoctrination, but I'm here to tell you that I didn't hunger for Gods word until after I accepted Jesus and received His Holy Spirit within me. \n\n \n That could be 100% true, but that does not keep you from having beliefs not inspired by God. If the Holy Spirit reveals the truth to true believers there would not be so many different denominations. Many of which share core values and are indistinguishable one from another except for a few differences in practice or thought. They believe in God, Jesus and salvation have given their lives to Jesus but something happens after that where they are misled. Why?\n \n \nYou see, you must justify your rejection of Gods word by assuming that we believers are victims of manipulation and coercion when it is you who has been manipulated to believe the big lie regarding our personal God who became flesh and died to redeem us from eternal separation from Him. \n\n \n No the reason is because to some extent you have. To suggest man has not abused the power he finds in religion is ludacris. Just as thinking you understand God is. \n \n \nYou will be a DOA on the spiritual battle field of life which you will ultimately learn one day, was the most important lesson to learn in this life. Here's how the bible puts it, not that you have the spiritual curiosity to even read it. But I promise you that the time will come in your futile existence when you will thirst and hunger for Gods word but it will not be available to you in that place you will reside.\n\n \n The place where God is not, where those he cares for are sent for not caring for him. A place where there is no forgiveness, no reconciliation. Will God just forget those of his children that were led astray? Will he think of them over the centuries knowing they remain in torment? Will he ever decide no transgression deserves such a punishment or continue that certain choices warrant such a permanent response?\n \n \n \n2Cr 4:1 Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,\n 2Cr 4:2 but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.\n 2Cr 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled [fn] to those who are perishing,\n 2Cr 4:4 in whose case the god of this [fn] world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving [fn] so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\n 2Cr 4:5 For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants [fn] for Jesus' sake.\n 2Cr 4:6 For God, who said, \"Light shall shine out of darkness,\" is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n 2Cr 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;\n 2Cr 4:8 we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;\n 2Cr 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;\n 2Cr 4:10 always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.\n 2Cr 4:11 For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.\n 2Cr 4:12 So death works in us, but life in you.\n 2Cr 4:13 But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, \"I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,\" we also believe, therefore we also speak,\n 2Cr 4:14 knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you.\n 2Cr 4:15 For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is [fn]spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God.\n 2Cr 4:16 Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.\n 2Cr 4:17 For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,\n 2Cr 4:18 while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\n\n [/QUOTE]\n \n \n It is a waste of time to point out the many problems with the above. Just as you claim others cannot see what is there they say the same about you. Try looking at this like before you found God and then as you see it now. Are you able to see the perspective of what is written when you are able to see through unknowing eyes?",

   "You describe God in paradoxes. You insist on conditions and requirements, while maintaining there are none. \n\n \n The quote of mine you posted and responded to made no conditions or requirements at all, but let me explain how anal you are being about something God made so simple and basic a child can comprehend it easily. Here's how it works, \n \n For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that whosoever believes in Him should NOT PERISH, but have everlasting life. For it is by grace that we are saved through faith, and not by works so that no man may boast. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one. And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; He who does not have the Son of God does not have life.\n \n And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.\n \n Simply put, the gospel requires only that we believe in what Jesus did on the Cross as the unblemished lamb of God. By this I mean that He is a worthy sacrifice for the sins which separate us from a perfectly holy God who cannot be in the presence of sin. All we must do is accept the free gift because there is nothing we can do to earn our way into heaven or be good enough to get there on our own merit.\n \n \n The Bible contains some truth, I have no doubt about that. The question then becomes what is, what isn't and what is, but is misunderstood because of what isn't. As long as you continue to insist that it all is you will never find the answer to what isn't and what is misunderstood, which leaves you with an incomplete and incorrect foundation of belief.\n \n Questioning the Bible should be encouraged, eventually only the truth contained in it will remain. Sure it will be a lot smaller, but the end result will be much better.\n\n \n Let us say for the sake of argument that the bible has been egregiously mistranslated in ways that corrupt and pervert the original intent as intended by God who is the author, I have given you the basic gospel message of salvation above which is \"saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ as the perfect lamb of God\". Everything else is doctrine and fluff that has no bearing on ones salvation or personal relationship with God through His Holy Spirit who indwells us and guides us daily in our lives. \n \n You are losing the forest through the trees by worrying about issues that have no bearing on the basic question of whether the gospel of salvation as outlined is valid or not. \n \n \nThat could be 100% true, but that does not keep you from having beliefs not inspired by God. If the Holy Spirit reveals the truth to true believers there would not be so many different denominations. Many of which share core values and are indistinguishable one from another except for a few differences in practice or thought. They believe in God, Jesus and salvation have given their lives to Jesus but something happens after that where they are misled. Why?\n\n \n You seem to be very comfortable looking at flawed and sinful men and how they interpret the bible to suit their personal ideals, and then from that conclusion, jump right to blaming God as if it's His fault men tend to congregate with like minded people. In other words, men can corrupt or misinterpret Gods word all day long but that doesn't mean that Gods word is wrong in any way. God and His word remains perfect and holy no matter how corrupted it is by fallen men who are flawed.\n \n \n \nNo the reason is because to some extent you have. To suggest man has not abused the power he finds in religion is ludacris. Just as thinking you understand God is. \n\n \n Show where I have ever defended MEN as never corrupting Gods word or abusing the power that comes with leading churches. I would love to see those quotes. I have debated strongly against the POPES, the Catholic church, christian cults like the JWs, Mormons, the Moonies and even the Christian Scientists. But again, just because men start cults, that does nothing to diminish the truth of Gods message.\n \n My first church as a believer was the Trinity Baptist Church. That denomination doesn't accept that the gifts of the spirit that were practiced by the Apostles in the first church exist for believers today. Even though I fully believe in and have even experienced first hand spiritual gifts that baptists insist can't exist today, I know God led me to that church at that time in my spiritual walk. I would never worship there today, but that doesn't mean that denomination doesn't serve a particular purpose and place in Gods plan for His children today. \n \n I mean, you come off on one hand as someone who is tolerant and totally into freedom of thought and all that liberal stuff. Yet when it comes to God, the most powerful being in time and space you seem awfully judgmental. Who are you to hold the author of life to a standard you yourself are incapable of attaining? And since when is the author of life expected to meet your low standards on any issue? \n \n \nThe place where God is not, where those he cares for are sent for not caring for him. A place where there is no forgiveness, no reconciliation. Will God just forget those of his children that were led astray? Will he think of them over the centuries knowing they remain in torment? Will he ever decide no transgression deserves such a punishment or continue that certain choices warrant such a permanent response?\n\n \n You just don't get it do you? God Himself became flesh and lived among us as a righteous and holy Man as an example that living a sinless life is possible, then as a sinless Man He gave up His life as an acceptable sacrifice so that we can finally be redeemed once and for all time through His shed blood. Before Messiah, Jews had to sacrifice animals as temporary propitiation for sins. But we need do nothing more than accept what he did for us to be saved even though we all come to the table as damaged goods, spiritually speaking. \n \n You want to continue to reject God and insult Him in this lifetime which He gave you for fellowship with Him, then you blame Him for giving you exactly what you continually insist you want which is anything but a relationship with Him. You wont even acknowledge He exists but you expect Him to save you after you die and can no longer deny that He exists?\n \n \nIt is a waste of time to point out the many problems with the above. Just as you claim others cannot see what is there they say the same about you. Try looking at this like before you found God and then as you see it now. Are you able to see the perspective of what is written when you are able to see through unknowing eyes?\n\n \n Why would I want to go backwards to a time when I was spiritually dead, deaf and blind? Try putting on blackout blinders and go just one day without sight. That is a poor example for what it would be like to ignore what I know to be absolute truth as a believer and revert back to being spiritually blind and dead as you are now. The very suggestion is ludicrous and reveals once again how shallow your insights are. You need to stop judging God and humble yourself before Him. If you want mercy then accept it as offered by Him through Jesus who died for your sins on Calvary's Cross. If you reject that grace and mercy then don't blame God for your choice to reject His free gift. I leave you with this promise, do with it what you will.\n \n \"He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.\" (John 3:36)",

   "(To Zorba)This is you JUDGING me.. something your own BIBLE says you should not do.\n\n \n Your theology stinks.\n \n \"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge:  \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to warn the wicked to turn from their sins:\n \n \"When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. \"Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself. (Ezekiel 3:18-19)\n \n \"When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. \"But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life. (Ezekiel 33:8-9)\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Jesus rebukes the Christ-deniers:\n \n Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!\" - John 8:42-44\n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Repent, heathens!",

   "Thank you.\n\n \n And if christianity is such a farce to you, why do you even comment on the religion forum debates at all? Why not just avoid such foolishness if it is just crazy talk to you? You make moronic arguments which don't make any sense to anyone with even an ounce of theological understanding, yet you claim to actually be interested in the truth. If you weren't so pathetic, you would be a standing joke around here.\n \n Here, educate yourself if you have the slightest desire for actual truth: Inerrancy and inspiration of the Bible | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n Inerrancy and inspiration of the Bible\n The Christian Church as a whole claims that the Bible is inspired and inerrant. This means that God is the one who moved through the writers to communicate to us the words which God wanted us to hear. This inspiration, however, is not a dictation, but a movement of God's spirit through the writer, utilizing the personality and style of the writer. Inerrancy means that all that is written in the inspired documents is without error. Now, there is a comment worth mentioning here. Inspiration and inerrancy applies to the original writings, not to the copies. In other words, it is the original writings that are without error. The copies, sadly, have copyist errors in them.\n \n Therefore, when critics of the Bible point out apparent contradictions, what they are doing is either failing to understand the context of the passages they are examining, or they have encountered a scribal copying error. The fact is that there are indeed copyist errors on the biblical documents and they account for many alleged contradictions. Remember, it is the autographs (original writings) that are inspired and inerrant, not the copies. The copies we have now are copies of inspired documents. The copies are not themselves \"inspired;\" that is, they have no guarantee of being 100% textually pure. Does this then mean that we can't trust the Bible? Not at all. The copies are so accurate that all of the biblical documents are 98.5% textually pure. The 1.5% that is in question is mainly nothing more than spelling errors and occasional word omissions like the words \"the,\" \"but,\" etc. This reduces any serious textual issues to a fraction of the 1.5%. Nevertheless, nothing affects doctrinal truths. In fact, nothing in ancient history even comes close to the accuracy of the New Testament documents. If the New Testament is disallowed, then all other documents of ancient history (Plato, Aristotle, Homer, etc.), must also be disallowed because the biblical documents are far superior in their copying accuracy than any other ancient literature in existence. See the chart below for further information on this.\n \n Nevertheless, following is a list of the types of errors that have crept into the Bible:\n \n Dittography - Writing twice what should have been written once.\n A good example would be writing \"latter\" instead of \"later.\" \"Latter\" means nearest the end. \"Later\" means after something else.\n Fission - Improperly dividing one word into two words.\n Example: \"nowhere\" into \"now here.\"\n Fusion - Combining the last letter of one word with the first letter of the next word.\n \"Look it is there in the cabinet... or Look it is therein the cabinet.\"\n Haplography - Writing once what should have been written twice.\n A good example would be \"later\" instead of \"latter.\" \"Later\" means after something else. \"Latter\" means nearest the end.\n Homophony - Writing a word with a different meaning for another word when both words have the exact same pronunciation.\n Meat and meet have the exact same sound but different meanings. Also, there and their and they're are another example.\n Metathesis - An improper exchange in the order of letters.\n Instead of writing \"mast,\" someone writes \"mats,\" or \"cast\" and cats.\"\n Does this mean that the Bible we hold in our hand is not inspired? Not at all. Inspiration comes from God and when He inspired the Bible, it was perfect. Our copies of the original documents are not perfect, but they are very close to being so. The critics often mistakenly assume that even the copies are supposed to be perfect. But when I point out that God never said the copies would be perfect, they then ask how can the Bible be trusted at all?

   "The quote of mine you posted and responded to made no conditions or requirements at all, but let me explain how anal you are being about something God made so simple and basic a child can comprehend it easily. Here's how it works,\n\n \n Yes it did. What was rejected? The light and the truth of Gods word. Accepting the dark and not accepting the truth of God's word earned a trip to the pit.\n \n If it were really that simple, do you honestly think it would cause so many problems?\n \n \n \nFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that whosoever believes in Him should NOT PERISH, but have everlasting life.\n \n \n Except we don't. We die and THEN in theory we will come back in Heaven or go to Hell. So we have eternal life regardless, the question is really where will it be. Just so we are clear God tells man do not bare false witness, Do not murder, He indirectly states do not drink human blood and do not eat human flesh. After that he then sends Jesus who in order to fulfill his task is falsely accused, brutally executed because this is what was necessary for God to forgive man for Adam's transgression and we commemorate this by symbolically drinking the blood of Jesus and eating his flesh. You can spin that however you want, but to do so is complicating it.\n \n \nFor it is by grace that we are saved through faith, and not by works so that no man may boast. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one. And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; He who does not have the Son of God does not have life.\n\n \n So instead of braggarts who did good things we now have braggarts who don't. Now the competitions is who has more faith. Who has God's blessing and who doesn't. If none are worthy then why do you get to go to Heaven? You should go if you earn it, if you deserve it. In our society we look down on people who do this.\n \n \n \nAnd we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.\n\n \n Would it not have been easier to Just make Jesus from the dust like Adam? Instead of getting a young unmarried girl pregnant, having him go thru childhood, teens and young adult and then be killed so he could go back to Heaven until he comes again.\n \n \n \nSimply put, the gospel requires only that we believe in what Jesus did on the Cross as the unblemished lamb of God. By this I mean that He is a worthy sacrifice for the sins which separate us from a perfectly holy God who cannot be in the presence of sin. All we must do is accept the free gift because there is nothing we can do to earn our way into heaven or be good enough to get there on our own merit.\n\n \n God required a human sacrifice in order to forgive us? You realize the God who can not be in the presence of sin is supposed to takes us even though nothing has changed. We still sin, we are still born that way and we always will be. We do not have eternal life and it isn't free. \n \n \nLet us say for the sake of argument that the bible has been egregiously mistranslated in ways that corrupt and pervert the original intent as intended by God who is the author, I have given you the basic gospel message of salvation above which is \"saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ as the perfect lamb of God\". Everything else is doctrine and fluff that has no bearing on ones salvation or personal relationship with God through His Holy Spirit who indwells us and guides us daily in our lives. \n\n \n For the sake of augment lets not address any inconsistencies and by doing so we will accept the one point we are discussing is what you meant to say.\n \n \n \nYou are losing the forest through the trees by worrying about issues that have no bearing on the basic question of whether the gospel of salvation as outlined is valid or not. \n \n\n \n But that is the problem, you can't see the trees only the forest. It's always the other person who is led astray, who doesn't understand.\n \n \n \n \nYou seem to be very comfortable looking at flawed and sinful men and how they interpret the bible to suit their personal ideals, and then from that conclusion, jump right to blaming God as if it's His fault men tend to congregate with like minded people. In other words, men can corrupt or misinterpret Gods word all day long but that doesn't mean that Gods word is wrong in any way. God and His word remains perfect and holy no matter how corrupted it is by fallen men who are flawed.\n\n \n I don't mean televangelists or religious crooks. The denominations I listed have millions of members who truly think they get it, bit they don't. The Spirit failed them. It was supposed to open them up to spiritual truth\n \n \n Show where I have ever defended MEN as never corrupting Gods word or abusing the power that comes with leading churches. I would love to see those quotes. \n \n \n \nI have debated strongly against the POPES, the Catholic church, christian cults like the JWs, Mormons, the Moonies and even the Christian Scientists. But again, just because men start cults, that does nothing to diminish the truth of Gods message.\n\n \n I agree\n \n \nMy first church as a believer was the Trinity Baptist Church. That denomination doesn't accept that the gifts of the spirit that were practiced by the Apostles in the first church exist for believers today. Even though I fully believe in and have even experienced first hand spiritual gifts that baptists insist can't exist today, I know God led me to that church at that time in my spiritual walk. I would never worship there today, but that doesn't mean that denomination doesn't serve a particular purpose and place in Gods plan for His children today. \n\n \n I don't doubt it does, but will God make an exception for them because he chose for them to worship incorrectly to serve some other purpose?\n \n \n \nI mean, you come off on one hand as someone who is tolerant and totally into freedom of thought and all that liberal stuff. Yet when it comes to God, the most powerful being in time and space you seem awfully judgmental. Who are you to hold the author of life to a standard you yourself are incapable of attaining? And since when is the author of life expected to meet your low standards on any issue? \n\n \n Here you misunderstand my intention. Trading one line insults is not my preference. I would much rather have meaningful discussions based on rational thought and credible facts. Not so I can gloat and say ha ha your wrong. Because my view is that sometime long ago we got God's plan wrong and then lost the directions. I believe that the parts of the bible that makes sense don't come from man and the rest does. Making your first statement correct, it can be very simple. We have made it complicated and as long as people are unwilling to consider this nothing will change\n \n \nYou just don't get it do you? God Himself became flesh and lived among us as a righteous and holy Man as an example that living a sinless life is possible, \n\n \n Just not for us as you said not two paragraphs above.\n \n \nthen as a sinless Man He gave up His life as an acceptable sacrifice so that we can finally be redeemed once and for all time through His shed blood. Before Messiah, Jews had to sacrifice animals as temporary propitiation for sins. But we need do nothing more than accept what he did for us to be saved even though we all come to the table as damaged goods, spiritually speaking. \n\n \n The first part of this I think you are right, but you contradict yourself because you won't accept anything but the same ideas repeated over an over. What is we could lead a moral life and that is what God is waiting for. Why does he need servants, he has Angels for that. Why does he need us to constantly praise him? He is God he knows how good he is. If as monkey gives you a thumbs up you think how cute. What I think God wants is man who is self sufficient, peaceful, respectful of his fellow man and is a beneficial contribution to existence.\n \n \nYou want to continue to reject God and insult Him in this lifetime which He gave you for fellowship with Him, then you blame Him for giving you exactly what you continually insist you want which is anything but a relationship with Him. You wont even acknowledge He exists but you expect Him to save you after you die and can no longer deny that He exists?\n\n \n Didn't blame anybody, just asked if God is as forgiving as you claim. Has it occured to you that had Jesus finished what he started 2000 years ago billions of people would not have been born to go to the pit, If children exist in Heaven we would have all been born into a perfect world\n \n \nWhy would I want to go backwards to a time when I was spiritually dead, deaf and blind? Try putting on blackout blinders and go just one day without sight. That is a poor example for what it would be like to ignore what I know to be absolute truth as a believer and revert back to being spiritually blind and dead as you are now. The very suggestion is ludicrous and reveals once again how shallow your insights are. You need to stop judging God and humble yourself before Him. If you want mercy then accept it as offered by Him through Jesus who died for your sins on Calvary's Cross. If you reject that grace and mercy then don't blame God for your choice to reject His free gift. I leave you with this promise, do with it what you will.\n \n \"He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.\" (John 3:36)\n\n \n You kind of missed the point. Right now you can't see what everybody else see's. And therefore can't really grasp what is being said to you becauase it is all noise to you with no meaning.",

   "Inerrancy and inspiration of the Bible\n The Christian Church as a whole claims that the Bible is inspired and inerrant. This means that God is the one who moved through the writers to communicate to us the words which God wanted us to hear. This inspiration, however, is not a dictation, but a movement of God's spirit through the writer, utilizing the personality and style of the writer. Inerrancy means that all that is written in the inspired documents is without error. Now, there is a comment worth mentioning here. Inspiration and inerrancy applies to the original writings, not to the copies. In other words, it is the original writings that are without error. The copies, sadly, have copyist errors in them.\n \n Therefore, when critics of the Bible point out apparent contradictions, what they are doing is either failing to understand the context of the passages they are examining, or they have encountered a scribal copying error. The fact is that there are indeed copyist errors on the biblical documents and they account for many alleged contradictions. Remember, it is the autographs (original writings) that are inspired and inerrant, not the copies. The copies we have now are copies of inspired documents. The copies are not themselves \"inspired;\" that is, they have no guarantee of being 100% textually pure. Does this then mean that we can't trust the Bible? Not at all. The copies are so accurate that all of the biblical documents are 98.5% textually pure. The 1.5% that is in question is mainly nothing more than spelling errors and occasional word omissions like the words \"the,\" \"but,\" etc. This reduces any serious textual issues to a fraction of the 1.5%. Nevertheless, nothing affects doctrinal truths. In fact, nothing in ancient history even comes close to the accuracy of the New Testament documents. If the New Testament is disallowed, then all other documents of ancient history (Plato, Aristotle, Homer, etc.), must also be disallowed because the biblical documents are far superior in their copying accuracy than any other ancient literature in existence. See the chart below for further information on this.\n \n Nevertheless, following is a list of the types of errors that have crept into the Bible:\n \n Dittography - Writing twice what should have been written once.\n A good example would be writing \"latter\" instead of \"later.\" \"Latter\" means nearest the end. \"Later\" means after something else.\n Fission - Improperly dividing one word into two words.\n Example: \"nowhere\" into \"now here.\"\n Fusion - Combining the last letter of one word with the first letter of the next word.\n \"Look it is there in the cabinet... or Look it is therein the cabinet.\"\n Haplography - Writing once what should have been written twice.\n A good example would be \"later\" instead of \"latter.\" \"Later\" means after something else. \"Latter\" means nearest the end.\n Homophony - Writing a word with a different meaning for another word when both words have the exact same pronunciation.\n Meat and meet have the exact same sound but different meanings. Also, there and their and they're are another example.\n Metathesis - An improper exchange in the order of letters.\n Instead of writing \"mast,\" someone writes \"mats,\" or \"cast\" and cats.\"\n Does this mean that the Bible we hold in our hand is not inspired? Not at all. Inspiration comes from God and when He inspired the Bible, it was perfect. Our copies of the original documents are not perfect, but they are very close to being so. The critics often mistakenly assume that even the copies are supposed to be perfect. But when I point out that God never said the copies would be perfect, they then ask how can the Bible be trusted at all? Quite simply, it is redundant in its facts and information sufficiently to guarantee accuracy.\n \n Compared to other ancient documents, the New Testament, for example, has far more textual evidence in its favor than any other ancient writing. Please consider the chart below.\n \n Author When Written Earliest Copy Time Span No. of Copies\n Homer (Iliad) 900 BC 400 BC 500 years \n 643\n Ceasar (The Gallic Wars) 100 - 44 BC 900 AD 1,000 years \n 10\n Plato (Tetralogies) 427 - 347 BC 900 AD 1,200 years 7\n Aristotle 384 - 322 BC 1,100 AD 1,400 years 49\n Herodotus (History) 480 - 425 BC 900 AD 1,300 years 8\n Euripedes 480 - 406 BC 1,100 AD 1,500 years 9\n New Testament 50 - 90 A.D. 130 AD\n 30 years 24,000\n This chart was adapted from charts in Evidence that Demands a Verdict, by Josh McDowell, 1979, pages 42 and 43.\n \n If the Bible cannot be trusted as being reliable because it has only a small percentage of copyist errors, then neither can the above documents be trusted that have far less textual support.\n \n Therefore, we can see that the Bible is an ancient document that has withstood thousands of years of transmission with remarkable accuracy and clarity.
