   "Lets put back in what you edited out:\n \n \nCounter-terrorism efforts over the period had also seen an overall net gain, the report argued, despite the seemingly \"counterproductive\" aspects of some of the United States's self-declared \"war on terror\".\n \n The US-led occupation of Iraq focused the worries of many Muslims worldwide and made them \"more easily seduced by\n Osama bin Laden's arguments\", the think-tank said, referring to the Al-Qaeda leader.\n \n Additionally, the massive US military commitment to Iraq had drained resources from other areas more closely associated with terrorism, such as\n Afghanistan.\n \n \"From Al-Qaeda's point of view, Bush's Iraq policies have arguably produced a confluence of propitious circumstances: a strategically bogged-down America hated by much of the Islamic world and regarded warily even by its allies,\" the IISS said.\n \n Nonetheless, Al-Qaeda and the global Islamic terrorist movement remained \"physically and ideologically in flux\".\n \n Al-Qaeda's expulsion from Afghanistan had lost the group its main base, while the positive use of diplomatic \"soft power\" by the United States and its allies to combat terrorists was growing.\n \n The robustness of US efforts to establish democracy in Iraq, coupled with renewed hopes for Middle East peace following Arafat's death in November 2004, \"allowed for a more optimistic counter-terrorism outlook than did circumstances at the end of 2003\", the IISS concluded.\n \n This is in stark contrast to the think-tank's warning in its previous Strategic Survey a year ago that the Madrid train bombings of March 2004 appeared to indicate that Al-Qaeda \"had fully reconstituted\".\n \n \n\n \n And:\n \n \nOn a more general level, the international scene was different thanks to a change in US policy following George W. Bush's re-election as president, and a realisation in Washington that the \"aggressive entrepreneurship\" on the world stage of US ideals was not always helpful.\n \n International diplomacy during Bush's second term looked set to be \"considerably less turbulent and polarising than it was in his first\", the IISS argued.\n \n \"Overall, Bush appeared to learn from the Iraq experience that even the United States could not do anything it wanted -- certainly not without the help of its allies, partners and sometimes even multinational institutions.\"\n\n \n \n So basically what they are saying is that now the Bush admin has figured out that Iraq was a mistake, their diplomatic strategy sucked, and we were wasting time fighting terrorism with our military, they are falling back to a more diplomatic strategy, which actually seems to be doing some good. \n \n Maybe we should have thought of this a trillion dollar ago....\n \n I am half way through the report. will finish it tonight anfd report back tomorrow.",

   "The left were talking about Saddam's butchery when the right were still busy selling him weapons. When the Hallabjah massacre occurred it was left wing politicians in the house of commons signing motions of condemnation. It was the right that abandoned the Iraqi people to their fate after they reinstalled their pet dictatorship in Kuwait. The left had more concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people in 2003 because, as we have now seen, we knew that 10s of thousands would die as a result of an invasion, and the likely result was a civil war. The right was too concerned about protecting \"our bastard\" in the 1980s, and too concerned about trying to get the guy who threatened Bush's daddy in 2003.\n\n \n I was referring to the time when the left was defending Saddam's regime before we went in in 2003. You want to talk about the 1980s when a larger threat existed in Iran. Circumstances change and as I pointed out we once did business with Stalin because we judged Hitler to be the greater evil. You might remember Hitler. He was the kindly fellow who was raining bombs and rockets on London around about 1940 and later. You should have heard what Churchill said about Stalin.\n \n Churchill was indeed a classic Realpolitiker - Alliances, military force and the 'balance of power', not ideologies, were the principal concepts which underpinned his view of international politics. Churchill's remark that if Hitler had invaded Hell, he would at least have made 'a favourable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons' was indication enough of the Prime Minister's determination to have any ally in the British crusade against Nazi Germany.\n \n http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1035899175998",
