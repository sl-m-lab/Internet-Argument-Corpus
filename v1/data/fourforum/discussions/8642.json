   "I have nothing short of great admiration for the man known as Fidel Castro. Fidel Castro has created a relatively prosperous, stable and healthy Cuba despite being an enemy of the United States of America - the world's only superpower and incidentally a close neighbor. Cuba is still the only communist country in the Western hemisphere and has survived the US opposition longer than any other nation in recent history. Now, Castro has had surgery and temporarily given the governance of the island to his brother. The world looks on; some hoping either that Castro is at the end of his road or praying that he will continues his work in Cuba.\n We hear so much about communism being an evil institution especially over the recent years and I believe that one of the reasons why the US has been against Castro so strongly may be that he and Cuba has shown that communism can work. Under Castro's care, Cuba has among the best medical institutions in the world, has a relatively strong economy an unbeatable track record with dealing with disasters such as hurricanes. All this and more despite having no trade with the US and many other countries and the fall of the Soviet Union which history tells us was the chief economic supporter and the reason why Cuba chose communism. And Cuba, despite all these hurdles is much better off than many \"democracies\" in the world. \n \n I believe that people should remember how communism entered Cuba. It was because of the United States of America. For those who do not know, here is a brief history -\n Cuba was in the grip of a powerful dictatorship by Batista when the young Castro dared to stand up and prevent his country from being raped by corruption and injustice. The USA believe it or not, supported Castro's revolution and the early days of Castro's government. But Castro did not do everything that America wanted. History tells us that the United States had its eyes on the prosperity of Cuba since the 1800's and even offered in1854 to but the island for $ 120 000 000. The USA even bombed its own ship and its soldiers on (suicide bombing!) the USS Marne in 1898 in the Havana harbor with the intention of getting an excuse to invade Cuba and take control. \n Castro did not do what was in the interest of the USA but the interest of Cuba and this angered the US. Castro introduced revolutionary programmes in agriculture and social reform that saw small peasant peasants getting land that they can till and produce a living from. The US stopped supporting Castro and placed sanctions on Cuba. Castro either had to bow to this pressure or defy it. But the island received help for the Soviet Union which only gave aid if Cuba accepted communism.\n \n So we can see why the US is opposed to Castro and Cuba. As Castro recuperates, Bush calls for democracy to be adopted in Cuba - but communism is in itself a form of democracy - democracy is more than voting for your government. \n But the world must look at Cuba and think and ask - should we look at Cuba and accept it as a success of Communism or call for the American style democracy? This question I pose to you.",

   "I would contend that Cuba is not the great state that you make it out to be. The people are impoverished. Castro forces his will on them or kills them. No one revolts because they can't. Did you know the cars they drive are from the US in the time period of the 1950's! 1950's! I find it amazing they still get some of them to work. The people are building flotation devices so they can reach our shores. They hate their oppressor and silently are hoping for him to pass and a new era of freedom to wash over them. This is a view of the inside out. My comments are not unsubstantiated either. Unless living in shacks is what these people hope to aspire to, they are not happy. The only reason communism is working is because of the military not because of the public consent.",
