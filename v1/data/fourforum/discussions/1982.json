   "Is democracy in danger? Should Non-Republicans sue to have these machines eliminated from the process? And, do Republicans endorse this behavior?\n \n \n New York Times November 9, 2003\n Machine Politics in the Digital Age\n By MELANIE WARNER\n Excerpt--\n \n \n \n \n IN mid-August, Walden W. O'Dell, the chief executive of Diebold Inc., sat down at his computer to compose a letter inviting 100 wealthy and politically inclined friends to a Republican Party fund-raiser, to be held at his home in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio. \"I am committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year,\" wrote Mr. O'Dell, whose company is based in Canton, Ohio.\n \n That is hardly unusual for Mr. O'Dell. A longtime Republican, he is a member of President Bush's \"Rangers and Pioneers,'' an elite group of loyalists who have raised at least $100,000 each for the 2004 race. \n \n But it is not the only way that Mr. O'Dell is involved in the election process. Through Diebold Election Systems, a subsidiary in McKinney, Tex., his company is among the country's biggest suppliers of paperless, touch-screen voting machines.\n \n Judging from Federal Election Commission data, at least eight million people will cast their ballots using Diebold machines next November. That is 8 percent of the number of people who voted in 2000, and includes all voters in the states of Georgia and Maryland and those in various counties of California, Virginia, Texas, Indiana, Arizona and Kansas. \n \n Some people find Mr. O'Dell's pairing of interests - as voting-machine magnate and devoted Republican fund-raiser - troubling. To skeptics, including more than a few Democrats, it raises at least the appearance of an ethical problem. ... \n \n Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company",

   "Oh yeah, perhaps it would be a valuable expenditure and use of judicial resources to file suit over the machines. Or, maybe, just maybe you could have the machines tested to assure that they work properly. Hmmmm....\n \n Why is it that the man cannot have a legitimate business, and at the same time be a fundraiser for his party? Are you saying that all who are involved in the electoral process should have no political affiliation? After all, they might influence the vote. What about the people who tabulate the results, where are we going to find enough people to do that who have no political affiliation? And what is wrong with his quote? He stated that he is committed to delivering votes to the president. So? He did not say \"I am going to rig my machines to deliver votes to the president\". Another example of people making sandwiches without bread.",
