   "Yuschenko won't have much time to enjoy his presidency :)\n Don't u think it all looks very weird about mister Yuschenko? It seems like our government caught at last it was their misstake to bring him to power in Ukraine. Don't u think huh? IMHO Yuschenko is not that good as expected. Just look, he happened to be so soft and nice that he agreed to compromise with Ukrainian current president Kuchma which gave him an opportunity to adopt the parliamentary reform. Now Kuchma has more power and I wonder what Yuschenko gonna do in this situation. I think it is time for America to do smth with this ****in Yuschenko. Why not use the same PORA that was running the 'orange revolution' in Kiev as long as a month ago? IMO these guys proved very good and effective. They helped to uprise Yuschenko now they will help too overthrow him and bring true democracy to Ukraine LOL",
