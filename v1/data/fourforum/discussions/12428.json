   "Nickelodeon is helping the socialist/Marxist get his message burned into the pliable brains of our children. Sympathetic political bias is always good for the cause.\n \n Nick News Pushes Leftist Propaganda on Kids | NewsBusters.org\n \n It is sad that Nickelodeon is too stupid to realize how big of a backlash this will cause. Time to get in high gear folks! Just wait till Bill O'Reilly rants on this one! Nickelodean will soon be backpedaling on this leftist propaganda.\n Army Wife Toddler Mom has the best summary on this, but you really just have to see it for yourself.\n \n This Nickelodeon \"news program\", is not a news program. It is a leftist primer on how to be a \"left-wing radical REBEL\".\n \n I am not a blind follower of our Government, and I also think that Government should be watched by it's citizens. It is our civic duty.\n However this program led by Ellerby, is anti-war, anti- GWOT, anti-military.\n \n This \"news program\" is not about people changing the World around them.\n Ms. Ellerby uses leftist propaganda buzz words like \"taking on the establishment\".\n \n She shows a group of \"tweenagers\" walking around in orange jumpsuits, hooded and yelling from a bullhorn. \"We are not ok, with people being tortured by American soldiers!\" \"Are cooperation's priority over human lives?\"\n \n There is also a call for the impeachment of the President in the second segment of the video, \"democracy is at stake because of the President violating the Constitution\".\n \n The fourth segment of video shows another tweenager, who has put together a video of wounded Iraqi children, with the song Jesus Loves Me playing over it. This teenager blames America, the military, for what is happening in Iraq. This young girl says \"she finds, videos and facts on the Internet\" to show what is REALLY happening in Iraq. I am guessing she is getting these images from Al Jazeera.",
