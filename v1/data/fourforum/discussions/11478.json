   "Both candidates spell doom. \n \n Both of them have no fiscal discipline. McCain or Obama will add trillions more to the debt. Currently Obama is actually more fiscally responsible by about $1 trillion. Granted that doesn't say much given that both are estimated to add over $4 trillion in debt without their medical plans. Either way we are voting for Financial Insolvency. You're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. \n \n Besides that, you have some problems. First of all, the tax rate of capital gains in the past was more then double and investment hardly fled the country. Furthermore, raising raising taxes on capital gains pushes people to hold on to their assets to either pass them off as inheritance (thereby removing such taxes on gains as the inheritee's tax bases is whatever the asset was worth at time of death) or to donate them to non-profits. This will likely cause less volatile trading. How do you think Buffet got his tax rate down to peanuts? Donating stocks. \n \n On top of that, a huge portion of our economy is devoted to trade and that trade is often owned by foreign firms. Not subject to high personal income tax.\n \n At least with Obama we'll be less insolvent then McCain (not that it makes a difference). McCain can't even add or subtract properly. But that is Washington. Fuzzy math.",

   "But times have changed. NAFTA comes to mind. Since 1994, many agricultural subsidies have ended making poor farmers even more poor.\n\n \n Um...that's questionable. It's not the subsidies that have killed small farming. It's the consolidation of large agricultural firms like ADM and the destruction of the farming support system that didn't promote massive production of cheap crops. Read Omnivore's Dilemma for why small farming in the US is having a real problem. It's not about subsidies per se. \n \n \nNet manufacturing jobs have declined by 3.6 million as of 2007. Good paying jobs have moved to places such as Mexico, where they can pay a fraction of what an American worker was payed to do the job, while still improving the income of the Mexican people and making the rich American executives richer.\n\n \n You do realize that many of those jobs were low paying? Furthermore, NAFTA caused fewer job losses then the US loses normally in a 6 month period. And it's as well established fact that the development of the 1st world is not towards that kind of manufacturing. Look at Europe. \n \n \nMeanwhile, J. Q. Factory-Worker is left searching for a job that they might possibly qualify for, often times not able to find jobs in manufacturing or industry without either relocating or taking a significant pay cut. Add to all this a large Mexican population jumping the border every year, and suddenly the job crunch gets even tighter for legitimate taxpaying Americans.\n\n \n Thus we need retraining. The US is quickly losing much of its competitive advantage in certain sectors of manufacturing, just as Europe did to the US back in the day. This is the cycle of progress. You don't ban the telegraph because it puts pony express delivery riders out of jobs. \n \n \nMake no mistake about it, we are not on the right track. Increasing capital gains make business owners in this highly mobile global economy much more willing to run south for the long depression ahead.\n\n \n You really think that capital is going to abandon the largest market on the planet, with some of the best R&D programs? Capital will abandon non-competitive industries as it should. We need to adapt and roll with the changes, changing our economy to suit the globalized economy. Instead of light manufacturing, we should be heavily into biotech.",
