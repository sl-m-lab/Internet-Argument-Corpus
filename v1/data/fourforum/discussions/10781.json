   "From the chief anglocentric shaman of the \"invisible (white) hand\" Smith, who projected the notorious stinginess / cruelty of his fellow scots onto the world population, to that genius lunatic Friedman, the narcotic of the freemarket has been pushed onto the witless addicted masses for generations.\n \n The Blinding Fraud of Pure Economics or Freemarkets\n According to narcissistic economists solitarily beating their logarithms and algorithms in their lab corners (Chicago School of Economics, Carnegie Institute), the whole world can be 'structurally adjusted' by a calculator: if only the market was free of DISTORTIONS, they feverishly ejaculate! This is the Golden Mean of 'scientific' economics.\n \n The cardinal ingredient of the freemarket and the junk science of economics is of course the holy variable of self-interest. This mostly anglo (Smithian) principle is worshiped by all rightwing / pure economists, (all of whom are naturally fat and wanting for nothing except a social consciousness) who fantasize of a world where self-interest is freed from the inhibiting forces of market distortions, e.g. social security, minimum wage, incubators for newborns, subsidized medicines etc. Remove such distortions they claim, and after a little compulsory bloodletting the market will find its equilibrium with the quirky white plump invisible hand revealing itself.\n \n The problem / fraud with this doctrine is of course, any psychotic economist ala Friedman will insist the hated State must retain the appendages of police and army to keep the freemarket free by stomping on the victims of the 'freemarket'! Can you see the hypocrisy, the fraud, the distortion!\n \n If free market forces are to be truly free in the libertarian nirvana, then the freemarket force of resistance by the masses struggling for their own SELF-INTEREST must not be distorted by the boot and baton of the very distorted and manufactured variable of military and police violence.\n \n Can you now see the astronomical lie of Friedman's freemarket forces: stand down your military / police stooges and cast them back among the poor masses, and then introduce the freemarket. It is guaranteed you Chicago School of psychotics, the market will truly be free, and the most left leaning loopy poor panhandler will embrace this freemarket.\n \n And as for Keynes, that bleeding heart bourgeoisie, as with all who squat quivering in between the lines, he was part of the problem.",

   "That's what textbook economics would predict, but the mainstream definition of monopoly is so incoherent it's no surprise the reality is a far different ballgame.\n \n I'm not aware of Standard Oil ever charging obscene prices for its oil, it grew by consistently and rapidly producing oil at much cheaper rates than its competitors. It never gained total control of the market, it gained a huge proportion of it until its competitors adopted its methods, and then its market share declined - it did not have further innovation to offer that would allow it to cut prices below its modernised efficient competitors. Companies like Shell and Texaco saw the profit opportunity, revealed by Standard Oil's rapid growth, and jumped at it. \n \n It was prosecuted because its politically connected competitors were envious of its profitability, and could not compete on market terms. Ida Tarbell who bhbcu64 cites is the daughter of a man who did charge high prices for oil, and was ultimately unable to compete with the more efficient operations of Standard Oil.\n \n Yes, there were \"robber barons\" in this same era, the politically connected railroad owners for example who built shoddy tracks to nowhere in order to collect government subsidy. To act as if these are legitimate businessmen, and those who produce a product for consumers at a lower price than anyone else at the time are robbers is a completely upside down picture of reality.\n \n \n \n Let's suppose I'm living in the era of Standard Oil's near monopoly, they've \"dumped\" a whole tonne of oil on the market at low low prices to gain market share, and I suspect in two years, once they've gained control, they will jack up the price. And let's suppose I have a lot of money, for whatever reason. Why don't I seize this opportunity to buy as much of Standard Oil's cheap oil as I can, then sell it back to the public 2 years later? If my ideas about Monopoly are correct, not only will I make extraodinary profits from my insights, but also force Standard Oil to lower their prices to compete with me, thus ruining their own anticipated profits. As a strategy, trying to monopolise a resource to jack up the price is at best misguided. The only case I can recall it happening was with copper, and the company in question made good profits for a short while before people switched to other metals and they went broke.

Their ongoing costs are slim to none, and the potential profits they can make by holding out enormous. Your task, monopoly-theory investor, is to buy as much oil up as you can at the last minute before the price goes up. You can wait as long as you want to start, the more accurate your prediction of the time of the price rise, the greater your profit, and the greater the loss Standard Oil suffers. How long can it maintain its discount rates, 10 years, 100, 1000?\n \n The longer it sells oil at low rates, the more opportunity there is for even more people to pursue such a venture, any attempt to prevent a selloff of stocks by maintaining abnormally low prices only makes it worse for them.\n \n That's the worst business model I ever heard of, and no one with the commercial sense of Rockefeller would have the stupidity to pursure it.\n \n What's worse to make this whole scheme work properly, Standard Oil has to adequately supply the market with all the fuel it needs, even at the low rates it has set. If it runs out of oil, people buy from its competitors, even at higher prices. To sustain full market control at low price levels, Standard Oil would need to continually expand its industrial base, its logistics and refining capacities. And then what happens when it starts charging vastly more for it and demand slips? Burn its old assets or let them rot? Sell them off, and introduce into the market competitors who can easily compete due to low costs? The whole enterprise is an adventure in how to ruin your business.\n \n So yes, a business with the size of Standard Oil can successfully, but temporarily, bone consumers, if that is its goal. But it can only do so by ruining its own commercial prospects to the benefit of the consumer. If the goal of Standard Oil is to make profit, it should not go down this path.

Historically it has been the rich who have sponsored or undertaken scientific research, for example, and that rising tide has lifted most boats in return. \n \n The idea that everything would be better if we divvied up the possessions of the rich among everyone is hopelessly naive.

Think it through :)\n \n When you're done, ask yourself whether spouses can inherit. No? So you're planning to toss Mr House Husband or Mrs House Wife out onto the street, homeless, should their partner die. Oh, wait, spouses can inherit? Welcome to a world where grannies marry twenty-year-olds in order to secure the future for their own children.\n \n And what exactly prevents parents putting money or assets in their childrens' names before they die? Or are you planning to instigate a 100% tax on Christmas presents too? Sorry Johnny, but that bike your parents bought you will have to go because it represents an unfair competitive advantage you didn't personally earn.\n \n Presumably at least some of this 100% inheritance tax is fed into a social fund to give each new baby the same start in life, yes? Except - oh dear! The wealth of the economy, and the birth rate, and inflation, aren't constant. So you won't always be able to afford to give all new babies/adults the same start in life, year on year. Not to mention that you have, at a stroke, undone all the progress modern society has made in terms of population control and improving per-child investment.\n \n What baffles me is that you seem to think this is all somehow necessary.

Again, I'm not ideologically opposed to levelling the playing field: I just don't favour methods of levelling the playing field that involve digging a thousand-foot hole and pushing everyone in.\n \n As I said earlier, and Steeeeve expressed more succinctly, inheritance is a kind of gift. There are certain assumptions made when someone dies intestate, but in the end a will is merely a statement of how a person wishes their property to be distributed after their death. Unless you're going to start restricting what people can do with their property before their death, draconian inheritance taxes are entirely pointless. What are you going to do, create a government department that decides whether any given child merits the gifts his or her parents provide for him? The Ministry of Fairness, perhaps?",
