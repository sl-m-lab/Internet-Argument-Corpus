   "a sudden crisis rose when war on Iraq declared, its recognition as protector of world became questionable by many who relied on it. This showed something went beyond control of UNITED NATIONS and had to sit back. Some countries were more powerful dominated and went their own way, UN and its 191 members could do nothing, was an indication of its failure to organize as powerful International body. Out of 191 countries in our world, only 15 are members of security council; 10 are elected by general assembly for 2 year term and 5 are permanent members (have veto rights). Decisions on the issues are made by positive votes of at least nine out of the 15 members. That means decisions on matters require nine votes, including the votes of five permanent members (veto power). So, 5 out of 9 members are strong members with having veto rights. All 191 members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of 9 members (4+5) of Security Council. The fate of entire world is on 5 permanent and 10 assembly (2 year term) elected members who decide the destiny of the world. The Council alone has power of decision that member States are obligated to carry out as per the UN charter. This system may not be transparent as long as voting rights not given to all its members. The real democratic pattern is involving all its members for contributing to making decision. Veto right is dictating term that obligates others to carry. Entire United Nations and its 191 members are under dominance of 5 permanent and 4 assembly elected members. New world order means amendment of UN Security Council policy to retain and establish its image. Click the link below: emoticon_xhoho \n World and the UNited Nations",

If the US REALLY wants democracy to spread across the world. Changing the structure of the UN Security Council is a fine place to start.",
