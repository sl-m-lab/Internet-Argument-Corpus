I assume part of this is due to the pathetic education system of America, but many people still have this pie in the sky idea of what Reagan was rather then understand what Reagan did.\n\n \n The beauty of supply side economics from the politicians POV is that basically you are telling people \"you can have your cake and eat it too\". Tax cuts coupled with the promise of increased economic growth sounds pretty good. The problem of course came when the growth did not materialize and the government started spending money like a drunk in a whorehouse, which basically stimulated debt based growth. Even worse, the economy was not really in any kind of shape to take that kind of bulk cash investment, so most of it was spent on military which is essentially a fiscal black hole. Sure, the flow through multiplier on military spending is high, but for all practical purposes you are just as well off handing out cash since the production inherent is not useful.\n \n This does of course beg another question. How much of the cold war was real and how much of it was just fear mongering in order to justify the massive deficit spending? With the collapse of the Soviet Union it did not take long for the west to figure out that we had been bamboozled and that the soviets never actually presented the threat that we had been told they did. They tried to preject a much stronger position than they were actually in, so it may be that everybody was fooled.

   "This is true. I about puked the other day when a bunch of \"fiscal conservatives\" were lamenting the \"un-reaganness\" of current canidates. I have also heard several \"fiscal conservatives\" argue that making the Bush tax cuts legal, and following that up with another round of large tax cuts, would make most of our economic problems go away. What a bunch of XXXXXX. \nYeah, reagan wasn't anything special. He did what was needed to bankrupt the USSR but failed to scale that back afterwards.\n \n Furthermore, did you hear McCain's plain to get the jobs back? He want's to cut the income tax for corporations from 35% to 25%. No company has ever complained about being taxed too much in the US. They left because our workers whine and they demand too much money. Try lower the income gap between rich and poor for starters and then standard of living demand goes down and people will be willing to work for less and companies come back. \n \n \nThat pretty well sums it up for me. Frankly the set of candiates we have to choose from here are just terrible. \n \n Cthulhu for president!\nHa, I really don't mind Huckabee as a presidential candidate and Obama doesn't seem horrible but I doubt they will win. We've been over this before but basically both of them have the quality of actually caring about making a difference and not appealing to lobbyists. Huckabee has gotten no money because of this but at least he sticks to it. I think it is best to look at what the candidates have already done...for Huckabee, as an example, he ran Arkansas fairly well and created ideas that are considered \"liberal\" for the sake of making a better state. Now this may not translate to being president but you never can be sure anyway. The problem with Huckabee is the Christian brush he has been painted with. Now people support him for the sole fact that he is a hardcore Christian which isn't a great reason to vote for someone because they can be a Christian who can't manage a 7-11 if they had to (some people just can't manage...and that's ok). Yeah they might have a solid belief structure but unless you can translate that to actual leadership you really have no skills for being president. So basically Huckabee's supports support him for the wrong reasons making him look bad. In reality, he has been more fiscally conservative than McCain by actually balancing a budget and making sacrifices to do so.",

   "The beauty of supply side economics from the politicians POV is that basically you are telling people \"you can have your cake and eat it too\". Tax cuts coupled with the promise of increased economic growth sounds pretty good. The problem of course came when the growth did not materialize and the government started spending money like a drunk in a whorehouse, which basically stimulated debt based growth. Even worse, the economy was not really in any kind of shape to take that kind of bulk cash investment, so most of it was spent on military which is essentially a fiscal black hole. Sure, the flow through multiplier on military spending is high, but for all practical purposes you are just as well off handing out cash since the production inherent is not useful.\n I wonder how much of our economy is driven by debt or government spending. Probably a lot considering the real estate bubble has killed us.\n \n \nThis does of course beg another question. How much of the cold war was real and how much of it was just fear mongering in order to justify the massive deficit spending? With the collapse of the Soviet Union it did not take long for the west to figure out that we had been bamboozled and that the soviets never actually presented the threat that we had been told they did. They tried to preject a much stronger position than they were actually in, so it may be that everybody was fooled. It seems that with all the intel resources we had working on it at the time, and all the thousands of high level soviet defectors we had over the years, that surely at some point somebody would have caught on to the fact that the soviets were parading cardboard missiles for western consumption.\nThis is true. The best purpose for the reaganomics was pretty much to bankrupt the USSR. Unfortunately for us they actually didn't need us to do so and so while it worked it did so much sooner and we ended up overkilling the entire thing. We also never repealed our government spending based economy so now you have the problem we are in now. \n \n We were playing economic chicken with the USSR who had already flinched years ago yet we are still in the middle of the road waiting for a car to hit us.",

That is pretty much it. NOBODY moves production offshore just because of taxes. Those taxes pay for infrastructure and it is a LOT cheaper to pay the taxes and have the infrastructure provided than to pay lower taxes and provide your own. I make no secret of the fact that I have helped companies offshore factories before and it is not unusual in some countries for the company to have to build out the electrical, sewers, water, and roads all at their own expense.

They hear about problems in the bond markets and go \"well, I don't have any bonds, so that is OK\". They do not seem to understand the implications of that entire sector going to hell. \n \n Did you catch the new \"plan\" to help people behind on their mortgages? Now, with participating lenders, people who are 90 days behind in their mortgages will be able to request that their morgage company freeze foreclosure proceedings for 30 days so they can try to obtain alternate financing. That is pretty much the entire plan, with nobody explaining why they think that giving the folks an extra 30 days on top of the 90 they are past due, and the 6 months they have known they were in trouble, is actually going to do any good. \n \n \nDon't worry about SS killing is in the next 20 years....Hillary and Obama want to add an entitlement program that will sink up faster.

With SS surpluses starting to shrink this year and medicare already having reached the point that we are going to have to start redeeming those bonds, there is jsut no way we will make it 20 years. I am not sure that even an 80% tax rate will be good enough, and I think zimbabwe is a better example than somolia. I am sure that at least initially we will try to print our way out of trouble, which will destroy our currency. \n \n \nAs an accountant I say listen to what accountants are saying (all from David Walker). \n GAO's simulations show that balancing the budget in 2040 could require actions as large as\n \u0095Cutting total federal spending by 60 percent or\n \u0095Raising federal taxes to 2 times today's level\n And this is the most interesting:\n \n The lack of discipline is reflected in the skyrocketing number of Congressional earmarks in appropriations bills.

They battle over earmarks has done one thing and one thing only....diverted the publics attention from the larger problem. You and I both know full well that earmarks boil down to pocket change when put up against any real spending program. They could all be squeezed into a single line on our military budget....if anybody actually bothered to keep track of what the military spends. The whole earmarks \"debate\" is akin to mopping up a spill in the galley of the titanic as it sank. \n \n We are going to be in a LOT of trouble LONG before 2040 rolls around. There seems to be this assumption that the trouble only really begins when the bonds start getting cashed out when in truth just the loss of that surplus revenue will be enough to do us serious harm. I learned a long time ago that you get the best data you can, run the numbers as best you can, then believe the numbers even if they are unpleasant. By the numbers, we are going to be in BIG trouble as early as 2012 and that assumes that we jsut kind of blow through the complete and utter mess in the financil markets that we are seeing right now and franjkly there is virtually ZERO chance of that.\n \n \n \nThis may be true. Probably good McCain wins so at least he will get destroyed by the democrat and the democratic candidate can screw us up instead of the republican for a change.\n\n \n McCains idea for solving the problem is to cut corporate taxes by 10%. ###???

The most we could hope for is a Huckabee or a Paul on the economic front as they might be able to buy us a year or two if they could actually make some tough moves.

The simple fact of the matter is that there are only 2 ways to produce wealth...produce items with tangible value (manufacturing) or take it from others. The Swiss, for example, take their wealth from others with their banking industry. In theory that is what we were shooting for with the idea of a service based economy....we were going to be the worlds brain trust and sell our knowlege and ideas to other nations. Unfortunatly we have fallen so far behind in virtually all areas that the very idea is a joke anymore. The huge business consulting branches that US companies (IBM, HP, Citibank, etc...) started have all failed miserably. It turn out that nobody wants to hire a business expert from a country where their production sector has collapsed. India and Korea are the worlds engineers now, and the Koreans and Irish are handling IT and tech development. \n \n This puts us in a bad catch-22.

Already the mess in those markets is big enough that we may not be able to overcome them without a depression.\n Remember are talk about mortgages a little while ago? You have short term bonds that pay for a long term mortgage with the bank inbetween. So the short term bonds expire many many times throughout the life of the mortgage and the bank makes money off the different between long term and short term interest rates basically. Like you said the problem is that people can't pay the mortgages thus the bank can't pay the short term loan and now Mister Investor is mad. So naturally the market knows this and adjusts for risk by increasing the short term loan interest rate. The problem is this makes it less likely for the mortgage to be paid and thus the bonds to be paid. The mortgage company could cut its losses by foreclosing and selling off the asset thus stopping the need to issue short term bonds but will still end up taking a rather large hit. The Clinton plan wants to prevent this from happening by saying you can't foreclose so pretty much the bank ends up footing the bill for the short term bonds and could end up bankrupting the bank. That would cause all shorts of problems of which massive inflation is one of them. Clinton's plan is basically trying to force a situation where risk doesn't exist but no one will buy into that. Clinton's plan would attempt to help the banks out by paying some of the money but this gets into the entire idea of where does the money come from and if you just print it them inflation happens thus increasing the cost of money and upping the interest rate (or trying to) causing the banks to loss more money. \n \n What I am getting at is that by trying to correct the problem of people being homeless you pretty much wreck the rest of the economy and screw over everyone that invested in mortgages or owns a bank. You are better off letting their mortgage default and taking the correction where it needs to be.\n \n \nThis puts us in a bad catch-22. We need to make fiscal changes in order to turn things arouns because we are basically broke, but at the same time we need to make major, expensive changes to our economic infrastructure in order to turn things around. It is like an excavator with a broken bulldozer who cannot afford the parts to fix the dozer, but can't make any money until the dozer is fixed.\nWhich is why you crash and start over with the manufacturing with lower cost of living citizens. In your example it is declaring bankruptcy and starting a new company ha. May not work but what else can you do? Either that or sell the dozer and buy a shovel. The ol' do more with less idea.

   "My mistake...the plan is as follows:\n \n \n\"I have a plan - a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days [and] freezing interest rates for five years, which I think we should do immediately,\n\n \n The results are the same though: \n Where Clinton goes awry is her proposal to freeze mortgage rates for five years, which is essentially a much broader version of a deal President Bush recently hammered out with lenders to assist some subprime borrowers. If Clinton's only goal were to bail out homeowners facing steep rate resets on adjustable mortgages, her plan would work just fine.\n \n For everyone else though, such a freeze would be disastrous. Interest rates on new mortgages would skyrocket - perhaps past 8 percent, as the mutual funds, pension funds and other investors who typically provide capital to the mortgage market shift their money into other investments where the government isn't impairing returns. With higher mortgage rates eroding buying power, the downward pressure on home prices would only increase. Lower home prices would lead to even more defaults, as more folks who'd lost the equity in their homes choose to walk away from their mortgages. \n And probably the best line I heard regarding the plan:\n \"This kind of an idea is a little bit of untying your shoes with a buzz-saw.\"\n http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/16/commentary/birger_clinton.fortune/\n \n I am renting now but I better buy before this plan happens...otherwise I am SOL.",

   "Remember are talk about mortgages a little while ago? You have short term bonds that pay for a long term mortgage with the bank inbetween. So the short term bonds expire many many times throughout the life of the mortgage and the bank makes money off the different between long term and short term interest rates basically. Like you said the problem is that people can't pay the mortgages thus the bank can't pay the short term loan and now Mister Investor is mad. So naturally the market knows this and adjusts for risk by increasing the short term loan interest rate. The problem is this makes it less likely for the mortgage to be paid and thus the bonds to be paid. The mortgage company could cut its losses by foreclosing and selling off the asset thus stopping the need to issue short term bonds but will still end up taking a rather large hit. The Clinton plan wants to prevent this from happening by saying you can't foreclose so pretty much the bank ends up footing the bill for the short term bonds and could end up bankrupting the bank. That would cause all shorts of problems of which massive inflation is one of them. Clinton's plan is basically trying to force a situation where risk doesn't exist but no one will buy into that. Clinton's plan would attempt to help the banks out by paying some of the money but this gets into the entire idea of where does the money come from and if you just print it them inflation happens thus increasing the cost of money and upping the interest rate (or trying to) causing the banks to loss more money. \n \n What I am getting at is that by trying to correct the problem of people being homeless you pretty much wreck the rest of the economy and screw over everyone that invested in mortgages or owns a bank. You are better off letting their mortgage default and taking the correction where it needs to be.\n\n \n yep. And how many banks do you think would actually survive this? Looking at recent numbers from the fed, net non borrowed reserves have fallen to just $900 million. That essentially means that there is only about $900 million in real money, held and owned by the banks (as opposed to on short term loan from the fed) backing nearly $4 trillion in PV deposits. \n \n Banks are in DEEP trouble. The FDIC has been putting out a LOT of stuff lately re: guidelines for making claims, how bank failures are to be handled, etc... On a typical year you will see maybe one minor bit of news related to that from them...usually a minor rule change or something like that. What has been coming out of there lately is an informational blitz by comparison. I suppose it could be a coincidence that they have suddenly decided that clarifying claims procedures is important at the same time that we find out that most of the US banking system is probably insovent. \n \n \nWhich is why you crash and start over with the manufacturing with lower cost of living citizens. In your example it is declaring bankruptcy and starting a new company ha. May not work but what else can you do? Either that or sell the dozer and buy a shovel. The ol' do more with less idea. Americans haven't traditionally been willing to do this.\n\n \n IMO it would take several decades for such a rebuild to occur, and the odds of the US managing to keep together as a cohesive nation during that time are not good. That may not be a bad thing as frankly we have overgrown our form of government It seems we have finally reached the point that every large nation or empire eventually does...the point where we collapse under our own weight. \n \n For all intents and purposes we have already sold the bulldozer (our industrial infrastructure). Then we took out a big loan using the bulldozer as collateral and have been living off that loan. Now I think we are going to get the opportunity to see how americans do as ditchdiggers. I am not optimistic. Americans are not the ditch digging type. \n \n It looks like it is going to be McCain and either Hillary or Obama in the final race, which is bad, bad news if you were hoping to avoid WWIII. One nice thing about Paul is that he was actually willing to take responsibility for our actions as opposed to jsut making excuses and blaming others for our problems. As americans start to get hungry, pressure to provide a whipping boy to assign blame to will be immense. I do not think paul would have been willing to play that game.\n \n On the up side, the crash of the US economy should help mitigate the effects of the world energy shortage. On the down side, I have been to Zimbabwe, Chile and Argentina, and none of them are really nice places to live. I do not look forward to emulating their lifestyle.",
