   "Zoo of God\n \n God is the word which manipulated to mean something that is miracle. Every substance and living cells are alterable in shapes and in prominence. However life is prepare to passing on like milks curd for cheeses but we do not live for Jesus. Do you need to know that you are existed for you to exist so are Gods. Every thing has memories because energies all have passes. However what happen if you born with a different body then sorry to say that you are non-existed or this is impossible for origins and times changed. Indubitably this is the meaning for individualism. Like every mater have inertia and all kinds of energy mostly try to confine in their own states firstly. The requisitions of human are foods, health, pleasures, sexes and motions. In between all each events we need pleasures and happiness then there are the hedonisms. If you are quite health and happy then you always wish to seize for today but our environments and our fates are unpredictable for some times so that there come the romanticism willing to live in some more causal styles\n Right and wrong are combating and embarrassing for a honest soul and there are why so many philosophers. There are macroscopic and microscopic points of views as define by human s knowledge. I am short eye-sighted and needed the help of lens to adjust my visions to become a little bit clever. So I favor scientific proofs and evidences for matters and powers and hence rejected the possibilities of Gods and heavens. Actually there may be some gods but they are incomprehensible like mirage and aquatic creatures swim inside earths interiors. Just shocking of the earth did not seem to have any preempted strike on heavens but some artifice means such as explosions are killable to our souls. If some body try to damage your body then what happen to your conscious. Don't rely on yourself too much but it is even mockery to believe in Gods. Our physical worlds are being vertical for even a little ant may flee away from spiders and live on\n There is also the theory of fitness can survive. The whole universal exhibit the random natures. You think you are from gods but this chance is out of estimate as we have no thermos in our statistics or mathematics which account for this. It is your favor and your pastures. If you wish to establish your theories then somebody may look for some evidences. No myths are ever recorded and verified to be true by modern mediums especially for Jesus vital life after death.\n Gods will be very subjunctive to question and could not give direct answer for any normal souls. Can birth of Jesus have echoes and there is reborn again. There are so many stars in our western sky and we have so many doctors from every where who may ready to welcome him. Allow me to ask. Why not?\n I always have afterwards insights. Our earth has the presumption of a zoo of God as we are free and wild. Of course some creatures are bewildered and some face many persecutions. Our goals and our destinations of course are to live on. But wait! Some heroes doughty sleep in their tombs and they have legal immortal death. Do guests of heaven really feeling good or senseless. If we live not in a big zoo then do our Gods care for us or just let us play in some one s hands. Does god do many field studies. Some Christians live like folding but some like preys. Some are killed by diseases and many had very bad lucks. Do God s hearts is burning with anxieties. Dreams of gods are sometimes to late to be of use in a crisis. Your dreams may make you stronger and braver but some cowards hate themselves to be some cowards in dreams. Doctors are sometimes better than veterinarians under some views. The abstractions for the exist of god may be absurd.\n \n by cheung shun sang=cauchy3=laplace181 emoticon_xbouncer emoticon_xbouncer",
