   "Friday, June 09, 2006 \n BYU students punished for Soulforce participation --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Daily Herald \n Four BYU students have been sanctioned for violating the honor code during gay rights demonstrations on campus, and 21 people have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their arrests during a \"die-in.\"\n \n Brigham Young University spokesman Michael Smart said three students were put on probation after their honor code investigations were completed, and a fourth student was punished with \"suspension withheld.\" That consequence is just short of suspension, Smart said.\n \n On Wednesday, 21 people charged with failure to cease violation of a university rule pleaded guilty or no contest in 4th District Court. Judge Claudia Laycock fined them $200 each, which must be paid by July 19. They were represented by Provo attorney Scott E. Williams. Eight others have not yet entered pleas to their charges. \n \n Twenty-four people were arrested on April 11 during the \"die-in,\" sponsored by Soulforce, a gay rights group that was touring the country as part of its Equality Ride. On April 10, five members of the group were arrested for shouting and distributing literature on campus. \n \n The Equality Ride visited 19 schools across the country that ban or restrict enrollment of homosexuals, and plan to continue the ride next year.\n \n http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/181925/4/",
