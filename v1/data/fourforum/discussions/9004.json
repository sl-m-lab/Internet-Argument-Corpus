   "I can't believe this. Phelps is at it again. He never ceases to sicken me.\n \n \nKansas church plans to picket girls' funerals\n Wednesday, October 04, 2006 \n BY IRVIN KITTRELL III\n Of The Patriot-News \n \n Members of a Kansas-based church that has picketed funerals of fallen American soldiers are expected to protest at the funerals of the Amish girls killed Monday in Lancaster County, according to a news release issued by the church. \n \n The Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka blamed Gov. Ed Rendell for the mass murder of the five girls in a one-room schoolhouse because he ridiculed the church on a national television news show, the news release said. \n \n The church said nothing about the man who shot and killed the girls and wounded five other girls. He was identified as Charles Carl Roberts IV of Bart. \n \n Members of the church have been in the national spotlight after picketing at funerals of soldiers killed in action. The church says the military deaths are God's punishment for tolerance of gay people. \n \n In June, a York County man sued the church, seeking unspecified damages for the messages held by church protesters outside his son's funeral. \n \n The lawsuit seeks damages for invasion of privacy at the funeral. \n \n About a dozen states, including Pennsylvania, have adopted laws limiting funeral protests at services for soldiers killed in combat. \n \n President Bush signed a bill curbing pickets at national cemeteries.\n\n http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/115992961467770.xml&coll=1\n \n This is the best I could find. I've heard better reports of it on the radio, but can't seem to find much online. I heard that someone offered him something to not protest, but I didn't hear what it was. If anyone knows more about this, let us know.\n \n I heard a spokewoman for the church on the radio this morning who said something to this effect:\n \"It's better that these children were killed now instead of growing into adults, rebelling, and then be punished even worse in Hell.\"\n What?!! :xcensored \n \n I hate that these people are from Kansas. We're really not all like this.\n \n Before I only thought of Phelps only as extremely hateful, but now I realize he is absolutely crazy. I mean, certifiable. Like the kind of crazy where you need anti-psychotics and electroshock therapy. I'm not kidding. I wish I was.",
