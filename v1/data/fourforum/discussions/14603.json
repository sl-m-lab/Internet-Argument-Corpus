   "Less than a month after 9/11, commentator/film critic Neal Gabler wrote an op-ed piece I've never been able to get out of my head: An Eternal War of Mind-Sets - Los Angeles Times\n \n Though the essay specifically targets the the mindset of bin Laden and his radical Muslim followers, contrasting it with US secularism, it does so in the context of religious fundamentalism in general... and I couldn't help but note, even when it first came out, its relevance to our home-grown variety.\n \n Consider the following excerpts, in which I've replaced references to Islamic fundamentalism with generic equivalent terms. (Feel free to point out any substitutions you may disagree with): \nEpistemology is the branch of science and philosophy that concerns knowledge, specifically, how we know what we know. There are many \"ways of knowing,\" but the religious historian Karen Armstrong, in her recent study of religious fundamentalism, \"The Battle for God,\" identified two primary systems that have special relevance for the current conflict. One she called \"mythos.\" With its roots in ancient times when gods, heroes and other fanciful forces provided the answers for the questions of existence, mythos relies on intuition, superstition, emotion, tradition--on non-rational ways of knowing. You could call it a form of art. The other system is \"logos.\" As the name implies, logos relies on reason and logic, on what we call rational ways of knowing. You could call it a form of science.\n \n Our new war is a battle between mythos and logos.\n \n <snip<\n \n (These fundamentalists) live within mythos and have subordinated themselves to it. They see themselves not as individuals with wants and needs, which is a relatively modern notion, but as operatives of (God). For them, everything is religion, everything faith. In fact, they don't acknowledge any other legitimate way to look at the world. They are essentially premodern and ahistorical, believing only in what has been passed down to them by (God).\n \n <snip<\n \n The spiritual and the rational can coexist, as they do in almost every society, but (these fundamentalists) don't see it that way. As premodernists, they believe the two mind-sets are mutually exclusive; their grievance is that their way of thinking is being destroyed...\n \n <snip<\n \n They don't want...reason; they demand blind faith. They don't want progress; they demand tradition as prescribed by (their) clerics. But since they aren't pluralists and since they don't believe in tolerance, personal choice or persuasion, all of which are rationalist notions, their only option is to eradicate logos itself before it eradicates them. Their mission is to rescue the world from rationality and restore it to religion as they interpret it.\n \n In effect, they are attempting to turn back the clock to the time when reason wasn't empowered, and they are trying to purify the world of its putative secular taint...\n\n \n Comments? (Logically expressed, preferably.)",

   "Most excellent article - hits the nail squarely on the head.\n \n The conclusion was particularly scary:\n \n That is also why one must take the long view of our current war, as our enemies no doubt do. The terrorists aren't likely to destroy logos, but neither are we likely to destroy their mythos, even if we wanted to and, as rationalists, we don't. Instead, they will, in intelligence parlance, keep sending \"sleepers\" here, infiltrators who pretend to share a modern, secular way of thinking about the world as a way of extirpating it. And we will continue to use all the rationalist tools at our disposal to root them out, though we are fighting fanatical epistemologists, not just terrorism. We may catch Bin Laden and we may smash terrorist cells around the world, but, unfortunately, that isn't likely to end the battle over which way of knowing will prevail. You can measure this war not in weeks or months or years. You can measure this one in centuries.\n \n If, as you suggest, we substitute the Islamic mentality with the christian one, there really is no difference - well, except that the christians, as a whole, have mellowed with age.\n \n But, if you look back over the centuries, aren't the muslims doing now what the christians have been doing for 2,000 years?\n \n It seems that the religious war has come down to the 'Clash of the Titans'...and unless, the christians turn their plow shares into swords and fight back - or, the non-religious drop the hammer on both religions - it looks like the aggressors will eventually wipe out the pacifists.\n \n There is another possible out come: the younger generations will reject both extreems and a balance will eventuall come about in a peaceful way with both religions ending up in the 'Fairy Tale' sections of the librabies...where they belong, imo.",

The REAL problem lies in the over-reaction to the book-burning in that people would actually be violent over it, not the book-burning itself. But likely that won't be condemned as much as the book-burning itself. People aren't fixating on the REAL problem here--the nature of the reaction is a FAR more serious matter than the initial action. And let's be honest here--if a Bible had been burned publicly, does anyone really believe Christians be threatening violence and terrorism? No. This whole thing is just going to show that the problem is really more with one particular religion rather than religion in general (as anti-theists like to portray things). \n \n - Obama has now made tremendous condemnation of this pastor's actions, even going so far as to invoke \"American values\" over it.

   "It's not so much the media as the public in general..and certain media outlets in the U.S. are known for 'fanning the flames' against muslims\nTo your point:\nAsma Uddin: What's Behind the Negative Characterization of Muslims?\n \n Perhaps one of the most telling chapters of that story came during an episode of comedian Jon Stewart's Daily Show. Stewart revealed the astonishing truth behind a Fox News commentator's accusation that partial funding for the project was coming from an anonymous \"man\" who supposedly funds radical Islam around the world. Stewart pointed out that this \"man\" also happens to be the largest investor in Fox News after Rupert Murdoch. This in turn led to heated accusations by many of baseless fear-mongering, and the emotional pitch of the conversation inched even higher.\n \n This is by no means to deny that some Muslim projects are connected with problematic individuals and groups. Some clearly have been. But there are serious ramifications to the intentional fabrication of such connections with the intention of creating fear of an entire undifferentiated religious group. This dehumanized \"other\" is no longer merely different, but in fact dangerous and worthy of being hated.&#8232;&#8232;\n \n This \"otherizing\" process obfuscates the inherent diversity and world religion status of Islam. It also hides the fact that Muslims disagree among themselves over a good many issues, religious and non-religious. For a long time, Muslims have been bemoaning the false characterization of Islam as monolithic. Now this characterization is being amplified by the increasingly common denial that Islam is a religion at all.\n \n A prominent Tennessee politician recently stated at a campaign event that the First Amendment right to religious freedom may not apply to Islam because it could be considered \"a cult.\" A recent New York Times article on protests against mosques across the nation cited a member of ACT! for America, a group created to \"defend Western civilization against Islam,\" describing Islam as a \"political government\" that is \"100 percent against our Constitution.\" Still others take a common Muslim description of Islam as a \"way of life\" and misuse it to imply nefarious things about Muslims -- overlooking the multitude of faiths that also consider their religion a \"way of life,\" with the belief in God and the Afterlife informing their every action. Many defenders of Muslims unwittingly reinforce this narrative by acting as if Islamic beliefs are essentially impervious to reason and debate. By treating Muslim religious beliefs as inherently \"private\" and thus off-limits to public discourse, they shut down true dialogue. As I have argued elsewhere, this unwarranted discomfort with publicly-articulated religious beliefs can be downright dangerous.&#8232;&#8232;\n \n <snip<\n \n The rhetoric of demonization is not without consequences; indeed, there are reports of harassment, vandalism, arson, even murder. In recent weeks, a New York taxi driver was stabbed by a passenger for simply answering \"yes\" to the question \"are you Muslim?\" A black construction worker was attacked in New York during anti-mosque protests because he \"looked\" Muslim. Signs posted by vandals at a California mosque read, \"No temple for the God of terrorism at ground zero,\" and, \"Wake up America, the enemy is here.\" And a fire at the future site of the mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee was likely the result of hate-motivated arson.\n",
