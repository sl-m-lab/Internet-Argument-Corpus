   "There has not been a suicide attack in Israel since October. I felt things were looking up. Of course there were militant Palestinians just waiting for the Israelis' to strike. Sure enough, they did and the Palestinians retaliated just hours after the Israeli attack.\n \n http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=476090\n \n Tel Aviv suicide bomb kills three after helicopter strike on Gaza\n \n By Eric Silver in Jerusalem\n 26 December 2003 \n \n There was no Christmas truce in the Holy Land yesterday. A Palestinian suicide bomber killed at least three Israelis and wounded 15 at a crowded Tel-Aviv bus stop yesterday afternoon, just hours after an Israeli helicopter strike in Gaza City killed a local Islamic Jihad commander and four others. At least 12 other Gaza Palestinians were wounded, some seriously.\n \n Four of the Tel-Aviv wounded were reported to be in serious condition. According to early reports, two of the dead were women. All of the casualties were believed to be in their 20s. The army immediately clamped a total closure on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip....\n \n At midnight mass, a chair was left empty in the front row for Yasser Arafat, barred by Israel from travelling to Bethlehem. It was draped with the Palestinian leader's signature black and white keffiyeh, and an invitation to the service.",
