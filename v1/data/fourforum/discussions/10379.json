Many things happen. Gravity happens for \"no reason\". \n 2. Science does have some theoretical ideas about how life happens. That happens not to be unrelated to the theory of evolution.\n 3. Evolutionary theory does not propose that evolution occurs randomly. I don't know what \"accidentally\" means.\n 4. You have made the statement that a \"purposeful, designed\" organization of life is the \"only alternative\" to evolution without a shred of supporting evidence.\n 5. Just because stuff looks sorta kinda \"designed\" to you, doesn't mean it is. No one has yet to provide any evidence that anything has been designed by an outside force. The only argument is that things are too complex to be done, in solely your opinion, without an outside force. It is your gut feeling that there HAS to be a desinger 'cuz things just looked so darned designed. That hunch is essentially the basis of ID.\n 6. All IDers tacitly are promoting the designer as a god. Who else would it be? Please.\n 7. There is no honest difference of opinon here, I would agree, as the ID's do not promote any intellectually honest ideas.\n 8. Anyone opposing ID would gladly accept any alternative theory, including one that asserts a deity, if there was simply any evidence whatsoever. All the IDers have is wishin' and hopin' things were the way you want them to be. \n \n I am not nearly as knowledgeable about evolutionary biology as many other posters here, so I will defer to them on details. But it is clear you don't seem to understand it at all. \n \n I am always amazed at how the opponents of evolutionary theory never seem to actually understand what it is they are opposing. I suppose it's a testament to the robustness of the theory that the naysayers must distort it to criticize it.",
