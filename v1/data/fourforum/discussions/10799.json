   "I notice you haven't gotten many replies yet. I think we've chased most of the creationists out of here in recent days, and the editorial in Nature is like a mathematician coming out with a paper saying \"2+2=4\" to the rest of us. ;)\n \n I think it's good they finally did this though. The whole thought by science was \"there's nothing to debate, so we'll ignore the creationists. They'll go away when everyone starts laughing at them.\" Trouble is, the religious fundamentalists have too much political clout in America atm. Not enough people in power were laughing. Maybe this will help put the \"controversy\" to rest.",
