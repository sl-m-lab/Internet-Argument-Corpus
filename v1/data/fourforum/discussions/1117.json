Am I reading incorrectly, or is it condoning the act of having the abortion in these severe cases, and then confessing? Isn't that somewhat hypocritical? Please, say this isn't so!\n\n \n This is a bit of a non-answer; in a sense Orthodoxy finds it difficult dealing with laws and rules; thus it is ambiguus.\n \n My understanding of Catholicism is this legalistic interpretation of laws goes on. Orthodoxy sees the danger in this as illustrated in the myriad of hypothetical that can arise. What if this? What if that?\n \n If you say \"Thou shall not kill\" as an absolute, someone somewhere is going to come up with a situation that is a prima facie case for circumventing that law. A conversation might go like this...\n \n \"Thou shall not kill is a law.\"\n \n But then someone says \"What about abortion?\"\n \n \"Thall shall not kill is the law.\"\n \n \"But what about if the woman is raped?\"\n \n \"Thall shall not kill is the law\"\n \n \"But what about if the woman is raped, and then is certain to die if she doesn't have an abortion?\" (which is the case you cited)\n \n Immediately we're stuck with a hypothetical (though it 'could' be real) where-by it seems that we've then got to choose one life over the other. We can say abortion is murder, but in this particular case it seems rather heartless and rigid.\n \n Thus it is not an easy situation to answer. But equally, Orthodoxy might need to give such an answer. In this case they have attempted by saying \"the consensus of Orthodox opinion would be that a decision for abortion might possibly be made, but that it can in no way be easily justified as morally righteous, and that persons making such a decision must repent of it and count on the mercy of God\"\n \n All we can say is 'you won't be able to easily justify it'. We can't really make a determination that it can be justified; murder is murder (unless it's self-defence - which may be the situation here). But at the same time we understand the situation that the woman faces and hope that she will make the right decision. In the end she should be able to count on the mercy of God who is the ultimate judge. They are both trying to provide an answer and not provide a judgement in this particular case.\n \n Orthodoxy I think tends to give general terms of reference; such as \"Abortion is murder, therefore wrong\" but Man is a clever being and can orchestrate mental pictures to circumvent this (as illustrated above). As I said, we're not a legalistic faith. We are a 'mysterious' faith... in that we believe it is futile to elaborate on some issues as you'll get bogged down as this case shows. Some things we just will accept on faith.\n \n It's not a comfortable situation for any of the parties. Catholicism might be able to make an absolute determination in regards to this particular case; and might grant exceptions, but Orthodoxy finds this harder to do.\n \n This may not satisfy some parties who might want a definitive ruling on every situation. But that is the trap that the Pharisees made for themselves; slaves to the law.\n \n \n \n *\" Byzantine Catholics are Orthodox Christians who embrace full communion with the Church of Rome and its primate, Pope John Paul II, the successor of St. Peter, the first among the Apostles.\" (http://www.byzcath.org/Faith-and-Worship/Who-Are-Byzantine-Catholics.htm)",

Like the Maronite Church they practice Eastern Rites as Orthodox do, but they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.* They even say the original \"Nicene Creed\" as we do.\n\n \n Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.\n \n East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.\n \n Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?\n \n \nIt's not a comfortable situation for any of the parties. Catholicism might be able to make an absolute determination in regards to this particular case; and might grant exceptions, but Orthodoxy finds this harder to do.\n\n \n I understand. So basically, the Orthodox Church says whichever descicion you plan to make on abortion, \"Thou shall not kill\" will always be the answer, and when faced with a difficult question, the Church will explain the situation, and say that if you do it you'd have to be heartly sorry and go to confession.\n \n As you said, the Catholic Church has long laws in this situation. For instance, if the mother would die from the pregnency (only 2% of Abortions are done in this case), then whatever descision you make, the fetus and mother must be considered equals, and whichever you kill or allow to be killed must be done in accordance to the Church's teachings.",

   "Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?\n\n \n Given the question as how it has been put to me, yes Orthodox acknoweldge the Pope to be the successor of Peter in Rome.\n \n This answer needs further input - Peter was also bishop of Antioch. Thus the current head of the church of Antioch is also recognised as having Apostolic Succession from Peter.\n \n \nI understand. So basically, the Orthodox Church says whichever descicion you plan to make on abortion, \"Thou shall not kill\" will always be the answer, and when faced with a difficult question, the Church will explain the situation, and say that if you do it you'd have to be heartly sorry and go to confession.\n\n \n I don't understand the qualifier after the words 'always be the answer'.\n \n I believe I will contradict something I said earlier. When we say \"Thou shall not kill\" I put the qualifier for self-defence. I will remove this qualifier.\n \n The rule \"Thou shall not kill\" is I think an absolute.\n \n The fact that someone kills for the saving of a life is not an easy justification, but we believe that God will understand what is in man's heart.\n \n Good Christians of olden times would do pennance after battle - regardless of the cause.\n \n \nAs you said, the Catholic Church has long laws in this situation. For instance, if the mother would die from the pregnency (only 2% of Abortions are done in this case), then whatever descision you make, the fetus and mother must be considered equals, and whichever you kill or allow to be killed must be done in accordance to the Church's teachings.\n\n \n Yes, the Catholic Church likes to get into the nitty-gritty, legalistic stance. This is not meant to be a criticism, there are faults with both systems. I merely stated this to show differences of approach.\n \n I'm going to have to add a further qualifier. I am not the spokesman for the Orthodox Church. I am only responding as I understand things to be.",
