   "ORDER, LAWS, REGULATORS,\n \n In the old forum the topic was discussed but not answered.\n Speculations abound but some say it is not the function of science\n to investigate for the source of universal regulators (laws or you name it)\n I definitely state that yes, that is one of the, if not THE most crucial problems real science must deal with.\n Somebody wrote to me: \"They are there, do not worry. Think about real science!\". \n Now that is one of the most ludicrous attitude that a scientist can\n show.\n Go ahead let us see what many of you do or do not think about it...\n \n Cheers!\n \n B.T.W.

There is no evidence either way. Laws are just observations that have been observed to hold true in all cases. Like gravity. It is a property of matter (or should I say mass).

   "Hello Lurch,\n \n \nI don't think so. \n\n \n Well, I still do think so. Never did I receive any scientifically reasonable answer to that. ( I've asked many \"authorities\")\n \n \nIf you want to claim that your god is responsible, then go ahead\n\n \n Do not worry Lurch about what I do or do not think. Just tell me about what the evo idea is. B.T.W. I do not have a \"god\", you may\n have many that is your given right.\n \n \nThere is no evidence either way. \n\n \n No evidence of what?\n \n \nLaws are just observations \n\n \n No, the result of their function/work is observed. That is ORDER.\n Order (effect) is observed, not the laws (cause).\n \n \nLike gravity. It is a property of matter (or should I say mass). \n\n \n Matter is subject to its regulator(s). One of them is gravity. Gravity is the ruler, matter is the subject. The ruler is not the \"property\"\n of the subject.\n \n \nTo objects attract each other. Did your god do it?\n\n \n Why do they do it? I do not have \"god\" see above. Why do you\n insist talking about \"god\"? Focus on the question please. \n \n \nBut the question is pretty irrelevant to science\n\n \n Really? Then why do they experiment on \"antigravity\" devices or\n the theoretical possibility of \"time-travel\"?\n \n \nAnd before you go on you're going to have to define order and specifically why and how you think that it is relevant to evolution. Please don't get into that 2nd Law stuff that has been debunked so many times.\n\n \n Order is the status of things which make any sort of existence\n possible. It is relevant to every single factor of being. The 2nd\n law is not a question here at all. (Besides if you think it was \"debunked\": what do you mean? Who \"debunked\" the \"second law of thermodynamics\" and why?)\n \n Cheers.",

   "Well, I still do think so. Never did I receive any scientifically reasonable answer to that. ( I've asked many \"authorities\") \n \n Gabor, we've gone round and round on this, but what the heck....\n There are hypothesises concerning the fundamental nature of existance. But these concepts are very complex and very few people in the world can even begin to understand them. Stuff like Superstring theory and Brane worlds are way, way over my head. I don't have to understand them in detail to accept their premise. But if you want to refute them, you have to understand them. If you want to claim there is some supernatural intelligence that created the \"laws\", show us the evidence, you haven't done this yet. Could God be behind every thing, the grand architect who's unimaginable power created and guided everything from behind the scenes? I'll gladly admit that could be true but it is the least likely possibility. Why? Because everything we have seen so far in this universe has a natural cause. Every phenomenon we have been able to explain has a natural cause.\n It is therefore reasonable to extrapolate that everything we haven't seen and can't explain yet also has a natural explaination.\n Show me any evidence of a supernatural act or any phenomenon that can only happen via a supernatural act and I'll consider your position.\n \n \n Do not worry Lurch about what I do or do not think. Just tell me about what the evo idea is. \n \n The evo idea on what? Cosmology is not a part of the Theory of Evolution. Please expand on what you mean.\n \n \n \n Matter is subject to its regulator(s). On of them is gravity. Gravity is the ruler, matter is the subject. The ruler is not the \"property\" \n \n I think you are totally wrong here. Your ruler/subject analogy breaks down. Gravity is an intrinsict property of mass. If you have a mass in space by itself, no other planets, stars, ect. around it, that mass has a field of gravity. Remove that mass and there is no more gravity there. So gravity IS a property of matter. Besides these lousy examples, you have shown no evidence for your claim that these \"regulators\" pre existed the \"subjects\" they operate on.\n \n B.T.W. That may be the detonator for the demolition explosive of the \"darling\" : \"TOE\". \n \n I think this is what Lurch was commenting on concerning th 2LOT.\n My question is what does the origins of order have to do with the TOE? It doesn't matter where the \"laws\" came from, the Theory of Evolution isn't dependent on their origin. Just as it doesn't matter how the first life originated, the TOE explains the diversity of life on this planet. So how does your arguement demolish the TOE?",

   "Demon,\n \n \nThere are hypothesises concerning the fundamental nature of existance. But these concepts are very complex and very few people in the world can even begin to understand them. \n\n \n And they are the \"adept\" ones who agree they understand it are not they? How do you know they have truly got the thing? You must accept it by faith since you are not amongst the \"precious few\" who are inspired to understand it. It is strange that Newton's formulas can be understood without being accepted into\n the secret society of evolutionary magicians.\n \n \nCould God be behind every thing, the grand architect who's unimaginable power created and guided everything from behind the scenes? I'll gladly admit that could be true but it is the least likely possibility. Why? Because everything we have seen so far in this universe has a natural cause.\n \n \n Can you tell me Demon what is \"natural\"? Is gravity \"natural\"? Of\n course because it is there always in \"nature\". But whaen we say\n \"natural\" we use a conventional expression to tell that it is something always experienced. What is a \"natural\" cause? Just\n because they are there it is assumed that they are the \"product\"\n of \"Mother Nature\". But that is not science. Science works from the effect to find the cause. If that is not the way then the method is not scientific. If \"science\" says the cause is \"natural\"\n meaning that the laws are \"intrinsic properties\" of matter then\n it is not science though it may be called so \"conventionally\" yet it\n is meaningless.\n \n \nEvery phenomenon we have been able to explain has a natural cause.\n It is therefore reasonable to extrapolate that everything we haven't seen and can't explain yet also has a natural explaination.\n\n My apologies Demon but it is not so, not at all. The real, true causes of great phenomena are not \"explained\" at all, not even\n guessed. Physics has hypotheses or theories about almost everything but extrapolate (expand by assumption) ideas beyond\n the observable is just that: the work of belief. \n \n \nCosmology is not a part of the Theory of Evolution. Please expand on what you mean.\n\n \n Only if we restrict the term \"evolution\"' to the biological theory. But there is \"cosmogical evolution\" theory too. Neither do I think\n change equals evolution. There is change in things it is a fact, clearly observable. But the \"theory\" of evolution actually says \"change for the better\" or \"higher\" level. That is not factual\n the opposite of it (decay, change to a lower level) is indeed observable, a fact. So the opposite of the evolution \"theory\" is \n the fact.\n \n \nMy question is what does the origins of order have to do with the TOE?\n\n \n \"Cosmological\" evolution says from \"nothing\" came out all things.\n But even that speculation of faith is based on the assumption that\n tha laws were there. Otherwise the idea itself does not work. So\n the circle is closed, the question remains : how come the regulators were there? Did they \"evolve\" as well? IF yes, how\n please?\n Thank you.\n \n Best wishes.",
