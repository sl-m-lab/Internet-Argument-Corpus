If not, please will a moderator vaporize my post.\n \n Some friends of mine and I are working on creating a web site which will be a kind of on line encyclopedia of libertarian and conservative thought.\n \n Everyone would find it useful: conservatives and libertarians for obvious reasons, liberals and Lefties to know what the Enemy is thinking.\n \n More information at the site which is my signature line, below.\n \n Doug",
