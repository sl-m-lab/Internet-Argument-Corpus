   "The critics of it are the ones who called it Star Wars. o_O\n\n \n Strange how some major things that make no sense exist simply because the critics gave it that name. Republicans being related to elephants and democrats to donkeys were meant as insults when they were first used just as the term Yankee was during the revolutionary war. Also in reverse, hacker was once used as a positive term. I'm sure there are a lot more cases of this.\n \n Regardless of this I'm in favor of a missile defense. It will result in the same type of deterent that MAD would and there would be no risk of someone pressing a button and destroying all mankind. I hope to see it implemented before another world war breaks out and we destroy everything we have worked so hard to create.",

What makes the US so unique?\n\n \n \n Well, the missle defense shield idea has many critics NOT because (as some Republins seem to think) we all don't want America to be safe, but because they feel money can be better spent elsewhere to defend America. They feel that the biggest threat to the US is not an ICBM (hardly anyone possesses them) but instead a greater threat is that a terrorist, for example, will smuggle a wmd into the country. That combined with that most experts sayting we won't have the technology to build such a stysem for a long time, forms the basis to the objection of speding vast amounts of money on such a system.\n THere is also, of course, the objections of the US having signed a treaty saying we woulndn't build such a system, and the fear that it will start another arms race.",
