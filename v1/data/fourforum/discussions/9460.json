   "What I have been saying for months. The Chicken Littles have a little cottage industry going trying to scare Americans to death.\n ===============================\n January 17, 2007 \n Losing Sleep Over the Trade Deficit?\n By John Stossel\n \n I'm told to worry about the trade deficit.\n \n Commentators and populist politicians are wringing their hands. The trade deficit is a \"malignant tumor in the intestines of the U.S. economy,\" says Pat Buchanan. Lou Dobbs is very upset that \"We're borrowing about $3 billion a day just to pay for our imports\"!\n \n Economists had taught me that the trade deficit is not a big deal. (The budget deficit may be a big one, but that's a different issue.) But with all the pundits and politicians alarmed, I began to wonder if I was out of touch.\n \n Then I thought about my local supermarket. I buy stuff from the Food Emporium every week. I spend thousands of dollars a year there. But the supermarket never buys anything from me. Not one thing.\n \n And yet that is no problem. It's better than no problem -- it's fantastic! Imagine if I could only buy from the store to the extent that it needed my services. I'd starve. That would be barter, and mankind dumped barter for the money economy eons ago precisely because it is so inconvenient...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/01/losing_sleep_over_the_trade_de.html",

   "Rarely have I seem an article that contains so many half-thruths and outright lies. Oh, where to begin...\n \n \nTrade statistics obscure reality.\n\n I love this one. What he's basically saying is that facts obscure reality.\n \n \nIf we don't care about trade balances at the individual level, why does it matter if in a given year Americans as a group buy more from the Chinese than they buy from us?\n \n It doesn't.\n \n In fact, it's a good thing. Foreigners trade cool products (and capital goods) for paper money. They can do only three things with our dollars: buy American goods and services, save them, or invest in the United States (including buying U.S. government debt).\n\n The writer 'forgets' to mention that the foreigners can also use the dollars to upgrade their facilities, invest in other markets, buy goods and services like gas and oil from Iran/Nigeria etc.\n \n Only a fool would think that all the dollars that the Chinese make get recycled back to the US.\n \n \nEspecially absurd is Dobbs's idea that the trade deficit means we are in debt to foreigners. Except for the T-bills foreigners buy, this just isn't true. As George Mason University economist Donald Boudreaux wrote in the December issue of The Freeman magazine, \"If Mr. Sony uses the $2,000 he receives from selling computers to Americans to buy $2,000 worth of equity in Exxon, the U.S. current-account deficit rises by $2,000, but no real indebtedness is created. No American owes Mr. Sony anything. ... It just ain't so that the so-called trade deficit is debt!\"\n\n Now this here is just a masterpiece of twisting logic and half-truths.\n It's true that there is no real indebtedness, but the writer fails to mention (once again) what truly just happened in this transaction.\n Basically the US traded a piece of a valuable American oil company for Chinese computers. Yeah that's a great deal alright, maybe the US should consider trading GM for some iPods. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nBoudreaux adds, \"If we applaud when citizens of Wisconsin save and invest in software firms in California or orange groves in Florida, why should we not be equally pleased when citizens of Shanghai save and invest in these same American firms?\"\n\n Apparently the writer 'forgot' that Chinese interests differ from American ones. \n \n \nGood point, especially when you consider that the only way to shrink the trade deficit is for the government to prohibit us from buying whatever we want.\n\n Or, Heaven forbid, you actually start producing and selling stuff again as a nation. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nWhat the trade fearmongers don't say is that countries with trade surpluses often don't do very well. Japan had a trade surplus all during its long recession, which began in 1990 and is only now ending. By contrast, countries running trade deficits often experience economic booms. A Cato Institute study shows, \"Contrary to prevailing assumptions, 'worsening' trade deficits are associated with faster GDP and manufacturing growth and more rapidly declining unemployment, while 'improving' trade deficits are associated with slower GDP and manufacturing growth and rising unemployment.\"\n\n This is also a wonderfull piece of spin. the writer starts out by comparing trade surplusses against trade deficits. He cites one example and insinuates that deficits are better than surplusses.\n He then continues to try to back up his claim by citing the report from the Cato institute, but makes a leap of logic because the report is about worsening/improving deficits and not about surplusses and deficits. It's about the same as trying to link Saddam to 9/11.\n \n The report itself is utter garbage. It takes stats from individual years, adds them up and gets an average without even taking into consideration that maybe economic and political events can have an effect that can last for years.\n The dotcom bubble, the crashes of '87 and 2000, 9/11, China's entry in the WTO, the fall of the Soviet Union etc all have had major influence on the US economy, yet the report doesn't even tak this into account. It just presents the most basic and simplistic explanation and the conclusion is the equivalent of me proving that the Chinese surplus is caused by the EU surplus because for the last 8 years the EU has had a trade surplus with the US and so has China.",
