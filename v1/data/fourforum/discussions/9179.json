   "Maybe I mixed a bit too much human with computer.\n \n I'm pleasantly surprised that Arkansas made as big a jump as it did, although I'm skeptical that they're as good as the teams near them in the rankings. It does make perfect sense that voters liked them, after all the press. They're down at #9 in the computers.\n \n Rutgers is, amazingly, #2 in the computers.\n \n USC and Florida, as I guessed, are pretty much neck and neck in the human polls. Puny humans.\n \n The computers are still being a bit unkind to #8 West Virginia.\n \n Meanwhile, Wisconsin made a big jump as well, and probably deservedly so. Still, Louisville (#10) has them beaten by one slot according to the computers, even though their only loss is to now #6 Rutgers, and they beat WVU.\n \n I'm quite surprised that Texas took such a big hit, though that doesn't mean I'm unhappy that Texas took such a big hit...\n \n The next two weeks should be interesting.\n Ohio State plays Michigan next week; the loser may drop, but some are saying that a close game may not result in an opening at #2.\n USC will play Cal this week. Cal's already out, but they could play spoiler.\n USC will play Notre Dame in two weeks. The loser will drop out of contention, if they aren't by the time they get there.\n In only slightly less interesting news, Arkansas will play LSU. Another win for Arkansas might push them up. Assuming they win either of their two next games, they'll play Florida in the SEC championship game, which will be great for the winner and disastrous for the loser. Needless to say, the Hogs will be rooting for Cal over USC, then USC over Notre Dame.",
