   "I could not have said it better myself.....A home run with the bases loaded..\n \n http://www.chronwatch.com/content/contentDisplay.asp?aid=15483&catcode=13\n \n Liberals: Too Lazy to Win the War on Terror\n Written by Justin Darr\n Monday, July 04, 2005\n \n The essence of modern liberalism is laziness. The idea of the American Dream is based on individualism and personal responsibility. If you work hard, play by the rules, and develop your God-given talents to their fullest, you will be successful in life. But liberals do not hold to this ideal and would rather have you go through life sitting around passively waiting for something to be given to you by the government. Theirs is a principle according to which individualism is sublimated to the state and success is defined as relative comfort rather than doing the best you can do.\n \n This type of thinking is destructive enough in the domestic politics, but liberals are trying to apply the same lazy \"get something for doing nothing\" mentality to the War on Terror.\n \n The War on Terror has been advanced on many different fronts but the one constant has been that the left does not like it. While the Taliban were collapsing, the New York Times was calling Afghanistan a \"quagmire.\" While the FBI was pulling terrorist sleeper cells out of suburban communities, the left was demonizing the Patriot Act. And as our troops fight terrorists daily in Iraq, liberals are calling the War a disaster, comparing our soldiers to Nazis, and demanding a timetable for America to tuck its tail between its legs and run home. It is easy to sit and claim the left opposes the war in hopes of picking up a quick political gain, and to a degree this might be true, but the real reason the leftists have given up on winning the War on Terror is that they are too lazy to do what it takes to win. So rather than digging deep and doing what it takes, the left has decided to give up and drag the rest of us down in defeat with it...\n \n (Snip)\n \n The enemy in the War on Terror is not simply Osama bin Laden, but the militant anti-American ideology that spawned him. If bin Laden had failed in his attack on 9/11, or if he had never even tried, then it would have been some other group at some other time in his place. To actually end this threat, we cannot limit ourselves to fighting the actual perpetrators of 9/11 but the ideology and rogue states who promote their fanaticism.\n \n This is a very difficult and unpopular path to follow...\n \n (Snip)",

   "I have no idea what that comment is supposed to mean.\n \n Here's a hint VoR - you have no idea why you oppose \"liberalism\" yourself, you just have bad feelings towards it, like a kid does towards broccoli, so you dig up the most puerile articles deriding it you can find, and bark like a seal at the way they put down liberals, with no regard, or even ability to determine, whether their argument makes sense or not.\n \n Liberals are too lazy to fight the war on terror with other peoples' sons. Presumably conservatives are by extension too lazy to fight a war on poverty with other people money. Why its those industrious, individualistic totalitarians that both left and right should aspire to emulate, not these laissez faire lazybones who oppose government.\n \n I do find interesting in this article the pessimistic tone, essentially declaring that the US has been beaten and now seeking to blame the \"liberals\" for it.\n \n \nThe left's thinking is based on its love for the over simplification of complex problems and addiction to quick fixes... rather than calling militant Islam and rogue states the enemy they are and confronting them on a global scale.\n\n \n Ironing, anyone?\n \n \nNorth Korea, Iran, and militant Islamists have hated America\n\n \n Personal responsibility and individualism means attributing emotions to entities such as \"Iran\" and \"North Korea\".\n \n This is the empty \"freedom\" rhetoric of the neocons, jabber a few words about \"individualism\" and \"personal responsibility\" and then spend like a drunken hillbilly and demand everyone support your war.",

They infiltrated CIA agents into the UN inspection team to spy on the Iraqis. This greatly hindered the inspection team much to annoyance of the chief weapons inspector.\n \n Imagine that, eh?\n \n Basically the UN weapons inspection program was turned into a vehicle to infiltrate CIA spies. Naturally this ****** off Saddam, after which he didn't allow these inspections anymore.\n \n \n I'm going to do a recap, because I know that all this truth must have overloaded your brain since it's only used to lies:\n \n - Inspections find nothing\n - US keeps moving the goalposts and keeps adding new sites to the list\n - US uses UN inspections to infiltrate spies\n - Saddam gets ****** and doesn't allow inspections anymore\n \n \n Doesn't it ever get tiresome to be proven wrong so many times?\n \n What's that? It's sad, so sad? emoticon_cry emoticon_cry emoticon_cry emoticon_cry\n\n \n \n \nSaddam did give inspectors access to sites. And everytime the inspectors found nothing.\n \n \n That is XXXX and you know it...........There were many sites that the inspectors did not have access too and many scientists they could not interview my confused liberal friend.........",

I guess the shock of all that truth after such a long period of listening and telling lies was just too much Like I said, Saddam didn't want to give access to sites anymore because:\n \n a) the list of sites kept getting updated everytime the inspectors found nothing (i.e moving the goalposts)\n b) the CIA had infiltrated the inspection team\n \n It is a FACT that no working WMD's have been found in Iraq after the Gulf War (I'm not counting the leftovers from the Iran/Iraq war since they can't be used). \n \n But keep grasping at straws my little buddy, I like the entertainment. And I always like to see some confirmation that sheep are still around. It makes it easier for the rest of us normal people to take advantage of you.",
