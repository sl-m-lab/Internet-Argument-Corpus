   "I do like the 'conflict not in the new - link to news site'...but hey\n \n This is a conflict that goes far beyond just muslim/christian, which the article hints at, its not Albanian muslims vs Albanian christans its Albanians vs Serbs as it was when the Kosovo crisis began.\n \n Given Iraq is right next to Turkey, and Iran next to that, Islamic fundamentalism is hardly 'just appearing' on Europe's doorstep.",

   "Hmmm.. sorry to be crass, but if this is the only response the christians will get in Kosovo, they should be very, very happy. Considering the attrocities carried out in their name, they should be glad they haven`t met the same fate as the thousands of muslims butchered because of their ethnicity and religion in the region. Comparing it to the Kristallnacht is just moronic. A more fitting comparison would be the looting of american and brittish soldiers in Germany in the direct aftermatch of WWII. Certainly not good, but considering the circumstances, not very troubling either. \n \n It is also fascinating that they choose to interview a bloody american expert about the situation in Kosovo and the future for Europe... His expressed sentiments for the fall of the christian-orthodox hegemony in Jugoslavia is also highly entertaining (in a scary way)... Perhaps the Serbs should have been allowed to commit genocide on an increasinly massive scale just because they where christians? What a XXXXX!",
