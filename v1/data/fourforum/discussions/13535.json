I believe I have captured your point.\n \n Tell you what. I agree 100%. You are right about that, sister. You betcha. Gayness is a lifestyle, a behavior, a bad habit.\n \n SO, what I am asking is this: what to do about it? \n \n 1. Should gay people just accept the mistreatment and shut up about it, and go on being mistreated?\n 2. Should gay people do something about this to avoid mistreatment? \n If #2, what do you suggest?

God has been an important part of American institutions since the get-go. But you're too biased and jaundiced trying to justify illicit gay sex sin to admit it. \n \n The Danbury Baptist Letter, as Originally Drafted\n \n The Library of Congress is grateful to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory for recovering the lines obliterated from the Danbury Baptist letter by Thomas Jefferson. He originally wrote \"a wall of eternal separation between church and state,\" later deleting the word \"eternal.\" He also deleted the phrase \"the duties of my station, which are merely temporal.\" Jefferson must have been unhappy with the uncompromising tone of both of these phrases, especially in view of the implications of his decision, two days later, to begin attending church services in the House of Representatives.\n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n  Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Confirmed by: U.S. Library of Congress:\n \n Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition)\n \n And, no doubt based on Biblical admonitions against gay sex sin, numerous Americans voted against gay marriage in various states, shooting down another insititution of iniquity.

It's not catching them that is the question, instead, it's how to stop the ghey?!emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nI refute that.\n The post about Eskimos eating blubber was by far the most ignorant.\n\n \n I'm glad you're enjoying being pointless.emoticon_xdonno At least someone is enjoying your posts.:)\n \n \n \nDefine \"the gay lifestyle\", as you see it. Is it sex? Straight people have sex too. How is it that young gays in particular experience bias/hate, even without ever having had sex? When gay people are discriminated against, it's not because anyone knows what or if anything has happened, in terms of sex. Gay people are discriminated against due to identity, not sexual actions.\n\n \n Who said anything about sex?! I certainly did not. And yes, I will define,\" the gay lifestyle\". When you talk about a lifestyle it is much more then sex, because sex is only one aspect of someone's life. And if it is a fulfilling life then sex plays only small role in it because there are so many other aspects to consider.\n \n The way I define the,\" gay lifestyle\" is the emotional, psychological , and physical attraction to someone of the same sex. Whether sex ever played a part in the attraction or not. It is the wanting to make a life with someone of the same sex, and put that person in the same role you would put someone of the opposite sex in. And if not in a relationship with someone of the same sex, it is the psychological and emotional need to be/get close to someone of the same sex, for an un-natural type of companionship meant for someone of the opposite sex. That is how I define the gay lifestyle. It is far more then who you are going to bed with. It is a whole mentallity. Changing the roles of man and woman, in mind, body, and soul. Which in my opinion is un-natural.\n \n Young gays experience alot of bias/hate without having sex, because they are around other young people who are looking at them as something weird and disgusting. Not because of a certain sexual act, but because of their actions. And how they do not act the way other young males or females act. So other young people make fun of them. Like I said, it is not always about sex, but actions, and mentallities.\n \n \n \nI am simply trying to ask you a very relevant question. I disagree that is it off topic. It is the natural extension of your line of \"reasoning\". No one is asking for \"an endless debate\", just a simple answer, if you would please.\n \n Are there rules here where I am not permitted to ask you a question about your post?\n \n I'll spell it out for you.\n You are asserting that the struggle that black people have, being discriminated against because their race, is a valid one because the characteristic for which they are discriminated is inherent and unchangeable and genetic. You can clearly see what the beef if about. I agree with that as well. \n \n You object that gay people compare their struggle to that of blacks. You do not deny that a struggle exists. These are your words: \n You acknowledge the mistreatment, but feel it is not equivalent to the mistreatment of blacks because gayness is a lifestyle, a behavior that gay people choose to engage in. I believe I have captured your point.\n \n Tell you what. I agree 100%. You are right about that, sister. You betcha. Gayness is a lifestyle, a behavior, a bad habit.\n \n SO, what I am asking is this: what to do about it? \n \n 1. Should gay people just accept the mistreatment and shut up about it, and go on being mistreated?\n 2. Should gay people do something about this to avoid mistreatment? \n If #2, what do you suggest? That is what I am asking.\n\n \n \n No one should just be mistreated. As a matter of fact everyone should have rights. But the rights, each person should have should be within reason and not infringe on anyone else's rights. And that brings me to #2, if someone wants to stop being mistreated then they should not always have to be front and center trying to shame heterosexuals into having to except their lifestyle or else they are evil/hateful. They constantly put themselves out there and are pushing to be front and center, being allowed to so-called kiss in public, and everyone should apporve. Well, if you know that not everyone in society has excepted your lifestyle, then why push buttons?! And cross borders?! Why not practice it in your own environment, where others do not have to be annoyed by it?! But that is not enough, they have to try and make people except them. That is when people get annoyed, and start to think of them as meniscuses' thus the mistreatment. They want us to respect them and thier lifestyle, then except heterosexual lifstyle and stop trying to get us to go along or accept a lifestyle we do not agree with. \n \n \n\n If you can show me anybody who CHOSE to be attracted to the same gender, that would be helpful.\n People who claim \"choice\" have no idea what they are talking about.\n It is funny that you, presumably a straight person, eschew gay people who say that THEY were \"born that way\", and then you turn around and tell GAY people that THEY CHOSE to be gay.\n \n Are you some sort of mind-reader? :xbanghead\n\n \n Do you even listen to what you say?! And yep I'm straight. How did I eschew gay people who say they were born gay?! I replied to the topic about gayness being genetic, and actually you never responded back to me, leaving my post the last one on the thread. So how is that eschewing anything?! I did not avoid anything, I addressed it, and now saying that they choose the lifestyle. I do believe that I'm sticking to my original thought pattern. But what I'm confused about is the fact that you are confused when I in fact made myself very clear. The only thing I can think of is, bad reading comprehension?! Mind reader?! Nope, but imagine the doors that would be open to me if I could read minds, I'd have a new wonderful career ahead of me.emoticon_wow\n \n You want me to show you somebody who chose to be gay?! Right after you show me the genetic proof that twins are gay if one is.emoticon_xgood For now this show is over, I'm just waiting for your response. If one even comes.",

Well, let me brake it down to you then, gay people tend to think that everyone that disapproves of their lifestyle CHOICE is mean, and they try to lash out that it is unjust, because they are not accepted. People do not have to accept something that they do not apporove of. That is disrespectful to straight people. We are tired of you in our face, pushing the boundries, and trying to force us to accept a lifestyle we don't live ourselves. Now if you weren't always whining about not being treated right, or trying to make straight people out to be the bad guys when we don't agree with you, then maybe you'd get alot more respect because you're not being a headache.
