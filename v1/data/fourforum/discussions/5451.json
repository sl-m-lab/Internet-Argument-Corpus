   "The amount of land required for turbines is not as high as you might think, and offshore ones can be built over the horizon. Plus there are some places where wind turbines would improve the view (here's looking at you Morecambe Bay). Estimates here from the BWEA:\n \n \nHow much space do wind turbines require?\n \n The wind is a diffuse form of energy, in common with many renewable sources. A typical wind farm of 20 turbines might extend over an area of 1 square kilometre, but only 1% of the land area would be taken out of use, the remainder can be used for other purposes, such as farming or as natural habitat.\n \n To obtain 10% of our electricity from the wind would require constructing around 12,000 MW of wind energy capacity. Depending on the size of the turbines, they would extend over 80,000 to 120,000 hectares (0.3% to 0.5% of the UK land area). Less than 1% of this (800 to 1,200 hectares) would be used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% could still be used for productive farming. For comparison, between 288,000 to 360,000 hectares (1.2-1.5% of the UK land area) is covered by roads and some 18.5 million hectares (77%) are used for agriculture. \n \n \n This doesn't include the possibilities for offshore farms. Also, there would be a need for redundancy in the system to go above 10% provision from wind.",

It is when you go to expand the system (future usage) that you get into trouble since you have to build the wind turbines, plus the power plant. That is where your prices start heating up.\n \n You will never be carbon neutral as long as fossil fuels are being burned. A transition to fuel crops would be helpful, but in the end will not work due to the low energy density of such crops. It has been tried (dozens of times) and transport and hadling costs for the low desity feedstock kills it every time. \n \n I am on the crest gasfiiaction listserv, as is the guy spearheading the project you refer to.

This same principle is being used for the air born ABM laser mounted on a 747. It can correct for atmospheric distortions.
