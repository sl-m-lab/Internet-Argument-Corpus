   "This recently came up in another thread. Here's a cut and paste from my reply inthat thread:\n \n The American Psychological Association, representing more than 155,000 psychologists, states that children of gay and lesbian parents are at no disadvantage psychologically or socially compared to children of heterosexual parents.\n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics, the nation's leading pediatric authority with 57,000 members, says that children who grow up with gay and/or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional, cognitive, social and sexual functioning as children with straight parents.\n \n The National Association of Social Workers, with nearly 150,000 members, agrees that research on gay and lesbian parenting shows a total absence of pathological findings in their children.\n \n \"Not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents. Indeed, the evidence to date suggests that home environments provided by gay and lesbian parents are as likely as those provided by heterosexual parents to support and enable children's psychosocial growth.\" -- Charles J. Patterson, researcher at the University of Virginia, 2004\n \n \n And there was a study in Norway that showed that children raised by lesbian couples aren't disadvantaged (Halvorsen and Joner, 2001).\n \n \n So no, the kids are by no means disadvantaged.",

At least with a heterosexual couple the lesbian girl would have a mother to identify with.

   "Feel free to explain it then.\n\n \n Er... that's what I'm doing ;)\n \n \n\n No, I am saying that no matter how well adjusted and happy the parents are (and let's assume for the sake of argument that they are heterosexual), there can be issues that have nothing to do with the make up of the family unit.\n\n \n Well, sure, that can happen no matter what. That does not negate any part of my argument because I am not arguing that there would be no problems, just that a child confused about his sexual identity in a home with parents of the same sexual orientation would be less likely to act out because of this fact.\n \n \n \n\n *sigh*\n \n and I feel as if I have been repeating myself continuously.\n\n \n I do apologize if this was addressed, I did not read this entire thread.\n \n \n\n We do not live in a vacuum. If there were no other influences on a child, the you may have a point. But that is not the case. Believe it or not, but children are influenced most by their peers. And no matter the composition of the parental relationship, as long as the parents have a loving and honest relationship, the child will have a good example, gay or not.\n\n \n Well, then, we agree. However, saying what you have said, surely you see my point that it is beneficial to have what I was suggesting. I have never said or thought or intimated it was a requirement for a happy childhood or happy relationships, merely that it is a benefit. The ideal situation would be a couple that can provide both gender perspectives and are biological parents of the child in question.\n \n \n\n The issue of relationships for GLBT people has more to do with the denigration of glbt people, and the denigration of glbt relationships, than with \n what we have for examples at home. It doesn't matter if there is a loving gay relationship at home, as long as ther are positive images of gay people and relationships IN SOCIETY.\n\n \n Society is a benefit, yes, and we should work towards that. Nothing can replace your parents as role-models, though, nor should anything replace them (all else being equal).",

   "\n Behavior in relationships is, at least in part, learned by watching the dynamic of those in relationships around you. Men and women think differently, communicate differently and behave differently. Men act towards other men differently than they behave towards women, and women act differently towards women than they do towards men, and children learn this behavior. Children who are of a different sexual orientation will not have the touchstone on relationship behavior (what I call the \"dynamic\") that a child of the same sexual orientation would. I believe it is foolish in the extreme to argue there could be no benefit from growing up with and learning the dynamic of a heterosexual couple for a heterosexual child and a homosexual couple for a homosexual child (replace \"child\" with \"teen discovering his or her sexuality\" if you prefer)\n \n\n \n You keep saying that there's a difference, but what I'd really like is for you to give specific examples. It seems to me what you're talking about, and I could be wrong, are stereotypical gender roles. Women cry, men don't. Women hug each other, men don't. Men belch, women don't. Etc.

However, I don't see these as things that we really want to pass on to kids. These stereotypes, while real to some degree, are not inherent to gender, but instead taught by society. Women are taught that they're supposed to be demure and emotional, men tough and rugged. I see no value in these roles, and so failure to pass these on to one's kids seems to me to be a good thing.\n \n Of course, I may be completely off base about what you actually meant.

   "We have no way of knowing, of course, but I tend to think that if raised identically, the behavoral differences between a man and a woman would be insignificant, if there were any at all.\n\n \n Then there is no common ground between us on this issue, and there is no point to debate this further.\n \n \n\n The problem is that you're talking so broadly that I have no idea what you're trying to establish, beyond the fact that you don't think gays will make good parents. This seems like a really simple request to me; what, specifically, is so different about how hets interact compared to gays that is so important for a child to learn? If you can't answer it, can you at least go into some detail about why you can't? It seems to me that you're just asserting that there is a problem, without saying what the problem is.\n\n \n I have never said, thought, or intimated that gay parents would be bad parents. I am trying to establish that men and women approach problems and situations differently and think differently and react differently. When interacting with each other, a man and a woman couple would behave and react differently to situations that arise than a man and a man would or a woman and a woman would because men and women approach problems differently.\n \n A child growing up in an environment with a man and a woman will learn what a healthy heterosexual relationship is \"supposed to\" (at least what works) be like, and a child growing up in an environment with a gay couple (either gender) will learn what a healthy homosexual relationship is \"supposed to\" (at least what works) be like. The child will see how each of his or her parents approaches and reacts to the problem, will see how the other parent reacts to the first parents reaction, how arguments are resolved and what compromises work. In short, the dynamic of the couple and how the genders interact. And, since men and women react to situations differently, how this interaction happens will be different between heterosexual and homosexual couples.\n \n Since my premise is that men and women approach and react to situations differently, a heterosexual child in a heterosexual home will learn how a healthy heterosexual couple approaches problems and arrives at solutions while a homosexual child in a homosexual home will learn how a healthy homosexual couple approaches problems and arrives at solutions. However, this is all based upon the premise that men and women think about and approach problems differently. \n \n Thus, my conclusion is that a heterosexual child has an advantage being raised in a heterosexual home rather than a homosexual home. A homosexual child has an advantage in a homosexual home only if the home he is being raised in is of the same gender as the child. A homosexual child still has an advantage in a heterosexual home because that child will still have a parent of the same gender to identify with and model at least some behavior after. I furthermore believe having a role-model in the home in the form of parents is preferable to having a role-model outside the home, even a family friend.\n \n However, since we do not agree that the genders approach or think about problems differently, there is no common ground to work from.",
