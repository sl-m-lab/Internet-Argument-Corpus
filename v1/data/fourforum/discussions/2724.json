   "Scrueball, you are absolutely right about the right of the states to do (essentially) whatever they want because of the tenth amendment because the first amendment only limits what congress can do, not the states. This led to very oppressive state and local governments.\n \n This was all true until the 14th Amendment came along and cases were brought before the courts based on it.\n \n \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n It directly addresses the states and the courts have used it to apply 1st amendment right to the states.",

Just because the Constitution doesn't specifically outlaw something doesn't mean you can. Especially since there are also other laws which matter other than the Constitution.

This is basically saying that if it isn't in the Constitution, the federal government can't claim that they can make laws about it.\n \n And besides that the 10th amendment really isn't talking about freedom, it's talking about powers, as in governing the country.
