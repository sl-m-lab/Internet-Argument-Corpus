   "here's what I've got so far and it makes me slap my head and go DUH!\n \n \n answers:\n \n \nThe closest thing to a straight line on a curved surface is a \"geodesic\". But in general relativity the geodesics that objects follow are not the path through curved space with the shortest length, but rather the path through curved spacetime with the greatest proper time (time as measured by a clock that follows that path). And you can't be \"stationary\" in spacetime, every object is following some path through spacetime (its worldline), even if it is stationary in space (with respect to some coordinate system).\n\n \n\n warped space-time, not just space.\n \n Every object \"moves through time\". So when you trace the geodesic through time, the warped space-time causes them to experience a relative acceleration.\n\n \n So basically, in general relativity you write out equations in 4 dimensional spacetime (written as 4x4 matrices or in differential form, apparently). Since time is always progressing, there can be nothing that is \"stationary\" in spacetime. Even if we were to have an initial state of motionlessness, the two objects must gravitate toward one another because they have to follow the \"worldline\" with the greatest proper time. To me this means that, in effect, the passage of time \"causes\" the gravitation. But only at the initial instant since after that there would then be motion through the other dimensions of spacetime as well.",

   "Since time is always progressing, there can be nothing that is \"stationary\" in spacetime.\n\n \n Not quite right. Time does not progress for a photon. Everything moves through spacetime at the speed of light (speed c). The total motion is divided into travel through the three spatial dimensions on the one hand, and the one time dimension on the other. Anything that travels at the speed of light through the spatial dimensions, from our reference frame, has no leftover speed for the time dimension. \n \n The simplest way to explain gravity is that gravity is spacetime curvature. In the absence of mass (actually, mass-energy) spacetime would be flat. But when mass is present, the mass warps or deforms spacetime near it; and, matter moving through spacetime near the mass is affected by the curvature of the spacetime it is traveling through ... we view this as gravity.\n \n The general idea is often demonstrated using an imperfect analogy. A piece of cellophane wrap is stretched tight across a large opening, such as a of a large bowl. A small marble is then rolled across the \"membrane\"; the marble travels in a straight line, according to Newton's first law.

   "Is that how the speed of light is the same for everything no mater the direction or speed.\n\n \n Look at it this way. Maxwell's equations show that light is an electromagnetic wave, that propagates at speed c: about 3 x 10^8 m/s. This is a law of physics: it describes how the Universe must work.\n \n Physicists then tried to find out with respect to what does light travel at speed c. The idea was that all other waves known up to that point needed a medium to propagate through, and their speed was relative to that medium. For example, sound waves propagate through air and its stated speed - about 1,100 ft/sec - is its speed relative to the air. If the air is moving 10 ft/sec towards you, then sound travels towards you at abuot 1,110 ft/sec; if the air if moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction, then sound travels towards you through it at about 1,090 ft/sec. So physicists held that light's medium was something called the lumeniferous ether, and there began trying to find it. They continued to fail. Worse, they were led to self contradictions ... a clear sign that something was wrong with their reasoning. The problem was that they were sticking to the long held idea that time is absolute. By giving up the absoluteness of time, and space, Einstein eliminated the fictious ether by simply stating that it wasn't needed: light traveled at speed c relative to what? Relative to any observer in uniform motion.\n \n \nBoy i wish there was a better example when i try to explain this to my mother as far as she can get is the ball on the cellofane( or trampoline) is \"being puld towards the center by graviy\" and i dont think she'll get past that.\n\n \n Stress that in the imperfect analogy the ball is not being deflected from its straightline course so much by gravity pulling it into the depression as much as it is by the shape of the cellophane. \n \n It gets one step farther away, but imagine two scenarios. In one, a Matchbox car runs along a flat strip of Matchbox track ... it travels in a straight line. In the other, the track is curled up into a loop and the car navigates through that loop. Even though gravity is pulling the car down towards the Earth's center at every instant, the car follows the path of the track and heads upwards in an arc (before completing the loop). The key part here is the shape of the track, which determines how the car will move. Similarly, it is the shape of the cellphane membrane that determines how the marble will travel. And that analogy helps show that it is the shape of spacetime that determines how matter moves through it.\n \n \nIf time does not progress for a photon how does that work in terms of speed=distance/time or is it multiplied by time. Anyways how would this work?\n\n \n From our frame of reference, the same as always. It's when we consider things from the photon's point of view that time doesn't pass for it. In Einstein's special relativity, time passes at different rates in two reference frames in relative motion with respect to one another. So if someone rockets past Earth in a spaceship, and the same two events are considered from both our \"at rest\" reference frame and their \"moving\" reference frame, the time interval between those events will be different. So time is not an absolute: it is relative. \n \n Distance is also not an absolute. It is only the combination of space and time into one 'fabric' ... spacetime ... that is absolute. That is, all observers agree on the spacetime interval between two events, but not on the space or the time between them.

If clock B sees clock A move by and concludes that clock A is \"running slow\", why can't clock A claim to see clock B go by and conclude that B is \"running slow\"? It can! There's no contradiction, because of another remarkable implication of the principle of relativity: Two events that are simultaneous (i.e., that occur at the same time) in one frame of reference are not simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first. It is this relativity of simultaneity that allows two observers in relative motion to see each other's clocks \"run slow\", without contradiction. (emphasis added, Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics for Non-Scientists: 2nd Edition) \n \n\n \n \n Let's take a first look at how the relativity of simultaneity resolves the APPARENT contradiction. \n \n First, we have to acknowledge the relativity of simultaneity: here, two events that are simultaneous in one inertial reference frame are not simultaneous in a second inertial frame moving in a straight line at constant speed between those same two events. How does this come into play? That will take a bit of explaining.\n \n We have two inertial reference frames and two events. In the example that will appear in the quote, there is a spaceship traveling from Earth to a star. The two reference fames are the Earth-star frame and the spaceship frame. In the Earth-star frame the two events are the spaceship leaving Earth and the spaceship arriving at the star; in the spaceship frame the two events are the Earth leaving and the star arriving. \n \n Let's start by considering things from the Earth-star frame. In the Earth-star frame, the spaceship is moving from one event to the other, so needs only one clock to measure elapsed time, because it's one clock is present at both events. No problem with synchronizing one clock with itself. However, since in the Earth-star frame the Earth and star are at rest with respect to each other and with the two events, which are spatially separate - one at the Earth and the other at the star - two different clocks are needed: one at each event. Now, in order to measure the elapsed time between the two events the two clocks need to be synchronized. This can be achieved in a number of ways, one of which is to position a light source half-way between the two clocks and send out a flash of light: when a clock receives the light it sets it's clock to 0, and since the distance to both clocks is equal and no length contraction occurs, the light travel time will be the same to both clocks ... precise synchronization. So synchronizing the two clocks is not a problem ... or is it? It is! \n \n Let's switch to considering this from the spaceship's reference frame. The spaceship's one-clock is moving in a straight line at constant speed relative to and between the two events, therefore, because of the relativity of simultaneity, the two events involved in synchronizing the two clocks in the Earth-star reference frame cannot be simultaneous in the spaceship's reference fame. Consequently, the two clocks in the Earth-star frame, though synchronized in the Earth-star frame itself, cannot be synchronized from the spaceship's reference frame. \n \n With that setup ...\n \n \n\"Turn back to Figure 10.4, where (a) shows the situation in the Earth-star frame when the ship passes Earth and (b) shows the situation in this frame when the ship passes the star. In this frame all the clocks read 0 as the ship passes Earth (Figure 10.4a). Later, as the ship passes the star, its clock reads 15 years while Earth and star clocks - which are synchronized in the Earth-star frame - both read 25 years (Figure 10.4b). The interpretation of the clock readings in the Earth-star frame is that 25 years have elapsed in that frame but only 15 years have elapsed in the ship frame because the ship clock runs slow.\n \n Now look again at Figure 10.5, where (a) shows the situation in the ship frame when Earth passes the ship and (b) shows the situation in this frame when the star passes the ship. As in the Earth-star frame, both ship clock and Earth clock read 0 as Earth and ship pass. But in the ship frame, the clocks in the Earth-star frame aren't synchronized; in fact, the star clock already reads 16 years when Earth and ship pass. Later, as the star and ship pass, the ship clock has advanced from 0 to 15 years. The star clock, running slow from the viewpoint of the ship frame, has advanced only 9 years. But since it was [16 years] ahead to begin with, it now reads 25 years. The interpretation of the clock readings in the ship frame is that 15 years have elapsed in that frame while only 9 years have elapsed in the Earth-star frame.\n \n Yet observers in both frames agree about what the clocks actually read whenever two clocks are right next to each other so observers can unambiguously compare times. In particular, observers in both frames agree that 15 years elapse on the ship's one clock. They also agree that the reading of the Earth clock at the Earth/ship passing differs by 25 years from the reading of the star clock at the star-ship passing. What they disagree about is the interpretation of this 25-year interval. To observers in the Earth-star frame the clocks at Earth and star are synchronized, so 25 years is a legitimately measured time between two events. To observers on the ship, Earth-star clocks are running slow, and advance only 9 years between the two events. The 25-year difference in clock readings occurs because the star clock is ahead of the Earth clock by 16 years.\" (Simply Einstein: Relativity Demystified, Richard Wolfson, W. W.

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/01/science/01prof.html\n \n Scientist at Work | Lisa Randall\n On Gravity, Oreos and a Theory of Everything \n By DENNIS OVERBYE\n Published: November 1, 2005\n The portal to the fifth dimension, sadly, is closed.\n \n There used to be an ice cream parlor in the student center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And it was there, in the summer of 1998, that Lisa Randall, now a professor of physics at Harvard and a bit of a chocoholic, and Raman Sundrum, a professor at Johns Hopkins, took an imaginary trip right out of this earthly plane into a science fiction realm of parallel universes, warped space and otherworldly laws of physics.\n \n They came back with a possible answer to a question that has tormented scientists for decades, namely why gravity is so weak compared with the other forces of nature: in effect, we are borrowing it from another universe. In so doing, Dr. Randall and Dr. Sundrum helped foment a revolution in the way scientists think about string theory - the vaunted \"theory of everything\" - raising a glimmer of hope that coming experiments may actually test some of its ineffable sounding concepts.\n \n Their work undermined well-worn concepts like the idea that we can even know how many dimensions of space we live in, or the reality of gravity, space and time.\n \n The work has also made a star and an icon of Dr. Randall. The attention has been increased by the recent publication to laudatory reviews of her new book, \"Warped Passages, Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions,\" A debate broke out on the physics blog Cosmic Variance a few weeks ago about whether it was appropriate, as a commentator on NPR had said, to say she looked like Jodie Foster.\n \n \"How do we know we live in a four-dimensional universe?\" she asked a crowd who filled the Hayden Planetarium on a stormy night last week.\n \n \"You think gravity is what you see. We're always just looking at the tail of things.\"\n \n Although it is the unanswerable questions that most appeal to her now, it was the answerable ones that drew her to science, especially math, as a child, the middle of three daughters of a salesman for an engineering firm, and a teacher, in Fresh Meadows, Queens. \"I really liked the fact that it had definite answers,\" Dr. Randall said.\n \n At Stuyvesant High School, where she was in the same class as Brian Greene, the future Columbia string theorist and best-selling author, she was the first girl to serve as captain of the school's math team, and she won the famous Westinghouse Science Talent Search competition with a project about complex numbers. She went on to Harvard where she stayed until 1987 when she emerged with a Ph.D. in physics. \n \n Those were heady times in physics. Fired by the dream of a unified theory of everything, theorists flocked to string theory, which envisioned the fundamental elements of nature as tiny wriggling strings.\n \n Dr. Randall, however, resisted this siren call, at least for a while. For one thing, physicists thought it would take a particle accelerator 10 million billion times as powerful as anything on earth to produce an actual string and test the theory.\n \n String theory also stubbornly requires space-time to have 10 dimensions, not the 4 (3 of space and 1 of time) that we experience. Preferring to stay closer to testable reality, Dr. Randall was drawn to a bottom-up approach to theoretical physics, trying to build models that explain observed phenomena and hoping to discover principles with wider application. But Dr. Randall and string theory had their own kismet.\n \n In the mid-90's, theorists discovered that the theory was even richer than its founders had thought, describing not just strings but so-called branes, as in membranes, of all dimensions. Our own universe could be such a brane, an island of three dimensions floating in a sea of higher dimension, like a bubble in the sea. But there could be membranes with five, six, seven or more dimensions coexisting and mingling like weird cosmic soap bubbles in what theorists sometimes call the multiverse.\n \n \"The stuff we're really famous for was really lucky in a way,\" Dr. Randall said.\n \n In the summer of 1998, after postdoctoral stints at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley, she was a tenured M.I.T. professor ready to move to Princeton. She wondered then whether parallel universes could help solve a vexing problem with a favorite theories of particle physicists. . . .",

   "So if you use the frame of reference as a point on the ground say and the object is travelling at .999c north and then you have another frame of reference wich is the object travelling south at the speed of light, the point of reference on the ground and the object travelling south are both travelling at the same velocity relative to the object travelling north, but the velocity difference between the point of reference on the ground and the object travelling south is still the speed of light?!@#$%\n\n \n No, not quite. Three reference frames here, one one the ground, one on the object going north, which we'll call N, and one on the object going south, S. The point on the ground is G. Relative to G, both N and S are travelling .999c, in opposite directions. Relative to N, G is moving at .999c towards N, and S is moving at .9999995c. The formula is U = (u+v)/(1+((u*v)/(c*c)))\n \n The critical point, in fact the whole point of relativity, is that time and space are different when travelling near the speed of light. It isn't a matter of perception, it isn't that time and space seem different. A meter stick is actually a different lenght if its travelling at .9c. A minute actually takes a different amount of time to pass on a watch going .99c when compared to a stationary one. Naturally, if time and length act differently than velocity (L/T) also acts differently.\n \n \n\n And your other point about never reaching the speed of light. Does this mean that velocity is an asemtope? I wonder in theory if you could convert enough matter into energy in the universe to be able to propel two particles awayfrom each other and achieve the speed of light?\n\n Yes to one, no to two. Yes, the speed of light is the asymptote on the velcoity curve. No, you can never, ever, ever get a bit of matter up to the speed of light, no matter how much energy you dump in. Never. Major fundamental point here, can't emphasize this enough. Matter can not ever go at the speed of light, no matter what you do.",

I know this because light is affected by gravity and gravitational attraction is a function of mass, not energy.\n\n \n Nope, photons don't have mass, not in the conventional sense. It is true that gravity will bend light, but it does so according to relativistic models, not Newtonian ones that depend on mass. Here's a link to an article that can explain it better than I can.\n \n http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/light_mass.html",
