   "Remember the fruit loop Wasilla witchfinder general ? He's the tip of a lethal iceberg.\n \n \" ........ There have been Christians in Nigeria since the 19th century. While the majority hold moderate beliefs, an extreme minority has harnessed existing superstitions about black magic and turned them into a lucrative trade. Up to 15,000 children in Nigeria's Akwa Ibom and Cross River states alone have been branded witches by rogue pastors, who charge large sums to \"exorcise\" them.\n \n Sam Itauma runs the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network (CRARN), a makeshift shelter and school in Eket for 150 children who have been deemed to be possessed. The children bear the horrific scars of witch-branding: acid burns, machete wounds and severe malnutrition. \n \n A man from Ibaka in Akwa Ibom, who calls himself \"the Bishop\", has made a fortune conducting \"exorcisms\" of children, claiming that they are possessed by the devil and eat human flesh. He told an investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches that he had killed \"up to 110 people\" who were identified as witches. ........ \" \n \n \n Scandal of the children killed for 'witchcraft' - Africa, World - The Independent",
