   "http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Al-Qaida-BinLaden.html\n \n \nJanuary 19, 2006\n Arab TV Airs Audiotape Said to Be From bin Laden \n By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Al-Jazeera aired an audiotape purportedly from Osama bin Laden on Thursday, saying al-Qaida is making preparations for attacks in the United States but offering a truce to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n The voice on the tape said heightened security measures in the United States are not the reason there have been no attacks there since the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijackings. \n \n Instead, the reason is \"because there are operations that need preparations, and you will see them,\" he said. \n \n \"Based on what I have said, it is better not to fight the Muslims on their land,\" he said. \"We do not mind offering you a truce that is fair and long-term. ... So we can build Iraq and Afghanistan ... there is no shame in this solution because it prevents wasting of billions of dollars ... to merchants of war.\" \n \n The speaker did not give conditions for a truce in the excerpts aired by the Arab broadcaster. \nHmmm, Abramoff troubles, DeLay problems, Alito problems, problems passing the Patriot law, yes, it's time for Osama bin Laden to make an appearance, besides elections this year and the Republicans appear to be in trouble, yeppers, bring out our old pal Osama again and don't forget to pay him this time--you still have the bucks that Abramoff gave us, don't you?",

America is slated to begin pulling troops out in the near future. Bin Laden knows this. \n \n\n \n He also knows that mutual defense treaties are already in place between Iran and Iraq, and that the new leaders in Iraq are not only islamic fundamentalists, but Iranian puppets. The secular Iraq that once was...a major stumbling block in AQs goal of establishing a new Caliphet in the middle east is gone. Iran, Iraq, and Syria are united, the US has been kicked out of their bases in Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan has essentially promised to nuke anybody that atacks Iran.\n \n They have certainly won this round. \n \n Looking at Al-jazeeras coverage provides a little more insight:\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/593298A0-3C1A-4EB4-B29D-EA1A9678D922.htm\n \n \nThe voice, attributed to Bin Laden and apparently addressing Americans, said: \"The new operations of al-Qaida has not happened not because we could not penetrate the security measures. It is being prepared and you'll see it in your homeland very soon.\"\n\n \n If he is not just bluffing, the truce goes hand in hand with the threat. Muslim battle rules. You must first give your enemy a chance to surrender before you strike a major blow or engage in a major battle.\n \n \nMore blustering flatulence from a blowhard (maybe Osama, maybe not) who has just suffered a severe setback in Pakistan.\n\n \n Refresh me here. Severe setback? We missed our intended target, possible killed as many as 10 militants, killed quite a few women and children, and thousands of Pakistanis marching in the streets yelling \"DEATH TO AMERICA\", and burnign American flags and effigies of George Bush and uncle sam. Was there a victory I am unaware of?",
