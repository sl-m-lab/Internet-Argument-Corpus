   "Professor David Lewis Schaefer, professor of political science at Holy Cross College and author of Illiberal Justice: John Rawls Vs. the American Political Tradition (University of Missouri, 2007), recently critiqued the economic philosophy of John Rawls, longtime professor of philosophy at Harvard, in a Wall Street Journal commentary. Schaefer claims that in Rawls' most widely read book, A Theory of Justice (1971), Rawls professed to summarize the requirements of institutional justice in two principles. \nThe first principle mandated that the \"equal basic liberties\" of all citizens be maximized. The second (the \"difference principle\") ordained that inequalities in social and economic goods were allowable only to the extent that they improved the condition of the \"least advantaged\" members of society.\n\n \n Schaefer goes on to speculate:\n \nNor could Rawls demonstrate that any particular level of economic inequality violated his difference principle: If (as may well be the case) allowing corporate executives to earn annual incomes of tens of millions of dollars helps to generate the economic dynamism that raises Americans' living standards, including those of the poor, such inequalities are allowable.\n\n I quibble.\n \n I quibble first on the grounds that CEO compensation seems to be, in many instances, totally unrelated to how a CEO performs on the job. Incompetent CEOs who have run corporations into the ground have been given enormous \"Golden Parachutes.\"\n \n It is hard to see, in cases such as that, how compensating CEOs with tens of millions of dollars generates economic dynamism for the people who are made jobless by the ruination of a corporation, the employees who lose billions of dollars in failed pension funds pirated by corporations who move offshore with their booty and leave the corporate ruins of CEO mismanagement for a governmental cleanup.",

I do see logical connections between good corporate policy and the general health of the economy. I do not see any detectable link between good corporate policy and high CEO salaries.

Just as we have with sports, we've let supply and demand, along with the desire to be the best, escalate the cost of so-called \"key players\" to a ridiculous level. This doesn't help the economy in a significant way. The money would be better spent to raise the compensation given to WORKER BEES.",

Bare in mind, A government asks its people to save only when they are overspending. The government doesn't want to pay inflated prices which causes them to print more. A positive feed back loop that can cause run away inflation. This is why during a war, the government does everything it can to cause saving. They are spending their back sides off.\n \n As far as giving tax brakes to the wealthy. Yes investment can cause expansion, but don't you think China has enough plants at the moment? During the depression we still had the wealthy, they didn't disappear. We socialized roads and parks. Threw money into the economy and that created jobs. The odd thing about the massive socialization? It helped Business no end. Highways are great for business. G.E. making more money has no effect on jobs or salaries, it never has. The forces of supply and demand determine salaries.",
