Why don't you have the Eucharist - that's in the Bible!\n \n \n The churches are divided, too much unbiblical teachings going on there get out of the churches.\n \n Do I have a Minister, again, I only listen to Preachers, that has the word of Truth in them, www.overcomerminstry.com \n and a Female minister is a Sin BTW, women are under man, if you want to read the whole serman, I can post it.\n \n \nA TREATSIE ON\n GOD'S ORDER FOR WO-MAN!\n \n \"BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW, THAT THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN IS CHRIST; AND THE \n HEAD OF THE WOMAN IS THE MAN; AND THE HEAD OF CHRIST IS GOD\" (I Cor. 11:3).\n \n As a woman, wife, and Christian, the Bible does declare WHO woman is; WHAT \n she is; and what her place is in God's order. \n This truth has largely been obscured by the spirit of antichrist in the \n world, to the point that today's religious bodies teach man's traditional \n doctrines as truth, and are either ignorant of the truth, or are afraid to take \n a stand on the issue.\n The nature and sin of Satan was rebellion; and it is this nature we \n inherited. This rebellion, coupled with the sin of pride, presents a formidable \n foe to the truth of God.\n When this truth is one that is so closely related to our daily lives and \n inter-relationships, as this subject of the status of wo-man in God's order, \n then it becomes even more difficult to see, or accept.\n Man, with the assistance of Satan, has been promoting the idea that woman \n is as good as man (good as what?), is equal to man, has the same rights as man, \n etc. \n First of all, in the world's customs, they may accept this; but this is \n not for God's people, nor for His work on earth. \n Certain groups and organizations, as the \"National Organization for \n Women\", as well as blinded politicians, have and are pushing this idea as a way \n of life for all women.\n Most ministers fearfully go along with the tide and accept this false \n teaching. Why? Due to ignorance of God's word, and because of a fear of \n polarizing their people, the subject is \"taboo\".\n \n What does the word of God say? We must go back to the beginning, the Genesis of \n creation, in order to start on a proper foundation of truth.\n Perhaps it would be in order to inject another pertinent fact here: All \n aspects of the work of God is a THEOCRACY. That means God is in supreme control; \n He runs all things; everything is done according to His will.\n Nowhere do the scriptures support the idea or practice of \"democracy\". Man \n has nothing to say about how or the way things are done. The idea of man voting \n for a pastor, or voting on the issues of doctrine and beliefs are outlandish as \n well as being out of God's order; and since this procedure is a substitute for \n God's order, it then becomes \"antichrist\" in nature and action. The creation of \n man, and thus of wo-man, is an interesting truth. Genesis 1:26 states, \"LET US \n MAKE MAN (Hebrew = \"adham\", or \"adhamah\" = ground, earth-born; ruddy) IN OUR \n IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS, AND LET THEM HAVE DOMINION OVER...\"\n Notice that in the creation of man, all of mankind was viewed, including \n the wo-man. Verse 27: \n \"SO GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, IN THE IMAGE OF GOD CREATED HE HIM, \n MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM.\"\n He did not just create Adam, the male, but He also created the female in \n Adam. The man was both male and female. Genesis 5:1-2 makes this very clear. \n Verse 2 reads:\n \"MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM; AND BLESSED THEM, AND CALLED THEIR NAME ADAM \n IN THE DAY WHEN THEY WERE CREATED.\"\n However, we learn through the word of God that man had no helper,\n \"AND THE LORD GOD SAID, IT IS NOT GOOD THAT THE MAN SHOULD BE ALONE; I \n WILL MAKE HIM AN HELP MEET FOR HIM\" (Gen. 2:18).\n Thus the process of making a \"female helper\", the wo-man, began. A helper \n is one who helps, or assists. Usually, an unskilled worker who assists a skilled \n one. One who takes orders and does as requested. Not a, or, the boss.\n Now since this \"new creation\" was to be a helper, God knew from whence she \n would come - from Adam's side. No, not to be equal with him as some teach, but \n from the supporting structure of Adam's body, his ribs.\n Were it not for the ribs which attach to the spine and then join in the \n front of the skeleton, man would not be able to stand erect.\n Thus the woman was taken from the side of man, from one of his ribs; from \n that part of his body that symbolized her relationship to him, his helper; \n supporting him, being part of him.\n God then proceeded to remove most of the female attributes from Adam, and \n incorporated them into this `new' being who was separate from Adam, whom he \n recognized as part of himself when God brought her to him.\n \"AND ADAM SAID, THIS IS NOW BONE OF MY BONES (the rib), AND FLESH OF MY \n FLESH (his attributes and nature): SHE SHALL BE CALLED WOMAN, BECAUSE SHE WAS \n TAKEN OUT OF MAN\" (Gen. 2:23). \n In the Hebrew, the name \"wo-man\" is \"ishshah\" (female man); \"ish\" (man, or \n manward), and the \"ah\" being that of direction.\n Thus wo-man means, taken out of a man, or her husband, with her \n destination being to return to her man, or husband, and become part of him. A \n woman is not complete apart from her husband, or the man. She is part of him!\n Because of her unique position in creation, being the bearer of the young, \n she was called Eve, \"a\n life-spring\". She was to be, and is, the mother of the human race.\n Adam went on to say she had been taken out of man, and for this reason MAN \n would leave his father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they twain \n shall become \"one\" flesh (again). \n Note that nowhere in these scriptures is it said that a man and woman \n would live together, and each going his or her own way.\n When an incomplete female joins herself to the man chosen, and desires to \n become part of him, she assumes HIS name, thus admitting her identity with him.\n She becomes his \"MRS.\", wife, helper, companion, sharing all \"his\" life. \n She becomes the \"female\" part of the man he lost in the beginning in Adam, so \n the two again become one.\n As Paul stated in our introductory scripture, Christ is the head of the \n man, man is the head of woman, and God is the head of Christ. To the same degree \n that man is to be subject to Christ, or Christ to God is the woman to be subject \n to man.\n We notice an interesting fact here in the statement \"and the head of \n Christ is God.\" The Holy Spirit did not lead Paul to state what we would have \n thought was obvious... \"the head of the Son is the Father.\" NO! For the Son was \n equal with the Father. Only in His position as the Christ, the anointed One, is \n He subject to God.\n \n In the 3rd chapter of Genesis, we discover the events that dictated the status \n of the woman. Let us look at I Timothy 2:14 for further enlightment. Paul \n states:\n \"AND ADAM WAS NOT DECEIVED (Greek \"APATE\" = beguiled, cheat, a false \n impression), BUT THE WOMAN BEING DECEIVED (\"EXAPATAO\" = beguile thoroughly, to \n deceive wholly) WAS IN THE TRANSGRESSION\" (always a breach of and thus from \n God's through Adam).\n Then she overstepped her authority. She went beyond her boundary, her \n place under Adam. She got out of line, and took upon herself an authority she \n did not rightfully have, thus assuming the headship that was rightfully Adam's.\n These then were the errors committed by Eve; and of which many women today \n are guilty:\n 1) She overstepped her position; crossing the boundry or limitations set for \n her.\n 2) She did not submit to the headship of her husband.\n 3) She entered a forbidden area of communication with the enemy which is the \n responsibility of the head, man, the priest of the family (Eve as a type of the \n \"soul\", cannot engage in \"spiritual\" activities except in association with the \n spirit, which is the \"link\" to the spirit world. In this case, Adam was her \n \"spirit\", to whom she refused to submit).\n As a result of these activities, Eve was \"deceived\" (in the Hebrew this \n word means \"to outwit\", and the enemy will outwit you every time if you confront \n him outside of the Spirit). And being deceived, she was persuaded to partake of \n the forbidden fruit.\n Realistically, had Eve submitted to the headship of her husband, she would \n have referred the serpent to Adam, letting him assume the responsibility of the \n whole matter.\n How much better things would be if we all would follow God's order as He \n has instituted it. However, we have been \"out of order\" for so long and become \n so used to a lower level of blessing and way of life in the Lord, we are unaware \n of what our life could be.\n We always blame the devil, or the world, or sin, or \"things\" for keeping \n us \"down\", and away from the full benefits of God's promises, not being aware, \n or willing to admit that it is we ourselves and our rebellion and disobedience \n to God's will and divine order that hinders.\n In the case of Adam and Eve, while the above is true, we must not forget \n that THIS OCCURENCE IN THE GARDEN WAS THE WILL OF GOD! IT WAS PART OF HIS PLAN \n FOR MAN, AND THE MAKING OF SONS FOR HIMSELF.\n As a result of these occurances in the garden, God spelled out \n disciplinary actions against those involved.\n The serpent was condemned to crawling upon his belly and eating of the \n dust, and being a perpetual enemy of mankind.\n Adam was to earn his living by the sweat of his face, the ground being \n cursed to bring forth briars and thistles instead of the herbs of the field, and \n in pain he would eat thereof, until, being made from the dust of the earth, he \n would return to it. Thus the pronouncement of death came upon all mankind.\n To Eve, He said she would suffer pain in pregnancy and childbirth, and her \n longing or desire would be to her husband, and he would rule over her.\n UNTIL THE MATTER OF SIN HAS BEEN COMPLETELY ELIMINATED, ALL OF THESE \n CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. We see today that this is so. The serpent \n still crawls upon his belly, eating dust, and is an enemy of man. The earth \n still produces thorns and thistles for man instead of bountiful harvests of what \n is planted, or of the natural herb, and man still continues to earn his living \n by the sweat of his face. Women are still having pain and discomfort in their \n peculiar \"womanly\" functions, as well as pregnancy and childbirth, (see Editor's \n note) and their desire is still toward their husbands, as witness the \n conversation and actions of our young ladies as they enter the puberty years; \n all they can talk of is boyfriends, getting married, having children, their own \n home, etc. And, whether it is acceptable or not, the husband is still to rule \n over her.\n \n Notice, that in none of these instances, has the conversion of an \n individual eliminated any of these sentences pronounced at the beginning by God.\n A Christian man still has to contend with thistles and thorns, and sweat. \n A Christian woman still contends with the same \"physical problems\" as before, \n and still has children in pain. A Christian woman still has her desire to, or \n for, her husband, and she is still ruled over by her husband.\n Nowhere is it stated, nor evident, that becoming a Christian removes any \n of the judgments set by the Lord! Not until SIN, as the governing principle, \n Adam's sin or nature, is done away with, including death, will these things \n cease to have meaning in our lives.\n Those dedicated, Christian women who have seen this truth and practice it, \n have found a source of joy, and peace and contentment unknown to other women. \n They have a freedom and happiness that is undescribed.\n \n The complete passage of Scripture in I Timothy 2:8-15, has much to say on \n this subject. \n In verse 9 the qualifications of women from dress to attitude are \n discussed. They are to be adorned with clothing orderly (Greek \"KOSMIOS\", from \n \"KOSMOS\" = order; thus orderly and decent; modest). \n Along with this modesty and orderliness, she was to be in sobriety (Greek \n \"SOPHROSUNE\" = denotes soundness of mind, sober; \n sound in judgment practically expresses the meaning).\n It is that habitual inner self-government, with its constant rein on all \n the passions and desires which would hinder the temptation to these from \n arising, or at all events from arising in such strength as would overbear the \n checks and barriers which \"aidos\" [shamefacedness] opposed to it [Vine's Exp. \n Dict.]\n This was to be her adornment, not the plaiting (of hair in fancy hairdos) \n and gold or pearls or costly raiment.\n Paul goes on to say in verse 10:\n \"BUT (WHICH BECOMETH WOMEN PROFESSING GODLINESS <Greek \"THEOSEBEIA\" = \n fear or reverence of God<) WITH GOOD WORKS.\"\n THIS is her adornment! In vs. 11, Paul discusses her actions: \n \"LET THE WOMAN LEARN IN SILENCE (Greek \"HESUCHIOS\" = quietness, but \n indicates a tranquility arising from within, causing no disturbance to others) \n WITH ALL SUBJECTION\" (Greek \"HUPOTASSO\" = a military term to rank under; denotes \n to put in subjection, to subject. To subject oneself to obey; to be under \n obedience).\n Verse 12:\n \"BUT I SUFFER NOT A WOMAN TO TEACH, NOR TO USURP AUTHORITY (Greek \n \"AUTHENTEO\" = from \"AUTO\" = self; and a lost noun, \"HENTES\" = working; to \n exercise authority on one's own account; domineering) OVER THE MAN, BUT TO BE IN \n SILENCE.\"\n Notice that the meaning of the word \"OVER\" can also be interchanged with \n the word \"OF\". They are interchangeable, in that they, either one or both, are \n inserted in the text, not having the actual word for either listed. Thus the \n meaning can be either \"assuming man's authority\" (and thus his headship), or to \n try and assume authority \"OVER A MAN\", (which is in truth the same thing).\n Actually when a woman gets up to minister the Word of God publicly before \n a mixed audience, as an elder to teach, she is assuming the authority \"of\" as \n well as \"over\" a man.\n Paul goes on to reveal the manner by which God has established for a woman \n to be saved (Greek \"SOTERIA\" denotes deliverance, preservation, salvation. \n Material, personal and spiritual. Includes present salvation, and future \n deliverance of believers. The fulfillment of their hope, both now and their \n ultimate and final salvation) which was \"in childbearing\" (encompassing the \n duties of motherhood), \"IF THEY CONTTINUE IN FAITH AND LOVE (agape) AND HOLINESS \n (Greek \"HAGAISMOS\" = separated to God, holy) WITH SOBRIETY\" (see Editor's note).\n \n In Ephesians 5:21-29, the Apostle Paul clarifies this husband-wife \n relationship in contrast to Christ and His church. He starts out by instructing \n all the saints to be in subjection to one another in the fear of God. Then he \n adds a special note to the women:\n \"WIVES, SUBMIT YOURSELVES UNTO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS, AS UNTO THE LORD. FOR \n THE HUSBAND IS THE HEAD OF THE WIFE, EVEN AS CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH: \n AND HE IS THE SAVIOUR OF THE BODY.\"\n We thus see the extent of the wife-husband relationship. To the same \n extent that the Lord is head of the Church, and also the saviour of the body, \n indicating a total reliance upon, and submission to Him for all things, \n spiritual and physical, so the wife is to rely upon, and be in submission to her \n husband. Being one he (the husband) is the saviour (?) of her body.\n In verse 24 the word states: \n \"THEREFORE AS THE CHURCH IS SUBJECT UNTO CHRIST, SO LET THE WIVES BE TO \n THEIR OWN HUSBANDS IN EVERY THING.\"\n \"HUSBANDS, LOVE (agape) YOUR WIVES, EVEN AS CHRIST ALSO LOVED (a form of \n the word agape, meaning to value, esteem to delight in, manifest genuine concern \n for, be faithful towards, to delight in) [Husbands you have a tremendous \n obligation to that woman who consented to become part of you and your life.] THE \n CHURCH, AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR IT;\n THAT HE MIGHT SANCTIFY AND CLEANSE (cleansing: \"KATHARISMOS\" = denotes \n cleansing, both the action and results; purification, cleanse from sins) IT WITH \n THE WASHING (the word washing is: \"LOUTRON\" = a bath, a laver; is used of the \n word of God as the instrument of spiritual cleansing; a brazen laver sat outside \n in the outer court of the tabernacle so the priests could wash themselves during \n their ministry of offering sacrifices Eph. 5:26; Tit. 3:5 speaks of the washing \n of regeneration) OF WATER BY THE WORD.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n Paul has more to say on this subject in Colossians 3:18-19: \n \"WIVES, SUBMIT YOURSELVES UNTO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS, AS IT IS FIT \n (\"ANEKO\" = arrived at, pertained to, one's duty, as it is fit) IN THE LORD.\n HUSBANDS, LOVE YOUR WIVES, AND BE NOT BITTER (Greek \"PIKRAINO\" = to cut, \n XXXXX, to embitter, irritate or make bitter. Also refers to jealousy) AGAINST \n THEM.\"\n Here again, while we may point out the duties of the wives to be in \n submission to their husbands, and there is no excuse for their failure to obey \n God's word in this matter; yet, THE HUSBANDS HAVE AN EQUALLY DEMANDING CODE OF \n CONDUCT TOWARD THEIR WIVES, WHICH GOD WILL REQUIRE OF THEM. THEY HAVE AN \n OBLIGATION TO BE IN SUBMISSION TO CHRIST AND THE WILL OF GOD.\n \n When husbands and wives equally fulfill their God-required \n responsibilities to each other, marriage will become the wondrous event God \n intended it to be; The union of the male and female counterparts into ONE \n person. \n Many wives use the misconduct of their husbands to justify their failure \n to walk in God's order, yet this must not be. There is no excuse for failure to \n obey the command of the Lord.\n The 18th verse of this scripture sets all the boundaries needed. Now some \n women will excuse their disobedience due to the nature of the obedience \n required. However note that the word says, \"as it is fit in the Lord\".\n Nowhere does God require obedience to the point of sin. If the husband, in \n his disobedience to Christ, sets forth a \"law\" for his wife that conflicts with \n God's law, and would result in sin, or a disobedience to the word of God, then \n obedience to God must take precedence. As Peter said, \n \"...WHETHER IT BE RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD TO HEARKEN UNTO YOU MORE THAN \n UNTO GOD, JUDGE YE\" (Acts 4:19).\n In such cases the husband has ceased to be a scriptural husband. Yet, in \n other matters the wife still is in obedience to her husband, for as Peter says \n in I Pet. 3:1-6:\n \"LIKEWISE, YE WIVES, BE IN SUBJECTION TO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS; THAT, IF ANY \n OBEY NOT THE WORD, THEY ALSO MAY WITHOUT THE WORD (no nagging) BE WON BY THE \n CONVERSATION OF THE WIVES.\"\n \n In the next verses Peter uses almost the same words as Paul did in I \n Timothy 2 regarding the dress and conduct of the woman. Then in verse 5 we read:\n \"FOR AFTER THIS MANNER IN THE OLD TIME THE HOLY WOMEN ALSO, WHO TRUSTED IN \n GOD, ADORNED THEMSELVES, BEING IN SUBJECTION UNTO THEIR OWN HUSBANDS: \n EVEN AS SARA OBEYED ABRAHAM, CALLING HIM LORD: WHOSE DAUGHTERS YE ARE, AS \n LONG AS YE DO WELL, AND ARE NOT AFRAID WITH ANY AMAZEMENT\" (Greek \"PTOESIS\" = \n terror. Any unusual events as to cause fear or terror - Vine's): \n Christian women become, in a sense, children, or daughters of Sarah, and \n are to follow her example and life \"of demure submission\" to the point of \n recognizing her husband as not only her head, but also her lord (or master, as \n the word means). \n This attitude is certainly a far cry from that antichrist spirit that is \n so prevelant in the world today. Yet, it is the requirement for women if they \n are to attain full salvation and enjoy God's favor. These will be the \"daughters \n of God\" (II Cor. 6:18).\n \n Paul went on to say:\n \"AND ADAM WAS NOT DECEIVED, BUT THE WOMAN BEING DECEIVED WAS IN THE \n TRANSGRESSION\" (I Tim. 2:14).\n As a result, as we have seen in Genesis 3, the woman's longing would be to \n (for) her husband and he would rule over her. This has been confirmed over and \n over in the New Testament.\n Since we mentioned the \"daughters of God\" above, perhaps here we should \n discuss this little known truth as related in II Corinthians 6:18. Note that the \n Lord is speaking of two classes of His own.\n One, is the class of \"sons\", or in the Greek \"HUIOS\". These are His \n chosen, predestined from the foundation of the kosmos. The other class which is \n listed in the same category, is that of His \"daughters\", which in the Greek is \n \"THUGATER\" = a daughter; used of a natural relationship, also of a spiritual \n relationship in the sense of the practical realization of acceptance with and \n approval of, God. The only place in the N.T. where it applies to a special \n relationship (Vine's). In Thayer's Lex. we read: \"Daughter\" = a daughter of God: \n i.e. acceptable to God, rejoicing in God's protection and peculiar care\" (End of \n quote).\n In vs. 17, the Lord says to come out from them...the unclean, those \n unbelievers, unrighteous, idols, and infidels. Most of the \"unclean\" we see is a \n \"spiritual\" uncleanness, and from this God says separate yourself. Separate is \n \"APHORIZO\", to mark off by boundaries; to determine a limit; to exclude, \n divide, separate (Vine and Strongs) and (the) unclean (thing) do not touch, and \n I will receive you! This word \"unclean\" in the Greek is: \"AKATHARTOS\" = unclean, \n impure, is used of a) unclean spirits (especially so in idolatry); b) \n ceremonially, includes immorally. This also primarily refers to \"spiritual\" or \n religious uncleanness.\n The Lord God goes on to say to them who do these things, and beloved, to \n refrain from \"spiritual or religious\" uncleaness is to turn away from man's \n doctrines and traditions, all of Babylon's teachings, and walk in His truth and \n divine order. If we do these things, He will be unto us for a Father, not just \n our God, or our saviour, BUT OUR FATHER! And we will be unto Him for SONS (of \n God), or DAUGHTERS (of God). No beloved, He did not forget, nor leave out those \n consecrated and dedicated women.\n \n Now some women, in their desire to be males, will point to the Scripture \n where Paul states,\n \"THERE IS NEITHER JEW NOR GREEK, THERE IS NEITHER BOND NOR FREE, THERE IS \n NEITHER MALE NOR FEMALE: FOR YE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS.\"\n The use of the term Christ [anointed] Jesus [Saviour] refers to Jesus as \n our Saviour. Paul uses this term rarely, but when he does it refers to the work \n of Saviour (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:10-11).\n In the Galatian scripture, Paul is saying that as a result of their being \n baptized into Christ, they have put on Christ, and by faith they had become \n children of God. Then in the last, or 29th verse, he says if they are Christ's \n then they are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. In these \n verses Paul is speaking of those who are becoming Christians. In this area, \n there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor freeman, male or female.\n When you come to Christ to partake of His propitiatory sacrifice, God does \n not receive you according to outward merits, nationality, or sex. You are \n accepted on the merits of Christ's sacrifice. Therefore there is no Jew nor \n Greek, nor male and female.\n \n Now in Col. 3:10-11, Paul is saying the same thing in a different way. \n Verse 10:\n \"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the \n image of him that created him: \n The word \"new\" is \"NEOS\" = sig. new in respect of time, that which is \n recent; it is used of the young. Here the word stresses the fact of the \n believers new experience, recently begun, and still proceeding.\n Thus, Paul states in the next verse, in this experience with the Lord, the \n beginning of the new man, there is NO place for Greek and Jew, circumcision and \n uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ (is) all things \n and in all. Again, while male and female were not specifically mentioned, they \n could have been included, and we see that in the \"salvation experience\" one is \n not accepted according to outward appearances.\n \n What Paul is saying is that in salvation, under God's grace and \n forgiveness, we are accepted through His mercy and love based upon the \n propitiatory death of Christ Jesus. In this, as we are so readily aware, we are \n accepted, forgiven and cleansed, not because we are Jew or Greek, slave, or \n freeman, male or female, but because of what Jesus did for us. In our natural \n walk and life as a Christian we are what we were before conversion. A Jew? Yes, \n but now a Christian Jew. A slave? Yes, but now a Christian slave. A female? Yes, \n but now a Christian female. We remain what we are and were!!\n \n Example: The book of Philemon was written by Paul to correct an error by \n the slave Onesimus who had run away from his master, Philemon, and eventually \n found himself in Rome and a convert of Paul.\n Now Onesimus being converted, apparently assumed that conversion wiped out \n his previous life's obligation. Paul stated to Philemon that Onesimus would be \n an asset to him, however he was sending him back to him because he was still \n technically his slave. \n However, Paul instructed Philemon that though Onesimus was his slave in \n this life, he was a \"freeman\", YET IN THIS LIFE HE STILL WAS A SLAVE TO \n PHILEMON, AND MUST OBSERVE THAT STATUS.\n Do you see the point here? Many women will say, \"But I am in Chirst, and \n therefore there is no male nor female.\"\n Yet this is not true. We are still IN THIS LIFE and observing all the \n customs thereof; and like Onesimus, must return to their original status, even \n though a Christian.\n So, though a wife may be \"in Christ\", she is still a woman and subject to \n God's requirements and order for women.\n \n The scripture in Galatians 3:28 that states there is not male and female, \n also states there is not slave nor freeman.\n Paul explains the veracity of this verse by showing us that though \n Onesimus was a Christian, and in Christ a \"freeman\", he was still a slave in \n this life and must observe status.\n Also, he told Philemon that though he was a \"freeman\" he was a \"slave to \n Christ\", and to remember that in his dealings with Onesimus.\n By the same interpretation, a female (woman, daughter, or wife) is subject \n to the male (man, father, or husband).\n \n Returning briefly to the scripture in I Cor. 11:3-16 wherein Paul sets \n forth the \"governmental order\" of God, the A.V. refers to the woman's head being \n covered, as in putting a scarf, or hanky over the head.\n However, in the Greek, the word used is \"KATAKALUPTO\" which means veiled, \n to cover up, to cover oneself, indicating not only the head, but the whole body, \n leaving only the face open. If a woman was not to dress thusly, Paul said it was \n as if she should be shorn and shaven.\n The reason for this was that as man was to pray or prophecy with his head \n uncovered, being the image of God, woman was to be covered (especially the head, \n due to its significance) becuase she was the image of man. That which is of man, \n in the natural, is to be put down, decreased, that he might increase.\n This covering or veiling of the woman indicated her submission to the man. \n Paul said,\n \"BUT EVERY WOMAN THAT PRAYETH OR PROPHESIETH WITH HER HEAD UNCOVERED \n DISHONOURETH HER HEAD (which refers not only to her own head, but man as her \n head): FOR THAT IS EVEN ALL ONE AS IF SHE WERE SHAVEN.\n FOR IF THE WOMAN BE NOT COVERED, LET HER ALSO BE SHORN: BUT IF IT BE A \n SHAME FOR A WOMAN TO BE SHORN OR SHAVEN, LET HER BE COVERED\" (I Cor. 11:5-6).\n Then Paul clarifies the reasoning behind this order of God by saying: \n \"FOR THE MAN IS NOT OF THE WOMAN: BUT THE WOMAN OF THE MAN. \n NEITHER WAS THE MAN CREATED FOR THE WOMAN; BUT THE WOMAN FOR THE MAN. \n FOR THIS CAUSE OUGHT THE WOMAN TO HAVE POWER ON HER HEAD BECAUSE OF THE \n ANGELS\" (I Cor. 11:8-10).\n As to what angels is referred to here is debatable. Some say the fallen \n angels, or demons, as an example since they did not submit to God; others say to \n the Angels of God, for they will not minister to us if we do not obey God's \n commands.\n Paul goes on to say that this covering with this long garment was not \n necessary, and the churches had not that custom, since God had given woman \"long \n hair\" as her covering, or veil.\n This word is different from the other, being \"PERIBOLAION\" which comes \n from the word \"peri\", around; thus to throw something around (oneself), hence a \n veil, covering (Vine's).\n This indicates that the veil, or covering spoken of was not only for the \n head, but covered the whole body. However the woman's \"long hair\" was a \n substitute for this veil, being a glory to her.\n Now we see that a woman's long hair is her veil, and symbol of her \n submission to her husband, the man. Perhaps this is why so few women wear LONG \n HAIR today?? An indication of their rebellion?\n In homes where husbands and wives are obedient to the word of God and \n assuming their rightful places, these homes will be sanctified.\n Paul states in I Cor. 7:13-14:\n \"AND THE WOMAN WHICH HATH AN HUSBAND THAT BELIEVETH NOT, AND IF HE BE \n PLEASED TO DWELL WITH HER, LET HER NOT LEAVE HIM. \n FOR THE UNBELIEVING HUSBAND IS SANCTIFIED BY THE WIFE, AND THE UNBELIEVING \n WIFE IS SANCTIFIED BY THE HUSBAND: ELSE WERE YOUR CHILDREN UNCLEAN; BUT NOW ARE \n THEY HOLY.\" \n Perhaps many children from Christian (?) homes would not go astray and \n cause their parents so much heartache if they had been made holy by the sanctity \n of the home while growing up.\n We would be remiss in our duty if we did not include women's service \n relative to the church.\n Since the word of God has specifically forbidden women to teach publicly, \n in a mixed group, and usurp man's authority (or to take authority over men), \n then what is her scope of service?\n Probably the first and primary type of service is what we might call the \n \"Martha\" ministry; that of ministering to the needs of the saints in a natural \n realm. We have several examples of this ministry in the scriptures.\n In Acts 9:39, we read of Dorcas; a woman very highly commended, even to \n the point of raising her from the dead.\n Also, in Romans 16:1-2 we read of Paul's commendation of Phebe, a sister \n in the church at Cenchrea. She was called a \"succourer\" (someone who goes to the \n aid of one in distress).\n \"I COMMEND UNTO YOU PHEBE OUR SISTER, WHICH IS A SERVANT OF THE CHURCH \n WHICH IS AT CENCHREA: \n THAT YE RECEIVE HER IN THE LORD, AS BECOMETH SAINTS, AND THAT YE ASSIST \n HER IN WHATSOEVER BUSINESS SHE HATH NEED OF YOU: FOR SHE HATH BEEN A SUCCOURER \n OF MANY, AND OF MYSELF ALSO.\" \n This word in the Greek is \"PROSTATIS\", meaning a feminine form of \n \"prostates\", and denotes a protectress, patroness. It is a word of dignity, \n evidently chosen instead of others which might have been used and indicates the \n high esteem with which she was regarded, as one who had been a protectress of \n many.\n In Greece, PROSTATES was the title of a citizen of Athens who had the \n responsibility of seeing to the welfare of resident aliens who were without \n civic rights (Vine's).\n So, Phebe, as the female counterpart of \"prostates\" was involved in \n providing protection, and sustenance to Christians who came her way.\n The duties of motherhood involved the very important and special work of \n training the children at home, both boys and girls, until the boys came to the \n age of becoming sons, and thus accountable to the father who took over their \n training.\n In the church, Paul instructed Titus to instruct the women thusly:\n \"THE AGED WOMEN (Greek = \"PRESBUTIS\" - from a form of \"presbyter\"; means \n elderly, or to be elder; to be far advanced. refers to either chronological age, \n old; or to be advanced spiritually, as an elder; far advance in a Christian \n walk) LIKEWISE, THAT THEY BE IN BEHAVIOUR AS BECOMETH HOLINESS, NOT FALSE \n ACCUSERS, NOT GIVEN TO MUCH WINE, TEACHERS OF GOOD THINGS;\n THAT THEY MAY TEACH (Greek \"SOPHRONIZO\" denotes to cause to be of sound \n mind! \"Teach\" expresses the meaning adequately, for the teaching would involve \n the cultivation of sound judgment and prudence) THE YOUNG WOMEN TO BE SOBER, TO \n LOVE THEIR HUSBANDS, TO LOVE THEIR CHILDREN, \n TO BE DISCREET, CHASTE, KEEPERS AT HOME, GOOD, OBEDIENT TO THEIR OWN \n HUSBANDS, THAT THE WORD OF GOD BE NOT BLASPHEMED\" (Greek \"BLASPEMIA\" means \n sluggish, stupid, to injure by speech (or actions), to defame, revile, speak \n evil of) Tit. 2:3-5.

   "Illegal Concept,\n \n \nA $100.00 reward will be given for a Bible scripture proving any of the \n following statements to be true.\n \n 1. GOD HAS CHANGED THE SABBATH FROM SATURDAY TO SUNDAY.\n 2. WE SHOULD KEEP SUNDAY IN HONOR OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION.\n 3. CHRIST AND HIS APOSTLES KEPT SUNDAY AS THE SABBATH.\n 4. GOD'S TEN COMMANDMENTS ENDED AT THE CROSS.\n 5. BEING \"UNDER GRACE\" FREES US TO VIOLATE GOD'S TEN COMMANDMENTS.\n TRUTH\n\n \n You may be right in that the Bible does not contain any specific explicit reference to the transition from the traditional Sabbath and Sunday worship. This could pose a problem for sola scriptura  Christians. However, history along with scripture shows us that this practice was a part of early Christianity and it has been maintained and passed along as part of Tradition. Therefore, this does not pose a problem for Catholics and Orthodox who maintain Tradition as directed.\n \n \nThere are only eight texts in the New Testament that mention the first day of the week. Since none of them gives a hint that the sabbath was ever changed, there is no Bible authority for it.\n Here are the texts. Check them and see. Luke 24:1; John 20:1; Mark 16:1; Mark 16:9; Matthew 28:1; Acts 20:7; John 20:19; 1 Corinthians 16:2.\n\n \n One of the verses you cite, Acts 20:7 mentions that they gathered together to break bread on the first day of the week. What do you think this breaking of the bread was? It was the celebration of the Eucharist, as commanded by Jesus in memory of him. It was the early form of worship.\n \n \nSunday keeping originated as a pagan holiday for the worship of the sun. It came in with church apostasy. Professing Christians did not keep it until after the last of the Bible was written.\n\n \n Sunday keeping may have originated as a pagan holiday for worship of the sun for PAGANS. But for Christians keeping Sunday originated as a worship of the Son, that is the light of the world, the Son of Man. Keeping Sunday had nothing to do with paganism for Christians. \n \n You are wrong when you say that Christians did not keep Sunday until after the last of the Bible is written (if you are speaking of the Bible in its entirety as you know it today and also if you are speaking of scripture in its original form as the individual epistles and gospels). See the dates in the paragraph below and on the website provided below. \n \n If you reject the Church because of a supposed apostasy during this early time then it is logical that you would reject all workings of the Church from that time. This means that many Christians are keeping apostate and heretical doctrine. If the Church were not following the commands of God then why would one follow any further works by the Church? If you think this way then might also consider rejecting your Bible, the idea of the Trinity (formally defined in 325 A.D.) and the doctrine that Jesus was true man and true God (formally defined 451). The problem is that the books included in your Bible-every Bible, King James included-were established by the Catholic Church. The Old Testament in the King James has seven less books that were deleted during the Reformation (the apocrypha or deuterocanonicals). The New Testament of King James and Catholic Bibles contain the exact same books. BUT the canon of scripture that we all have today was not definitively established until 397 A.D. at the Council of Carthage. There were scripture writings and these writings were read at worship services but there was not a collected work in the form of the Bible. The Christian Church actually predates the New Testament and the Bible as a whole. \n \n Keeping Sunday was there from the beginning as Scripture hints, Tradition maintains, and other historical documents prove. It was there before even the Bible was. See this link:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Sabbath_or_Sunday.asp \n \n \n \nMatthew 24:20 proves that Jesus wanted His people to take great care to keep the sabbath after His ascension.\n\n \n Yes, Jesus kept the Sabbath but Jesus also broke the Sabbath. In Mark 2: 23-27  the disciples broke the Sabbath by plucking grain. Jesus replied to accusations by the Pharisees thus, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.\" Just after this Jesus breaks the Sabbath by healing a man (Mark 3:2-5). Also John 5:10-18, \"This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.\" See also, John 9:16  and John 7:23. Now, did Jesus truly break the Sabbath? If it is a sin to break the Sabbath and Jesus was without sin then did he break it? No, he more truthfully followed it. He said that he did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. So Jesus was teaching that the Pharisees were being hypocrites with all of their outward worship while at the same time having impure hearts and impure actions toward their brothers. (At any rate Jesus was God so he could change the Sabbath if he wanted to). \n \n But just because God in the form of Jesus has this power, do others, does the Church? Do we have the authority to change the day to our convenience? Let's go to Paul's writings and see. Colossians 2:16-17: \"Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.\" In terms of which day of the week to observe on, \"One man esteems one day as better than another, while another man esteems all days alike. Let every one be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord.\" (Romans 14:5-6) See also Acts 20:7-the Christians gathered to break bread on the first day and John receives his revelation on \"the Lord's day\" Revelation 1:10\n \n So we see that Jesus changed the Sabbath. The apostolic Church changed laws of God including circumcision (Acts 15). Paul wrote that one must set aside a time to honor God but the day that one does this is not important. Finally, by looking at the writings of the early Church Fathers-men who walked with the apostles-one can see that Sunday was the day of worship. Sunday was mentioned by name and it was also mentioned clearly that the Sabbath was no longer binding (see the website provided below). Although early Christians probably kept the Sabbath and during the same time worshipped on Sunday with the breaking of the bread, the Church changed from the Sabbath for three probable reasons: 1.to honor the Resurrection 2. rejection of Christians by Judaism 3.To distinguish Christianity from Judaism.\n \n Only one church, the Catholic Church, had the power to change the Sabbath. Not because it is the \"Catholic\" Church but because this authority was given to the Church by Christ himself. \"And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" (Matthew 16:18-20) You can see the authority of the Church illustrated in scripture at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15 (as I mentioned above). Here Gentiles were released from having to follow the law of circumcision. This was an everlasting command of God. How then does the Church change the law of God?\n \n How then can the Church deny the original Sabbath? It does so by the authority given it by Christ. \n \n A rigid observance of the Sabbath is for Judaism. The New Sabbath must be viewed in the New Law of Jesus, not the Old Law. The Sabbath/Sunday is for God. We owe him reverence on that day. It is also for man. It is for our leisure, enjoyment, and rest--a gift from God. \n \n \n\"Eucharist - that's in the Bible\" I got the New King James version of the bible, no eucharist books there.\n\n \n What do you think of these verses concerning the Eucharist? \n 1 Corinthians 10:16  and 1 Corinthians 11:23-29?",

   "4: Who first enjoined Sunday-keeping by law?\n Constantine the Great.\n\n Perhaps Constantine was the first to make keeping the Lord's Day a law?? But the practice was occuring long before Constantine. It is scriptural to worship on Sunday. The earliest Christians, who were also holding on to their Judaism to a certain degree, kept the Sabbath by going to temple to study and hear about scripture on Saturday. Then on Sunday, they met for the Lord's Supper to remember him. The Lord's Day is the fulfillment of the Sabbath for it is the day of the Resurrection, the guarantee of eternal rest.\n \n Acts 20:7 \"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread...\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 16:2 Sunday offerings-- \"On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that contributions need not be made when I come.\" \n \n It may also be of note that John \"was in the Spirit on the Lord's day\" when he received the Revelation which he penned.

   "Christ was the fulfillment of the Old testament, not the abolishment of it. Many of the procedures have been done away with because Christ makes us holy and \"clean\". The New Testament does show some of the laws but it also specifically refutes others (eg. Peter eating of both clean and unclean animals because God told him that nothing God makes is unclean). Also, many of the laws were to prevent plagues and parasites from ravaging the camp, as proven today by cooking procedures and quarantines.\n \n As for the original question, all of the statements are bunk, don't take them seriously.\n\n \n \n Well, that is the person who wrote the gospel of Peter, not Jesus. Jesus said not one word of the law would change till all was complete.. we are still here, so all i s not complete. It looks like Peter disagreed with Jesus there. Of course, the people followed that because it was easier.",

Regardless I have trouble seeing that this is the same system that ancient jews used. Did their saturday Sabbaths end on the same day the roman sith days were on or is the 6th day equivalent used or what?\nThey have their origins from the Romans, who borrowed them from the Greeks, who borrowed them from the Babylonians, who borrowed them from the Sumerians... Saturday is the only one that survives with a Latin derived name in English. French still has more of the Latin names, eg Mercredi (Mercury) for Wednesday, Jupiter (Jeudi) for Thursday and Vendredi (Venus) for Friday. \n \n The English names are a mixture of Latin, Saxon (Germanic) and Norse (Scandinavian). To add to Eddie's list, Monday is from the Saxon, Monand\u00e6g, Wednesday is named after Odin/Wodin (Wodensd\u00e6g from the Saxon), and Friday is also Saxon derived: Frigd\u00e6g.\n \n The first day of the week varies around the world. The Russian word for Tuesday is \"Vtornik\" which translates to \"second\". Monday is their first day of the week. Also international standard ISO-8601 defines Monday as the first day of the week. The sabbath is Saturday and thus Sunday is seen as the first day of the week by most Christian countries. Christianity probably moved the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday because legend has it that Jesus rose from the dead on a Sunday.\n \n The origins of a seven day week is unknown. It's possible, though highly unlikely, that it's origins are from the Bible and the ancient Jews. But Rome was using a seven day week system long before its conversion to Christianity for example. The fact that the seven days all have the names of the seven \"planets\" known about thousands of years ago suggests a more pagan answer to it's origins. This is reinforced by the fact that Hindi, Japanese, and Korean and other eastern languages have a similar planets/ gods naming system for the days of the week.",

   "1: What testimony did Christ bear concerning His relation to the law & the Prophets? \n \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy , but to fulfill.\" Matt. 5:17.\n \n 2: How enduring did He say the law is.?\n \"For verily I say unto youm Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" Verse 18.\n \n 3: What did He say of those who should break one of the least of God's commandments, and shall teach man so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.\" Verse 19\n \n Note: From this it is evedent that the entire code of ten commandments is binding in the Christian dispensation, and that Christ had no thought of changing any of them. One of these commands the observance of the seventh day as the sabbath. But the practise of most Christians is different; they keep the first day of the week instead, many of them believing that Christ chaged the sabbeth. But, from His own words, we see that He came for no such purpose. The responsibilty for this change must therefore be looked for elsewhere.\n \n 4: Who first enjoined Sunday-keeping by law?\n Constantine the Great.\n \n Notes: \"The earliest recognition of the observance of Sunday as a legal duty is a constitution of Constantine in 321 A. D., enacting that all courts of justice, inhabitants of towns, and workshops were to be at rest on Sunday (venerabili die Solis) with an exception in favor of those engaged in agricultural labor.\" Encyclopedia Britannica, ninth edition, article \"Sunday.\"\n \n And with real research one that truly want's to know and follow the truth, can.\n \n But I know it is harder so we believe in the other.\n \n God bless us all\n lliltiger\n\n \n \"For by GRACE you have been saved through faith and that not of your selves it is the gift of god that no man may boast.\"\n \n Now works may justify a man.",

It wasn't until Martin Luthor that the 'By faith alone' came about.. it isn't biblical, but Martin Luthor thought it should be.\n\n \n It is very biblical.\n \n In Genesis it says of Abraham, before he was circumcised \"Abram believed God and it was attributed to him as righteousness.\" This is the justification-righteousness that is. Paul even talks about this in Romans. It was highly considered well before Martin Luther. Paul makes a great deal of it throughout his epistles. Even the book of James which says not by faith alone but by works also, when taken in context shows that he means that a faith not leading to works is not really faith. It is not the works that justify though. It is the faith.\n \n The jews got it wrong. However, the old testament is a different critter. Testament also means covenant. Under the old covenant God promised that if israel kept the law then israel would be gods people. Under the new covenant, Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the life I should have died and therefore through propitiation I am declared righteous. \n \n Romans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\n Romans 6:23 For the wages (read earned through working) of sin is death but the free gift (read unearned through no merit whatsoever) of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our lord.\n \n Paul in romans states that no man is justified by works of the law. NO one ever has been and no one ever will be. On part of the thesis of romans is that the law was there to describe the perfect rigtheousness of GOd and to show man that without utter dependence on God (faith) man CANNOT keep the law.\n \n Faith is the means, God is the source for all justification. Living the law for the faithfull is a process called sanctification. Living perfectly is called glorification. They are part and parcel of salvation.\n \n Before I was enslaved to sin. I had no choice. NOw I am saved from the penalty but not the presence, and in the future I will no longer be in the presence of sin. \n \n But, How I am justified is how I should live, namely by faith. It is that faith that allows me to do works of the law.\n \n Ef",
