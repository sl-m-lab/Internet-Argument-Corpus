   "Turkey's entrance into EU will give 'green light' for Europe filling with of radical Islamists, first of all Chechen extremists. It's well-known that refugees from Chechnya during some years enjoy their special status in Turkey. And with Turkey's accepting into EU all those refugees will get Turkish citizenship and therefore European too! Rivers of legal Jihadi migrants will start flow to Europe.\n Well, Europe has already faced Chechen refugees problem. The latter push their rights in EU, take part in protest actions and support illegal Muslims demonstrations! And Europe suffers from it! We are fighting against it but Turks are ready to send thousands of new gangsters! It's not a secret that Chechens in Europe deal with drugs, weapons smuggling, kidnappings and other. That's why we are to stop Turkey's entrance into EU before Chechens refugees get special status here!",
