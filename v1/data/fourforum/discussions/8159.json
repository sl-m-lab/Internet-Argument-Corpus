   "My own definition of \"personhood\" is a bit different than yours since I do not require communication. After all, there is little or nothing that we can communicate in sleep or in coma, and early babies have very limited communication - does that make us any less a person in those circumstances? My definition of \"person\" only has two requirements:\n 1) The being is human - i.e. human DNA\n 2) The being has at least the beginnings of a mental existence (either conscious or subconscious).\n \n I require a mental existence since I do not believe a living body without a mind can be considered a person. Outside of the abortion debate, all of our uses of the term \"person\" imply a mental existence. Also, I require the being to be human since many animals also have a mental existence. However, though I advocate against animal cruelty, I would not give animals the same rights as we people have. One can envision future scenarios of human-animal hybrids or even aliens where such a definition might be challenged, but we haven't faced those scenarios yet.\n \n As for when we first become \"people\" and when we lose that distinction, I would point out that neurologists associate higher brain functions with our abilities to think, have emotions, register pain, etc. The function of the higher brain (cerebral cortex) can be monitored by measuring certain types of EEG patterns. Apparently, such higher level EEG patterns can first be detected around the 30th week (near the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy) so I would say that that is the point at which we first have the possibility of acquiring a mind - and thus, that is when we might first start to exist as \"people\". Once those EEG patterns end at the end of our lives, indicating that the higher brain is no longer functional, then we no longer have a mental existence and, in my view, we are then no longer \"people\". One can continue to keep our bodies alive artificially but, as people, we are long gone.",

   "Another Opinion and I have had this discussion before. \n \n He has his own defintiion and tends to stick with that while I take more of a \"not my call\" approach. I think defining when a \"person\" is a \"person\" is like deciding the meaning of life. For this reason I take the every human is sacred approach. When a human begins is not really disputed that much....unless we want to change the definition of human (like we have with person).\n \n Another thought I have is that people will tend to form a definition of person to suit what they would like it to mean. So a pro-life person would be like \"I don't like abortion so person begins at conception\" while a pro-abortion person says \"I support abortion so person begins at birth\"....kind of a conclusion based reasoning. So therefore the definition of person has become worthless in a way. We either have to go back and see what person \"meant\" prior to abortion being a huge issue or just find another criteria.\n \n Another Opinion has good thoughts on the subject though so I hope you all read what he has to say as well.",

   "To begin with, we must remember that the category of personhood is our creation, and our definitions of what constitutes personhood are therefore completely arbitrary. It is not a workable ethical category for anybody. For the theist, this understanding of personhood steps on the toes of the much less capricious body of revelation on the topic of what makes humans valuable or worth considering whole. For the non-theist, the separation of humans (or some humans) into persons that are above the rest of the world in some mode of value is one more chunk of humanistic chauvinism, a completely unjustifiable and capricious move.\n \n Therefore, the question of when a human becomes a person or ceases to be a person is hardly a discussion (given the definition). The beginning and end of personhood will correspond to the arbitrary qualities by which you choose to define personhood. In the case of your definition, it begins after birth and lasts until braindeath. I understand \"think\" in your use to be equivalent with self-consciousness. If it is \"think\" in some broader sense then we will have many persons outside of the human race. Between those categories of birth and death (I believe total braindeath is the medical understanding of death, and not truly an issue here; perhaps in the spirit of discussion you meant to point to something short of that, such as PVS?) all otherwise persons sleeping or unconscious also temporarily forfeit their personhood--which is something you may want to amend by providing for potentiality in your definition. That, however, is a move you may not want to make, because in doing so you would have to affirm both the fetus and the PVS patient, which your definition is clearly intended to exclude. I say \"your definition\" as that which you provided, intending no personal offense as it may not be personally endorsed by yourself.",

It may require other things as well (life, human DNA, etc), but without a unique personal identity, there can be no personhood.\n \n It seems to me this is self-evident and unobjectionable. \n \n Those who accept the Sacred Texts believe that personal identity extends beyond the existence of sperm, egg, and cadaver.

However, roughly speaking, I would say that \"any of the above\" criteria would be enough to define a minimum mental existence - and thus define a person.\n \n On a last point, why is memory important to you? Various people who have experienced major brain trauma have lost most memory function - so they have no memory of who they are, what they were doing one minute ago, etc. One can imagine that the extreme situation would be someone who has no memory at all - so he has no words to communicate, no memory of a personal history. Indeed, every experience is completely new, including the experience of pain, pleasure, etc. However, this memory-less person can still have experiences (feel pain, pleasure, experience the input of the senses, etc.). He would be completely baffled as to what any experience at all is telling him, but he would still have the experiences. Extremely limited as that person would be, I would still call him a person.

Their personal identity incorporates other beings which have their own personal identity, but each still have personhood. \n \n \nWhere mental existence is concerned and criteria I use to define it, many of the criteria I listed (thought, emotion, sense of pain, perception of experiences, sense of self, etc.) are interdependent (ex. emotion can be thought of as a type of thought, it takes a type of thought to recognize pain or sensation, etc.). However, roughly speaking, I would say that \"any of the above\" criteria would be enough to define a minimum mental existence - and thus define a person.\n \n On a last point, why is memory important to you? Various people who have experienced major brain trauma have lost most memory function - so they have no memory of who they are, what they were doing one minute ago, etc. One can imagine that the extreme situation would be someone who has no memory at all - so he has no words to communicate, no memory of a personal history. Indeed, every experience is completely new, including the experience of pain, pleasure, etc. However, this memory-less person can still have experiences (feel pain, pleasure, experience the input of the senses, etc.). He would be completely baffled as to what any experience at all is telling him, but he would still have the experiences. Extremely limited as that person would be, I would still call him a person. I'm not sure if that is the type of memory that you were referring to. If not, then please clarify.\nWell, he could not be baffled, because that would require remembering un unusual or inexplicable experience (and trying to figure it out).\n \n I do not believe there are any reported cases of a true absence of memory, so we are talking hypothetical, which is fine.\n \n I have heard of the cases of persons with short term memory of about 10 seconds. These individuals are able to remember language, perspective concepts, effects of gravity, what I would call \"generic\" knowledge that most people would know, but nothing specific to the life experiences of the individual. For example, they know they must have had a mother, but not who that would be; that G.W. Bush was president, but not if they ever met him.\n There are memories, so there is personal identity.\n \n And of course we know of trauma induced amnesia, where the person becomes aware of the present, with no specific knowledge of their past life experiences. From that point they begin building memories, and they have the memories of generic knowledge. There are memories.\n \n But let us suppose an evil virus attacks an adult human brain, and irreplaceably damages the mind's ability to remember anything, ever. Sensory input is fine. Stimulus response is normal. There are no memories.\n Any speech or listening (hearing and understanding) is impossible.\n Any learning is impossible.\n \n Any recognition of any stimulus or sensory input is totally unrecognizable. Sounds would simply be sounds, and the mind could never learn that some sounds are human voices, and some are natural or mechanical.\n There would be no such thing as repeatable to this stricken human. Every single experience or thought would be brand new, from millisecond to millisecond. There could be no train of thought, linking related ideas.\n \n Without memory, the personal identity ceases to exist, and the person is the equivalent of \"brain dead\". Actually, I think I will coin the phrase \"mind dead\". If, as I believe we have agreed, that the brain and mind are connected but different, we should be able to agree that the brain could be functional, but not the mind. No functional mind, no mental existence.\n \n The purpose of the mind is to retain the value of experiences, recalling them at future moments, in order to make sense of the world.\n The operation of the mind (not just proper operation, but any operation) is dependent on memory. It is not enough to say \"we have the firing of synapses\" to identify a mind at work. That will describe the brain at work, but the mind requires memory.\n \n I do not think it matters that some individuals may be dumping all personal identity memories at regular intervals and starting new memories.\n \n I do not think it matters that some individuals are in comas, and there memories cannot be tested. Brainwave activity can be tested, and provide evidence the mind is at work. If the mind is at work, there is personal identity, and also mental existence.\n \n I believe two paths bring us to the same clearing, but at slightly different points.",

No functional mind, no mental existence.\n\n I'm not completely convinced that a memory-less person would not have a personal identity / sense of self unless the meanings of our two expressions are different. By sense of self, I do not think of a person who even recognizes the concept of \"I\" - whether it be an \"I\" that is considered part of a greater whole or not. I just think of the mental center of ourselves which is the one that feels the pain or sensation, has the emotions, etc. I view that sense of self as the very core of our minds. However, I think a sense of self could exist even without memory. Every experience would be new, no learning would be possible, no reference point of judging an experience would exist. However, I think that helpless human could feel a sense of pain and, at least at the moment of feeling it, have some automatic emotion associated with pain. There are emotions which probably do require some sense of memory - such as fear and suspense, perhaps happiness as well. However, I think more rudimentary emotions such as alarm, or a neutral sense of comfort might not require memory. It is an interesting case to ponder and I might still be convinceable of your point, but so far, I can still imagine a human with at least a sense of self and experience of sensations as having a mental existence despite not having memory and, therefore, in my mind, being a person.\n \nThe purpose of the mind is to retain the value of experiences, recalling them at future moments, in order to make sense of the world.\n The operation of the mind (not just proper operation, but any operation) is dependent on memory.

In order to ever understand another person's thoughts or whether they have thought at all, they have to communicate, and learning that skill takes sensory input. \n \n Would there be a sense of self-awareness if a brain was utterly isolated from its external environment? (And always was.) Sure \"I think, therefore I am\", but then you have to define what thinking is. Are thoughts merely brainwaves, or must they be organized in a way that has a relationship to our shared reality?",

Unless I can translate words into images, I get 'stuck' when attempting to read.\n As for time, I haven't worn a watch in over 25 years. my built in clock is near perfect. I can even wake myself up from sleep or a 10 minute nap on time.\n \n As to sense of self, studies on meditation not that the practice often affects that part of the brain that differentiats self from anything else. Thus, you get a religious sense for some practioners as if though they are becoming 'one with the universe' (or one with another or object). Conversly, some people (rarity) have bad 'trips' with meditation. From what I've read, some cases (in the extreme) have people becoming permanentally dissociated from a sense of correct self interpretation.\n \n So, the theory of these being hard wired isn't that far fetched.",

I wouldn't call anybody who is narrow minded and intolerant a person. A person has to expose themselves to numerous personalities. Most do, that's why most people are not like their parents.\n\n I have seen many nature documentaries where individuals might occasionally change groups - be it a stray male kicked out of neighboring group that takes over an existing independent group, or a stray individual that gets adopted by a group, but these events do not happen too often. Also, groups of animals - such as apes - do interact with other groups in what is essentially warfare over territory. However, I admit that I have not heard of two independent groups of apes interacting peacefully. Indeed, though I have seen nature documentaries showing many fights between groups of animals, I don't think that I have ever seen cooperation between separate groups - interesting to ponder. I have heard of certain tool use among apes quickly spreading from the ape that \"invented\" a particular tool use to the whole group, but I haven't heard of such acquired \"culture\" spreading through an ape population of a wider region. This lack of cooperation with other groups might well be one of the numerous aspects limiting the mental development of higher mammals.\n \n As for humans that never go outside their local environment or narrow way of thinking, I would certainly still call them people, just not \"well-rounded\" people. I have dealt with enough of such people in my life to know how very frustrating it can be to deal with. I think that part of their mentality is that they do not trust their own capabilities of reason and find strength in an absolute trust in their narrowly defined group - in that their group leader tells them what to think and they trust that. They essentially do not allow themselves the freedom to judge for themselves. It is a pity since this allows so many people to be lead astray by charismatic leaders. This is even true at a national level - more so with Republicans I have met than with Democrats (though I admit to being biased). So many of the world problems would be more easily solved if people consistently demanded solid reasoning from their leaders and did not trust blindly.",
