   "Juan Williams got what he wanted.\n \n Controversy, in the media spot light, new money and a job at Fox.\n \n Yes, he is nervous around Muslims, just like I am around black men in a poor section of town, but I don't go on TV and put my name to the feeling and expect no controversy or no problem with my non-biased news employer.\n \n No, this was planned, and yes it was racist based because that is what he and Fox needed to hire him - the media spotlight to start his ratings and securing of advertiser dollars.",
