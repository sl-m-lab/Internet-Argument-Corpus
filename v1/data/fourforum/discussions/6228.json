   "Well, the next semester starts Monday, so it'll be back to college for me (in addition to working full time). So I won't be able to post here as much as I have been.\n \n I know it may seem egotistical for me to create a new thread for this, but there's actually a reason for doing so. \n \n I've been involved heavily in a lot of different threads in this Evolution/Creationism forum. For me to make my \"back to college\" comment on the last page of one thread would not let everyone I've been debating know, and they may mistakenly take my sudden lack of responding to mean I can't counter their arguments. So I'm letting everyone know ahead of time, in one spot, that is clearly seen by all.",
