   "Breaking News, Kenya, Africa, Politics, Business, Sports, Blogs, Photos, Videos- Owning AK-47 soon to be a hanging offence\n \n \nAccording to the latest proposals contained in the National Policy on Small Arms and Light Weapons, no one will be allowed to own an AK-47 rifle, a G3 or \"any automatic or semi-automatic self-loading military assault rifle of any other calibre\".\n \n Anyone found guilty of having one will be hanged. The policy is a follow-up of a letter to the Attorney General dated February 12, 2007. The letter from the then Police Commissioner, Maj-Gen Hussein Ali, had proposed that the death sentence be imposed on criminals with illegal firearms and civilians who misuse licensed guns.\n\n \n Hmm. We're always being told how the rest of the world has the right idea when it comes to dealing with firearm-related crimes and offenders, and how other countries should be viewed as an example that we should readily copy and practice ourselves.\n \n Anyone wanna claim that now?",

The military hasn't had a semi-automatic rifle as their main soldier armament since 1957, when they finally phased out the M1 Garand.\n \n Kenya wants it to be a death penalty offense to own civilian legal firearms. That's a serious violation of human rights no matter what anybody says.",
