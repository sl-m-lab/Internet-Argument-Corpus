   "the biggest thing about running for a presidential election is your campaign. raise a few million dollars by any means necessary, and start running ads. of course your ads are not gonna talk about what you plan to do to make the country run smoother (apparently the public doesnt care about that). instead, you work on the public's emotions. create feelings of anger in them toward your opponent, and feelings of heroic buddy-ness in them toward yourself. here are some key points for getting the fickle public to like you coming close to elections:\n \n - show clips of your opponent frowning, looking confused or doing something goofy. then show clips of yourself shaking hands, signing autographs or being cheered on by supporters\n \n - show clips of your opponent cavorting or enjoying luxury of some sort, and then clips of yourself in a nature-oriented environment or chatting with regular-looking people\n \n - talk about the wild and stupid events of your opponent's childhood and youth, then contrast it to your uneventful and pure upbringing (if you dont have a pure unbringing, then just leave that out and say you didnt do those things that your opponent did)\n \n - show clips of the opponent making promises that he never kept even though he emphasised that he actually keeps his promises, then make those same promises, emphasising that youll actually keep them\n \n - try to conceal the sources of your campaign funds, then do your best to expose how unscrupulous your opponent was in raising his campaign money\n \n - incorporate serene scapes (sunsets, children playing, flowers, puppies, etc) into your campaign ads, and play soothing instrumentals, like harps or piano solos in the background\n \n - finally, never ever ever ever ever talk about the issues. nobody cares that your opponent made a disaster of his political past (unless its a sex scandal). and nobody cares whether youre a competent decision maker and leader. and nobody cares if you plan to continue governing EXACTLY how the other guy was, or that your radical changes are gonna make the country better or worse. people dont like to think, they just like to feel. so emotional ping-pong is the only way to get their votes. it always has worked and it always will",

If giving detailed and intelligent talks about the issues would win them more votes, then that's what they'd do. They get the most bang for their campaign buck by appealing to emotions rather than intellect. If that's what the people respond to then they'd be fools to do anything else. \n \n This all assumes that the various campaign managers know what they're doing. I haven't seen anyone actually try running a campaign which appeals to the voters intellect, so I don't actually know that it wouldn't work. However, looking at what passes for enterainment these days, I wouldn't run a campaign that appealed to people's intelect.\n \n (I just know this will come back to haunt me when I run for President :))",

   "The question that is begged is, \"Is it the candidates that are not talking about the issues or the media that is not covering the issues?\"\n\n i think the media is prone to show what the candidates tell them to show, for the right price. and as long as the ads have that little disclaimer that says \"paid for by the supporters of X\" then it shouldnt be a problem of whether the media censors or allows it. the issues arent covered because the media plays the same games as the politicians: they play on emotions. if its a story to make you cower in fear, buy more protection, or becoming more paranoid about their surroundings, then the media endorses it. emotion is a better rein to steer the public than intellect and thought.\n \n if you ever get hold of a campaign budget, i'll bet youll find that the majority of funds goes on staged tv ads and fired up rallies and tours. a politician wants to look like a champion and a revolutionary at election time, not a wise and sober decision maker and thinker (even though when the election is over, thats when we all start to think about how stupid/rash/thoughtless/passive/apathetic our leader is...)",
