   "Spain Becomes Third Country To Legalize Gay Marriage \n by The Associated Press \n \n Posted: June 30, 2005 7:45 am ET \n (Madrid) Parliament legalized gay marriage Thursday, defying conservatives and clergy who opposed making traditionally Roman Catholic Spain the third country in the world to officially recognize same-sex unions. \n \n The measure passed the 350-seat Congress of Deputies by a vote of 187-147 with four abstentions. The bill, part of the ruling Socialists' aggressive agenda for social reform, also lets gay couples adopt children and inherit each others' property.\n \n The bill is now law. The Senate, where conservatives hold the largest number of seats, rejected the bill last week, but the Senate is an advisory body and final say on legislation rested with the Congress of Deputies.\n \n Gay couples will be allowed to marry as soon as the law is published in the official government registry, the Boletin Oficial del Estado. This could come as early as Friday or within two weeks at the latest, the parliament's press office said.\n \n After the final tally was announced, activists watching from the spectator section of the ornate chamber cried, cheered, hugged, waved to lawmakers and blew them kisses.\n \n Several members of the conservative opposition Popular Party, which vehemently opposed the bill, shouted: \"This is a disgrace.\" Those in favor stood and clapped.\n \n The Netherlands and Belgium are the only other two countries that recognize gay marriage nationwide. Canada's House of Commons passed legislation Tuesday that would legalize gay marriage by the end of July as long as the Senate also passes the bill, which it is expected to do.\n \n \"We were not the first, but I am sure we will not be the last. After us will come many other countries, driven, ladies and gentlemen, by two unstoppable forces: freedom and equality,\" Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told the chamber before the vote.\n \n Zapatero said the reform of Spain's legal code simply adds one dry paragraph of legalese - but means much, much more.\n \n He called it \"a small change in wording that means an immense change in the lives of thousands of citizens. We are not legislating, ladies and gentlemen, for remote unknown people. We are expanding opportunities for the happiness of our neighbors, our work colleagues, our friends, our relatives.\"\n \n Zapatero lacks a majority in the chamber but got help from small regional- based parties that tend to be his allies.\n \n Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy said after the vote that Zapatero has deeply divided Spain and should have sought a consensus in parliament that recognized same-sex unions but didn't call them marriages. Rajoy said that if the vast majority of countries in the world don't accept gay marriage, including some run by Socialists, there must be a reason.\n \n \"I think the prime minister has committed a grave act of irresponsibility,\" Rajoy told reporters.\n \n The gay marriage bill was the boldest and most divisive initiative of the liberal social agenda Zapatero has embarked on since taking office in April 2004.\n \n Parliament overhauled Spain's 25-year-old divorce law on Wednesday, also irking Spain's Roman Catholic Church, by letting couples end their marriage without a mandatory separation or having to state a reason for the split-up as required under the old law.\n \n He has also pushed through legislation allowing stem-cell research and wants to loosen Spain's restrictive abortion law.\n \n The Roman Catholic Church, which held much sway over the government just a generation ago when Gen. Francisco Franco was in power, had adamantly opposed gay marriage. In its first display of anti-government activism in 20 years, it endorsed a June 18 rally in which hundreds of thousands marched through Madrid in opposition to the bill. Some 20 bishops took part in the June 18 rally.\n \n On Wednesday, a Catholic lay group called the Spanish Family Forum presented lawmakers with a petition bearing 600,000 signatures as a last-minute protest.\n \n Late last year, a spokesman for the Spanish Bishops Conference, Antonio Martinez Camino, said that allowing gay marriage was like \"imposing a virus on society - something false that will have negative consequences for social life.\"\n \n However, polls suggest Spaniards supported gay marriage. A survey released in May by pollster Instituto Opina said 62% of Spaniards support the government's action on gay marriage, and 30% oppose it. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n \n But surveys show Spaniards about evenly split over whether gay couples should be allowed to adopt children.\n \n Earlier this week Canada's House of Commons approved a gay marriage bill (story). The legislation needs approval of the Senate - likely to come before the end of July - to make Canada the fourth country to legalize same-sex marriage.\n \n \u00a9Associated Press 2005",

   "The last week has been tough for opponents of same-sex marriage. First Canadian and then Spanish legislators voted to legalize the practice, prompting American social conservatives to renew their call for a constitutional amendment banning such marriages here. James Dobson of the evangelical group Focus on the Family has warned that without that ban, marriage as we have known it for 5,000 years will be overturned.\n \n My research on marriage and family life seldom leads me to agree with Dr. Dobson, much less to accuse him of understatement. But in this case, Dr. Dobson's warnings come 30 years too late. Traditional marriage, with its 5,000-year history, has already been upended. Gays and lesbians, however, didn't spearhead that revolution: heterosexuals did. \n \n Heterosexuals were the upstarts who turned marriage into a voluntary love relationship rather than a mandatory economic and political institution. Heterosexuals were the ones who made procreation voluntary, so that some couples could choose childlessness, and who adopted assisted reproduction so that even couples who could not conceive could become parents. And heterosexuals subverted the long-standing rule that every marriage had to have a husband who played one role in the family and a wife who played a completely different one. Gays and lesbians simply looked at the revolution heterosexuals had wrought and noticed that with its new norms, marriage could work for them, too.\n \n The first step down the road to gay and lesbian marriage took place 200 years ago, when Enlightenment thinkers raised the radical idea that parents and the state should not dictate who married whom, and when the American Revolution encouraged people to engage in \"the pursuit of happiness,\" including marrying for love. Almost immediately, some thinkers, including Jeremy Bentham and the Marquis de Condorcet, began to argue that same-sex love should not be a crime. \n \n Same-sex marriage, however, remained unimaginable because marriage had two traditional functions that were inapplicable to gays and lesbians. First, marriage allowed families to increase their household labor force by having children. Throughout much of history, upper-class men divorced their wives if their marriage did not produce children, while peasants often wouldn't marry until a premarital pregnancy confirmed the woman's fertility. But the advent of birth control in the 19th century permitted married couples to decide not to have children, while assisted reproduction in the 20th century allowed infertile couples to have them. This eroded the traditional argument that marriage must be between a man and a woman who were able to procreate.\n \n In addition, traditional marriage imposed a strict division of labor by gender and mandated unequal power relations between men and women. \"Husband and wife are one,\" said the law in both England and America, from early medieval days until the late 19th century, \"and that one is the husband.\" \n \n This law of \"coverture\" was supposed to reflect the command of God and the essential nature of humans. It stipulated that a wife could not enter into legal contracts or own property on her own. In 1863, a New York court warned that giving wives independent property rights would \"sow the seeds of perpetual discord,\" potentially dooming marriage.\n \n Even after coverture had lost its legal force, courts, legislators and the public still cleaved to the belief that marriage required husbands and wives to play totally different domestic roles. In 1958, the New York Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the traditional legal view that wives (unlike husbands) couldn't sue for loss of the personal services, including housekeeping and the sexual attentions, of their spouses. The judges reasoned that only wives were expected to provide such personal services anyway.\n \n As late as the 1970's, many American states retained \"head and master\" laws, giving the husband final say over where the family lived and other household decisions. According to the legal definition of marriage, the man was required to support the family, while the woman was obligated to keep house, nurture children, and provide sex. Not until the 1980's did most states criminalize marital rape. Prevailing opinion held that when a bride said, \"I do,\" she was legally committed to say, \"I will\" for the rest of her married life.\n \n I am old enough to remember the howls of protest with which some defenders of traditional marriage greeted the gradual dismantling of these traditions. At the time, I thought that the far-right opponents of marital equality were wrong to predict that this would lead to the unraveling of marriage. As it turned out, they had a point.\n \n Giving married women an independent legal existence did not destroy heterosexual marriage. And allowing husbands and wives to construct their marriages around reciprocal duties and negotiated roles - where a wife can choose to be the main breadwinner and a husband can stay home with the children- was an immense boon to many couples. But these changes in the definition and practice of marriage opened the door for gay and lesbian couples to argue that they were now equally qualified to participate in it.\n \n Marriage has been in a constant state of evolution since the dawn of the Stone Age. In the process it has become more flexible, but also more optional. Many people may not like the direction these changes have taken in recent years. But it is simply magical thinking to believe that by banning gay and lesbian marriage, we will turn back the clock.\n \n Stephanie Coontz, the director of public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, is the author of \"Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage.\"\n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/opinion/05coontz.html?th&emc=th",

   "Two men -- a psychiatrist and a store window decorator -- have tied the knot in a Madrid suburb, the first gay couple to marry in Spain since the country's parliament passed a law allowing such unions last month.\n \n Monday's civil ceremony, which lasted 10 minutes, was attended by a few family members and friends of the couple -- as well as several dozen representatives of the media -- in the city council room in the suburb of Tres Cantos.\n \n Pedro Zerolo, a gay rights activist and member of the country's ruling Socialist Party, confirmed it was the first marriage between people of the same sex in Spain and called it \"a triumph of common sense and the state of law.\"\n \n Spain's Roman Catholic Church staunchly opposes the new law.\n \n The men said they have been a couple for 30 years. The psychiatrist, Carlos Baturin German, and the store window decorator, Emilio Menendez Menendez, replied affirmatively when the Tres Cantos town councilman officiating the ceremony, Jose Luis Martinez, asked if they wanted to marry each other.\n \n \"I declare you -- united in matrimony,\" the councilman then pronounced, dispensing with the traditional \"husband and wife\" formula.\n \n The newlyweds then hugged each other, did not publicly kiss, and exchanged rings. They declined to give their ages.\n \n The Netherlands and Belgium also allow same-sex marriage, but Zerolo said the legal terminology in Spain's new law is more progressive than in those countries. It also goes beyond the same-sex marriage law in effect in some parts of Canada, because the Spanish legislation equates fully, without any separation or distinctions, same-sex marriage to heterosexual marriage.\n \n Parliament approved the controversial law on a 187-to-147 vote on June 30, and the measure went into effect on July 3. Since then, numerous same-sex couples have gone to city halls and civil registries across Spain to get the required paperwork to hold a civil wedding.\n \n The newlyweds in Tres Cantos said it had not been their intention to hold the first same-sex marriage in Spain -- on the eighth day since the law took effect -- but it just worked out that way, given the marriage docket schedule in the middle-class suburb north of Madrid, after their application form had been completed.\n \n \"We're normal people who love each other and want to be happy,\" Menendez said afterward outside of the Tres Cantos town hall. \n \n \"The (Catholic) bishops have lost an opportunity to be shepherds,\" he added, saying the church could have tried to mend fences by reserving church weddings for heterosexual couples while accepting civil marriages for gays.\n \n But thousands of Spaniards demonstrated in central Madrid last month just before the law was finally approved, and last week, leaders of the Spanish church sharply criticized the law, saying it would create \"confusion\" and went against \"human reason.\"\n \n The new law is also seen as a challenge for Pope Benedict XVI, given the Vatican's strong stance in favor of heterosexual marriage only.\n \n The Socialist government estimates there are 4 million homosexuals in Spain, nearly 10 percent of the population.\n \n Under the new law, gay couples could also adopt children, but the first gay couple to wed said they weren't interested in adoption.\n \n Polls show about 60 percent of Spaniards are in favor of same-sex marriage.\n \n Some church leaders have called on local officials not to perform same-sex marriages. Tres Cantos is ruled locally by the conservative Popular Party, which at the national level voted against the gay marriage law in parliament. \n \n But the councilman officiating the first same-sex marriage was from the Communist-led United Left coalition, which has supported the law.\n http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/11/spain.gay/",

Stay tuned for more to follow.\n\n \n It is interesting that those some of them are very much Catholic. But I don't think that is because Catholics are becoming more open to same-sex marriage, or especially Catholicism in general. Catholicism has been waning now for a long time--the great Cathedrals of Europe as well as the smaller churches there are often more empty now than filled with people. That's not because of the nature of religion or that people are getting less religious, because protestantism and evangelical Christianity has been florishing world-wide. I rather like Catholicism (though I'm not a Catholic), but it does tend to be rather ritualistic in a modern fast-paced world. I think the fact that these nations went against their Catholic roots is a more of a result of the fact that Catholicism has been waning (and in Europe is more of a cultural identity than a religious one).\n \n And I am sure there will be some other nations too that will redefine marriage. But for the U.S. it's not really on the radar screen, and as far as I'm concerned there are a lot of things other countries do that we have no business following suit.",

Talk about grasping! You will see anything you want to see to discredit gay rights. \n \n \nBut for the U.S. it's not really on the radar screen,\n\n \n Well we'll see.\n \n \nand as far as I'm concerned there are a lot of things other countries do that we have no business following suit.\n\n \n Yet you try to discredit gay marriage, by saying most countries don't recognize it. Arguing against it, because of what the majority of countries do. Now you seem to suggest that isn't important to you.",
