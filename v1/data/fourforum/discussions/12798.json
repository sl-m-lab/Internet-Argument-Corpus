   "Can the average American afford health care? \n \n ------------------------------\n \n Uninsured face avalanche of health costs\n May 28, 2009\n \n By Deborah Charles\n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Jim Hann learned he would be laid off, he scheduled surgery to donate a kidney to his wife.\n \n Steve Drake rationed his asthma medicine after he was let go while two-time cancer survivor Roberta Furchak had to draw on precious retirement savings to ensure her tests were covered after she lost her job.\n \n All three were trying to compensate for losing health insurance in a country where unemployment often means going without coverage.\n \n With unemployment rising to its highest level in more than a quarter century, more Americans are confronting the double crisis of losing both their jobs and their employer-sponsored insurance, which covers 177 million people.\n \n Many unemployed Americans say they cannot afford the high premiums insurance companies charge for personal policies. People like Furchak and Drake who have pre-existing medical conditions have a tough time even finding coverage.\n \n A recent study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said the number of uninsured Americans could jump to more than 65 million in 10 years as healthcare costs more than double. The U.S. Census Bureau says about 46 million Americans are currently without insurance.\n \n President Barack Obama has vowed to reform the healthcare industry and lawmakers are struggling to figure out a compromise all can agree on.\n \n (continued at link)\n \n Uninsured face avalanche of health costs | U.S. | Reuters",

The US could nationalise the system and save money, not cost more. I fail to see how a tax rise is a problem if it is accompanied by a larger drop in other outgoings. In fact, removal of healthcare costs for companies will likely result in a massive stimulation of the economy, as fewer costs fall directly on employers. Match this with income tax raises on the highest earners, an increase in capital gains and corporation tax and you probably bring in more money. The only people who suffer are the HMOs.",

   "Many here probably think my post above is paranoid and an exaggeration of reality, right? Well it isn't. It is being discussed right now as a solution for the out of control spending which Obama is heaping upon future generations in order to transform America from a capitalist democracy to a socialist welfare state. Here's the evidence with a link and an excerpt from it. \n The federal budget deficit is projected to approach $1.3 trillion next year, the highest ever except for this year, when the deficit is forecast to exceed $1.8 trillion. The Treasury is borrowing 46 cents of every dollar it spends, largely from China and other foreign creditors, who are growing increasingly uneasy about the security of their investments. Unless Congress comes up with some serious cash, expanding the nation's health-care system will only add to the problem.\n \n Obama wants to raise income taxes for high earners and impose new levies on business, but those moves would not generate enough cash to cover the cost of health care, much less balance the budget, and they have not been fully embraced by Congress. Obama's plan to tax greenhouse-gas emissions could raise trillions of dollars, but again, Congress is balking. [snip]\n \n A VAT's Bottom Line\n \n What would it cost? Emanuel argues in his book that a 10 percent VAT would pay for every American not entitled to Medicare or Medicaid to enroll in a health plan with no deductibles and minimal copayments. In his 2008 book, \"100 Million Unnecessary Returns,\" Yale law professor Michael J. Graetz estimates that a VAT of 10 to 14 percent would raise enough money to exempt families earning less than $100,000 -- about 90 percent of households -- from the income tax and would lower rates for everyone else.\n \n And in a paper published last month in the Virginia Tax Review, Burman suggests that a 25 percent VAT could do it all: Pay for health-care reform, balance the federal budget and exempt millions of families from the income tax while slashing the top rate to 25 percent. A gallon of milk would jump from $3.69 to $4.61, and a $5,000 bathroom renovation would suddenly cost $6,250, but the nation's debt would stabilize and everybody could see a doctor.\n \n Sales Tax Gains Momentum\n \n Burman, who helped House Democrats craft an unsuccessful 2007 plan to repeal the alternative minimum tax, said he's received a number of phone calls from lawmakers interested in his idea, though \"they can't quite imagine how to make it happen politically.\" Burman said the 25 percent rate has caused some sticker shock, and he's trying to figure out how to bring it down.washingtonpost.com\n \n What I also find incredible is the dishonesty of the socialists to call a tax which adds extra cost to the price of everything consumers purchase a value added tax (VAT) as if raising the cost for the end user actually adds value to the item being taxed. \n \n And if you will claim this is just talk, don't miss this part of the article:\n A White House official said a VAT is \"unlikely to be in the mix\" as a means to pay for health-care reform. \"While we do not want to rule any credible idea in or out as we discuss the way forward with Congress, the VAT tax, in particular, is popular with academics but highly controversial with policymakers,\" said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for White House Budget Director Peter Orszag.\n \n Still, Orszag has hired a prominent VAT advocate to advise him on health care: Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and author of the 2008 book \"Health Care, Guaranteed.\" \n So notice how this administration always says what they know we want to hear up front, as they have simultaneously hired the brother of Obama's chief of staff as an administration insider pitching this very VAT vehicle for financing an ever expanding government, rather than creating new ways to rid us of the trillion dollar deficit. emoticon_rolleyes",

Corporate taxes and increased income taxes would be sufficient to fund public healthcare, it's just a question of levels.\n\n \n Of course it's a \"socialist\" mechanism for centralizing a nations wealth for governmental control and dispersal. And most all of Europe is doing it. What amazes me is that you can admit that and then claim that the socialists are against it. If they find it so regressive which it is, why are they doing it? \n \n What I find so incredible is that the left will openly claim they are against bad policies as they endorse, support and institute them in the very next breath as the only rational solution to their out of control spending for programs which purposely centralize power and spending. Here's an opposing view of it.\n The VAT Cat Is Out of the Bag [Larry Kudlow]\n Everyone should closely read today's Washington Post story on the value-added tax, or VAT. The cat is now out of the bag. For months I have argued that Team Obama and the Democratic Congress were going to be forced to consider a VAT in order to pay for their extravagant spending. Now borrowing almost 50 cents on every new dollar spent, the Democrats will at some point begin to deal with the politics of deficit reduction as a way of countering Republican criticisms about deficit expansion. And the VAT's part of their answer.\n \n Senate Budget Committee chair Kent Conrad calls the VAT \"fundamental tax reform,\" and he argues for a VAT plus high-end income-tax hikes. The WaPo story talks about a White House conference earlier in the year where \"a roomful of tax experts pleaded with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to consider a VAT.\" Budget chief Peter Orszag hired prominent VAT supporter Ezekiel Emanuel - the brother of White House staff director Rahm Emanuel - as an adviser.\n \n Of course, President Obama blew an even bigger budget hole into long-run planning with a cap-and-trade proposal that would exempt 85 percent of the tradable emissions warrants from any auctions. In other words, it's a free lunch, making a bad idea even worse. But the Democrats are going to want to hang on to their massive increases in social-spending transfer payments, along with the big expansion of health care and who knows what else.\n \n Now remember, this VAT tax would come on top of existing income, payroll, and business taxes. This is how the European countries and many others do it. And the VAT is a tax imposed throughout the economic food chain, at all levels of production, finally ending up inside the consumer pocketbook.\n \n The VAT is a sure way to permanently depress economic growth. It's also a sure way to Europeanize the American economy. But at some point, after the economy gains at least some cyclical economic-recovery traction, the Obama Democrats will want to re-label themselves as deficit-reduction fiscal hawks. Hence the VAT, a real bad idea.The VAT Cat Is Out of the Bag - Larry Kudlow - The Corner on National Review Online",

Either way there is more money to pay off debt that isn't going into the offshore accounts of a few wealthy shareholders.\nI understand your point...my point is that we really can't afford to do anything about it. Look at it this way, if you continuously borrow $100 and reduce it to $80 you are STILL in debt. This is basically the proposal and I doubt it would work out as well as that. It is unrealistic to assume you can get that money from the rich and corporate income tax. You'd obviously have to raise taxes on the entire population to get the roughly 2 trillion you'd need. If the rich paid just half of that you are looking at increasing their taxes $200,000 per household (assuming rich means household making over $250,000 or so). In the mean time we actually need to pay for the things we used over the past 50 years in order to get our debt down. You can only get this from the rich too. The rich are going to be out of money! \n \n You are left giving health care costs to everyone which would be partially offset by employers not paying it anymore. Sadly this isn't the plan anyway. From what I've read you still want to have the insurance companies but we want to insure the other 50+ million people. This means keeping what you have AND adding costs. A $300 billion or so idea ($5,000 per person or so) per year on the rich is also another $50,000+ in taxes which is fine for the person making $5 million but not soo good for the \"rich\" household making $250,000.\n \n I mean it just comes down to the fact that we can't afford our current system AND we can't afford any other system.

You seem to be saying that all taxation is socialist. This is a perfectly valid opinion, but not one that it terribly useful for debate as it just allows you to label anything you don't like as socialist.\n\n \n I will respond to this post by offering this linked article as a rebuttal to your fallacious claim that I label any tax I don't like as socialist. What Obama is doing is bankrupting america on purpose by spending money we don't have in order to change the fundamental type of government the US is without concern for cost as he will then force us to pay for his new type of european government oversight through higher taxation.\n \n On the one hand you admit that the EU practices this government control yet you deny it is socialism. It is you who is in denial of what you are living under and you have no right or opinion to voice what we do here in the USA. Screw your political systems up but leave ours alone. I don't want to follow the failing system in Europe. It makes no sense at all to abandon what has made us the most powerful economy on Earth and replace it with what has been floundering for decades in Europe.\n Greedy Politicians Intrigued by Value-Added Tax to Finance European-Style Welfare State in America | Cato @ Liberty\n \n Not surprisingly, the Washington Post did not bother to quote any free-market people who oppose giving politicians a new source of money. For what it is worth, I wrote a piece for National Review in 2005 that explains why a VAT is a terrible idea. The core arguments are just as relevant today as they were then:\n  A VAT might have some theoretically attractive features, but it is a perniciously effective way of raising revenues and inevitably leads to bigger government. The best evidence comes from Europe. Back in the mid-1960s, the burden of government in Europe wasn't that much higher than it was in the United States. Tax revenues consumed about 30 percent of gross domestic product in Europe. The U.S. had a small advantage: The tax burden, including state and local governments, was about 27 percent of GDP. But then European governments started adopting the VAT. Denmark was the first to do so in 1967. France and Germany followed, with many other European nations imposing the tax within 5 years. For politicians, the VAT was great news. Besides being a new source of revenue, the VAT has been a disturbingly easy tax to increase since it's built into the price of products and hidden from consumers. Moreover, even small increases generate a big pile of revenue because the tax base is so broad. The tax has become so easy to raise that VAT rates in Europe average more than 20 percent. For taxpayers, however, the news has been disastrous. Thanks to this levy, the burden of government in Europe today is much higher than it is in the U.S. On average, taxes consume about 41 percent of Europe's economic output. While other taxes have also climbed, the VAT certainly has helped finance the explosion of social welfare spending that creates such a drag on European economies. In the U.S., by contrast, the total tax burden as a share of GDP is about where it was 40 years ago - 27 percent... Many European governments...claimed that more destructive taxes would be reduced or repealed once the VAT was implemented. In the short term, this was true: As late as 1975, taxes on income and profits were lower in the EU than they were in the U.S. But this was a transitory phenomenon. Income-tax rates quickly began climbing and almost immediately jumped above U.S. levels. Ironically, the VAT facilitated higher tax rates on income since politicians often argued that a higher VAT had to be accompanied by higher income-tax burdens to ensure the tax burden wasn't being shifted to lower-income taxpayers. There is only one scenario that would make a VAT acceptable. If U.S. lawmakers were willing to repeal the 16th Amendment and abolish all taxes on income, a VAT would be an acceptable risk. But until that happens, taxpayers should vigorously resist the Europeanization of America.",
