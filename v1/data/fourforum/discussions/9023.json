Are you saying there are first class doctrines that are iron-clad infallibly pronounced, and others in another softer squishier category that are believe it or not?\n\n \n Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 1261 (CCC 1261) As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: \"Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,\" allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.\n \n From:\n http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1261.htm\n \n Others who are not babies can also gain entrance into heaven without baptism according to Catholic teaching:\n \n CCC 1258 The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament.\n \n CCC 1260 \"Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.\" Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.\n \n CCC 1281 Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, can be saved even if they have not been baptized (cf. LG 16).\n \n Baptism is normatively necessary. This means that it is the most appropriate way to come into communion with God and gain salvation. But it is not absolutely necessary. This means that we cannot put limits on God's power to save. Though God bound the sacraments he is not bound by the sacraments.",
