   "Assuming you want a real reason as opposed to a bunch of \"we just hate people who are different from us\" junk.\n \n Hitler hated the jews because he imagined a Jewish conspiracy. At the time, the economy in Germany was shot, yet many jews were prosperous. German jews at the time were almost universally unwilling to loan money to non jews and there were many jews in the banking field.\n \n From a realistic standpoint, German Jews were not disproportionally prosperous because of some vast conspiracy, but because they were taught to be thrifty and to save money (as most jews are today). Like most stereotypes, the image of Jews pinching pennies is somewhat grounded in reality. It is a teaching of their religion to be thrifty and save your money.\n \n As far as the Jews being more willing to ledn money to other jews than non jews, this was partly because they had better credit than your average german of the time (again, due to cultural tradition). Jews are also taught to stick together (which leads to anti semitism in some cases even today). Jews do business with other jews, give jobs to other jews and prefer to deal with other Jews.\n \n I have a jewish brother in law who openly admits that the only reason he got his job is that he was the only jewish canidate and the guy doing the hiring was jewish.

Haulingboat alluded to this with his observations about their relatively low crime rates and also their productiveness in various endeavors.\n \n I have heard that the hand that rocks the Jewish cradle is a demanding one. I think much of the credit goes to Jewish mothers who expect great things from their sons and daughters. They push them to grow up to be doctors and lawyers and such. It was probably as much a part of a young Jewish boy's life to have that message ingrained and drilled in his head as it was for you and I to be playing a game of sandlot baseball. The focus to succeed and better oneself is a powerful, relentless message in the Jewish community. Then combine that with the means to equip themselves for it. Relatives are often called upon to provide for the best education possible if the immediate family is unable to. Rich uncles often provide a leg-up in business endeavors. This thinking permeates entire communities which take a direct interest in their young. \n \n They, more than any other people, have learned the power of networking and how to translate it into success.\n \n And what does success breed?

   "Business acumen\n \n One of the most influential pieces I've ever read about this subject we're discussing was written by Mark Twain over a century ago. Twain, IMO, possessed one of the keenest minds ever into human insight and had the additional gift of a sharper tongue. \n \n He was visiting Europe during the turn of the 20th century, shortly before the continent engulfed itself in world wars, and was an eyewitness to some of the most open, vitriolic hatred ever expended on the Jews. \n \n After writing an article or two about his experiences, an American Jew wrote him and asked the same point-blank question which Haulingboat asked. We are fortunate to have Twain's response saved online, an essay entitled \"Concerning the Jews\" and I'll link to it below for those of you who are interested in learning more about this subject.\n \n At this point in his career, Twain was now an atheist, but he used the story in Genesis of Joseph being sold into bondage in Egypt and how, just a few short years later, was in possession of the grain supplies of the entire country as the \"quintessential Jewish story\". It is one of business acumen, and in the history of the world, we have never seen anything like their dominance in this regard. Twain wrote:\n \n \"... the Jew is a money-getter; and in getting his money he is a very serious obstruction to less capable neighbors who are on the same quest. I think that that is the trouble. In estimating worldly values the Jew is not shallow, but deep. With precocious wisdom he found out in the morning of time that some men worship rank, some worship heroes, some worship power, some worship God, and that over these ideals they dispute and cannot unite - but that they all worship money; so he made it the end and aim of his life to get it.\"\n \n They have gravitated toward certain industries such as banking, entertainment, and manufacturing. The relatively few I know seemed to have a sixth sense about them, always seemed a step or two ahead of the competition, but still were excellent listeners, as though one never knew when a scrap of useful information would be gleaned from a conversation. I got the impression the midnight oil was being burned, yet they never gave the appearance of doing so.\n \n As simple as I can say it-they are fierce business competitors. Historically, few non-Jews have been able to compete head-on. Their pencils seem sharper, their noses closer to the grindstone. As Twain observed: \n \n \"I am persuaded that in Russia, Austria, and Germany nine-tenths of the hostility to the Jew comes from the average Christian's inability to compete successfully with the average Jew in business - in either straight business or the questionable sort.\"\n \n How many businessmen, seeing their business flounder, are willing to admit they are being out-smarted and out-hustled? Very few I suggest. It's easier to imagine a conspiracy, or an uneven playing field, than to look in the mirror, and to invest in midnight oil. \n \n How to deal with that reality?

   "In the early 20th century, the economic succes of the jewish community was largely due to their tradition in banking. This tradition was established during the middle ages in europe as the catholic church forbade making interest out of lending. The jews where allowed to handle the lending business as they where not bound by the christian dogma. As the industrial revolution hit Europe, the banking business flourished. Investing capital was the best way to get rich which increased the demand for loaning money. This naturally led to hiogher interest rates and higher profits for the banking business. Another important aspect of the economic succes of the jewish community in the 20th centruy that is still important today is their cultural emphasize on education. I don`t know exactly where this comes from but I would guess it has something to do with the fact that education was for a long time the only way to reach any higher levels in society for a jew. Jews where not treated as christians and did not have acces to the upper levels of the eudalistic system in Europe. The only way was to \"cheat\" the system through getting a good education that required the aristrocrats to treat the jews with at least a smudge of respect.\n \n I have nothing but awe and respect for these aspects of the jewish culture in europe.\n \n Edit: However, the similarities between those preying on the jewish pariha status in early 20th century europe and those advocating higher taxes for the upper levels of the income bracket is non-existant. The day Kerrys supporters starts kill off the rich or starts to advocate different legal statuses for rich and poor, I might give your comparrison credit. Until that day however, I see no connection.",

   "I would finally like to point out what is fairly obvious and has been a source of much persecution throughout the centuries, they were Christ-killers. We have already established that antisemitism is older than New Testament times, so this musn't be thought to be a root cause perhaps, but it is important to understand how handy this excuse is and how effectively it works on countless people who don't enjoy doing a lot of personal thinking on their own.\n \n And it takes so very little thinking to see there is no basis for it. After all, Jesus was a Jew. To conduct a short ministry and then die for us-that was his purpose, according to Christian thought. Yet the need to find a scapegoat is a strong one. And in case some didn't quite make the connection on who that should be, ask yourself: who betrayed Jesus? Yes, that's right-JU-das. I've often wondered why Judas isn't honored instead of being vilified. After all, if it weren't for him, the entire salvation plan would not have come to pass. But I'm digressing.\n \n There is power in the accusation of Christ-killer, make no mistake. It is a coiled snake, hissing with hatred, ready to strike in a split-second, and has been lying in ambush, barely covered in the tall grass, for two thousand years now.\n --------------------------------------------------\n I have a couple more observations I'd like to share.\n \n It's pretty common to hear the term \"damn Jews\", in everyday conversations, as in a couple farmers talking, \"The price of a bushel corn sure is low this year.\" \"Yeah, damn Jews.\" It's shorthand for, \"I don't really know why, but I'm powerless to do anything about it.\"\n \n One last: Although anyone can be a Jew, it is safe to say they can be identified by racial features: Olive skin, smallish eyes, and an aquiline nose. The latter two usually aren't associated with a universal standard of beauty. Appearance is very important, I am sorry to report. The Nazis were effectively able to caricature the Jews as human rats to the general German population. One wonders if their features were more in line with say, Scandinavia, if the ensuing insanity would have ever occurred.",

The gap between the haves and the havenots has grown tremndously over the last few years. I don't worry that the rights of the rich are in jeopardy, what a laugh. I also don't think we can solve our social problems by taxing rich people until they're poor.\n \n See the real trick is to get those who make $200,000 a year to support the agenda of those who make $2-20 million a year. When the guy making millions a year is taxed at the same rate as me I'll worry about him being overtaxed. That has never happened in this country.",
