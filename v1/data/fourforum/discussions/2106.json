   "Against a background of neighbor countries Belarus reach for the West. But its leaders forget about Georgia and Ukraine experience. Lukashenko should understand at the end that promised by Soros close economical cooperation with West is a provocation. And that his concessions will be used against him. First who suffer is a president and then citizens. They will pay good for such re-orientation the line to the West. When West begin to help Belarus it will demand democratic liberties that will mean opposition growth. The USA as usual finance TV opposition promotion and so on. All the **** will lead to the political crises and change of power.",
