   "Faith, you gotta have Faith! The Law of Identity (A = A) is invoked in debates because agreements are difficult, if not impossible where common definitions can't be reached, and most of all in Religion or Comparative Religions. Please ponder with me, the meaning of the word:\n \n Faith:\n \n IMO, this word holds dramatically different and contrasting meanings in the scrum of Theistic - Atheistic debates.\n \n When the Bible talks about &#8220;faith,&#8221; it does not refer to it in terms of unreasonable belief or something that lacks evidence. As the theologian Millard Erickson says, the nature of faith is twofold: &#8220;giving credence to affirmations and trusting in God.&#8221;\n \n God has poured out evidence and good reason for us to believe in Him through his Word, through his action in history, logical inference, morality, imagination, the Incarnation, love, and through other ways. \n \n So where does &#8220;faith&#8221; come in when we have evidence? The meaning of faith in a simple synonym&#8212;trust. Faith is trusting what there is good evidence to believe is true.\n \n Far and away across the battle lines of contrasting Religious Philosophy, and a Postmodern secular or cultural take, where, &#8220;faith&#8221; conjures up unhelpful connotations.  Importance of Philosophy.com in brief, defines faith this way,&#8220;It is when one accepts a statement as true without evidence for it, or in the face of evidence against it.&#8221;\n The Skeptic&#8217;s Dictionary defines faith like this, &#8220;Faith is a non-rational belief in some proposition. A non-rational belief is one which is contrary to the sum of evidence for that belief.&#8221;\n Still more confusing, in our culture, we often use the word &#8220;faith&#8221; as a synonym of &#8220;religion.&#8221; Many speak of the Hindu faith, Buddhist faith, Muslim faith, but they really mean &#8220;religion&#8221; put in softer terms, while also subtly signifying that they are all basically the same. In the modern Western context, if something is a &#8220;faith&#8221; or someone practices &#8220;faith,&#8221; it does not count as knowledge. There is no way to verify it with evidence. In fact, many imply that a person of faith is one who throws reason out the window.\n \n On this view, how would you arbitrate between one religion and another, or between one worldview and another? This is exactly what secularism says, &#8220;All religions are fundamentally the same but superficially different.&#8221; Are religious people, especially Christians, capable of having a reasonable faith? Are we Christians allowed to stand on something solid, something we can actually know?\n \n Thankfully, the Bible consistently speaks clearly about faith and reason. In my personal experience, every time I am challenged I search back or reach out and discover my Faith is confirmed by the evidence, and that evidence increases my Faith! In Acts 26:25, Paul in defense of the Gospel says, \"What I am saying is true and reasonable.\" Addressing Timothy, Paul writes:\n \n &#8220;This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith&#8221; (I Timothy 1:18-19).\n \n Can we all get along and accept each other's \"faith\" with Tolerance and good cheer this CHRISTmas season?",
