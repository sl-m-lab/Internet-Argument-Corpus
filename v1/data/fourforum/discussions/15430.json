Without congressional approval or constitutional authority the TSA is being elevated to a full force threat, pushing harder and harder against the people. \n \n And knowing what we do from history about angry people in the middle of an economic crisis when the government starts pushing them harder and harder, this may very well be the straw that breaks the camel's back and causes the pressure cooker to explode.\n \n And considering how liberals are gonna be getting junk groped just like everyone else when in a public place like a bus stop, they might be joining the anti-government movement because they don't wanna get violated and molested.",
