   "http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6396.pdf\n \n Meet Senate Bill 6396, an unreasonable assault on a law abiding person's second Amendment rights. Yet another attempt at banning so-called \"assault weapons\", but this bill goes much further than any other state; even further than California. Look:\n \n \n(20) \"Assault weapon\" means:\n (a) Any semiautomatic pistol or semiautomatic or pump-action rifle or shotgun that is capable of accepting a detachable magazine, with a capacity to accept more then ten rounds of ammunition\n\n \n Pump action rifles and shotguns have been around since the 1880s back during the era of the cowboys. They're literally some of the oldest designs to still be made in today's world. But the anti-freedom, rabid gun-hating fanatics obviously feel that ancient technology is too evil to be owned.\n \n Further:\n \n \n(c) Any semiautomatic pistol, any semiautomatic, center-fire rifle,\n or any shotgun with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds of ammunition;\n (d) Any shotgun capable of accepting a detachable magazine;\n\n \n A lot of semi-auto shotguns, used for hunting since the beginning of their creation, have the ability for the magazine to be extended with a commonly available kit. And these gun-hating fanatics want them all taken away under threat of prison for noncompliance.\n \n What was that you gun haters were saying? That you only want \"reasonable, common sense, well meaning\" gun control laws?\n \n I think you should justify yourselves and explain exactly how this proposed law would qualify as reasonable, as common sense, and as well meaning.",
