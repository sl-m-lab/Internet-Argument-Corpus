   "Link:\n http://www.geocities.com/kfzhouy/Partye.html\n \n This chronology contains the lists of the ruling parties of the countries in the world as well as the periods when they were in power. The regimes included in this chronology are confined to those which adopted a constitution or a modernised form of government. All ancient regimes and the few modern regimes with no constitution are excluded. \n \n The \"Ruling Parties\" listed in this chronology refer to the political parties of the chiefs of state holding real powers. This may mean different posts under different political systems. Under the \"Presidential System\" (of which USA is a typical example), this refers to the President. Under the \"Parliamentary Cabinet System\" (of which Germany and Britain are typical examples), this refers to the Prime Minister, Premier or Chancellor. For those countries which adopt a \"Semi-Presidential\" type of political system (such as the Fifth French Republic, Finland ) or a political system under which the posts of President and Premier are occupied by different political groups (such as Serbia and Montenegro), the political parties of both the Presidents and the Premiers are listed. For those countries with a constitutional monarchical system or absolute monarchical system in which the monarch holds real political powers despite the presence of a prime minister or even a party cabinet, and thus the political parties forming the cabinet are not regarded as ruling parties in this case. Finally, for those countries that do not belong to any of the aforesaid political systems or that are undergoing political changes, the ruling parties are identified according to the particular situation. \n \n There were often the cases when political parties formed coalition government. In this case, only the political party of the chief of state holding real powers is regarded as the ruling party. However, under particular situation when the coalition became an institution or a consensus of the whole nation, then the coalition will be regarded as the ruling party. In addition, there were also many cases in which the monarch, a royal member, an army officer or other non-party figures assumed the post of chief of state, or people from different parties acted as collective chiefs or chiefs of very short terms of office (less than a year). In these cases where it is difficult to identify the ruling party, the period concerned will be omitted from this chronology.",

   "That is most impressive! How log did it take to put that together?\n\n Thank you for your interest. It is hard to tell you how long it takes me to put these data together, because it depends on how you define the work. Well, it only takes me less than 2 months' time to compile it. Surprised? The reason is that the website is translated from a Chinese website of the same topic which is also owned by me. Even that Chinese website is not too hard to compile. It only takes me about 2 months' time because the information is adpated from a book I published recently. The title of the book is \"An Outline of the Regimes in World History\" (in Chinese). Well, all the hard work is devoted to the compilation of this book. In fact, I started to collect data when I was a teenager. And so one may say it takes me more than a decade to do all these things. I hope my explanation won't be too confusing. But it is the reality. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "May I ask if your impressive endeavor is for personal or professional purposes? I'm also curious about the defining index; only those powers using constitutional forms of government. Is the exclusion of ruling families/dynasties for a specific reason, such as a success/failure constitutional government comparison in your book? \n \n I wish I had the scholarly time and interpretive ability to compare constitutions. I'm wondering if they're like a majority of legal documents in that few originals exist with most being adaptions of those originals tailored to suit prevailing customs and goals of their eras.",

I hope I haven't misinterpreted your meaning. I exclude the dynasties from my chronology because there are already an abundance of such websites on the web. I hope to develop a site which is quite specialized (but not necessarily unique), in order to acquire a special status among the countless websites around the world.\n As for my purpose, it is only for personal interest to do all these things.",

For your information, I'm now developing another website named \"A Chronology of the De Facto Rulers in World History\" first in Chinese and then in English.
