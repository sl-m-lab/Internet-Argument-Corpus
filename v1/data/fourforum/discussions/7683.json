   "Just lately I've been doing my civic duty as a juror. Here's a bit of backgound.\n \n The local county court is situated in the bailey of a castle built by William the Conqueror in 1070. The courthouse itself is relatively modern; it was built in 1823.\n \n I spent two weeks hanging around in the jury assembly room, and was called as a juror on only two cases in that time. The first was wrapped up after a couple of days when the defendant decided to change his plea to guilty. The second lasted about 15 minutes before the judge dismissed the case because of some legal clanger dropped by the prosecution attorney. \n \n Lots of time is wasted. Most of it because witnesses don't turn up, or the police lose the evidence, or the lawyers make long submissions to the judge in private, etc.\n \n All this costs a great deal of public money. From a taxpayer's point of view, it's an incredibly inefficient system.\n \n Perhaps justice could be served by an inquisitorial rather than an adversarial hearing for many criminal cases, and trial by jury restricted only to the most serious felonies.",

   "I had a similar experience perhaps five years ago, being called for jury duty to our local county courthouse. Only one case came to the cusp of the courtroom, and shortly before it was to begin the defendant plead guilty. \n \n Last year I was selected to be in a pool for our federal system. I had to fill out a long form about my personal life and would then be on call for about six months. Happily, I was never called. \n \n IMO, juries are fraught with problems. Some of the worst ones are in civil trials where somehow instead of dispensing justice to the case at hand, they often decide to \"teach a lesson\" and award absurd monetary judgements.\n \n But what do you mean by an inquisitorial rather than adversarial hearing?",

   ".\n But what do you mean by an inquisitorial rather than adversarial hearing?\n\n In an inquisitorial court of justice, the presiding judge actively supervises the whole proceedings. He/she guides the search for the truth by questioning witnesses, the police, and the defendant. Attorneys play the part of 'assistants to justice' rather than partisan advocates.\n \n In the adversarial system (which we have in the US and Britain), the truth is supposed to be discovered by the familiar contest between prosecution and defence lawyers who seek, by advocacy, to convince a jury of the merits of their case.\n \n The purpose of both systems is to elicit the truth of course - but the inquisitorial process is more focused on the search for truth rather than on the rights of the accused.\n \n Inquisitorial justice does not demand a presumption of innocence that is fundamental in the adversarial system, and generally gives less legal protection to criminal defendants.\n \n I don't know whether I'm correct in suspecting that the adversarial system is more expensive to administer than an inquisitorial system: I have no comparative figures. \n \n Trial by jury is a very expensive and wasteful procedure. But it is often demanded and conceded for petty offences because there's are much better chance of being acquitted by a jury than by a sceptical judge.",

   "Being a law school graduate in a country wih an inquisitorial court system, I must say that neither concept is perfect. Simply put, no system is immune to abuse.\n \n The problem is the clients. They don't know the law and, essentially, don't care - tey KNOW they are right. They get a lawyer, they don't expect him to go for justice. They KNOW justice means they win. And the lawyer better do their damndest to make sure justice gets done! I might exaggerate, but not by much. Trust me.\n \n Lawyers need to make their money, eventually, and you can only refuse so many unfounded cases before you run out of clients. And if you don't have a case that is actually justified, you only have one thing left: use any trick you can think off to prolong the case, complicate the case, entangle the case with irrelevant issues,...\n \n In criminal cases, the above applies to the defense. The prosecution faces some of the same and many other issues. Like everybody knowing everything, except you (for some reason, it's very easy for people to believe whatever a guy in the bar says), but not being willing to testify in the court (even though they spent weeks of your time demanding you \"Do something about it!\"). The police, who everyone expects to be composed of serious, wise, patient men, reasonably educated and of firm moral character, actually has to recruit the same people as every other employer: young, irresponsible people with no sense, patience and the moral fibre that wouldn't constipate an amoeba. And these people then get faced with A) normal people who are temporarily out of control (via being a drunk, angry or young, or, most likely, all of the above) B) people who don't care about control (via being drunk, angry or a hardened criminal) or C) victims of crimes (or maybe just claiming to be victims of crime) and demanding that they \"Do something about it!\" in D) a complete absence of any clues whatsoever.\n \n All the dirt of the society just oozes down, until it gets to its final destination: Waste disposal, Hospitals, Cemeteries and the Law.

When I asked her she said yes that was true. So now I have her testimony and her \" lawers \" version of what took place. Now I talk to my younger son and he tells me he did infact take the toy in question from her,.. however he was taking it back because she had just ripped it from his hands. This was easily confirmed by an eye witness, an employee of mine. ( the oldest boy and she, just wanted the toy for themselves.)\n \n Now my oldest son was shocked when he discoverd that he along with his sister would be sitting for awhile. His protest \" I didn't take it she did \"\n I explained that as he too tried to get me to believe something that wasn't entirely true he had been just as guilty as her for the actions.

Civil law is a very coherent system of law that needs objective principles to stand correctly, but it is not as fluid as the common law. Common law is much more adaptable, but also much more manipulable and less stable. So, depending on the case, either can provide a solution that, to the naked rational eye, could be just.
