Aside from the fact that the crime was \"inappropriate e-mails, not pedophelia since there was o contact\", it involved a lone member of Congress. Compare that to a totally ineffective Democratically-controlled Congress. \n \n\n Only a idiot would fall for that. Your argument is that the Democrats are worse then the Republicans because they failed to delivery. Not that it wasn't just a stunt. There's a reason why you are steering clear of the Foley statements I've made. \n \n\n I told you already. The Foley incident was \"inappropriate e-mails\" and it was dealt with. Foley's gone. Contrast that with Stubbs, who had sex with an underage page but was only slapped on the wrist initially and them canonized by the Democratic Party. It's apples and oranges, IMO. \n \n\n Exactly like how the GOP operates.

Furthermore, you're now arguing that more legislation is better!\n \n You're no conservative, you're a flaming liberal. Not surprising as you vote Republican. What do Republicans fear more then Democrats? Conservatives. There's a reason why McCain was scuttled in the 2000 election, the Party was not about to nominate a actual Conservative. \n \n \nSad indeed. emoticon_cry\n\n \n Too bad your party is to blame.\n \n \nFirst, I wasn't aware that I had a party.\n\n \n When you constantly fail to criticize the republicans for behavior you bash the democrats are, you are a republican.\n \n Party A engages in bad behaviors A-G.\n Party B does the same.\n \n You only criticize party A for their behaviors. What does that say? unlike ME, who criticizes both and considers them cancers, you are obviously partisan. \n \n \nIt's not the party that corrupts in washington, it's the lack of accountability and the power that corrupts. National politicians believe that they re above the laws that they hold others to. Institutionalized hypocricy abounds in DC. :xcensored\n\n \n Then why are you even arguing about the parties? If the problem is the institution, why don't you try and fix that? \n \n \nMy point was that they are beter......at NOT getting caught.\n\n \n Perhaps they are. Or perhaps they haven't had time to engage in such behaviors. Hastert covered up Foley since 2002. Now Pelosi hasn't even been in power for a year. Give it time. But you are jumping the gun here. \n \n \nNo, I think that shows the dichotomy that exists in politics. Congress would defend murderers if it maintained their power.\n\n \n So again the problem is institution, not the exact people. So why not argue for term limits for everyone to prevent people from doing exactly what you say: defending murderers to stay in power? If they legally cannot stay in power, then they do not have incentive to argue for legal free zones in their offices to run crack labs. \n \n \nThe Republican defense was about the separation of powers and not about Jefferson's guilt or innocence.\n\n \n It was PATHETIC and it showed just who had something to hide. Their argument boiled down to that they were above the law in their offices. Didn't you just say that was the problem? \n \n \nBy the JD raid on Congressional Offices set a precedence and weakened Congress' power.\n\n \n Why is this a bad thing? You yourself said that Congress was corrupt. Corrupt people do corrupt things. Therefore we EXPECT them to engage in illegal behavior in their offices. Are you seriously suggesting that their offices become legal free zones where they could run prostitution rings out of? It's amazing what you're willing to defend.\n \n \nWe could argue the hierarchy of crimes all day long and not agree. So I will leave it at that.\n\n \n I don't think that Congress members should be above the law. You apparently think so. \n \n \nI think that you are over-dramatizing the case against Foley. I'll admit that I don't recall all of the sorid details, but IIRC, there was no physical contact.\n\n \n Nevermind that foley tried to get into the page's dorms and had to be forcibly prevented from entering. Nevermind that Hastert was TOLD of this in 2002 and just happened to forget. Nevermind that his behavior was REPEATIVELY reported to Hastert over the course of 4 years. Nevermind that Hastert did NOTHING, not even removing Foley from his position in charge of the pages. How you can defend this is completely ridiculous, but expected of a partisan hack who can't criticize his own party. \n \n \nIt was all done through inappropriate e-mails with a page.\n\n \n Wrong. Explain to me how Foley had to be forcibly stopped from entering the pages dorms in 2002. \n \n \nContrast that with Gerry Stubbs (D) that actually had sex with an underaged male page and was slapped on the wrist and re-elected for another 4 or 5 terms.\n\n \n Again your argument of 1 instance making a party worse then the other is just foolish. That was 1973. We can go back listing horrible thing each party had. It doesn't make one better then the other. We're dealing with THIS congress and the LAST one. You obviously cannot do this as you keep bringing up older congresses to bolster your pathetic argument that a few bills is worse then a laundry list of scandals. \n \n \nI'm a Jeffersonian Liberal that would love to see Congress work hard to dismantle most of the Federal Government. I don't want them to sit on their asses; I want them to return the country back to its prior greatness.:xcensored \n\n \n Sure you do. Except you support a party that is the anti-thesis of that view. \n \n \nEasy one. Aside from the fact that the crime was \"inappropriate e-mails, not pedophelia since there was o contact\", it involved a lone member of Congress. Compare that to a totally ineffective Democratically-controlled Congress.\n\n \n Pedophelia is not limited to contact. Get your facts straight. And he tried to get into the dorms. Furthermore, a do nothing Congress is something CONSERVATIVES like. Which proves you're nothing of the sort. \n \n I'd rather have a totally ineffective Democratically-controlled Congress then a \n pedophelic page scandal that was covered up for at least 6 years, 13,000 earmarks, fiscal liberalism on a new level, socialistic bills flying everywhere, a COMPLETELY OVERSIGHT DEVOIDED CONGRESS. But you can't criticize the republicans because you have to tow the line. Do not think, just worship the GOP eh? \n \n [qupte]I told you already. The Foley incident was \"inappropriate e-mails\" and it was dealt with. Foley's gone. Contrast that with Stubbs, who had sex with an underage page but was only slapped on the wrist initially and them canonized by the Democratic Party. It's apples and oranges, IMO.[/quote]\n \n Again your argument of 1 instance making a party worse then the other is just foolish. That was 1973. We can go back listing horrible thing each party had. It doesn't make one better then the other. We're dealing with THIS congress and the LAST one. You obviously cannot do this as you keep bringing up older congresses to bolster your pathetic argument that a few bills is worse then a laundry list of scandals. \n \n And foley did more then just e-mails.\n \n \nI said that both parties were corrupt, that power corrupts, lack of accountability corrupts. How is that hyprocritical?\n\n \n Because you put a lack of legislation as worse then a laundry of scandals. Furthermore, you refuse to criticize the Gop for things you criticize the dems for. That makes you a hypocrite. But party fanatics aren't exactly open to understanding just how warped their minds are. \n \n \nYou made a big wrong assumption in thinking that I was OK with any pork-laden bill. That's an error on YOUR part, my friend.\n\n \n I'm not friends with partisan hacks like you. The entire budgets passed by the Gop in the past 6 years were pork laden. Where were you criticizing them? Oh wait, you didn't. because you're a partisan. Fiscal conservatism doesn't matter to you, just like the rest of the GOP. Spend money like a drunken sailor and purge out all of the deficit hawks. Cost was never a real issue with the vast majority of the GOP. Sure you had a few deficit hawks ****ing about the cost, but no one paid attention. \n \n \nIf you've read many of my posts, I rate \"compassionate conservatives\" as the Republican equivalent to Liberal Democrat. :xcensored\n\n \n Except you tow the party line every chance you get. \n \n \nWhen I vote, I'm forced into te lesser of two evils. That means that I vote Republican because Democratic policies negatively impact me much more than Republican policies, in general.\n\n \n Then why don't you criticize them? If you actually believed that line of garbage, you'd be railing against them. Some of the worst criticism of the GOP comes from Conservatives. \n \n \nIn an idealistic world, I'd vote Libertarian or something else that was closer to our Founding Fathers Vision for the US: self-determination, no nanny government interference, strong defense of our borders, etc.,\n\n \n Except the GOP is the anti-thesis of those as well.",
