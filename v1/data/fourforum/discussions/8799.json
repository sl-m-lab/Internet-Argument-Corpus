   "From http://chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/4151779.html\n \n \n\n FORT WORTH -- A pastor accused of raping a church member at his house last year under the guise of casting out demons has been indicted.\n \n Leonard Ray Owens, 63, who is free on $25,000 bail, is now awaiting trial on a charge of sexual assault, a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison. He was arrested in November.\n \n Police began investigating Owens last year after a 22-year-old woman reported that Owens raped her twice at his Fort Worth home. The woman told police that in July, several months after she began attending the Prayer House of Faith, she went to Owens' home for counseling following a miscarriage.\n \n Owens told her that a sex spirit and lesbian demon were inside her and needed to be cast out, police said. The pastor then asked her to lie on the floor and began yelling at her as if she were a demon, saying, \"Loose her in the name of Jesus,\" according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n \n The woman told police that Owens pulled down her pants as he called for the demons to come out. When she tried to get up, he pushed her down, the affidavit said. The pastor then began to fight with her as if she were a demon before climbing on top of her, pinning her down and raping her, police have said.\n \n Then Owens, a self-proclaimed prophet, ordered her to wash her face in the name of Jesus and to read Psalm 105:15, which says to do no harm to prophets, the woman told police.\n \n The woman told officers that Owens raped her again a month later, after he asked her to go to his house to pray for another woman.\n \n Owens has denied having sexual contact with the woman, police have said.\n \n",
