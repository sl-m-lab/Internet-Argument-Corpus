   "Christ Jesus wasn't crucified to make society fairer.\n \n St. Louis - What is Christianity's proper role in American presidential politics? This question has gripped the 2008 campaign. From the dispute over the acceptability of Mitt Romney's Mormonism, to Mike Huckabee's musings about conforming the US Constitution more to the Bible and the controversy over Sen. Barack Obama's former pastor, the spiritual and secular realms have collided fiercely. Just this week, Senator Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton fielded questions from US religious leaders at a special forum broadcast on CNN.\n \n More broadly, arguments over public policies - from war to illegal immigration - are increasingly being infused with scriptural justifications.\n \n The media, of course, relish such controversy. So do many religious leaders, who use the occasion to offer the \"real\" interpretation of what Scripture says about a particular issue. As a result, religion and politics aren't just mingling - they're being wedded to the same goal: redeeming America's body politic.\n \n A largely Protestant nation that can trace its theological taproot to Martin Luther ought to know better. As the original Reformer, Luther understood how critical it was to separate church and state and, in a more important sense, the spiritual kingdom of Christ and the secular realm where God reigns in a hidden way through humans using reason as a guide.\n \n That is not to say that Christians today shouldn't let their Christianity inform their political values and action. They should. But the Bible is not a political playbook. Christians, or adherents of any religion for that matter, should refrain from using holy text to fight politically over human concerns. Using Christian doctrine to push a political agenda is not just rude - it is a dangerous departure from the core message of Christianity: salvation by grace through faith.\n \n Christ Jesus was not crucified to make society nicer or fairer; no, he suffered to redeem the believer from sin.\n \n Did not Christ tell Pontius Pilate: \"My kingdom is not of this world\" (John 18:36)? Which of these seven words is so hard to understand? Christians should keep Scripture out of politics | csmonitor.com\n \n One Christian's opinion, but IMO it has a lot of intelligence to it. emoticon_xagree",

   "If Luther thought it was so important to separate church and state, why did he accept state sanction of his church by German rulers, such as Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, and why if he wanted religion and politics separated, was he willing to call on the nobility, referencing scripture, to slaughter rebellious peasants?\n \n Separating religion and politics is artificial. For those of us who are believers, it is simply not possible because our beliefs directly inform our politics. Scriptural interpretation, particularly for those who believe in Sola Scriptura, is therefore of paramount political importance.\n \n Christ's kingdom is not (yet) of this world, but part of our mission as Christians is to try to be like Christ, and by extension to make our world as Christ would have it. As the prophet Micah said, \"What does the Lord require of us? That we do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God\". Justice and mercy will be at their fullest when governments do them as well as people.",

This has resulted in a patchwork pattern of enforcement in circuit courts across the nation; while some courts apply Lemon in all or most cases, others apply it in few or none. \"- From Wikipedia",

Thus it is difficult to fathom \"why so many of them\" insist on exposing this magnificent treasure to public derision by using it for the wrong purpose. The Gospel \"can illume the believer's reason in his\" secular pursuits but is not meant to be a \"script for them\".\n\n Archie, you can look this guy up for yourself.

   "\n Jesus came not only to save the sinner, but to convict the unsaved that they needed salvation. The only way to do that is for righteous believers to stand against the sin and spiritual darkness which is endemic in a sinful and fallen world.\n\n \n \nI'm sorry, but no.\n What you describe is not only NOT \"the only way to do that\", but it is COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE to achieving a goal of convincing the unsaved.\n Like I have asked you on MANY occasions, but you lack the intellectual honesty to internally (much less externally) address it, this abrasive \"You must follow my religious rules\" mentality DOES NOT CONVINCE people. The arrogance turns people off.\n \n In fact, Jesus had an explicit message to his followers. He told them that if a village did not receive them, they should shake the dust from their sandals upon leaving the village.\n He DID NOT tell them to force the villagers to abide by Biblical law, regardless of whether or not they believed.\n\n \n It's just impossible for you to accurately interpret what I say, isn't it foundit. By disregard isn't to force one to believe as we do, but we are commanded to stand fast and not slink away from defending the truth that we know to be true. No where does that imply force of any type. It's impossible to force anyone else to accept the spiritual truths of God and His word. \n \n \nThere is a difference between \"standing up\" and speaking your mind, and \"standing up\" and imposing biblical law on non-believers.\n Furthermore, you are committing a routine error here. You are confusing \"truth\" with biblical law.\n If a person does not covet his neighbor's oxe, is that \"truth\"? No.\n \n You fail to recognize what the real issue is here...\n\n \n I would like you to show where I have said I want to impose any religious laws on you. Your total and complete prejudice and blindness lies in the fact that it is you who is attempting to impose your perverted self serving laws on society in opposition to existing laws which were never imposed by any church to begin with, but by a duly elected congress. If any law opposes what you want, your consistent retort is that it is religiously motivated when it was written according to widely accepted moral standards that have always existed prior to this generation. And we have your godless community to thank for the moral dumbing down of this culture over the last 35 years.\n \n \nThe irony is that in this country, I have every right to disregard your ramblings.\n If you actually think your religion tells you to ensure others don't disregard you, and you don't question that???\n WoW!\n\n \n Amen... I totally agree. I have no power to force my beliefs on you in any way so the implication that I try to is ridiculous. What you can't do though is squelch my rights and freedoms to oppose what you represent just as your community forces its warped perspective in every corner of our society as you do. I will not allow you to disregard my right to express myself.\n \n \nOne thing that amazes me is how you can't see certain obvious solutions to the situation.\n Can you show any bible passage which claims \"Christ Jesus was crucified to make society nicer or fairer...\"?\n No. Of course you can't.\n\n \n I repeat what you responded to: This is not only incredibly shallow, but blatantly wrong.

Show where I have ever said it's my desire to force anyone to adhere to my belief system. But just as you insist on your right to spout your godless and immoral gospel, so do I demand the right to share my opposing views by giving the scriptural, NOT MY views. \n \n \nDo you get (or can you get) that this is NOT about not \"sharing the values\", but rather LEGISLATING the values?\n You can \"share your values\" without imposing them politically.\n\n \n That issue is much larger than this discussion. I'm not legislating my values on anyone, yet you try to indict me as if I'm part of the lawmakers who stand against gay marriage. What I in fact represent is another American who stands up boldly for what I believe just as you do for what you believe. What is infuriating is that you feel justified and correct in standing for your ideals while condemning me for sharing mine. Total hypocrisy and a double standard on your part.\n \n \nArchie, you can look this guy up for yourself. You're assuming too much there.\n Uwe Siemon-Netto - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n He has co-founded Christian magazines.\n\n \n Then why did he refer to christians in the third person? If I had written the article about the error of fellow christians, I would have said we, not they.\n \n \nIt's annoying how some Christian \"interpretations\" just plain REWRITE things for their own designs.\n\n \n I have rewritten nothing foundit.

The way a definition applies is this; if, when and how even a single ONE of the aspects apply,... so then does the definition.\n \n When someone uses the combination of scientific facts such as the fact that a human being's agin begins at conception, that human beings are organisms, that a human fetus is a \"human\" being, etc...

It was to oppose his claim as that claim is in many cases not correct (in fact in all cases it is not correct, because we DON'T know that ANY of the foetuses will be born if not \"butchered\" - as evidenced by miscarrages, prolapsed cords, nuchal cords, etc.).\n \n Anyone reading it can see quite clearly that my response was to oppose his claim because his claim was not true.\n \n \n \n The words YOU WERE putting into my mouth, schmuck, is that you are implying that my objection to his incorrect claim was to \"justify\" \"butchering\" foetuses/babies.\n \n Your statement in which you implied that is here: \"Of course pregnancy isn't a 100% foolproof process, but how does that fact justify the murder of healthy unborn babies?\"\n \n Of course, I never once in any of my posts even IMPLIED that because pregnancy isn't 100% foolproof that it justifies murdering ANYONE.

   "Interesting, the page you linked to in that debate is missing one thing; YOU stating your belief that we are one person. But that's beside the point.

Answers\n\n \n Well, I didn't think I was inviting a continuation of the debate you conceded, but if you want to, I'm sure we can start up a thread here. \n \n Just a comment on your post here - Yes, it is impossible to know if some generations (a father or a son or a grandson) were not listed - those do not affect the actual TIMELINE set up by the genealogy when we are told how old a person is IN RELATION TO another person (told when a person is born in relation to the age of another). I could give you a genealogy saying I was born when Bob (who is my grandfather but not a piece of information I list) was 60. Then Walter was born when I was 65 (which in the genealogy I do not say is my grandson). \n \n The two missing people (my father and my son) do not make any difference on the overall timeline - 125 years has still passed between the birth of Bob and the birth of Walter. 60 years has still passed between the birth of Bob and my birth, and 65 years has still passed between my own birth and the birth of Walter. The two missing do not matter whatsoever to the actual timeline (time that has passed).\n \n But then, we are getting OT, so why don't we start a new thread on Religion forum or E/C forum?",
