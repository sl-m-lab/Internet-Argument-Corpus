   "An interesting video, but I think it fails on a number of levels.\n \n First of all, it's vital to recognise that the radical islamist movement feeds on oppression. Stoking indiscriminate fear and mistrust of muslims among non-muslims undermines moderates and only makes it easier for radicals to sell their message. \n \n But it goes deeper than that. So long as there are human beings there will always be malcontents with a vision of how the world ought to be, typically featuring them or their ideas in a more prominent role. Such men (and they usually are men, acting out some mutant alpha-male imperative) gravitate towards and promote belief systems that appear to legitimise their hatred and prejudice. Radical islam is one such lightning rod, but equally extreme interpretations of christianity, communism - heck, even democracy - also exist. This much is inevitable.\n \n The real problem comes when people start listening to these fruitcakes in significant numbers. A few decades ago it was the Nazis. Crucially, the Allies recognised the role the post-first-world-war impoverishment of Germany had played in providing Hitler with a platform of national discontent from which to launch his campaign, and between them spent the last two years of the second world war devising an economic strategy for 'paying for the peace'.\n \n The lightning rods of today are radical islam and a kind of bizarre militant evangelical democracy, each feeding off the atrocities of the other and doing their best to denigrate moderates on both sides. Quite honestly, I despair no less listening to AA's utterly unrepentant defence of the bombing of Iraq than I do watching this video. The foresight the allies showed in the forties was woefully lacking this time around: ideology rather than pragmatism ruled the day. What little peace-planning Bush et al bothered to sponsor relied on the post-war existence of the very infrastructure that was targeted in the first days of bombing.\n \n My solution? Nothing terribly sexy. We simply need to be vigilant, looking for situations around the world that provide fertile ground for extremists, and taking steps to defuse those situations, to deny malcontents the sympathetic ears they need to become dangerous. We need to stop trying to force other cultures to respect our strength and get them to love our generosity instead. Giving the whole world clean drinking water would be a nice start, and well within our capabilties if we put our minds to it.\n \n And if we have no choice but to cause harm in the name of preventing greater harm, we need to recognise that our hand having been forced does not absolve us of the responsibilty to plan for and deal effectively with the consequences.",

   "I love Peeling to death, but I'd have to disagree here. Some of these radicals are willing to use their own CHILDREN to carry suicide bombs. The Koran is ripe for violent interpretation. I don't think our 'generosity' will convince someone who is willing to kill their own children to get at us or who will kill their sister for having a boyfriend to come to our side. They hate our way of life and our very existence and they have for a long time. It is THEY who have determined that one or the other culture must be excised from the Earth. It is they who what sworn to put the unbelievers to the sword. I for one feel, if it has to be us or them...that I'd rather it be them!",

That denomination wasn't mentioned at all in that link. Your rationale is defamatory and has no basis in truth. But feel free to believe what you like I have seen too many times how warped your perspective is.\n \n And don't get me wrong, I'm in no way an apologist for every sect of protestantism out there by any means. But you're just off the wall if you consider what you have posted to be evidence that proves the whole WOF denomination is corrupt doctrinally. Because you haven't proven anything at all in my opinion.",

   "Archy, you D.A.\n You post LESS when others ask you for information.\n \n Furthermore, I posted one link I still had on my favorites.\n There are plenty others, I have no desire to go through and sort them all simply because I KNOW you'll deride anything I post.\n You, sir, are a complete waste of time and are ignorant and willingly choose to remain so.\n \n I posted a link to a PRO-CHRISTIAN web site that is DEVOTED to exposing the problems of the Word of Faith movement.\n I even posted quick wikis of the them for a simply (and quick) explaination of them. As well as one of the more problematic styles of theology...Kingdom Now Theology.\n \n I even mentioned that Rick Ross has exposed several of their groups AND that you yourself have PREVIOUSLY used Rick Ross as a link to justify your own postings.\n \n I did NOT post a single atheistic link nor one to a disreputable source (wiki may be biased but, a search of other sites and a perusal of a local book store can often divulge the definitions of these groups.\n \n I even listed 2 BOOKS that are writen BY CHRISTIANS who EXPOSE the WofF as the anti-Christian (pagan in disguise) belief systems they are.\n \n The Kingdom Now Theology, which is VERY popular with professed Evangelical Christians (the guys your blindly accept as the base of your political party and believe to be your fellow Christians), are people who refuse to accept that God, Your God, is a Soverign Lord.\n They take it upon themselves to act in Gods place. \n \n As for the denomination not posted in the link.\n Archy, If I posted that Father Jerome of Our Lady of the Blessed Mary molested a child...tell me you wouldn't know it was about a catholic priest?\n Tell me, you wouldn't look up the web site and further information on the Church that a pastor preached at. Nor, fail to look up what affiliations they have?\n When a pastor says they're hooked up with T.D. Jakes...then you KNOW what faith they are.\n \n And that's the problem with most sectarian ignorant people. Which, truth be know, constitutes about 99.99% of ALL people.\n \n Take the Jesus Camp documentariest for example.\n All they did was think 'Hey, these Bush loving Jesus Freaks are ALL THE SAME. Let's document them (without doing much research) and show them as if though they represent ALL sects of Jesus Freaks!'\n It took me 2 watchings of the documentary to realise that certain turns of phrase, mannerisms and practices were hallmarks of WofF. And, the trip to venerate Haggard (a WofF paster) pretty much tipped it even further.\n Then, you actually have to look up the church camp the woman taught at to find more information.\n \n Archy, I even asked you to go to a WofF church yourself and witness what they teach. So that you may know from experience...since you place so much value on your own.\n \n \n This is to educate you on some small aspect you may not be aware of. If you are truely interested in correct doctrin and following your bible you should come down off your high horse and NOT be so quick to defend everyone who pretends to be your brother as you are wont to do on these forums.\n \n Arch, I've personally traveled hundreds of miles to listen to some of these peope at times.\n And, while not all WofFers teach the same IDENTICAL heresy...they ALL teach heresy.\n \n Take Joyce Meyers for example. A very popular female preacher and she has several books out. It's hard NOT to find them sold in Wal marts and major book stores...even Christian books stores.\n \n She believes Jesus had to die spiritually and suffer in hell for your sins.\n Even though the bible says that all that was needed was his shed blood spilt on the cross. \n She denies that that is the key to salvation...and places salvation in hell.\n \n You can occasionally hear this preched in it's subtle form by replacing the comment 'Jesus died for you' with 'Jesus went to hell for you.'\n But, brainwashed people who are conditioned to accept blindly that which comes from the pulpit and not to question whether is jives with scripture...eat it up and accept it. And pass it on to others.\n \n Think real hard Archy. If 90% of all Christian radio and TV programming is dominated by people like these wolves in sheeps clothing and most people think reading Joel Osteen is spiritually uplifting, what damage is being done to the body of Christ (the Christians)?\n \n What's worse to you, a believer, Archy?\n Someone strapping a bomb to their chest and killing 3 and wounding 10?\n Or someone spreading false doctrine that is blindly accepted and will lead to the eternal damnation you seem to believe awaits all who follow errant ways?\n 3 dead or 300 million burning in hell?\n \n \n And, Archy, I don't typically use a lot of 'personal' experiences that can't be verified (unlike asking you to visit their churches, or do research yourself to verify the truth of my claims) but, personally, I've had a $1200 AKC pure breed Irish Wolfhound POISONED by a WofFer who left the cult after becoming aware of what they really were and was shunned by all of their former friends and family and were in the standard throws of suicidal depression (that can be witnessed on forums when it happens to others too) and they wanted to see if their suicide attempt they were planning would be successful. An IW is larger than a Great Dane, and at 150lbs weighed the same as they did.\n \n Harm? Very real. \n \n That was over 2 years ago.\n \n I just recently was able to find another such dog for sale (they aren't a common breed) and bought one 3 weeks ago.\n \n And that's just the tip of the iceberg of what I've witnessed and was personally told by some members of such churches.\n Admissions to engaging in fraud and theft just to make ends meet. Because they were convinced what they were doing was a blessing from God.\n God presented them with that opprotunity and they'd be passing their harvest and blessings if they didn't act.\n THIS is a tangent effect of Kingdom Now theology. NOW. NOW. NOW. Don't waite on God. Do it NOW.\n It's the same mentality homosexuals use to justify their beliefs that they can both be gay and a blessed and saved child of God. \n \n And Archy, whil I see religion as nonsense and would wish for it to dissappear. I KNOW that won't happen. And many times, when I know that the person I'm dealing with is having troubles but can't (for what ever reason) accept atheism, I do direct them to a beneficial and NON-parasitical religious sect that can meet their physical and psychological and emotional needs. Typically a medium sized church that has enough extra resources and a close knit community that can help in a personal and meaningful way.\n Occasionally, this may be Catholicism if the person has strong affiliations with that. Other times it will be Baptist or Methodist for example.\n \n My take Archy, that if you're going to be a 'Christian', don't be an ignorant one. Don't be a hypocrit and don't accept beliefs that are clearly heretical/paganistic just because their coached in christian jargon.\n \n One of the most interesting things for me was that when I was a teen/young adult decades ago, I hung with pagans and new agers (where i learnt that they were frauds, made stuff up that pleased themselves and that their mish-mash beliefs were nonsense). Years later, when I started visiting a couple of WofF churches (and some Oneness Pentecostals too), I found I was hearing the SAME principles and beliefs being taught. Only they replaced new-age definitions with Christian ones. And that their teachings didn't jive with the bible or what other protestant sects were teaching.\n But, when I pointed this out to friends who went there. I was casually dismissed as someone who was 'casting doubt upon their faith' and that they would lose their blessings if they listened. This is Just like Christian Scientists (a sister sect to WofF) and even the Jehovah's Witnesses. People who can NOT listen to or accept anything that contradicts what their church leaders push.\n \n \n Archy, if you just spent a little of your time learning of the other sects out there, you'd be able to spot those who tried to pose as your brethern so that they may divide you once more.\n Much like some predatory animals/ insects will pose as their prey so as to infiltrate them....that biblical 'wolf in sheeps clothing'. \n \n \n But, I know you'll disregard all this.\n \n You're so focused on the foe that exists outside your Church that you're oblivious to the beast feasting on the one sitting next to you in the pews. And the cancer rotting the roots of your faith from within.\n \n Let's pretend you're right about there being an afterlife with a hell full of fire, torment and gnashing of the teeth.\n I'm pretty decently versed in my Christian theology. What they bible says and most of what it means. I reject it because it makes no sense to me and I've witnessed nothing worth leading me to accept, much less blindly accept. I see it as offering nothing to my life and it's promises being a fantastical tale.\n So, my damnation would have been a choice (foolish as you'd say, but a conscious one.)\n You on the other hand would be sitting right beside me suffering for all eternity too because you were led astray by a false prophet; \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.\" Matt 23:15\n \n And you know what I'd say to you then?\n \n \n \n \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! \n It BUUUUUURRNNSSSS!\"\n \n \n LOL, bet you thought I'd say \"I told you so.\"\n \n Anyway Archy, how many links would be needed to convince you of the corruption and perversity of this movement?\n \n I'd STRONGLY recommend Christianity in Crisis\n http://www.amazon.com/Christianity-Crisis-Study-Guide-Hanegraaff/dp/1565076966\n \n The author cites many examples of heretical beliefs and posts actual quotes (and where they can be found) of some of the top people of this movement from several years back.\n My copy 'walked away' with a friend several year back. \n \n and, here's another I've heard was decent but haven't read it myself.\n \n http://www.amazon.com/Different-Gospel-Biblical-Historical-Insights/dp/1565631323/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_k2a_2_txt/103-0537312-2667029?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-2&pf_rd_r=0GY093MZZAMKY9707NB5&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=304485601&pf_rd_i=1565076966\n \n and there are many others.\n Writen BY Christians.\n That's right. People who believe in God.\n \n http://www.scionofzion.com/wof.htm <- more commentary on WofFers.\n \n \n http://www.rickross.com/groups/wordoffaith.html <- rick ross links on another WofF group chronicling abuse. \n \n The Texas area has more of these stories. I used to cover the Houston area news and would hear about them from time to time. About as often as you hear about Catholic clergy abuse in national news. \n \n \n Oh well, it's late and I need sleep.\n And I think that no matter what I post, you'll find some reason to dismiss it as \"horse dung.\"\n So, I'll just say now, \"I told you so.\"\n We can shout out 'Aaahhhhhhhhhhhh! It Burns!' together when we're dead. And since your older than I, an will most likely die before me...save me a spot.\n When I'm not writhing in torment...I can be humorous. emoticon_xgood",

   "I hope that eventually, people will move past ALL religion. Look how far we've come in the West just since Christianity in General and Catholicism in Particular have lost its anaconda grip on us. The new Islamists would have us move swiftly back to the 6th century mentality but there are branches of X-ian churches that aren't immensely better. I think that pretty much all organized religion is a crutch, the same one people have been leaning on since cave paintings and pyramid building. The sooner we grow out of it the better!",
