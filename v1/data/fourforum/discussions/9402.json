Setting definitions beforehand prevents moving the goalposts. (I once again direct you to my earlier zipnats post.) For example, anybody with a rational understanding of atheism (and an unfamiliarity of your hijinks) would take your challenge in a heartbeat because you're so obviously wrong. Instead, you'll be arguing that theistic evolutionists, Deists, and most Christians are atheists. If that's the case, why bother? If you don't mean atheism, find an appropriate word or phrase. I suspect you mean \"contradictory to marc's particular brand of fundamentalism.\" If you mean neither evolution in the biological sense nor \"evolutionary theory\" as it applies to life on Earth, then find an appropriate word or phrase. I suspect you mean \"the idea that God didn't do anything at all,\" which is neither evolution nor evolutionary theory.\n \n \nI put dictionary.com's list of definitions for evolution up in this thread, post #51, and you and yours ran, remember? Do you remember number 4 from that list?\n\n You lie. There is no other way to say this. You are simply lying. I do remember. In fact, I remember that I didn't run. I remember that I posted a response, and you had nothing to say about it at all. You can't even pretend that I'm not right, because you've repeatedly referenced Darwin and Origin of Species and said nothing about society, economy, or institutions.\n \n \nWhy couldn't you display your case for definitions in the debate? Answer that question please.\n\n Because they're separate issues. See zipnats.\n \n \nWhy do you insist on stacking the deck - handcuffing the judge, with definitions?\n\n Definitions don't handcuff the judge any more than a resolution handcuffs a judge. Definitions prevent asinine claims like \"Catholics are atheists\" from being significant. I speak English, not marckian. See zipnats.\n \n \n\"Evolution\" is a broad term and you know it.\n\n Wait for it... wait for it.... All the more reason to restrict the term to a narrow definition!\n Suddenly, I think you'd really like the zipnats debate. Want to have a one round debate on that instead?\n \n If you want to debate the meaning of atheism, propose a separate debate. If you want to use some concept besides what rational English-speakers consider \"atheism,\" then put that concept into words and use those instead. The same goes for \"evolution\" and \"evolutionary theory.\"",

   "Resloved: From the 1859 publication of Origin of Species by Darwin to present day evolutionary thought and application, evolution is based upon and dependent upon atheistic principles.\n\n \n You do realize do you not that there is only a single atheistic principle to consider? That principle is the actual assertion that GOD (any GOD which is \"divine\") does not exist.\n \n Your entire debate would consist of your opponent saying - \"Evolution from Darwin to the present day does not formally deny the existence of GOD\" and you are finished unless you can show otherwise. And by Evolution I mean current scientific evolutionary theory as explicated in the refereed scientific literature. I do not mean popularizers who are stating their beliefs instead of their science - like Dawkins. I mean the actual science of the theory. OK? You do understand that the theory is NOT dependent on an explicit denial of GOD even though GOD is not invoked within the theory.\n \n Do you consider a cooking show atheistic unless the chef invokes GOD? Same with the theory of scientific evolution.",

   "Peeling, replying to Marc, quoted and replied:\n Quote:\n Inevitably, nihilism will expose all cherished beliefs and sacrosanct truths as symptoms of a defective Western mythos. This collapse of meaning, relevance, and purpose will be the most destructive force in history, constituting a total assault on reality and nothing less than the greatest crisis of humanity\n \n In other words, in Nietzsche's opinion it is the ultimate vacuity of the purpose offered by all institutions, including Judeo-Christianity, that sets us up for this fall.\n \n \n I would like to point out that this is not Nietzsche's own opinion. His sister Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche edited The Will to Power after Nietzsche went into third-stage syphilis, with heavy brain damage. It is true that Nietzsche despised Christianity, but he felt that he had a higher purpose, and was never a nihilist. He was seeking a way to create the next higher form of human life, preferably as far above us mentally as we are above our reconstruction of the common chimp-human ancestors. \n \n In fact, none of the historical nihilists of whom I am aware believed this version. Certainly the Nazis, who loved The Will to Power, didn't. The anarchist-nihilists believed that they had to destroy the structure of society (over and over if necessary) in order to reach a utopia of the mind in which there would be no illusions, and in particular no domination of one group of people by another, but that is a mythic goal in itself. I think that the only people who can credibly be called nihilists in the sense suggested are catatonics. You can't ask them, so it's hard to tell.",
