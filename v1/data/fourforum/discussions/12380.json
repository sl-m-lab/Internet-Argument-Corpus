   "After just four weeks into his presidency it is very \"transparent\" that Obama is attempting to \"change\" the US into a socialist paradise. Stimulus packages, bail-out plans, national health, housing subsidies, new welfare programs and the list goes on and on. \n \n Eloquent speeches, filled with doom and gloom, crisis predictions and promises of new give away programs were all designed to assure himself of the support of the sheep who elected him. Obama's 2012 election campaign is already in full swing. Heaven help this country if he serves more than one term.\n \n His budget speech to be delivered in a few hours is supposed to be the first to include some positive remarks. We shall see. Since taking office the stock markets are tumbling, housing prices are dropping, unemployment is rising, business and personal bankruptcies are at an all time high and consumer confidence is at an all time low. \n \n I wonder how much his approval rating has dropped?\n \n Ciao",

   "I just saw our new messiah say on the News that in order to fix the economy we must also create, and I quote him, fiscal Healthcare. Can anyone tell me what fiscal healthcare is? It is the socialist plan to place a value on the recipients of needed medical care. For example, if a healthy 80 year old falls down and breaks their hip, and a hip replacement is recommended by their doctor in order to insure a healthy and pain free life, according to Obama's plan that person wouldn't qualify for the procedure since their average life expectancy doesn't justify the cost of the operation. Go figure huh! Life will now have attached to it a monetary value based on life expectancy, so our parents who have worked lifetimes will now become disposable as we determine that they don't deserve the care to maintain a quality and pain free life. That this will shorten their lives will be used by these socialists to justify their agenda since these seniors lives will be cut short due to the decrease in quality care. It is circular reasoning at its best. emoticon_frazzled emoticon_icemoticon_xdonno:xbanghead",
