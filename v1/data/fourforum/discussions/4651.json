I ended up making the transition for our entire company becuase I employ a bunch of slackers ho surf the internet endlessly when they should be working. Spyware was a real problem.\n \n The amount of spyware that adaware finds is less than 1/20 of what it was before, and now that everybody has a 3 button mouse (which is a must have for tabbed browsing) everybody seems happy with the changes. Additionally, I LOVE the ad filter and the fact that when you install it, it imports EVERYTHING including password lists and cookies (older versions did not do this). \n \n I use an air gapped computer for things like forum surfing and some of my general web surfing, and the air gapped machine is on dial up. The Ad filter cuts down on load times considerably. The flash filter is also good for dialup folks (keeps pages from loading flash stuff, replaces it with a \"play\" button instead so it only downlods it if you want to see it).",

   "Firefox's main advantage is that it is far more secure, or fewer people are going after it, either way you'll have fewer problems, for now.\n\n Yep yep. I use Mozilla. It's the same company. And it really is more secure, even if people were going after it. IE has ActiveX capabilities (among other [dangerou] capabilities) that open up lots of holes in security. You can shut those options off, of course. Moz doesn't even let them be on so there's no chance of a hack through them. ActiveX's are needed to watch videos on Yahoo's Launch, but that's about it. In that case I go for Netscape (same browser as Moz but with ActiveX). I like Moz better than FF just because the Google bar and address bar are one on Moz and separate on FF. Moz/FF are soooo much faster than IE too. And it takes less comp. memory. I can have one Moz window with like 10 tabs and not slow down at all. 10 separate IE windows though? That's gonna slow me down a bit.",
