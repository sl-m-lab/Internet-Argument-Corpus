   "For behavior of a person both character and environment contribute their positions. Environment initiates our character to react to behave and stronger one dominates. In many cases we have noticed people felt uneasy in many circumstances (environment) but had no other options, especially in married life, and adjusted them to live with. In this married life dominated person's behavior created unfavorable environment caused uneasiness to other partner but social or economic circumstances influenced to live with that forced to submit. The influence of the environment is so strong that it forced the character to submit and behavior was submissive. Submissive characters are generally weak, these characters are not tough enough to put own strong image may be due to economic or social conditions as above example or other reasons. Environment is the surrounding atmosphere created by strong instincts that forces others to surrender or submit. On the other hand, other partner if had strong character could have led to clash and dominated or separated self. When both characters were strong with same wave length, means both positive and both negative; the environment would have suitable to both. Therefore, the action that communicates and exhibits the character of individual is behavior. Its submission or dominance depends on the environment. Positive environment always will have its impact on the behavior so higher the number of good characters stronger the positive environment. Character and environment are linked to each other and contributes their sense to behave. Click the link below:\n What is \"BEHAVIOR\"",
