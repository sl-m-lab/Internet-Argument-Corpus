   "I am delighted to see this thread. I am a proud Hindu outside the subcontinent, and a person who tries to be a good Sanatanist. Sanatan Dharma, literally translates into \" eternal dharma,\" and while I know that practices of the past has not been all good in the religion, and are very much known, since the west loves to dwell on it while tey do not see their own faults, I am yet to find a doctrine that can compare for my life. It might be different for other people, but I am prod to say I am a proud Hindu.",

   "I am somewhat familiar. Ultimately it is all unprovable romanticism.\n\n \n It will be appreciated if you can clear up what you mean by this.\n \n As far as i know, hinduism is still a living religion, which i aspire to practise, like many others thoughout the world. We may not all be perfect to it, but we tried. Some may have succeeded, but we are not a judges of who is a better hindu, or a follower of any other religion for that matter.\n \n Perhaps, its time to change that \"somewhat familiar\", into \"much more familiar\".\n \n PS. as Hindus, we are encouraged to appreciate someone else's beliefs, as it all leads to the one common goal that is salvation. No one person is more right than the other. Is this not interesting?",
