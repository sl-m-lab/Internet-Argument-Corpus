I agree with some of what all of you are saying. I agree that one can be saved by accepting God or confessing their faith and repenting (Catholics call this a baptism of desire). I believe this because although I believe that God has bound the sacraments, He is not bound by the sacraments-that is, it is a Scripturally and Traditionally clear fact that Jesus instituted the sacraments as necessary and appropriate but God is not limited by them in granting his salvation. I wanted to pose some ideas on other avenues into the entitlement of Christianity besides a confession of faith. And I think we all agree that one's faith must be lived-to live The Way most fully and most closely with Jesus then the sacraments are needed. \n \n Concerning baptism, it was the Christian equivalent of Jewish circumcision. Circumcision occurred on the 8th day and the child was accepted into the Jewish faith. It was recognized that parents can and often do speak for their children when their children are unable to do so. At some point the child must accept or reject the faith of their family. But until they are able to make that decision they are entitled to the benefits of the faith as passed on by their family. If Jesus gave his grace and salvation as a gift then there is no reason why he wouldn't give that gift to children. Early Christians understood this:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Infant_Baptism.asp \n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Early_Teachings_of_Infant_Baptism.asp \n \n Baptism does have the power to save by the gift of grace:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Baptismal_Grace.asp \n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Born_Again_in_Baptism.asp",

Being a Christian is not a routine, its a personal relationship with God. If we could not meet for church or something happens to where we cant have church, we could still be Christians. \n\n \n Practicing a religion is all important. One must live a Christian life. Jesus instituted liturgical life \"Do this in memory of Me\" He said at the last supper. Less than 100 years later we find the Didache talking of baptism, and the Eucharist (not a celebratory piece of bread; but the Body of Christ).\n \n You can still be a Christian, yes, but it is a chance at a fuller life to be a practicing Christian.\n \n You're once in a life-time fix-it is false ideology. When you marry, you've made a commitment to love, but do you leave it at that? No, you continually say \"I love you\", you act out your love, you do things in love. You can still be married, when you are assigned to work for a few days in another city, and you're unable to directly love your partner, but it is no substitute for living and experiencing married life.\n \n Marriages fail when there's no communication. A husband might say \"Of course I love her, I don't say it, but I'm there with her at night\". Making a once in a lifetime declaration is not enough.\n \n \n How many times must you confess you are a sinner? Once, or all the time should you profess yourself a sinner?\n \n \nhow is a guy, who has sinned just like everyone else, taking water and sprinkling it on ur head gonna get u a place in heaven? Im not trying to cut down ur religion and if it seems like that im sorry. I just think Catholics are mistaken.\n\n \n If I smash your car and just say 'sorry', or if I smash it, say 'sorry' and help pay for the damages... which do you think is genuine?\n \n Jesus led a liturgical life. Why did He get baptised, He who was without sin?\n \n Why when the Centurion in Acts became faithful, and a believer, was it necessary for him to be baptised? Why are whole families (including kids) getting baptised in the New Testament?\n \n I should point out too, that Orthodoxy baptises by full immersion, not just sprinkling of water.\n \n \n \n Where do you believe that the relationship with God should be personal? Why did Jesus create Bishops to administer to the flock... look at Acts, the faithful gave their money to the church to distribute - showing that there's an organisation. Further, the Bishops were the ones debating in Jerusalem about whether to include Gentiles.\n \n You're ignoring church history.",
