   "The world lost an icon this week. More importantly we lost an enormous amount of love which came to us in such a strange little package.\n \n It takes serious intellectual courage to try to connect the dots that form the pop culture template that was Michael Jackson. Nothing about Jackson's story and his life was normal. From his sexual proclivities to his bizarre appearance and behavior, Michael Jackson appeared to be about as weird a person as one can imagine.\n \n The record speaks for itself: the multiple plastic surgeries that have rendered his nose the apparent consistency of Play-Doh, the fascination with the Elephant Man's bones, the hyperbaric chambers he used as beds, the dangling of his child off a balcony, the televised shopping trips for high-end kitsch, the masks he wears in public, the fact that he gave two of his kids' the same name ...\n \n \"The damage suffered by child stars rarely shows by word or deed until they crash suddenly, leave the business, or make their way to adult success. Then comes the anger, the grief, the cynicism and - the hardest of all - the longing for a prime you've been past for most of your life.\" Margo Jefferson. Pantheon\n \n The coping mechanisms he used to deal with his inner pain-with the conflict between the child who hadn't had a chance and the adult who couldn't face his reality-never worked. His self-admitted addiction to prescription drugs, which probably started with getting burned in a fire in the late '80s, was certainly aggravated by the trial and by the multiple lawsuits with which he had to contend. An autopsy will undoubtedly show the drug problem to have been a contributing factor in his cardiac arrest.\n \n There was also the lack of vitality and other problems that stem from the likely probability Jackson was an anorectic. How that bird-like physique could have pounded out 10-hour rehearsals, to be followed by a year on the road putting on the huge extravaganzas his fans relished, is hard to imagine. \n He certainly suffered from social isolation and withdrawal, both closely related to anorexia and depression. Who wouldn't be depressed and grieving over the loss of status as the King of Pop and being $300 million in debt? His history of multiple cosmetic surgeries also indicates he suffered from dysmorphobia (the obsessive preoccupation with body parts) the nose, for example, that are felt to be ugly or somehow abnormal. No matter how many times he looked in the mirror, he never looked all right to himself.\n \n MJ may have known, deep down, that he couldn't really handle the rigors of the upcoming tour. He always wanted his performances to be perfect. Add in the tension of his financial situation, the damage to his reputation from the sexual abuse charges, and the extended loss of the love of the people (he said he wanted to live on stage, basking in the applause of standing ovations, and he hadn't performed in many many years), and I believe his heart was as damaged by the stress of his emotions as by the drugs.\n \n Michael Jackson was a tormented, lonely Genius. He carried to the grave the need for a childhood which created his world of needing love, romance and people. Pitifully his world was lonely until the end, emphasizing the importance of early childhood rearing. It would be fair to say he far exceeded his dad's expectations at the sacrifice of losing a childhood and trying to gain that part of life at his passing.\n \n He had bypassed parts of childhood enjoying the company of other children. He grew up in a world surrounded by adults. And although he was admired, loved and respected on stage his personal life was intensely lonely and depressing. He longed for being able to play with children his own age. That wish was denied him time and time again.\n \n Although Michael became exceedingly wealthy it was marked by his extreme loneliness. Not only did he not have true friends, he needed to somehow touch the childhood denied him.\n \n There is generally one of two things we do when we go through such unforgettable circumstances such as missing one of life's milestones; we are doomed to repeat it with our own offspring or we will avoid it at all possible costs. Sometimes we try to regain it vicariously through the lives of others. This is what MJ did when he was accused of pedophilia. Of all people on earth he would have been the last to have abused a child since he came from such an abusive environment. He could not possibly try to reconstruct his childhood while abusing a child at the same time. This would make no sense, not even to psychologists.\n \n For us to become judge and jury over his lifestyle simply indicates that we have no idea what Michael Jackson went through as a child. From our perspectives we couldn't understand it because we didn't experience it. What we read and saw on television where judgments of those who didn't understand either.\n \n There's a fable which comes to mind about a particular battle. It was such an intense battle between good and evil in Heaven that God sent bands of angels to fight. The angels fought so hard that any of the anger, fear, jealously, judgment, hate and sourness they possessed had been left on the battlefield. The only emotion able to be retained by the angels was LOVE exhibited by a smile. This is what God gave to us in the Down Syndrome child. Perhaps Michael's love was similar for different reasons.\n \n I always wished Michael could have found some real help to banish his childhood demons and build a stronger adult self. Once again, adult dysfunction coming from childhood abuse has robbed us too soon of all that Michael Jackson was and could have been. I believe his impact on us will be even larger after his death than it was in his glittering, one-gloved life.",
