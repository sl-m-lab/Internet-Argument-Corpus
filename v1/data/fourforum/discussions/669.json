It's apparent that you haven't extensively studied the various facets of the topic; however, you proceeded in citing statistics and other information that are not completely accurate (100% recidivism rate, causal factors of child molestors, quick fix to the problem, etc.). Also, I'm not aware of any cases in which an offeder received the death penalty for a rape conviction. There may be a few cases in which serial rapists have been executed. For the most part, the death penalty in the U.S. is reserved for capital crimes, mainly murder. Even those convicted of assault charges do not receive the death penalty.

How? \n\n Have you heard of the \"get tough on crime\" movement that has been an integral function of our criminal justice system for the past 25 years? The viewpoints of advocates for this movement correspond well with those of your own. In particular, the \"quick fix\" nature of policy makers to enact laws to allay public fears. However, in your defense, there are many others in our society (some in roles as policy makers) that share your same conservative and irrational perspective, so don't feel alone.

   "Let me get into this discussion for a moment. I am a prosecutor in Virginia. I want to give you a prosecutor's perspective of child sexual assault cases. To handle them successfully, you have to get the children to trust you enough to open up and be comfortable talking about what happened to them. A by-product of this pre-trial preparation is the emotional bond you create with these child victims. For this reason they are the most emotionally charged and gut wrenching cases of all to prosecute (even more so than capital murder cases). \n \n This past Thursday I prosecuted a man who was charged with sexually assaulting two children. I've been doing this for a long time now, and these cases do not shock me like they used to when I first started handling them. But this one really got to me because it involved yet another father who was molesting his own children, and the children bonded strongly with me and saw me as their protector. In this case, the victims were the defendant's two daughters. One was 6, and the other was 4 years old. \n \n The defendant's 8 year old son testified for me. He described how his father would send his mother to the store, and after she was gone he would order the boy to go to his room and shut the door. He would hear his father order his two sisters to go to their room (one they shared together). He would lie on the floor of his room and watch through the crack at the bottom of his door to see if his father would follow them down the hallway past his room. He would hear the girls start crying and say things like \"daddy stop.\" He would hear his father get angry with them and tell them to \"hush.\" He never saw the abuse, but he would see his sisters afterwards, and he could tell they were upset and withdrawn. It did not take him long to figure out what was going on. I kept having to ask the boy who did these things, and we went through several questions for which he would point at the defense table in answer, where defense counsel sat in a new suit, while his father sat beside him in a khaki long sleeve shirt with no tie. \"Who sent your mom to the store?\" He would point, and I would have to ask \"are you pointing at your dad?\" \"Yes\" would be his answer. \"Who would follow your sisters and go into the room with them,\" etc. Finally, when we got to the point of describing what he could hear coming from the back bedroom, he refused to allow me to associate the name \"dad\" with him anymore. Instead, he answered \"I would prefer you say I pointed at the man with no tie.\" \n \n The 4 year old girl was too scared to testify, even with the assistance of closed circuit TV. The 6 year old girl testified, and she described in graphic detail how her father would have anal intercourse with her and her sister. It was a repeated pattern of conduct spanning several months. \n \n The defendant testified, and he denied everything. The jury found him guilty, and the question of punishment arose. In Virginia, jury trials are divided into two stages. Juries also recommend the sentence for those they convict, and if a defendant is found guilty then a second hearing is conducted at which we argue for the appropriate sentence. The defendant was 39 years old, and he had no prior criminal record. As happens with all these cases, his attorney told the jury that parole had been abolished, mentioned how much of a hardship a prison sentence would be, and argued for the lightest sentence possible. I spoke of the special malice required for this type of crime where you cannot dehumanize your victim. This is not a stranger at a bus stop who has never met these children before and who should have no emotional attachment to them. This was the man for whom the day of their birth was supposed to be one of the happiest days of his life. This was the man who was supposed to chase the imaginary monsters from under the bed, and not to become the very real thing they feared coming down the hall. This is the man who is supposed to pick them up, hold them, and whisper \"it's all right, daddy's got you now\" whenever they are scared or when they fall and scrape their knee. This is the man who is supposed to proudly walk these girls down the aisle one day and give them away. These children have been sentenced to a lifetime of shame and feelings of self-guilt as they struggle to come to terms with what their father did to them: Two girls who are worrying if they are dirty or bad-if it was their fault that their father did this to them-an 8 year old boy who feels responsible as the oldest sibling for what happened to his sisters, and who feels guilty, frustrated, and angry because he unfairly blames himself for not being able to prevent it from happening. \n \n We can talk about rehabilitation and sex offender therapy if anyone wishes to. But for myself as well as all the prosecutors I work with, we see our role in these cases as being very simple: Do not bear the sword in vain. Punishment is the goal in these cases, and in considering punishment financial restitution (which is a part of what we call punishment) is rarely if ever an issue. The sole desire is to seek as large a prison sentence as can be obtained. To understand this, you have to understand the nature of the crimes and the lasting impact they have.",

As a prosecutor, I realize that you primary responsibility is to promote justice, particularly in cases such as the one you described.

As someone who is a survivor of sexual abuse, a practitioner who has worked with sex offenders, and an aspiring criminologist, I know the the dynamics surrounding the issue.\n \n However, I have a question for you: Do you believe that such stringent policies that have been developed and implemented regarding sex offenders in recent years are effective and rational? If so, why?",

   "Well, let me answer your question this way. Rationality for me is a question of the validity of legislative goals-that is, what is the government trying to accomplish. Do these goals make sense? Is it something which our government should involve itself in? Etc. Effectiveness is a measure of how well the legislation realizes these goals. Is this law the best way to achieve the legislative goal? What unintended side effects, if any, are created by the law? Etc. \n \n I can't speak for legislation in other states. Even in Virginia I don't think I can effectively generalize across a broad spectrum of sex offender legislation. I think it would be a better discussion if we took the path of divide and conquer in this area. Why don't you suggest a topic to start with from the more recent developments in sex offender legislation, like post conviction registration, post conviction intensive sex offender probation, post incarceration civil commitment, or some other topic you may prefer to start with? \n \n I can't find the time to post here every day, but I would be happy take some time to walk through a discussion of these issues and see where we agree or disagree.",

Sex offenders shouldn't be registered, but gun owners should be even though the guns are inanimate objects.\n \n You don't need a license to own, buy or use a car, especially if it's on your own land.\n \n \nWoudnt you want to know if your child was spending the night at someone who kept a full auto AK47 or FN57 in the house?\n\n \n No I wouldn't, because it's irrelevant information. I'd be more worried that my kids are making friends with sex offenders than fellow gun owners.\n \n \nOnce again only think about your own selfish rights and not the rights of everybody else.\n\n \n Everybody else in this country has the same rights as me. If I don't stand up for my rights then what's going to protect the rights of anybody else?\n \n \nThe government keeping a record of people owning inanimate objects is different than keeping a record of peoples sexual preferences.\n\n \n Not really. One group of people is no different than somebody that owns a set of golf clubs, the other is a group that likes raping little kids.\n \n \nWould you like it if all lesbians had to register because they might kill people by spreading HIV?\n\n \n Men are the ones spreading HIV disease, what with taking it up the tailpipe. If anything all men should be registered; including you.\n \n \nThe government shouldnt punish people for what they might do. But that is what its doing when it keeps a record of all sex offenders.\n\n \n You're a protector of sex offenders and a persecutor of gun owners. That's evidence enough that you're a sex offender as well.\n \n \nIn a lot of places people on the government registry cant live within 2000 feet of schools, parks, public swimming pools and day care centers so most of the city is off limits to them. And how are you supposed to get a job when everyone knows about your past?\n\n \n In all 50 states a gun owner can't be within 1,000 feet of a school while armed. How are they supposed to protect themselves while still obeying the laws?\n \n \nThats why alot of these people are forced to turn to a life of crime to make a living. That doesnt sound like a free and equal society to me.\n\n \n I really don't care about them. If somebody rapes a little kid then they used up all of their chances; that's justice, it's called due process.

I'll tell you what Matthew, click on this site: National Sex Offender Registry and put in your own address, town, state and zip code and see how many registered sex offenders live within a 3 mile radius of your address. I had 107 results for mine and I live in an upper middle class section of my NH town. Then tell me how against it you are if you have a rapist or two living in homes next to you.\n \n Also, you can click on the flags and find out what they did. You will be shocked to see how many of them had sex with children under 13 yrs old. I would be very curious to know the results of how many offenders your search showed.\n \n find offenders\n \n search by location\n \n street: \n city: \n state: \n zip code: \n ",
