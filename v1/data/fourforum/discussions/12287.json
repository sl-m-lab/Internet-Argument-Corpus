   "The task force observed that many of the studies published during the period reviewed suffered from serious methodological problems. Thus, it focused most closely on those found to be most methodologically sound to arrive at its conclusions. Inconsistencies in findings reported by published studies were judged to reflect differences in study quality and failures to control for potentially confounding factors.\n \n \"The best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy, the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first-trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy,\" said Brenda Major, PhD, chair of the task force. \"The evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain.\"\n \n The task force found that some studies indicate that some women do experience sadness, grief and feelings of loss following an abortion, and some may experience \"clinically significant disorders, including depression and anxiety.\" However, the task force found \"no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se, as opposed to other factors.\"\n \n The report noted that other co-occurring risk factors, including poverty, prior exposure to violence, a history of emotional problems, a history of drug or alcohol use, and prior unwanted births predispose women to experience both unwanted pregnancies and mental health problems after a pregnancy, irrespective of how the pregnancy is resolved. Failures to control for these co-occurring risk factors, the task force noted, may lead to reports of associations between abortion history and mental health problems that are misleading.\n \n The report noted that women have abortions for many different reasons and within different personal, social, economic and cultural circumstances, all of which could affect a woman's mental state following abortion. \"Consequently,\" the task force wrote, \"global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading.\"\n \n According to the report, women terminating a wanted pregnancy, who perceived pressure from others to terminate their pregnancy, or who perceived a need to keep their abortion secret from their family and friends because of stigma associated with abortion, were more likely to experience negative psychological reactions following abortion.\n \n The task force noted that despite the importance of understanding the mental health implications of abortion compared to its alternatives - motherhood or adoption-very few studies included appropriate comparison groups for addressing this issue. One of the task force's chief recommendations is for better-designed, rigorously conducted future research on the topic to \"help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives.\" APA Press Release: APA Task Force Finds Single Abortion Not a Threat to Women's Mental Health\n \n This was brought up in another thread, so I figured if it were to be discussed it should be discussed in the right thread.\n \n I see some interesting attributes in this study, and a definitive call for further research.\n Also a demonstration that any negative post-abortion reaction is typically involving an exterior factor. This is similar to people trying to rush to associate \"depression\" to homosexuality, when it is not the homosexuality which causes the problem but rather something exterior to the homosexuality.",

   "Oh, and this is the part of the critical info:\n \nAccording to the report, women terminating a wanted pregnancy, who perceived pressure from others to terminate their pregnancy, or who perceived a need to keep their abortion secret from their family and friends because of stigma associated with abortion, were more likely to experience negative psychological reactions following abortion.\n\n Pressure, real or not, appears to be an important factor in psychological problems following abortion.\n \n We do have a heavy-duty societal onus on us which has not yet been removed concerning \"fallen women,\" \"bastard babies,\" etc.\n \n Also, there is probably some indication that women who have multiple abortions were mentally unstable to begin with. No sane woman would repeatedly find herself pregnant and would feel that she should abort.\n \n I've personally noted one weirdo who seemed to be actually one of those women who got pregnant on purpose to abort so that they could feel guilty about it. She was something of a religious sicko.",
