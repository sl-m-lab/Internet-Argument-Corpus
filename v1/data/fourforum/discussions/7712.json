   "it apparently sounds like a good idea. I don't know anyone on it, but I think there are like 4 breaks around 3 weeks long, instead of 3 months of summer vacation and spring and winter break. Summer vacation is nice, but really uneccessary. I'd much rather have 3-week breaks (plenty of time to go on vacation or do everything else done in summer besides get bored :)) 4 times a year. I heard someone else (a student) bring up something about year-round school, fewer breaks, but 4 days a week (52/7 = 7.4 weeks of vacation, less than we have now for summer vacation). Not sure how it would work, but since I graduate next year, it's probably too late for me anyway :(",

   " It is apparent most do not know how the Year Round School system works. A student is not in school for the whole year. Each school or town is set up into a 4 block system. While 3 blocks are attending school, the 1 block is out. It works like this: basically 3 months in school, 3 weeks off, for the whole 12 months of the year. This is the way our town/school were set up. This opens up a vast amount of opportunities for the students as well as the teachers! Students can be involved all year in projects or sports, they can catch attend a class during the \"off\" time if they need to catch up, families are not limited to the summer for vacation time, they are not home in front of a t.v. or video game for 12 weeks during the summer! Teachers are employed all year, they can take vacations though out the whole year, teachers can help students who need the extra help. There is less need for parents to try to find a sitter for 12 or more weeks for younger kids. The \"Summer Job\" issue is really not a problem, most employers liked the idea of having the students during the 3 week \"off time\", they worked with every one and they even kept some students employed longer then just for the summer. You people really need to know how the system works before you give you opinion on some thing you know nothing about. It is time to grow and to grow up.  As a student, I attended a YR school. As an adult and parent, I wish we had the YRS. I have seen many students in my childrens classes who whould have benifited greatly from the YRS. It is time we start looking at the progress the world around us has made and then look in the mirror. We need to catch up!",

This meant that some households had students who did not attend the same school and thus had some children on vacation while the rest were still in school.\n \n Furthermore, year-round school here was simply spreading out the summer vacation over the calendar year. Students still only spent 180 days in school.\n \n I am in favor of year-round school if it allows students to enter at a later age or graduate at an earlier age because the K-12 180 day school schedule is condensed so the school facilities are used more efficiently.\n \n Alternatively I support year-round school with a longer school year and a reduction of course repetition so schools can have an extensive college prep program. I have designed such a curriculum for a private school I am trying to open. The calendar year will have five 9-week academic terms with a 1-3 week break between terms. Students will be in school for 48 terms and will be prepared to take at least 8 AP exams by the time they graduate.",

The way my school (and most of the ones I've heard of) worked you had lots of breaks throughout the year and summer wasn't even that short. Summer would still be about 6 weeks- that is plenty of time for a break. Now, in normal school, I find myself extremely bored by the end of August. Except once I'm back in school for a couple of weeks I wish I had a break, but there is none to be had until November. As for educational benefits in YR, you don't forget nearly as much over the summer as you do in regular school, and you don't forget anything over the short breaks.

   "Well, I had soome experience with Year-round school. From Kindergarten to Third Grade I lived in florida and went to a school that had Year-round school, but unfortunately we had to move to Missouri and couldn't find a local one that had it. I really liked it.\n \n Basically how it went was we would have about six weeks off in the summer, four weeks off in the winter, and two to three weeks off in the Spring and in the Fall, giving us actually more than most public schools. The really good thing about the spring and fall breaks was that if you wanted to go somewhere on vacation (to a themepark like Disneyworld, or out to the beaches on the East or west coach), there would hardly be anyone else there - imagine not having to wait in line at a theme park (a novel experiene for some, I would bet).\n \n As for other benefits, it helps prevent burnout from months of school at a time with few to no breaks. It also could reduce the amount of students that get away from the phys ed and become couch potatoes (probably a large cause of our obese nation). The most important, however, is that it reduces the amount of time you are out of the classroom, thus reducing the amount of information you forget, and in turn reducing the amount of time wasted after each break by the teacher going through a comprehensive review.",
