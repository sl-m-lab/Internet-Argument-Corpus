Incidentally, since one of their main talking points is to argue the supposed injustice of 'putting their rights to a vote' when these things come up, it will be fascinating to see if they still reject the vote in the event they WIN it. emoticon_xangel\n Bet ya 10 to 1 they'll suddenly and hypocritically drop that argument, for the most part.\n \n Personally, I would vote against the amendment.
