   "What's wrong with it? Here's what's wrong with it.\n \nNothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution\n --Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975)\n\n I suspect that Debater doesn't know who Dobzhansky was. He was a geneticist and one of the leading formulaters of the synthetic theory of evolution, i.e., the synthesis of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theories.\n \n Another thing that is wrong is that you claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. You studied the cartoon version that these YECs wanted to feed you. Rather than learn science, you learned religion and how reality must be disregarded when it conflicts with mythology.\n \n If you are going to study science then you must follow where the science leads. You haven't learned anything about science if you require that your conclusions conform to a book of mythology.\n \n A Beka Books - Recommended by Debater. Let's see what kind of science Debater has learned.\n \n Grade 7 - Science: Order and Reality\n \n Students are introduced to the scientific method and encouraged to apply it through out this Christian general science text. They are given a fascinating study of soil science, plants, the human body, principles of physical science, atmospheic science, the weather, classification, microscopy, Creation, and insects.\n \n What exactly is \"Christian general science and how does that differ from regular general science? What does creation have to do with it?\n \n Grade 8 - Matter and Motion in God's Universe\n \n Like the other books in the series, Matter and Motion is written in the perspective of the founders of modern science: the belief that God is the Creator of the universe and the Originator of its order, reason, and reality; and that science is one way for man to control and master the physical world for the benefit of mankind. Students begin their study with a section on astronomy, in which they learn how the heavens proclaim the glory of God. Several chapters introduce and reinforce the basic principles of matter and motion and lay the foundation for physics. Chapters on magnetism and electricity follow, and the text closes with a chapter on science versus the false philosophy of evolution.\n \n I wonder how old that chapter on astronomy says the universe is? What is the philosophy of evolution and what does that have to do with the topics in this book?\n \n Grade 9 - Science of the Physical Creation\n \n Atmosphere, weather, oceanography, earthquakes, volcanoes, rocks, and fossils are just some of the earth-science topics of this outstanding text. The geology section includes a good refutation of the \"principle of uniformity\" and other ideas of evolutionary philosophers. Basic concepts of chemistry are presented in a simple and yet accurate manner, and physics concepts are applied to lasers, computers, and other electronic devices.\n \n I wonder exactly what is the \"principle of uniformity?\" Do they mean uniformitarianism? That is a tenet of geology that states that the processes visible in the world today are sufficient to account for geological changes visible in the geologic record from the past. Why would anyone want to refute that and what do you replace it with, miracles?\n \n Grade 10 - Biology: God's Living Creation\n \n Thoroughly Christian in perspective and tone. Truly nonevolutionary in philosophy, spirit, and sequence of study. Pedagogically superior for tenth- through twelfth-grade students.Begins with the familiar, tangible things of nature. Ties abstract concepts to concrete examples. Thoughtfully designed to aid student learning and teacher preparation. Lists key concepts at the head of each chapter. Includes section reviews and a chapter review for each chapter to reinforce learning and help students prepare for tests. Includes a set of TransVision overlays of the human body to show at a glance the an atomical relation ships of the body's systems. Scholarly, accurate, and up-to-date in content and organization. Reflects the latest advances in man's understanding of living things with out neglecting a foundation in the basics.\n \n \"Thoroughly Christian in perspective and tone\" means that it is a bunch of unrelated facts taught without any unifying concepts. How can you claim to have studied evolution when A Beka Books themselves claim that your source is \"nonevolutionary.\" It seems pretty apparent that the book doesn't intend to teach evolutionary theory. It is also apparent that you didn't learn any. Not much science either.\n \n Grade 11 - Chemistry: Precision and Design\n \n The excellent organization of this superior Christian chemistry text ensures mastery of the basic principles of chemistry and makes those principles understandable and interesting to your students. A Christian perspective helps students see chemistry as a beneficial science that can be used for man's benefit and God's glory. Environmental issues such as ozone depletion, global warming, and nuclear power are presented from a balanced, conservative perspective.\n \n How can chemistry have a Christian perspective? Ozone depletion as chemistry I understand. But global warming is a bit of a stretch and nuclear power is physics.\n \n Grade 12 - Physics: The Foundational Science\n \n Stresses the compatibility of faith and science. Physics: The Foundational Science can play an important role in showing students the harmony between scientific knowledge and Christian belief. The text is firmly grounded on the view that we live in a God-created world governed by laws discoverable by reverent scientific inquiry. Issues of vital concern to Christians are handled in depth. In terspersed through out the text are biographies of great physicists who were also Bible-believing Christians.\n \n Of course, if that \"reverent scientific inquiry\" reaches conclusions that disagree with a literal reading of the Bible, the science is rejected in favor of dogmatism. And I'll bet the formal list of \"great physicists\" who preceded the development of the theory of evolution is meaningful. I wonder how many of these \"great physicists\" also believed that night air could make them ill? How many beleived in alchemy, like Newton? I wonder if Newton is in that list? He didn't believe in the divinity of Christ.\n \n By the way, polls have shown that over 95% of scientists reject creationism. In the biological sciences, 99% are evolutionary biologists.",

The theory is supposed to explain observations that fit the definition. Your definitions are wrong. Not according to me. According to every evolutionary biologist that I know of.\n \n Definitions aren't things that \"work.\" They are convey meanings. It might give you a hint that you are way off mark that you think they reveal some sort of working. Apparently you don't know what a definition is.\n \n In Darwin's time, the word evolution carried a connotation of progress. That is why Darwin objected to it as applied to his theory. Darwin realized that evolution did not require that things get better, more complex, or higher. Things may become more complex, but they may also become less so. Besides, such matters as good-better-best are subjective. According to Darwin it is the environment that makes that judgement; and it is statistical - it is a matter of which characteristics tend to give their bearers a reproductive advantage - and more than that. Which inherited characteristics tend to give the offspring a reproductive advantage?\n \n So the bottom line is that you are misrepresenting evolution from the very start. You are misrepresenting the definition. You may define it any way you wish for your own use and then argue against that definition - that is called a straw man. No doubt you will win your argument and show that your definition is wrong. The reason is simple. Your definition is wrong. But you are not arguing against real evolution - and you haven't even got beyond the definition - to the observations and the theory.\n \n So, in fact, no matter how often you claim that you studied evolution, it is clear that you didn't. You studied a cartoon version - a starw man constructed to be knocked down. But you aren't arguing against evolution. You are arguing against the misrepresentation of creationists.\n \n Why would a community use a fundamentalist, young earth creationist biology text? Didn't anyone in the class complain? Didn't anyone mention that they wanted to learn biology in the biology class instead of religion? How bizarre! emoticon_confused",

   "Well, I'm a bit troubled by this. You see, I don't understand why a secular, accredited college would use a high school book, especially one that is intended to teach biology as religion? The accreditation of that school could certainly be placed in jeopardy by such a course as part of the biology program. Even if the very premise of A Beka Book's Biology: God's Living Creation were not totally unacceptable, the content of a high school biology text is inadequate for a course at the college level.\n \n Maybe my wording is a bit loose and you are not actually saying what I think you are saying.

I do not mean that this course was offered by some local church using borrowed classrooms at the college, as part of some christian school or home school program.\n \n In other words, this is Biology 100 or Biology 101.\n \n Biology 100 is a one quarter survey course intended for non-biology majors. It concentrates on the scientific method, ecology, genetics and evolution. The text used in that course by all of the several instructors who teach the course is Discover Biology, 2nd Edition by Cain et al. The text, as is appropriate for the course, is also intended for non-biology majors. I was informed of the above information by Shylajar Akkaraju, Assistant Professor of Biology at the College of DuPage.\n \n Biology 101 is part of a series of three courses (102,103) intended for biology majors. Major topics include the philosophy of science, scientific method, chemical and cellular organization of life, energy dynamics, genetics and evolution. The text is Biology, 6th Edition by Solomon. I was informed of the above information by Dr. Mark Zelman, Associate Dean of Natural and Applied Sciences (and also a biologist).\n \n Both of the above faculty members assure me that the A Beka Book is not used by the College of DuPage in their biology program. I suppose I could email the remaining 12 biology instructors to see if any of them use the book, but I am pretty certain that I would find that none do. To do so would most certainly put that teacher's job in jeopardy.\n \n So your story doesn't add up. So why is it that you told us that you took a biology course, and studied evolution using a high school book that presents a non-evolutionary view, at a college that doesn't use the book?",

At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa. This time it was fully modern H. sapiens, which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe. Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations, some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies, and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations, eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective. In this view there is a specific speciation event that occurred which led to the origin of H. sapiens in Africa, and this population is the forerunner of modern humans, leaving the European Neanderthals, Chinese erectus, and others out in the cold.\n \n Homo Sapiens",

   "I'll type slowly this time. I seemed to have typed too fast the last time.\n \n A monkey is a modern animal. However, monkeys and humans are both primates - they share certain characteristics that are similar and seem to have similar origiin.\n \n But all in all, a human is an ape, clearly. Now I understand how upsetting it is for you to see pictures like the series of skulls that I showed you, but nevertheless, the sequence in the bottom picture goes generally from older to younger (except for the first), and they go from less modern to more modern. The also go from more ape-like to less ape-like.\n \n Additionally, even Darwin predicted that the earliest hominid fissils would be found in Africa, and he was correct. Even some very early hominid fossils found in other locations are very similar to older fossils that have been found in Africa.\n \n And if one studies the sequence of the progression of the climate in the areas where these fossils have been found, the areas were at one time heavily forested similar to those areas in chimpanzees now live. But as those areas went from forest to savana, the nature of the wildlife changed. For example, even the 2.5 to 3.3 million year old skull of Australopithecus africanus is decidedly bipedal. And there are fossils from even earlier species that were bipedal - Au. afarensis for example. This is evident from the position of the foramen magnum, pelvis, hip, knee, and other characteristics. But they certainly weren't human.\n \n And, of course, there is genetic evidence. In comparisons of the DNA of humans and chimpanzees, they are found to be between 95% and 98% identical. A comparison of the proteins of each organism shows them to be identical in many cases, and different by only one or two amino acids in others. And claims to the contrary, there are no proteins in bullfrogs that are closer to human proteins than are chimp proteins. The author of the above claim also claimed that there was a protein in chickens that was closer. After several years of making this claim while refusing to identify it. Finally, he identified the protein as lysozyme. How strange. That protein contains a sequence of 151 amino acids. Human and chimp lysozyme differ by zero amino acids while chicken lysozyme differs by 30.\n \n So we are not far removed from our cousins, the chimpanzees (there are two species - the chimpanzee and the bonobo). We had a common ancestor some 6 to 7 million years ago.\n \n Here are a couple of sites that you can visit to learn more.\n \n Evolution\n \n Becomming Human\n \n A question: Since you are obviously not an atheist, why would you choose a name that identifies you as such?

To be an atheist, one must have absolute knowledge about everything; they must be omniscient. No human knows everything about everything. An axiom is defined as \"A self-evident or universally recognized truth; maxim.\" (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.) In other words, an absolute statement. \"There is no gold in China,\" is an absolute statement. What do I need to know about China in order to make that statement and have it be true? EVERYTHING. I need to know what is in every rock, and river, and what is in every person's tooth. As this is impossible, I cannot say \"there is no gold in China.\" The same holds true for an atheist. To say \"There is no God\" is an axiom; an absolute statement. What do they need to know in order to make that statement and have it be true? They need to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING... including what you dreamed last night and what your mother ate for breakfast the day you were born. Therefore, since no one knows everything about everything, the best they can say is, \"I think there is no God,\" which makes them an agnostic.

Every branch of the tree represents a species, and every fork separating one species from another represents the common ancestor shared by these species. While the tree's countless forks and far-reaching branches clearly show that relatedness among species varies greatly, it is also easy to see that every pair of species share a common ancestor from some point in evolutionary history. For example, scientists estimate that the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees lived some 5 to 8 million years ago. Humans and bacteria obviously share a much more distant common ancestor, but our relationship to these single-celled organisms is no less real. Indeed, DNA analyses show that although humans share far more genetic material with our fellow primates than we do with single-celled organisms, we still have more than 200 genes in common with bacteria. \" This, according to http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat01.html#Q11.

How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought.\n\n It's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you don't even know what it is, but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly. If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion, \"God did it!\" without any specifics as to how, then you have answered no questions and explained nothing. Such empty assertions cannot be proven wrong. Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God, and that is what scientists study. There are lots of scientists, evolutionary biologists among them, who believe in a Creator God.\n \n Science is not a matter of proving something right. Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed. In science, the facts are the observations. The process of science is a process of testing those theories, again and again. The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong. The more a theory has been tested, the more secure it is, even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic. How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun? Is that a fact? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons?\n \n Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are \"proven\" they will grow up to be facts? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and \"God did it\" offers no predictions.\n \n However, if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events, you have made assertions that can be checked. For example, if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that. But clearly there are. And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that. For example, SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth. It's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method. It is 170,000 light years away. In other words, SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago. A creationist's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth, complete with the history of an explosion that never happened. Ultimately, creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence.\n \n So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology, great! But if you wish to argue science, then shouldn't you at least learn what it is? If you claim that a theory is wrong shouldn't you at least know what that theory is?\n \n By the way, I am getting the definition of evolution from memory. I have been using it for many years. It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago. Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class. Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition. It is common knowledge - and that's why I ask, if you don't know what evolution is, how do you know that you are opposed to it?\n \nEvolution is a change in the gene pool of a population over time.\n Introduction to Evolutionary Biology\n\n Here is a more complete definition from Futuyma's text on evolutionary biology.\n \nIn the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.\n - Douglas J.

But again, if you claim something as a fact, you must have proof, verified in both your method of reasoning, and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to.\n\n A fact is simply a phenomenon that is observable by any competent observer. It is not proven.\n For example, Euclid made the assumption that one and only one straight line exists between two points. This is generally considered a fact. However, two points that cannot be connected by a straight line could be discovered tomorrow, and that Euclid's first postulate would be disproven.\n \nI think one blob attatched to another blob, and then those blobs joined together to create a group of blobs...scientifically speaking. emoticon_confused\n\n That is, not scientifically speaking.\n \n Of course, for abiogenesis claims, I keep this site handy. In particular, I would like to point out the second caption:\"Figure 2. Original cellular genesis in retracement taped by Mr. Randall Grubbs. A large chunk of thermal protein (1000x) is contacted by warm 1.0% sodium chloride solution. On cooling, protocells stream forth in less than two minutes.\"",
