   "Had to share the following joke. I hope this is the right place.\n \n \nAn Irish man walks into a pub. The bartender asks him, \"what'll you have?\" The man says, \"Give me three pints of Guinness please.\" \n So the bartender brings him three pints and the man proceeds to alternately sip one, then the other, then the third until they're gone. He then orders three more. \n \n The bartender says, \"Sir, I know you like them cold. You don't have to order three at a time. I can keep an eye on it and when you get low I'll bring you a fresh cold one.\" \n \n The man says, \"You don't understand. I have two brothers, one in Australia and one in the States. We made a vow to each other that every Saturday night we'd still drink together. So right now, my brothers have three Guinness Stouts too, and we're drinking together. \n \n The bartender thought that was a wonderful tradition. Every week the man came in and ordered three beers. Then one week he came in and ordered only two. He drank them and then ordered two more. \n \n The bartender said to him, \"I know what your tradition is, and I'd just like to say that I'm sorry that one of your brothers died.\" \n \n The man said, \"Oh, me brothers are fine - I just quit drinking.\" \n",

In the last visit the patron was really sad and obviously holding back his tears, prompting the bartender to ask which brother had died, to which the patron answered that nobody died...he'd just been told by his doctor that he had to quit drinking. He'd accomplished this by cutting out his own drink from the traditional three he had.\n \n Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Now that's funny!emoticon_xhoho",
