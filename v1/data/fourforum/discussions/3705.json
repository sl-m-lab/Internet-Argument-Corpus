(W)e have wasted 2 years and about a trillion dollars by invading iraq.\n The term \"wasted\" is subjective. The ousting of SH and the creation of a Democracy isn't wasted IMO.\n The war has cost about $120 billion, according to the White House Office of Budget and Management, so your assertion of $1Trillion is easily disproven.\n \n 4. saddam did not deserve the notoriety bush gave him\n \n Saddam used chemical weapons against Iran, killing 5,000 Iranians between 1983-1988.\n \n In mid-March of 1988, Saddam Hussein and his cousin Ali\n Hassan alMajid -- the infamous \"Chemical Ali\" -- ordered the dropping\n of chemical weapons on the town of Halabja in northeastern Iraq. \n \n Human Rights Watch estimated that between 50,000\n and 100,000 Kurds were killed during the Anfal campaigns in 1987-88.\n \n The invasion and occupation of Kuwait killed more than a thousand\n Kuwaiti nationals, as well as many others from other nations.\n \n In March and April of 1991, Saddam Hussein's forces killed somewhere between 30,000 and 60,000 Iraqis, most of them civilians.\n \n Saddam Hussein's government has drained the southern marshes of Iraq, depriving thousands of Iraqis of their livelihood and their ability to live on land that their ancestors have lived on for thousands of years.\n \n Ethnic cleansing of ethnic \"Persians\" from Iraq to Iran, and an\n ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing of the non-Arabs of Kirkuk and\n other northern districts.\n \n The regime carryied out a systematic campaign of murder and intimidation of\n clergy, especially Shi'a clergy. The number of those killed unlawfully\n is difficult to estimate but must be well in excess of 10,000 since\n Saddam Hussein officially seized power in 1980. \n \n U.S. War Crimes Ambassador Reviews Saddam Hussein's Criminality\n The Case for Justice in Iraq\n By David J. Scheffer\n Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues\n Monday, September 18, 2000 \n Middle East Institute and the Iraq Foundation\n National Press Club, Washington, D.C.\n \n Excerpted from:\n http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/2000/09/iraq-000918.htm\n \n 5. neither was he an imminent threat to the safety of any country other than his own\n Internation sanctions against SH were breaking down. He was acquiring large sums of money through illegal Oil for Food deals. This was allowing him to purchase Dual Use technology that could rapidly be converted to WMD production.\n \n\n Significantly, this \"just-in-time\" approach to WMD deployment was no less dangerous, from the U.S. perspective, than possession of a WMD stockpile. At least with respect to chemical and biological agents, the most important assets appear to be the availability of suitable expertise and the necessary industrial base. Both of these Saddam had in plenty. Thus, a rogue state, capable of reconstituting its WMD arsenal at a time of its own choosing, poses as much of a threat as a regime with the WMD forces in being.\n \n Finally, an Iraqi just-in-time strategy may have been even more dangerous to the United States because of the possibility that Saddam would share either existing WMD, or technical expertise, with a terrorist group. In fact, a rogue regime which has adopted a virtual arsenal approach, while disclaiming its intent to field WMDs, might well feel that it has more plausible deniability and, therefore, would actually be more likely to transfer WMDs to a third party. There is even a possibility that Iraq may have combined its WMD-related efforts with other rogue regimes (Syria in particular) and intended to develop a \"distributed\" arsenal, which would have been more difficult to both detect and target.\n http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/rivkin_casey200407130904.asp\n\n \n 6. the people of iraq are not being liberated because we the bush administration are sympathetic humanitarians, but only because iraq is sitting on the second largest oil reserve in the world.\n \n Only partially true. Our liberation of Iraq isn't purely humanitarian, I agree, but it was necessary because of Iraq's oil wealth and Saddam's desire to use that wealth to reconstitute his WMD programs and gain power within the Arab world.",

He was acquiring large sums of money through illegal Oil for Food deals. This was allowing him to purchase Dual Use technology that could rapidly be converted to WMD production.\n\n extra money could be used for anything. other than speculations by the government officials, there is nothing to back up the allegations that saddam had intentions of reconstituting a weapons program. not only that, but upon request, all evidence shows that saddam destroyed any and all his weapons he had in possession, as well as anything else that could be involved in a weapons program. the inspectors did account for the the disnmantled weapons and equipment, and produced no evidence that there was anything else ressembling a wmd in iraq. after our invasion efforts we found exactly what the inspectors said we would find, yet we are treating iraq as if it posed a threat when we have already proven that it never did\n \n \nOnly partially true. Our liberation of Iraq isn't purely humanitarian, I agree, but it was necessary because of Iraq's oil wealth and Saddam's desire to use that wealth to reconstitute his WMD programs and gain power within the Arab world.\n\n saddam's \"desire\" to reconstitue his wmd programs is nothing but absolute and unsupported speculation. there is nothing documented or reported that supports the claim that saddam had intentions of producing wmds. and even if he did have this plan in his head, he neither had the funds nor the means to make such a plan a reality. he was under constant scrutiny by the UN, and under such surveilance had kept his country wmd-free. any discrepancy other than very minor ones in the oil for food program were immediately detected. saddam basically couldn't sneeze without raising a UN red flag. our \"enforcement\" against saddams non-existent weapons stockpiles, facilities and capabilities proved redundant and therefore utterly useless. using the wmd threat as a rationale for the invasion has been shot down, killed and buried a long time now\n \n the fact is, as \"liberators\" of iraq, we will soon begin to demand our \"liberation fee\" in the form of oil revenue or heavy tax over the oil industry in iraq. the $150B is an investment that bush is set on seeing returns on in the very near future, as long as the iraqi people can be pacified as easily as the american people are, through media and charismatic speeches full of lies. this was bush's intention all along",

   "\n evidence and sources that support this meeting are questionable to say the least, and most reports conclude it to be completely fictional. so far EVERY attempt to link al qaeda to iraq in the remotest has turned out to be based on untruths. the interesting thing is, even IF we found credible links between al qaeda and iraq, how could that possibly be justification for invasion? if jim is a murderer, and the police produced evidence that you went to school with jim's cousin, would that be a good reason for them to arrest you and leave jim at large? this is exactly what bush is doing with bin laden and saddam. only in this case, the documents showing that you went to school with jim's cousin were forged.\n\n \n From your reference, that you concluded supported your assertion that the meeting was \"questionable\"\n \n\n Czech intelligence responds. In, fact there never was a retraction, or even modification, from the relevant officials in and supervising the Czech intelligence service. On December 17th, 2001 Gabriela Bartikova, the spokeswomen for the Minister of the Interior, had said \"Minister Gross had the information from BIS, and BIS guarantees the information, So we stick by that information.\" On May 3rd, 2002 referring to the Washington Post-Newsweek allegation, Interior Minister Stanislav Gross stated \"I believe the counterintelligence services more than journalists. I draw on the Security Information Service [BIS] information and I see no reason why I should not believe it.\" He further explained that he had consulted with BIS chief Jiri Ruzek on May 2nd in order to find out whether the Czech intelligence service had any new information that would cast doubt on the meeting. \"The answer was that they did not. Therefore, I consider the matter closed,\" Gross concluded \n In other words, to date, Czech intelligence, the only agency anywhere that claimed to monitor the meeting, stood by its guarantee that the atta-al-Ani had taken place..\n\n And for someone who talks about \"questionable sources, you quote the \"World Socialist Web Site\" as a credible source for the assertion that \" most reports conclude it to be completely fictional\". I won't even bother with that one.\n \n \n\n since 9/11 there have been numerous anthrax attacks, and 6 al qaedas in buffalo, ny were arrested when found with a grenade launcher. before 9/11, the last terrorist attack here from al qaeda was in 1993. so i can't see how you can boast about 3 years without terror attacks (when in fact there were), when before 9/11 there was an 8 year terror-free streak (except for mcVeigh, which was in 1995), because its not a reduction in terrorist attacks at all.\n\n Your own statement above \"6 al qaedas in buffalo, ny were arrested when found with a grenade launcher\" demonstrates the effectiveness of the Bush Administration's activities in reducing the terrorist threat in the US. Thanks for the help.\n \n\n the trillion dollar figure was an exagerration, yes, the cost is actually closer to $150B. \n \n\n Curious debating technique. Do you always debate using easily proven exaggerations? Kind of kills the credibility thing a bit, eh?\n \n\n creating a democracy in iraq is not making american safer because the terrorists are not even in iraq,\n\n This is too easy. \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108371,00.html\n http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/08/30/sprj.irq.main/\n http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/09/20/britain.allawi/\n http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=36737\n \n The last reference contains the following passage \" An article titled \"Do Not Go To Iraq,\" by Muhammad bin al-Salim, says: \"My instructions to the people of the peninsula [Saudi Arabia], young as old, men as women, is to fight Americans in their homes and the people of Yemen should fight the Americans in their bases, battleships and their consulates.\" \n The Post notes this is a change in strategy by bin Laden, who reportedly in October shifted some resources from Taliban renegades in Afghanistan to Iraq in order to battle coalition forces.\"\n \n\n and even if they were, terrorism is fueled by anti-american hatred and islamic fundamentalism. installing a democracy in iraq has absolutely no effect on the root cause of terrorism in the middle east, therefore it is a waste of money. \n\n Again, you aren't sure enough of your facts that you feel the need to qualify your assertions with weasel words like \"Even if\". Either you're sure of your position or you aren't. A wise man once said that its hard to keep your feet planted firmly on the ground when you're straddling the fence. \n \n\n saddam had no means of attacking or even threatening to attack america. he had no weapons, and no links to anybody with weapons.\n\n \n \"In 1995, Iraq admitted to the IAEA that it had considered several implosion-type bomb designs. UN inspectors said the newest Iraqi design would weigh only about 600 kilograms and measure 600 to 650 millimetres in diameter - small enough to fit on Iraq's Scud-type missiles.\" http://www.cbc.ca/news/iraq/issues_analysis/wmd.html\n We know that Saddam had developed Al Samoud missiles post-Gulf War, that exceeded the allowable range specified in the Cease fire agreement.\n \n \n\n he did have links to terrorists in pallestine who were responsible for suicide bombings in israel, but noone has been able to identify a single mean by which saddam could possibly pose a threat to america. as far as defending the country, deposing saddam was a waste of money\n\n \n So, you admit that Saddam had ties to terrorist groups after all? Do you also admit that he funded suicide bombers in Israel AND elsewhere?\n As for your assertion that deposing SH was a waste of money because he was no threat to America, I think that the recent Oil for Food scandal has demonstrated that he was a very real threat because he was able to divert as much as $20Billion away from the OFF program and was using it to purchase \"dual use\" technology.\n \n \n\n i'm not arguing that saddam didnt cause a lot of deaths in his regime. the iranians were at war with iraq, and iran killed many iraqis. you can expect a large number of iranians to die as well. as for the kuwait invasion, the death tolls of our invasion in iraq has surpassed that by about 20 times.\n\n I wasn't arguing the numbers of deaths during the war, but rather the means by which those deaths occurred. He used chemical WMDs against Iran and his own people. That is a war crime that is unrelated to deaths from \"normal\" warfare.\n \n\n in saddam's 32 year regime, estimates say he has killed 200,000 - 300,000 people (about 6000-10,000 per year). in our 20 months since the invasion, we've killed an estimated 14,000-16,000 iraqis (8000-10,000 per year). it seems as though we've managed to keep the iraqi death rate almost perfectly consistent even without saddam doing the killing.\n\n The number you quote are the number of Iraqis ONLY that Saddam was responsible for killing, intentionally. It doesn't include those killed in Iraq's two wars with its neighbors.\n The number of civilian casualties during the most intense fighting March 21-July 31, 2003 put the number at ~2000, so I would like to see a credible reference to dispute my figure. http://civilians.info/iraq/ And I'm not sure that we'd agree with their count even. Their numbers include car bombing victims and those killed due to \"increased lawlessness\" as a result of the US intervention.\n \n\n its a pity the numbers for other countries are near impossible to get on the net. it would be interesting to compare this to other arabian countries, but all we have to work with is the iraq figures and ours.\n\n My link above comes from: data collection by CIVIC Worldwide\n Raed Jarrar, Director of Iraq Survey, a door to door survey by 150 volunteers in Iraq. It's interesting, but their count includes those mentioned above.\n \n\n extra money could be used for anything. other than speculations by the government officials, there is nothing to back up the allegations that saddam had intentions of reconstituting a weapons program. not only that, but upon request, all evidence shows that saddam destroyed any and all his weapons he had in possession, as well as anything else that could be involved in a weapons program. the inspectors did account for the the disnmantled weapons and equipment, and produced no evidence that there was anything else ressembling a wmd in iraq. after our invasion efforts we found exactly what the inspectors said we would find, yet we are treating iraq as if it posed a threat when we have already proven that it never did.\n saddam's \"desire\" to reconstitue his wmd programs is nothing but absolute and unsupported speculation. there is nothing documented or reported that supports the claim that saddam had intentions of producing wmds. and even if he did have this plan in his head, he neither had the funds nor the means to make such a plan a reality. he was under constant scrutiny by the UN, and under such surveilance had kept his country wmd-free. any discrepancy other than very minor ones in the oil for food program were immediately detected. saddam basically couldn't sneeze without raising a UN red flag. our \"enforcement\" against saddams non-existent weapons stockpiles, facilities and capabilities proved redundant and therefore utterly useless. using the wmd threat as a rationale for the invasion has been shot down, killed and buried a long time now\n \n\n I suggest that you read Claudia Rosett's Summary of the OFF program and its lack of oversight. here's one passage\"\n As Oil-for-Food grew in size and scope, the U.S. mission to the UN began putting a significant number of its relief contracts on hold for closer scrutiny. Both Sevan and Annan complained publicly and often about these delays, describing them as injurious to the people of Iraq and urging the Security Council to push the contracts through faster. What Sevan did not convey was that, by 2000, complaints had begun reaching him about Iraqi government demands for kickbacks from suppliers on the relief side. These (according to a recent report in the Financial Times) Sevan simply buried, telling complainants to submit formal documents to the Security Council through their countries' UN missions (something they had no incentive to do since Saddam would most likely have responded by scrapping the deals altogether).\"\n http://acepilots.com/unscam/archives/000732.html\n \n the above describes the means Saddam used to divert funding with little or no auditing of contracts.\n below tells what he did with some of the money. Here's an excerpt from:\n \n Testimony to the US Congress\n by Mr. Charles Duelfer,\n Director of Central Intelligence Special Advisor for Strategy regarding Iraqi Weapons \n of Mass Destruction (WMD) Programs\n \n 30 March 2004\n Procurement\n Let me begin by discussing procurement and financing, two critical areas that cut across all potential WMD efforts. The ISG has been investigating Iraq's procurement process, sources of finance, the involvement of foreign firms, and the specific types of goods that were sought. Iraq utilized a complex and well developed procurement system hidden by an effective denial and deception strategy. By the late 1990s, Iraq, in contravention of UN sanctions, pursued the procurement of military goods and technical expertise for military capabilities. \n The primary source of illicit financing for this system was oil smuggling conducted through government-to-government protocols negotiated by Iraq with neighboring countries. Money also was obtained from kickback payments made on contracts set up through the UN's Oil for Food program. \n Iraq derived several billion dollars between 1999 and 2003 from oil smuggling and kickbacks. One senior regime official estimated Iraq earned $4 billion from illicit oil sales from 1999 to March 2003. By levying a surcharge on Oil for Food contracts, Iraq earned billions more during the same period. \n This was revenue outside UN control and provided resources the regime could spend without restriction. It channeled much of the illicitly gathered funds to rebuild Iraq's military capabilities through the Military Industrialization Commission, the MIC. MIC worked with the Iraqi Intelligence Service to establish front companies in Iraq and other countries to facilitate procurement. \n The budget of MIC increased nearly 100 fold from 1996 to 2003, with the budget totaling $500 million in 2003. Most of this money came from illicit oil contracts. Iraq imported banned military weapons and technology and dual-use goods through Oil for Food contracts. Companies in several countries were involved in these efforts. Direct roles by government officials are also clearly established.\n http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/speeches/2004/tenet_testimony_03302004.html\n As you can see, Saddam was procuring banned military hardware through the use of OFF money. The evidence coming out is indisputable.\n \n \n the fact is, as \"liberators\" of iraq, we will soon begin to demand our \"liberation fee\" in the form of oil revenue or heavy tax over the oil industry in iraq. the $150B is an investment that bush is set on seeing returns on in the very near future, as long as the iraqi people can be pacified as easily as the american people are, through media and charismatic speeches full of lies. this was bush's intention all along\n\n \n That is an absolutely absurd statement. Iraq's total Oil reserves have been estimated at 112 Billion barrels. If we have already spent $150Billion in Iraq and didn't spend another dime, we'd have to \"steal\" ALL of Iraq's oil at 2/3rd's of its current market value (~$50/barrel) until all of the wells in Iraq are dry to even break even. Does that sound like shrewd business to you?",

   "\n since you wont accept the article because of its from wsws, how about that same view from BBC, and czech's own Prague post, which both happen to be saying the same thing as wsws...\n\n I believe that the Czech Interior Minister summed it up better than I can in the BBC article you cited above. \n \"The Czech Interior Minister, Stanislav Gross, however, insists there is no reason to doubt the initial reports of the meeting. \n \"At present I don't have the slightest information that the reports I received from the intelligence service were not in order. I believe the intelligence services more than journalists,\" he told the Czech press agency, CTK.\"\n And in the Prague Post article you also cited above is found this:\n \"That is not what government officials have said so far. They have stated repeatedly that Atta and al-Ani met at least once in Prague, suggesting the encounter occurred in early April 2001. Al-Ani, suspected of plotting an attack on the Prague headquarters of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on behalf of Iraqi intelligence, was expelled from the Czech Republic April 22, 2001 -- soon after the alleged meeting -- for abusing his diplomatic status, a charge usually associated with spying or terrorism.\"\n I'm sure that, if I was multi-lingual, I could find the proceedings that documented Al-Ani's expulsion from the Czech Republic, but nobody is disputing the fact that he was ousted for abusing his diplomatic status, further supporting the Czech claims against him.\n \n\n the point is that your suggestion of america being safer because of 3 years of no terrorist attacks since 9/11 is both false and irrelevant. you seem to ignore that before 9/11 we were 6 years attack free, but it had no relevance to how \"safe\" the country was.\n\n I can cite you a hundred examples of increased security measures as a result of 9-11 that demonstrate that we are safer. They range from increased air travel security measures to increased border checks. Now, admittedly, the borders are still swiss cheese, but they are infinitely more secure than prior to 9-11. As someone who travels across the border into Canada occasionally, I can assure you that the border crossing takes much longer now than it did pre-9-11.\n You stated \"creating a democracy in iraq is not making american safer because the terrorists are not even in iraq\" to which I supplied links showing that terrorists were, indeed, in Iraq, including Al Qaeda.\n \n\n too easy. not one of the articles you linked shows that there were terrorists from iraq. every article says that the terrorists came to iraq from outside, and only as a result of our occupation there. in other words, we are the ones that brought the terrorists to iraq.\n\n So, now you're agreeing that the terrorists ARE in Iraq? Your original contention, quoted above, was that there weren't any terrorists IN Iraq, not that there weren't any FROM Iraq. I'm having a hard time debunking your statements because you're beating me to it. ;)\n \n reread the post. \"even if\" is used hypothetically, not because of uncertainty. i have showed that not a single report has identified a single al qaeda-linked terrorist from iraq.\n\n I have already presented proof, from an Al Qaeda website, stating that some Al Qaeda members were sent from Afghanistan to Iraq. Terrorists don't have to be native Iraqis in order to be terrorists IN Iraq, you know. We've already established that Iraq has been a magnet for attracting terrorists.\n \n\n read what cbc news has to say about the wmds in iraq today. the very inspectors that reported those statistics in 1995 also reported that the weapons were not there in 2002, and showed where the weapons were dismantled. the main problem was that the number of dismantled weapons accounted for did not correspond with the figures from then. as of today, no \"unaccounted for\" weapons have ever been found, dispite the best efforts by the inspectors and our own agents\n\n Since Saddam prevented weapons inspectors from inspecting continuously up to the war, there was no way that we would have known, a priori, that the previously indentified, but unaccounted for, WMDs had been dismantled, smuggled out of the country, etc., Doesn't the fact that many previously counted WMDs are STILL unaccounted for bother you in the least? It seems to me that if SH had 100 A-bombs (for example) and our weapons inspectors counted them in 1995 and came back in 2002 and there were only 50, that would be bothersome to us. Since SH never provided any verification that they were destroyed, one must assume that they exist...somewhere, right? I find little sollice in knowing that the number of WMDs catalogued in 1995 doesn't jive with the number counted in 2002.\n \n\n reports show that saddam supported pallestinian terrorists. i never denied that he did, but saddam wasnt the major sponsor of palestinians. i cant see how he would also be supporting israel at the same time, since they were always enemies \n\n I never contended that Saddam was a major sponsor of Palestinian terrorism, only that he did have ties to terrorists and terrorist activities.\n \n\n true, but he had no weapons, and no weapons capability. there are dictators openly budgeting that amount to fund their active weapons programs, yet we are convinced that saddam was a greater threat?\n\n I don't think that you're getting the concept of \"dual use technology\". The dual use technology provides the weapons capability. It is technology that can be quickly converted from inoccuous use to sinister use in a short time. As for other dictators also spending money on WMD programs, that is a fact. The major difference is that Saddam has already an established track record of having no qualms about using WMDs on his enemies since he used them in Iran AND Iraq. That makes him a more dangerous dictator than one who hasn't demonstrated a willingness to use a WMD. If N. Korea used a WMD on its own people, for example, we'd be all over North Korea like white on rice.\n \n\n so why would we include numbers of people that saddam didnt kill when talking about the number of people he did kill? do we pin people that died as a result of air raids and foreign or internal wars as saddam's fault? i dont get this \n\n Sorry, I may not have been clear. The 200-300,000 that you quoted didn't include the number that died fighting against Iran or in Kuwait. That number only represented Saddam's attempts at \"internal genocide\" against Kurds and Shi'ites as well as his Death Squad activities. If you included the Iraqis that died fighting in Saddam's wars, the number would exceed 1,000,000 easily.\n \n\n i dont dispute that he got away with gaining funds illegally, nor that he could potentially use those funds to restart a weapons program. but he didnt. how is it that he is more dangerous than dictators that did?\n\n See above comment.\n \n\n good point. it seems as though the money we spent and are still spending to liberate iraq wont be recovered from their oil reserves alone... it doesnt sound like shrewd business at all...\n\n So, you agree that Iraqi oil wasn't the motivation for invading Iraq? That's a start. I'd like to hear what your other reasons might be then since I've disproven your major one. \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I believe that the Czech Interior Minister summed it up better than I can in the BBC article you cited above. \n \"The Czech Interior Minister, Stanislav Gross, however, insists there is no reason to doubt the initial reports of the meeting. \n \"At present I don't have the slightest information that the reports I received from the intelligence service were not in order. I believe the intelligence services more than journalists,\" he told the Czech press agency, CTK.\"\n And in the Prague Post article you also cited above is found this:\n \"That is not what government officials have said so far. They have stated repeatedly that Atta and al-Ani met at least once in Prague, suggesting the encounter occurred in early April 2001. Al-Ani, suspected of plotting an attack on the Prague headquarters of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on behalf of Iraqi intelligence, was expelled from the Czech Republic April 22, 2001 -- soon after the alleged meeting -- for abusing his diplomatic status, a charge usually associated with spying or terrorism.\"\n I'm sure that, if I was multi-lingual, I could find the proceedings that documented Al-Ani's expulsion from the Czech Republic, but nobody is disputing the fact that he was ousted for abusing his diplomatic status, further supporting the Czech claims against him.\n\n according to the 9/11 commission report, no evidence was found that could verify this meeting. even with the czech officials standing by their statement in the face of no evidence, which is common among politicians, the fact remains that the report cannot be verified. the 9/11 commision has done extensive research on this matter, and there simply is no proof that such a meeting ever occured except the czech's official's word.\n \n \nI can cite you a hundred examples of increased security measures as a result of 9-11 that demonstrate that we are safer. They range from increased air travel security measures to increased border checks. Now, admittedly, the borders are still swiss cheese, but they are infinitely more secure than prior to 9-11. As someone who travels across the border into Canada occasionally, I can assure you that the border crossing takes much longer now than it did pre-9-11.\n\n even with increased security measures, bureacracy and barriers, the threat of a terrorist attack is still as existent as ever, because the terrorists themselves are still free. we are doing nothing to prevent further terrorist attacks, but we are putting in costly measures to handle an attack if and when it occurs. this is not making us safer.\n \n \nYou stated \"creating a democracy in iraq is not making american safer because the terrorists are not even in iraq\" to which I supplied links showing that terrorists were, indeed, in Iraq, including Al Qaeda.\n\n you showed, in all your links, that terrorist came to iraq after we were already occupying. those terrorist came from foreign countries outside iraq. if we were about fighting terrorism, why didnt we invade the countries that those terrorists are from?\n \n besides that, your links have absolutely nothing about defending our operations to \"create a democracy in iraq\". a democracy has nothing to do with the elimination of terrorism, particularly when the terrorists are motivated by anti-american hate and islamic fundamentalism\n \n \nSo, now you're agreeing that the terrorists ARE in Iraq? Your original contention, quoted above, was that there weren't any terrorists IN Iraq, not that there weren't any FROM Iraq. I'm having a hard time debunking your statements because you're beating me to it. ;)\n\n they ARE in iraq now because we invaded iraq first. when we got to iraq the terrorists werent there, but now, thanks to your news links, we see that the terrorists are coming into iraq from foreign countries to fight the army. are you saying that because the terrorist came to iraq on account of our being there, we have justification for invading iraq? we could have invaded any country in the middle east and use that same justification.\n \n \nI have already presented proof, from an Al Qaeda website, stating that some Al Qaeda members were sent from Afghanistan to Iraq. Terrorists don't have to be native Iraqis in order to be terrorists IN Iraq, you know. We've already established that Iraq has been a magnet for attracting terrorists.\n\n i acknowledged that. the scenario is similar to arresting an innocent man for drug possession, then giving him the drugs and telling him \"see? NOW you have drugs on you. thats why you're under arrest.\" we invaded iraq when there were no terrorists there. now that terrorists have come to do battle with us, we are using that as proof that there are terrorists in iraq, and thats why we invaded. see how ridicuous that is?\n \n \nSince Saddam prevented weapons inspectors from inspecting continuously up to the war, there was no way that we would have known, a priori, that the previously indentified, but unaccounted for, WMDs had been dismantled, smuggled out of the country, etc., Doesn't the fact that many previously counted WMDs are STILL unaccounted for bother you in the least? It seems to me that if SH had 100 A-bombs (for example) and our weapons inspectors counted them in 1995 and came back in 2002 and there were only 50, that would be bothersome to us. Since SH never provided any verification that they were destroyed, one must assume that they exist...somewhere, right? I find little sollice in knowing that the number of WMDs catalogued in 1995 doesn't jive with the number counted in 2002.\n\n yes, but as of today the weapons (if they ever existed) cannot be accounted for. how is it that we relied on the un inspection's finding 10 years ago, and doubt their findings now? the unproven presumption that saddam was hiding weapons is what bush acted upon to declare war on a country that was obviously innocent of wmd possession. now that we realize that they were indeed innocent of the charge, bush tried to shift the charge to something else. today, its \"iraqi liberation\", an operation that has no basis for declaring war, and no relevance to terrorism\n \nI never contended that Saddam was a major sponsor of Palestinian terrorism, only that he did have ties to terrorists and terrorist activities.\n\n as did many sheiks in the arabian peninsula, contributing even greater sums than saddam himself. not to mention the jordanians, egyptians and palestinians themselves, who not only sponsored the terrorists, but provided recruits, operatives, materials and training facilities for them. saddam, though he did contribute to terrorist, was far from a major sponsor of terrorism. if our actions were based on terrorist sponsorship, we'd be all over the middle east, not just in iraq\n \nI don't think that you're getting the concept of \"dual use technology\". The dual use technology provides the weapons capability. It is technology that can be quickly converted from inoccuous use to sinister use in a short time. As for other dictators also spending money on WMD programs, that is a fact. The major difference is that Saddam has already an established track record of having no qualms about using WMDs on his enemies since he used them in Iran AND Iraq. That makes him a more dangerous dictator than one who hasn't demonstrated a willingness to use a WMD. If N. Korea used a WMD on its own people, for example, we'd be all over North Korea like white on rice.\n\n you are still weighing potential and possible over actual and evident. n korea and many other countries ruled by ruthless tyrants have ACTUAL wmds. al qaeda ACTUALLY attacked the US. yet we completely ignore those and focus on the POSSIBILTY of saddam someday turning his POTENTIAL technologies into weapons capability. i think there is a huge misdirection of priority here.\n \n \nSo, you agree that Iraqi oil wasn't the motivation for invading Iraq? That's a start. I'd like to hear what your other reasons might be then since I've disproven your major one. \n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n i'd like to hear yours. our invasion into iraq obviously was not to eliminate terror (since the terrorists are from elsewhere) or defend america in any way (since iraq had absolutely no means of attacking america). so why did we invade iraq in the first place?",

   "\n Point 1\n ok. my argument is that the war in iraq is completely unrelated to fighting terror \n \n\n \n I have demonstrated provable links tying SH to terrorists, and you have conceded, that Saddam was supporting terrorists. In your own words:\n \n \"reports show that saddam supported pallestinian terrorists. i never denied that he did, but saddam wasnt the major sponsor of palestinians. i cant see how he would also be supporting israel at the same time, since they were always enemies. Unkerpaulie\n \n And:\n \n saddam, though he did contribute to terrorist, was far from a major sponsor of terrorism. if our actions were based on terrorist sponsorship, we'd be all over the middle east, not just in iraq .\" Unkerpaulie\n \n Al-Ani was expelled from the Czech Republic for meeting with the Iraqi diplomat, Mohammed Atta. You disputed this by citing newspaper articles that have been refuted by the one party that had first-hand knowledge, Czech officials.\n \n \n\n Point 2\n and by invading iraq we are not reducing terrorism. \n\n \n Since 9-11, we have killed or captured about 3,000 Al Qaeda terrorists, including many of the top leaders such as Al Qaeda's third in command, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind 9-11 and there hasn't been one terrorist attack on US soil since 9-11. We have, however, caught terrorists planning actions inside of US, demonstrating that we are getting better at preventing attacks.\n \n \n\n Point 3\n as far as the war on terrorism is concerned, we have wasted 2 years and about a trillion dollars by invading iraq.\n\n As you have conceded, the $Trillion figure was an inaccurate exaggeration on your part. As for wasting 2 years by invading Iraq, I submit that come Jan. 05, the existence of the first democracy in Iraq's history can hardly be deemed \"a waste\".\n \n \n\n Point 4\n i would also argue that saddam did not deserve the notoriety bush gave him, \n\n Now, surely you didn't really mean to serve up this meatball for me to smack out of the park? Saddam was a proven threat to his own people and his neighboring countries people whom he attacked, sometimes even with WMDs. Estimates of SH's killings in his own country exceed 300,000 people, including at least 5,000 killed with chemical weapons. Don't you agree that makes him a notorious character?\n \n \n\n Point 5\n neither was he an imminent threat to the safety of any country other than his own. \n\n In retrospect, I would agree, but at the time, he was thumbing his nose at the International community and becoming more and more emboldened as he regained more and more wealth through illegal OFF proceeds.\n \n \n\n Point 6 i will also argue that the people of iraq are not being liberated because we the bush administration are sympathetic humanitarians, but only because iraq is sitting on the second largest oil reserve in the world\n\n The key word in your fallacious argument is \"only\". There are many reasons that the people of Iraq are being liberated. These include our desire to maintain stability in the ME, our determination to prevent SH from rearming, especially with WMDs, as well as our desire to free the people of Iraq from SH's rule. \n You can't make an intellectually honest case for the war being exclusively over Iraqi's oil because the cost of the war has, so far, cost the equivalent of 1/3 of all of Iraq's reserves. And the US has never stated that we were planning to forcibly, or otherwise, extract 1/3 of their oil gratis.\n \n \n\n Point 7\n bush lied about the reason for the invasion, and he continuously shifted the rationale in order to sustain the invasion. \n\n In order for it to be a lie, the truth must be known beforehand. Prior to the invasion of Iraq, the UN believed SH had WMDs, British Intel told us that he had WMDs, even France and Germany believed that he had WMDs.\n The failure so far to find WMD in Iraq is a major embarrassment for President Bush, and congressional hearings into the intelligence prior to the Iraq War are welcome. But the post-Iraq debate shouldn't proceed on false pretenses: Everyone this side of famed Iraqi prevaricator Baghdad Bob believed that Iraq had WMD. In the run-up to the war, the United Nations, the \"axis of weasel\" (France and Germany) and high-profile Democrats all agreed about WMD.\n The specific figures in Secretary of State Colin Powell's U.N. presentation about Iraq's unaccounted-for WMD came from U.N. inspectors. France and Germany didn't argue that Saddam had no WMD, but inspections could rid him of them. Clinton and Al Gore dissented from aspects of Bush's policy, but agreed about WMD. \"We know,\" Gore said, \"he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons.\" http://www.townhall.com/columnists/richlowry/rl20030603.shtml\n \n\n Point 8\n we are not winning the war on terror\n\n That's a tough claim to prove OR disprove. I can only point to the fact that there has been no terrorist attack on US soil despite there being many terrorist attacks in other countries. OBL is forced to live in a cave for the remainder of his life and two terroruist regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq no longer exist.\n \n\n Point 9\n . in fact, we are not even fighting terror\n\n That's an easy one to disprove. Since 9-11, over 3000 Al Qaeda terrorists alone have been captured or killed. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries have joined the US in rooting out terrorists around the world. The International Community is freezing assets of \"front companies and charities\" and prohibiting the donation to still others. http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041019-050521-6847r.htm\n http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-homelandsecurity-storygallery%2C0%2C5108934.storygallery?coll=chi-newslocal-utl\n \n In summation, you can't use post-Iraq War information as a case against going to war in the first place. There was no a priori knowledge that Saddam didn't have WMDs. It was known that he was in constant violation of the terms of the Gulf War cease-fire.\n These violations included:\n 1. failure to provide evidence of the destruction of WMDs catalogued by weapons inspectors in the mid-90's.\n 2. attacking planes patrolling the No-Fly zone\n 3. not allowing unconditional access to all facilities in Iraq by UN weapons inspectors per UN Res 687.\n 4. failure to destroy all missiles capable of traveling over 150km\n \n We know that SH had links to terrorism. The OFF scandal proved that he was funneling money to suicide bombers' families as a \"bounty\" for killing Americans. We know that there were terrorist training camps in Northern Iraq and that the man responsible for the Achille Largo terrorist attack was captured in Iraq.\n \n While we didn't uncover expected stockpiles of WMDs, we did put a genocidal mass murderer out of business. We are bringing democracy to a country that has never experienced freedom. Iraq's women will be able to vote, attend school and be treated as equals with Iraqi men instead of as their property.\n \n Several new agencies have been created in the US, new security measures have been instituted in almost all major venues including airports, stadiums, arenas, Federal Buildings, courthouses, etc., Inspections at borders have increased; undesirables have been banned from airlines; visas are being more highly scrutinized.\n While we can debate the Constitutionality of these measures in another thread, we are, unquestionably being scrutinized much more than we ever have been in the past.",

As for wasting 2 years by invading Iraq, I submit that come Jan. 05, the existence of the first democracy in Iraq's history can hardly be deemed \"a waste\".\n\n we are already in jan 05, and no real developments in terms of a democracy in iraq are being made. the fact that the news doesnt report the conflict there as often is not a testament that the situation is quieter, as some people might think.\n \n \nNow, surely you didn't really mean to serve up this meatball for me to smack out of the park? Saddam was a proven threat to his own people and his neighboring countries people whom he attacked, sometimes even with WMDs. Estimates of SH's killings in his own country exceed 300,000 people, including at least 5,000 killed with chemical weapons. Don't you agree that makes him a notorious character?\n\n a notorious character perhaps, but as far as completely eclipsing bin laden, impossible. saddam has been a menace to his people for decades, bin laden dealt a direct slap to the american face. all of a sudden we notice the attrocities of saddam's 30-year regime, and effectively give bin laden a full pardon. this is not in any way reducing terrorism\n \n \nIn retrospect, I would agree, but at the time, he was thumbing his nose at the International community and becoming more and more emboldened as he regained more and more wealth through illegal OFF proceeds.\n\n violating un sanctions is not an act of terror, and pales in comparison to using commercial airlines as manned-missiles to destroy american targets. by focusing on the misdemeanors of saddam's defiance and not on the murders of innocent people caused by bin laden, we are not reducing terrorism\n \n \nThe key word in your fallacious argument is \"only\". There are many reasons that the people of Iraq are being liberated. These include our desire to maintain stability in the ME, our determination to prevent SH from rearming, especially with WMDs, as well as our desire to free the people of Iraq from SH's rule. \n\n we have no similar desire to \"liberate\" and other oppressed nation from any other dictator's rule. not only that, but since saddam had no wmds or arms of any kind in the first place, the threat of him \"rearming\" or \"unleashing wmds\" could be applied to virtually any country in the world. since we need no evidence to create such a charge against a sovereign nation, we could as easily attack anybody using the same excuse.\n \n \nYou can't make an intellectually honest case for the war being exclusively over Iraqi's oil because the cost of the war has, so far, cost the equivalent of 1/3 of all of Iraq's reserves. And the US has never stated that we were planning to forcibly, or otherwise, extract 1/3 of their oil gratis.\n\n and while the cost of the war has indeed exceeded the profits the oil reserve would give us, time will show that much of the iraqi oil revenue will be channeled back to the us as a form of \"maintenence fee\" for our liberating them. more importantly, the us will control who the oil goes to, to ensure that the european market will not get enough leverage to becoming more powerful than the us dollar\n \n \nIn order for it to be a lie, the truth must be known beforehand.

I can only point to the fact that there has been no terrorist attack on US soil despite there being many terrorist attacks in other countries. OBL is forced to live in a cave for the remainder of his life and two terroruist regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq no longer exist.\n\n gauging our national safety based on the length of time since the last attack is a terrible method. before 9/11, in the 5+ years of an attack-free state, the threat of a terrorist attack was still very real and eminent, even though we were unaware of it. 4 more years of attack-free status says absolutley nothing of our safety from terrorist threats, obviously. a more accurate indicator of how effect we are against terror is to look at\n - the size of the terrorist activities between then and know\n - our ability to identify and intercept attacks\n - our ability to prevent attacks before they happen\n - the funding and resources available to these terrorists\n - our intelligence on what the terrorists are up to\n \n we have focused all our efforts on invading and \"liberating\" iraq, while in egypt, jordan, the saudi peninsula, pallestine, sudan, syria, lybia, and about a dozen other middle-east countries in the region, terrorist recruitment is up, while our intelligence on their resources, movent and plans are down. therefore the terrorists are gaining the advantage, while our forces are not even confronting them. clearly, we are not fighting terrorism, let alone winning it\n \n \nThat's an easy one to disprove. Since 9-11, over 3000 Al Qaeda terrorists alone have been captured or killed. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries have joined the US in rooting out terrorists around the world. The International Community is freezing assets of \"front companies and charities\" and prohibiting the donation to still others. http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041019-050521-6847r.htm\n\n out of a estimated 70,000 to 100,000 recruits in al qaeda alone, what makes you think that capturing 3,000 is really an impact? and since 9/11, al qaeda has possibly recruited 5 times that amount, but is evident that al qaeda is growing faster than we are reducing it. does that soune like we are eliminating terror?\n \n forbidding donations to charities \"suspected\" of funding terrorism is not a war activity and is totally unrelated to our invasion in iraq. and this article will still do very little to stop terrorism, since is doesnt give definitive evidence to back up its claim, nor does it show that we are actually stopping people from giving to the charity, nor stopping the charity organization from distributing the funds in anyway they please. this is hardly a blow to terrorism\n \nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-homelandsecurity-storygallery%2C0%2C5108934.storygallery?coll=chi-newslocal-utl\n\n this too is not even remotely related to the invasion in iraq, and is not even scratching the surface of eliminating terrorism\n \n \nIn summation, you can't use post-Iraq War information as a case against going to war in the first place. There was no a priori knowledge that Saddam didn't have WMDs. It was known that he was in constant violation of the terms of the Gulf War cease-fire.\n\n this is not true. the fact is that bush declared war on iraq on the basis that he was a threat to the safety of the united states. violating un sanctions does not make a country a threat to the us. the actually given reasons for the declaration of war all turned out to be based in untruths\n \n \nThese violations included:\n 1. failure to provide evidence of the destruction of WMDs catalogued by weapons inspectors in the mid-90's.\n\n the very weapons inspectors documented the weapons that were dismantled and disposed of. though they did not correspond in numbers with the amounts from the 90's, it still did not demonstrate that he did not destroy them all. by the reports of the weapons inspectors, they were all destroyed, and there was nothing left in iraq to destroy, after years of being in iraq looking for the same wmds, we came to the same conclusion that the inspectors came to. its just that it cost us hundreds of millions and thousands of lives and a few years to find out what they had already told us\n \n2. attacking planes patrolling the No-Fly zone\n\n the \"no-fly zones\" had nothing to do with un sanctions and were set up by the us illegally in the first place. iraq was under no obligation to abide by these rules, and violation of them did not make them violators of un sanctions\n \n3. not allowing unconditional access to all facilities in Iraq by UN weapons inspectors per UN Res 687.\n 4. failure to destroy all missiles capable of traveling over 150km\n\n the iraqis were indeed non-cooperative with un inspectors, prior to 9/11. in fact, the conflict between saddam and the un inspectors ended sometime in 1999, when the inspectors decided it wasnt worth the effort to contend with the iraqis. we declared war on iraq some 3 years later, deciding that all of a sudden its time to rush to war for a 3 year-old violation. according to the same inspection report, iraq did declare all their illegal al-sammoud missiles to the un, and destroyed them in march 2003. do we still consider them sanctions violators even though their compliance was witnessed and documented?\n \n \nWe know that SH had links to terrorism. The OFF scandal proved that he was funneling money to suicide bombers' families as a \"bounty\" for killing Americans. We know that there were terrorist training camps in Northern Iraq and that the man responsible for the Achille Largo terrorist attack was captured in Iraq.\n\n we also know that most of the al qaeda operatives and sponsors of the 9/11 attack were from saudi arabia. saddam was in no way a major terrorist sponsor, probably not even in the top 100. and even if he was, eliminating his 1% contribution to terrorism at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives is obviously not worth it, especially if your stated vision is to eliminate ALL terrorist sponsorship.\n \n \nWhile we didn't uncover expected stockpiles of WMDs, we did put a genocidal mass murderer out of business. We are bringing democracy to a country that has never experienced freedom. Iraq's women will be able to vote, attend school and be treated as equals with Iraqi men instead of as their property.\n\n equality in iraq among the people still waits to be seen. democracy does not equate to prosperity, peace and certainly not the elimination of islamic fundamentalism. it is utterly naive to think that a population of anti-american muslim extremist will be appeased by inposing the very american system they despise in their region. not only that, but it is even more naive to expect this democracy to \"spread\" into the surrounding nations that never looked up to iraq in the first place. why would a country want to emulate an inferior country. installing democracy in iraq has absolutely no impact in terms of reducing terrorism, but rather more likely the opposite effect\n \n \nSeveral new agencies have been created in the US, new security measures have been instituted in almost all major venues including airports, stadiums, arenas, Federal Buildings, courthouses, etc., Inspections at borders have increased; undesirables have been banned from airlines; visas are being more highly scrutinized.\n While we can debate the Constitutionality of these measures in another thread, we are, unquestionably being scrutinized much more than we ever have been in the past.\n\n installing a police-state system in america is not going to reduce terrorism.\n \n you reduce terrorism by eliminating the terrorists, and by weeding plucking out the instigators of muslim extremism. you eliminate terrorism by anihilating terrorist organizations. you eliminate al qaeda by crushing bin laden.\n \n none of the activities our troops are occupied in are reducing terrorism. none",

   "If either debater spent the amount of time they used launching attacks on the other to establish a criteria by which I could adjudicate the round, this might have actually been a good debate. As it is, neither of y'all had any knockout points, and the entire thing focused way too much on the Saddam/terror linkage. This is one issue of importance, to be sure, but hardly deserved the time spent on it.\n \n Essentially, the key argument in the round for Unkerpaulie comes down to the \"oppurtunity cost\" arg (my summary, but since his entire attack was basically \"Saddam wasn't as bad as X,\" I think it's a fair summary). This is a pretty weak argument on the whole, because it assumes (without any supporting analysis) that we would/could do any of the alternatives suggested. Was there the political will to invade Congo, or NK? Would we have shifted all the Iraq war resources to the Al-Qaeda fight? We don't know, and Unkerpaulie never gives us any analysis to tell us why it would happen. Furthermore, I'm not sure if it actually proves his point. If I can give $5 books to a child, or $10 bucks to an elderly man, either option could reasonably be considered \"good,\" even if one is \"better\" than the other. Unkerpaulie has to show why the invasion was a BAD idea, not why it wasn't the best idea. Could it be argued that any idea but the best idea is a \"bad idea\"? Probably, but nobody got into that debate. Since y'all are forcing me to set the standards, I'm going to pick the one that has the most competitive equity. Net good vs. net bad seems relatively fair. The caveat to this, however, is that there has to be a sizable \"net good\" to vote for the war (this is self-evident, we wouldn't justify a war on the basis of saving one baby bunny rabbit from being hurt, even though that might be a \"net good\"). Aside from that, Unker's other attacks (e.g., we're only in it for the oil) had zero warrant aside from their assertion and were not considered.\n \n The problem is, while all of Unker's \"bads\" are comparitive (e.g., Saudi Arabia is worse, OBL is worse), virtually all of JP's \"goods\" are speculative or based off misplaced intelligence. Democracy might or might not be a success in the region. Personally, I'm cautiously optimistic, but there was virtually NO debate on this facet of the issue, which was frustrating. Neither side made much effort to prove their points here. And while the lack of WMD's might have been an honest mistake, its still a \"mistake.\" All that noting that \"everybody\" made the mistake too proves is that Bush shouldn't be impeached. It doesn't prove we were right. The next point JP makes is the link to 9/11 terror; I'm swayed by Unker's disproof of this (the 9/11 commission also didnt buy the Czech meeting as having happened). JP's points about ending funding to Palestinean terror and capturing a noted genocideer are well taken and not sufficiently responded to (just because terror isn't happening on our soil doesnt mean we should ignore it, and finding ANY genocideer is good even if we can't get them all).\n \n Those last two points VERY weakly persuade me to vote for JP, since they are offensive reasons that clearly show a benefit to the invasion. However, I was overall disappointed with the quality of the debate, especially on an issue of such great importance. In your next debate, please please PLEASE give me a standard by which to adjudicate the round. I had literally no clue what to do hear because neither debater told me what was needed to be proven in order for either side to win the round. That leaves me floating. :(",
