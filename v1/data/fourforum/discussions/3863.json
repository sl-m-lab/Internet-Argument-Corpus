   "I'm sure everyone has heard this by now, but if not here's a brief synopsis...In Florida, a 24 year old female teacher, Debra Lafave, is being accused of having sex on numerous occasions with a 14 year old male student. They had sex at least 5 times, including on a field trip to Sea World, at her house, and in her car. The sex was consentual. She is being charged with lewd and lascivious behavior. She is facing 2 counts, which could total 30 years in prison.\n \n Mary Letourneau, when she was 34, had sex with a 12 year old male student 300-400 times. She became pregnant with his child and was charged with statutory rape, but released on bail. She was not allowed to associate with the underage kid anymore. She did it anyway. She then served a 3 month sentence in jail and was freed. She was again caught having sex with the person she was not allowed to have contact with (he was still underage). She became pregnant by the kid again. She was sentenced to 7 years in prison.\n \n The problem I have is the double standard here. A month or so ago, a weatherman in Florida, Bill Kamal, was arrested for setting up a meeting for sex over the Internet with what he thought was a 14-year-old boy. The boy was actually an undercover federal agent. He was immediately dismissed from his job and is being denied bond. He is being charged with enticing a child, a penalty that can carry up to 30 years in prison. And he didn't even have sex with anyone.\n \n How come when females have sex with underage kids society doesn't put it in the same category as when a man does? When a man does, he is chastized for the rest of his life. When a female does, she's cool. Mr. Kamal didn't even have sex with anyone and will likely serve at least 4 years in prison. Letourneau repeatedly had sex with a kid and served 3 months. Ms. Lafave will likely receive probation or a very minimal sentence. Why are the punishments not equal?",

This shows something. It's not like she is hideous and can only get a kid; she is good looking and yet goes for a kid over a man. And Mary Kay Latourneau was married when she had sex with a 12 year old!!! These women didn't just happen to have sex with a 12 or 14 year old becase they were in distress and couldn't find anyone else to fulfill their needs. One was married to a man and the other is good looking enough to get almost anyone she wants. Lordtammerlain said that Bill Kamal, the weatherman, will likely affect tens of kids and that a teacher would likely only affect one, yet Kamal never had sex with a kid. Having sex with a 12 or 14 year old could ruin their life, especially when they are on national TV. However, Latourneau got 3 months in prison for her 1st escapade and Lafave is likely to just get probation. There's a 99% chance Kamal will get at least 1 year, yet all he did was arrange to meet a kid.\n \n I don't even see how people can defend the women. They were just as wrong, if not wronger, than Mr. Kamal. What all of them did was wrong, but why do women tend to get off easier than men?",

That means I am presenting a \"supposed incident\" I am not saying it happened and that this guy met any kids in person. I stand by my post as is. A grown adult male chatting with kids on line is either prowling for prey , or is a bit short on bricks to his stairway upstairs. True , he does not deserve jail time for being caught chatting with kids, but the guy needs help, and need to be monitored. Internet abuse of kids on line is a growing menace in this country. ...\n \n How could anyone that is computer literate NOT know about the WRONG of adults \"chatting\" with children on line? The authorities in my state have set up special task forces to catch these people trolling for kids on line. The guy is not totally innocent , even if he had not made contact. ..\n \n And to the sex biased remark I say being biased has nothing to do with it. I am not much on being politically correct, because I am 52 years old, have seen a lot, and callem' the way I see them. Look at the averages of sexual crimes perps and you will see they are usually males, males are stronger physically and have the dominant role most of the time. \n \n Now, if you post a link on where a adult woman has molested a pre - puberty child 12 or under, then you will have me there with a hanging rope for her tied , nice and pretty.

However rape is not a sexual act - it's a violent one and it is actually hard for male rapists to sustain erections in a rape than with sex.\n \n By the way - this woman sounds like a predator to me. 14 year old boys may think they want an adult hottie - however the adult hottie has no business taking advantage of that.\n \n icky icky icky\n\n \n I won't argue that it isn't appropriate, but as for \"damaging to the victim\", I think that should be evaluated on an individual basis.

Now I understand the potential of the man's crime was much worse since he could have done something bad and the woman already showed it was consentual, but that's just potential.

For example we can't invade a country just because they had the potential to make WMD's... oh wait, too late.\n \n Ok but my point is if I have a gun you can't charge me for murder because of my potential to kill.

They are assuming that a 12 and 14 year old boy is fully competent in making decisions regarding sex (only when the recipient is a female), yet a 14 year old girl can't do the same because no matter what, she'll be pressured and overpowered. You can't just assume that since a grown man is bigger and stronger than a 14 year old girl that he will overpower her. If a 12 year old boy can make his own decisions, so can a 14 year old girl. \n \n It is amazing to see the complete lack of any objectivity in this debate. A woman is equally capable of rape, just as a man. The crime doesn't discriminate based on gender, yet women always get off the hook easier because they aren't looked at as such a menace to society as males are.",

   "Well, I go to an all-boys school with all-male teachers, so I can only say 'half his luck' about the 14 year old and his 'hottie' teacher.\n \n But what I cannot understand is what all the fuss is about. I can't see how the 14 year old bloke was 'scarred' or anything like that. My guess is that he felt much better about himself after the experience.\n \n My first sex was when I was thirteen, and it was with a schoolfriend's mum, who was, I guess, in her mid thirties, maybe even older. I certainly don't feel scarred, and I don't feel that I was forced into doing anthing I didn't already desperately want to do. It was great, and I felt great about myself afterwards!....\n\n \n Was her last name Robinson? :)",

International posts are, to me, welcome in that they often offer differing viewpoints from our (US) somewhat closed and prejudicial minds. \n\n I post to a few international forums. The debates can get quite nationalistic and lively. I only mentioned it because I wasn't aware that we had an international flavor, too. In other forums with international appeal, there is usually a box at the top for flags, country of origin and the like. emoticon_xgood \n \n\n Incidentally, that film was released 37-years ago and few people in the US under the age of 50 are familiar with it.\n\n \n But it's a classic!

   "Thanks Georged, but I have not found Americans to have closed or prejudiced minds. I found most to be very generous, like yourself, towards foreigners.\n\n I think that we all have a tendency to paint people with too broad a brush. I think that most people are kind and generous regardless of country of origin.\n \n\n I know this is OT, but I was fortunate enough to spend my last Christamas school holidays in the USA, and I have to say that I got to really like American people. I visited an elderly lady in California who knows my family, and I travelled around a lot of the States by myself, (I told her that I was being met by another adult friend of the family, or she would not have let me go.)\n \n\n Well, you picked a nice place to visit, even if I wouldn't want to live there. California has lots to offer someone who spends most of his time in the fog-covered UK. That big, yellow thing in the sky is called the sun, by the way. ;)\n \n\n Anyway, most Americans were really great to me, even though I was a foreigner in your land. And even though I had trouble with your language, and Americans had even more trouble with my accent. :) \n\n Americans typically are very hospitable to Brits. We have a long history of being strong allies, with the exception of a rocky start. And Brits, I've found, don't take themselves too seriously, as do Americans, so we're able to enjoy the common bond of humor.\n \n\n In my home country, the UK, and here in Australia, where I am an exchange student for a year, I hear lots of negative comments about 'the Yanks', but a lot of the people who say these things have never been to the USA.\n \n I reckon it's pretty stupid to typecast 300 million people as being one thing or another.\n\n The same is true here, but we don't hear too much bad press about Australia or the UK, so we generally have favorable impressions about both countries.\n \n\n But you do speak strange English, and no one understood me when I asked for 'chips', 'Devonshire Teas', directions to 'the coach station', or where the 'lift' was.
