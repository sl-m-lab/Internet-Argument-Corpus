   "I lived in Canada for 10 years and in the U.S. for 15 years. I have a history of kidney stones, and I had them in both countries. Here is what happened.\n \n CANADA:\n When the problem was diagnosed I was immediately admitted to a hospital. I stayed there for a few days until the problem was resolved. I did not pay a penny.\n \n UNITED STATES:\n I went to an emergency room and was diagnosed with a kidney stone. I said \"OK, take me upstairs and remove the stone.\" They said: \"No, you have to find a urologist.\" They took a blood sample, gave me some painkillers and sent me home. I went home to search for a urologist.\n \n Then I started to have fever. I went to the emergency room again. They took a blood sample, gave me some antibiotics and sent me home. [In Canada I was put in a hospital to be monitored for infection even before I had one.]\n \n I finally found a urologist and went to his office. After 2 hours of waiting they took a blood sample and the doctor told me the stone was small enough such that no procedure was necessary, and I should go back home. I was skeptical, and after some arguments and phone calls it turned out that they had faxed him the stone dimensions incorrectly as 4x4 mm instead of the actual 4x8 mm. So he told me to come to his other office in a few days.\n \n I came to his other office. They took a blood sample and scheduled an operation in a hospital.\n \n When I came to the hospital I was in pain. But they told me they would not perform the operation unless I paid $200 co-pay. I was prepared for the operation, given antibiotics and dressed in the hospital gown. Then I was informed that the operation was canceled and I should come the next day. The next day the operation was finally performed.\n \n Then I found that the hospital also charged the $200 co-pay to my insurance company and I was requested to pay for it again out of my deductible. I did recover my $200, but not without enduring rudeness by the person on the other side of the phone line. Apparently it was my fault that the hospital extorted $200 out of me..\n \n How is this a better healthcare?",
