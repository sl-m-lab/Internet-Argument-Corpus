   "\"This theme of equality and freedom is the approach that the homosexuals are using today - totally perverting the true intention of what our Constitution meant. ... The homosexuals get it - it's a struggle between our religious freedoms and their right to do what they want to do.\" \n \n Around the banquet hall, Kern's speech met with applause and calls of \"Amen!\" from a crowd stoked in a crucible of conspiracy and intrigue. For the whole day, the \"Clouds Over America\" conference, run and organized by the John Birch Society, held lecture after lecture Jan. 23 and 24 dedicated to explaining their various conspiracy-laden tenets. Here's one - that a godless secret society, the Illuminati, has been battling against the founding of the United States of America and decent citizens to live in peaceful, worshipful freedom. \n \n Kern called for a new \"Great Awakening,\" referring to a period of religious revivals from the 18th century considered precursor to the American Revolution. \n \n \"The solution is another Great Awakening, folks,\" Kern said. \"We need a spiritual revival, and that will only come if God's people, especially you pastors, will stand in your pulpits and vocally preach the word of God and thus declare the Lord this sin, and preach it in love, only then does our nation have a chance of overcoming the scourge of AIDS, HIV and the devastating destruction that the homosexual lifestyle is bringing on your children and our grandchildren.\" \n\n As conspiracy theories abound in Oklahoma, John Birch Society and others rally | OKG Scene.com\n emoticon_wow\n \n Where to begin... emoticon_frazzled\n \n 1) The \"true intention of what our Constitution meant\" is typically a call to apply only the issues that they endorse, and reject the issues that they object to.\n For example, people had \"beliefs\" regarding racism and segregation which were trampled upon. The government utilized legislation and the courts to establish \"equality and freedom\".\n And they support that.\n But when it comes to gays, they oppose.\n There are some individuals who would see a consistent standard of claimed \"true intentions of what our Constitution meant\", to show that the rules would apply in the same way to all. Giving the masses more power to discriminate and the minority less recourse (via the government) to fight back.\n \n 2) \"struggle between our religious freedoms and their right to do what they want to do\"\n I bold-faced the two items of significance.\n \"OUR religious freedom\" vs \"THEIR right to do what they want\"\n Ignoring the propagandic nature of the latter, I can't help but notice that the issues have a distinct lack of overlap, yet it's a common attempt for the religious right to pretend that they are somehow victimized when they can't make the gays into victims.\n \"OUR religious freedom\". That would mean that the INDIVIDUAL person has the right to follow HIS/HER beliefs in HIS/HER life.\n How does that conflict with other people's rights in what they \"want to do\"???\n \n Such an assumed imposition, whereby their \"religious freedoms\" extend into the lives of OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES is a recurring theme, and it demonstrates how irrational the \"Kerns\" of this nation can be...\n \n 3) \"that a godless secret society, the Illuminati, has been battling against the founding of the United States of America and decent citizens to live in peaceful, worshipful freedom\"...\n But the funny thing is that one myth, of the gays imposing upon the religious right, sees acceptance.\n The other myth, regarding the Illuminati, is typically recognized for what it is...\n \n 4) \"preach it in love, only then does our nation have a chance of overcoming the scourge of AIDS, HIV and the devastating destruction that the homosexual lifestyle is bringing on your children and our grandchildren.\"\n I invite people to recognize the absurdity that Kerns just perpetrated.\n To help some who are more inclined to perpetuate such occurrences, would the following rephrasing make sense and seem consistent?\"preach it in love, only then does our nation have a chance of overcoming ... the devastating destruction that the Christian lifestyle is bringing on your children and our grandchildren.\"If we tried to separate \"Christians\" from \"Christianity\", and denigrate Christianity in such an extreme way, would it make sense to try to tell Christians that the distinction is somehow significant enough to warrant a lack of revulsion at the innuendo?\n After all, a person could profess to \"love\" the Christian, but we \"hate\" the Christianity...\n \n Somehow, that \"phrasing\" would be recognized as a pathetic attempt to side-step the vile denigration, but some still think the above statement (regarding gays) is somehow perfectly sensical...\n \n 5) And then there is the whole accusation that \"homosexuality\" is somehow a threat to \"our children and our grandchildren\".\n Heaven help any gay \"children and grandchildren\" who have to live under the roof of that mentality...",

   "Who said anything about gay marriage?\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n It's quite obvious that Sally Kerns was explicitly and directly referencing gays.\n \"Gay Marriage\" would be the ultimate \"government\" recognition of gays, would it not? Any government which recognizes gay marriage will typically also recognize the full gambit of gay equality, like gay adoption, gays in the military, etc, etc...\n \n I realize you want to side-track the issue, cause you NEED to find some way to keep pushing the dead-line for \"God's judgment\" on nations back so it will be a \"future\" occurrence...\n Cause if you had to be specific to an issue and had to face the fact that your idea of \"decadance\" has come and gone and your God's \"destruction\" was a no-show???\n \n That would be too much for you...\n \n \n \nYou have a one track mind foundit, and a limited perspective also.

Slavery? Misogyny? Land theft from the rightful original occupants?\n \n This nation was not \"built upon\" \"Gods moral values\".\n It was built upon the constitution.\n Is your constitution found in your bible?

The application of the comparison, v. 22 endash 24. Two sorts of vessels God forms out of the great lump of fallen mankind:-[1.] Vessels of wrath-vessels filled with wrath, as a vessel of wine is a vessel filled with wine; full of the fury of the Lord, Isa. 51:20. In these God is willing to show his wrath, that is, his punishing justice, and his enmity to sin. This must be shown to all the world, God will make it appear that he hates sin. He will likewise make his power known, to dynaton autou. It is a power of strength and energy, an inflicting power, which works and effects the destruction of those that perish; it is a destruction that proceeds from the glory of his power, 2 Th. 1:9. The eternal damnation of sinners will be an abundant demonstration of the power of God; for he will act in it himself immediately, his wrath preying as it were upon guilty consciences, and his arm stretched out totally to destroy their well-being, and yet at the same instant wonderfully to preserve the being of the creature. In order to this, God endured them with much long-suffering-exercised a great deal of patience towards them, let them alone to fill up the measure of sin, to grow till they were ripe for ruin, and so they became fitted for destruction, fitted by their own sin and self-hardening. The reigning corruptions and wickedness of the soul are its preparedness and disposedness for hell: a soul is hereby made combustible matter, fit for the flames of hell. When Christ said to the Jews (Mt. 23:32), Fill you up then the measure of your father, that upon you may come all the righteous blood (v. 35), he did, as it were, endure them with much long-suffering, that they might, by their own obstinacy and wilfulness in sin, fit themselves for destruction. [2.] Vessels of mercy-filled with mercy. The happiness bestowed upon the saved remnant is the fruit, not of their merit, but of God's mercy. The spring of all the joy and glory of heaven is that mercy of God which endures for ever. Vessels of honour must to eternity own themselves vessels of mercy. Observe, First, What he designs in them: To make known the riches of his glory, that is, of his goodness; for God's goodness is his greatest glory, especially when it is communicated with the greatest sovereignty. I beseech thee show me thy glory, says Moses, Ex. 33:18. I will make all my goodness to pass before thee, says God (v. 19), and that given out freely: I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. God makes known his glory, this goodness of his, in the preservation and supply of all the creatures: the earth is full of his goodness, and the year crowned with it; but when he would demonstrate the riches of his goodness, unsearchable riches, he does it in the salvation of the saints, that will be to eternity glorious monuments of divine grace. Secondly, What he does for them he does before prepare them to glory. Sanctification is the preparation of the soul for glory, making it meet to partake of the inheritance of the saints in light. This is God's work. We can destroy ourselves fast enough, but we cannot save ourselves. Sinners fit themselves for hell, but it is God that prepares saints for heaven; and all those that God designs for heaven hereafter he prepares and fits for heaven now: he works them to the self-same thing, 2 Co. 5:5. And would you know who these vessels of mercy are? Those whom he hath called (v. 24); for whom he did predestinate those he also called with an effectual call: and these not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles; for, the partition-wall being taken down, the world was laid in common, and not (as it had been) God's favour appropriated to the Jews, and they put a degree nearer his acceptance than the rest of the world. They now stood upon the same level with the Gentiles; and the question is not now whether of the seed of Abraham or no, that is neither here nor there, but whether or no called according to his purpose.\n\n Blue Letter Bible - Commentaries\n \n \n \nAnd since you saw fit to actually quote the bible when you think it suits your purpose while otherwise denying it, I felt this passage was befitting that occasion.\n\n Archie, I think you fail to recognize what is going on.\n I never professed to follow your bible.\n But for those who DO, I'm pointing out what your religion actually says...\n \n To put it another way...\n If YOU refuse to listen to your bible, why the heck should I?\n \n \n \nPsa 50:16 But to the wicked God says, \"What right have you to tell of My statutes And to take My covenant in your mouth?\n Psa 50:17 \"For you hate discipline, And you cast My words behind you.\n\n Sigh.\n It's also disturbing how you think people who don't think your bible is believable somehow \"hate\" something...",

   "If people don't like it, they obviously don't need to read it...\n But like I pointed out in my original post, a lot of what she says are common-place statements. Unsubstantiated opinions and delusional beliefs that have been echoed on this message board time and time again.\n She's not alone...\n And that is why I post it.\n \n 1) The \"true intention of what our Constitution meant\" ...\n This has been an issue bandied about this message board on many occasions. If constitutional protections were removed from gays, we would still have sodomy laws on the books. It would still be legal in some parts of the country to arrest gays JUST for having private, consenting gay sex in their own homes.\n \n 2) \"struggle between our religious freedoms and their right to do what they want to do\"\n This issue has also been brought up quite a few times. People who pretend that gays are somehow imposing upon Christians by fighting back against anti-gay discrimination in our legislation.\n People who pretend that gays are somehow VICTIMIZING Christians by fighting back against anti-gay discrimination.\n \n 3) \"that a godless secret society, the Illuminati, has been battling against the founding of the United States of America and decent citizens to live in peaceful, worshipful freedom\"...\n Again, seen to one extent or another.\n And when people resurrect the \"1972 gay platform\" and similar junk, they are helping to keep such conspiracy delusions alive, on purpose or unintentionally.\n Most people here would never have heard of a \"1972 gay platform\" unless some anti-gay poster hadn't pointed it out to them. Any comments on \"don't even remember hearing of the woman\" are incredibly shallow, coming from a poster who posts about a \"1972 gay platform\" which is unilaterally condemned by gays is incredibly shallow and quite frankly hypocritical.\n At least the gays condemn that \"platform\", while I see no criticism for Sally Kerns comments from anti-gay Christians.\n \n \n 4) \"preach it in love ... the devastating destruction that the homosexual lifestyle ...\"\n Again, these are sentiments echoed here. A pretense of \"love the sinner, hate the sin\" and attempts to claim focused attention on areas of the \"sin\" (like the act of gay sex) when the examples demonstrate that the anti-gay movement is obviously much more concerned with the existence of gays.\n They even try to persuade gays to change themselves with \"reparative therapy\" and ignore how destructive THAT \"therapy\" is to gays.\n \n And on this front, I think the statements of another parent are relevant.\n Hopefully Kerns' son won't wind up in the same conclusion...\n \n A Child is Listening...\n \"Because of my own lack of knowledge, I became dependent upon\n people in the Clergy. When the Clergy condemns a homosexual\n person to Hell and eternal damnation, we, the congregation, echo\n 'Amen'. I deeply regret my lack of knowledge concerning gay and\n lesbian people. Had I allowed myself to investigate what I now see\n as Bible bigotry and diabolical dehumanizing slander against our\n fellow human beings, I would not be looking back with regret for\n having relinquished my ability to think and reason with other\n people...people I trust for truth and guidance in my life and in the\n life of our gay son.\n \n \"God did not heal or cure Bobby as he, our family and Clergy believed\n He should. It is obvious to us now why He did not. God has never\n been encumbered by His child's genetically-determined sexual\n orientation. God is pleased that Bobby has a kind and loving heart. \n In God's eyes, kindness and love are what life is about. I did not\n know that each time I echoed 'Amen' to the eternal damnation,\n referring to Bobby as sick, perverted and a danger to our children\n that his spirit was broken until he could no longer rise above the\n injustice of it all. Bobby ended his life at age twenty.\n \n \"It was not God's will that Bobby jump over the side of a freeway\n overpass into the path of an eighteen-wheel truck, killing him\n instantly. Bobby's death was the direct result of his parent's\n ignorance and fear of the word gay.\n \n \"An injustice has been done not only to Bobby but to his family as\n well. God knows it isn't right that Bobby is not here with loved ones. \n Correct education about homosexuality would have prevented this\n tragedy. There are no words to express the pain and emptiness\n remaining in the hearts of Bobby's family members, relatives, and\n friends. We miss Bobby's kind and gentle ways, his fun-loving spirit,\n his laughter. Bobby's hopes and dreams should not have been taken\n from him, but they were. We can't have Bobby back; if we could we\n would say to him, as I say to all gay and lesbian people around the\n world, these benevolent words of Leo Buscaglia:\n \n ' Love yourself -- accept yourself -- forgive yourself --\n and be good to yourself, because without you the rest\n of us are without a source of many wonderful things.'\n \n \"There are children like Bobby sitting in our congregations. \n Unknown to you, they will be listening to your 'Amens' as they\n silently cry out to God in their hearts. Their cries will go unnoticed\n for they cannot be heard above your 'Amens'. Your fear and\n ignorance of the word gay will soon silence their cries.

   "But like I pointed out in my original post, a lot of what she says are common-place statements.\n\n \n Here's another example...\n SALT LAKE CITY (ABC 4 News) - Utah state senator Chris Buttars is now comparing some in the gay community to radical Muslims.\n \n Buttars makes this strong comment in an upcoming documentary about Prop 8.\n \n And they come just a year after remarks by Buttars greatly offended many African-Americans.\n \n In late January of this year, Senator Buttars sat down for an interview with documentary maker and former ABC 4 reporter Reed Cowan.\n \n Cowan's documentary is called, \"8: The Mormon Proposition. \"\n \n In it, Buttars not only makes the comparison to radical Muslims, but also suggests that gays could pose the greatest threat to America.\n \n Because the documentary has not yet aired, we can't show you the video of senator Buttars speaking.\n \n But ABC 4 has seen it.\n \n And in the audio clips which ABC 4 received permission to broadcast from Reed Cowan Productions, Buttars makes several equally strong comments.\n \n Sen. Chris Buttars: \"Homosexuality will always be a sexual perversion. And you say that around here now and everybody goes nuts. But I don't care.\"\n \n Just one year ago, Buttars found himself in hot water locally and nationally for this comment on the senate floor.\n \n \"This baby is black...this is a dark, ugly thing.\"\n \n And even though Buttars says in the documentary interview,...\"the ACLU - bless their black hearts...,\" it's his other comments which may get the strongest reaction.\n \n Like this one which the documentary maker confirms is about gays.\n \n \"They're mean. They want to talk about being nice. They're the meanest buggers I have ever seen.\"\n \n And just seconds later, Buttars draws a comparison between some gays and radical Muslims.\n \n \"It's just like the Muslims. Muslims are good people and their religion is anti-war. But it's been taken over by the radical side.\"\n \n Buttars also claims he's \"killed\" every gay rights bill in the legislature for the last 8 years.\n \n He also talks about gay marriage being the beginning of the end.\n \n Buttars: \"What is the morals of a gay person? You can't answer that because anything goes.\"\n \n And finally, this is how senator Buttars refers to the \"radical gay movement.\"\n \n \"They're probably the greatest threat to America going down I know of.\" \n EXCLUSIVE: Senator Buttars compares some gays to radical Muslims - ABC 4.com\n \n If you visit the web-site, you'll see an online poll asking people if they agree with Senator Buttars.\n Almost a full 7% state they agree with Senator Buttars.\n \n Being an online poll, it suffers from the fallacies of the online poll.\n But to compare it anyways and put it into perspective, gays make up only about 5% of the population.\n By some people's numbers only gays, there would be about twice to four times as many people who agree with Buttars than gays...\n \n As I said in starting this thread, I post it because the statements given represent a very real presence in our United States that should not be ignored.",

But just remember this Matt, the people spoke, not a few judges who are in the pocket of a minority special interest group. \n\n By this logic, blacks should have just been content if a Southern state passed some law that discriminated against them... emoticon_emb\n Our frustration is justified. Under the California constitution, our right to marriage was VERIFIED and ACKNOWLEDGED, and people took that away from us.\n \n Maybe you need to be in a position like that for yourself, where one of YOUR rights is taken away by the prejudice of the majority, before you can get what we're talking about.\n But even then, I doubt you would. In your mind, your head is just too firmly established as refusing to see the discrimination against gays as anything less than expected and \"just\".\n \n Somebody recently pointed out that the children of today would look back at the travesty of their parents and be ashamed by how their parents today were treating gays.\n That is already happening.",

   "Evidently that is precisely the case. Either your imagination or more delusions on your part. Are you taking your meds like a good boy, because religious groups have no more power to place amendments on ballots than the State Constitution allows for. It's an action which is built into the State Constitution and is accomplished through the Secretary of States office in order to allow the PEOPLE to decide issues rather than the Governor or the State Legislature.\n \n Like it or not, Prop 8 was an example of the people of California speaking, not the churches. If only Cali's religious people voted for it and all secularists voted against it, homosexual marriage would be legal right now in California.\n \n Wasn't it a gay group that took this issue to court in order to usurp the previous ballot initiative through judicial activism?

Such is the reality of this spiritual battle we are in. So I have no illusions of christian invincibility at all in this world, just as you should have none about the value and importance of your homosexuality or the lifestyle it represents.\n \n What is so sad Matt is that you embrace and cling to this lifestyle as if it's your salvation when since it's of this world, all it represents is your destruction. And I could say the same thing to you if your passion was only hunting or shooting pool which took precedent over what really matters in this life, and that is fulfilling what you were created for, that is fellowship with with our heavenly father who created us in His image.\n \n Instead though, you rant and rave at how much you hate Him if you can't get what your flesh desires in this world. You need to seriously reconsider your priorities and what is really important to you. Will you trade an eternity in glory for a few decades of physical decadence? If so, you have the right and the power to make that choice. But I'm imploring you to adopt an eternal rather than an immediate perspective about why you exist and what matters in the long term for you. \n \n After all Matt, none of this will matter in the Age to come. All of the desires of the flesh are for not when compared to the ultimate reason for our existence which is to fellowship and serve our maker who is worthy of all praise and worship. \n \n My hope for you and everyone is that you would seek absolute truth rather than what seems right according to your personal desires. And I know how difficult it is to submit ones will to God as I have made that decision myself. It is the definition of what faith is. It means giving up our personal desires by faith and following Him. It's a true adventure since we don't know what's coming from one day to the next. But that is just as it is for the unbeliever except that the believer knows that our life is in the hands of a loving father who is trustworthy and cares for us in even the most minute aspect of our life. \n \n I truly wish only the best for you Matt. I vent at you in my frustration at what I know to be a completely shallow and fruitless world view, but if I thought that being gay would or could prevent you from having what I do in Christ, I would never tell you to seek Him as I have. Christ died for ALL OF US, no matter what sins separate us from Him. If you seek His truth, I can confidently promise you that HIS TRUTH will set you free in ways that make your current understanding seem like the spiritual emptiness it truly is.\n \n Here is the prophecy which say's that the beast will kill any and all who would refuse to worship him. Which the followers of Christ will refuse to do.\n Rev 13:15 He was granted [power] to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.\n \n Rev 13:16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, And here is the judgment where it states that the method they were killed was by beheading. Interesting in light of radical Islam's preferred method of killing perceived infidels, don't you think?Rev 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then [I saw] the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received [his] mark on their foreheads or on their hands.

Not that I ever saw.\n \n And if you are posting this in response to my post about biblical prophecies regarding christian persecution in the last days, isn't it obvious that you are creating a strawman/red herring/bogus argument since I never said that persecution was taking place NOW in America, at least. So what's your point foundit? Just more stretching of reality in order to paint yourselves as victims once again?\n \n Only in your mind is someone victimizing you for speaking their mind in a country where free speech is supposed to be allowed. But you can post thread after thread looking for the most inane reasons to condemn christians as you post stories about individuals and condemn us all with sweeping generalizations, but you are allegedly doing some sort of public service. \n \n When foundit does it, it isn't hate speech, but when traditionalists stand against what the homosexual agenda represents, it's discrimination of the highest order. You are a flaming hypocrite foundit and you have no concept of equal rights or fair play in a civil society. Oh, and by the way, the quality of your reasoning and the double standards you represent disgust me.\n\n \n Tell me foundit, how is your post #44 in any way an on topic rebuttal to my post 43 which directly confronted the hypocrisy of what your post 42 argues? Must you always just make excuses and justifications rather than ever objectively respond to the arguments posed? As for Buttar's statement:\"This baby is black...this is a dark, ugly thing.\" Here is what he was actually talking about, but was once again unfairly attacked when PC extremists conveniently took what he said out of context and made it an ugly racial statement. And the propaganda tactics of the homosexual agenda are right out of the extremist handbook, but I missed the part where he compared them to terrorists. http://www.abc4.com/content/news/slc/story.aspx?content_id=97874B57-73A7-463D-890A-AD0CE40BDE20xdonno:\n \n \n[Post 44]1) Senator Buttars' comments are not shared by a vast majority.\n Not by a \"conservative majority\" either.\n \n 2) Senator Buttar's put homosexuality up as equivalent to terrorism.\n He stated homosexuality was the biggest threat to America.\n Do you think that a \"vast majority\" or \"conservative majority\" agree with that?\n \n No. I did not miss that.\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n Archie, I have criticized Matthew on a variety of occasions for his attacks on Christians.\n \n Archie, at this stage you've either got too short of a memory to intelligently remember, or you're just plain lying.\n The \"mass protests against churches\" occurred because of their unconstitutional \"separation of church and state\" violation.\n \n Furthermore, CHURCHES CAN'T VOTE, which should tell you there is something significantly wrong about your claim... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n No. I am not.\n I am posting this cause unlike your \"biblical prophecy\" junk, THAT was topical....\n \n And if I were to switch the word \"gay\" for \"Christian\", I'm betting you would recognize the attack and claim \"victim\" wouldn't you... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n You question the fact that I think Barber's claims are inaccurate ...\n ... and then you claim I am making \"sweeping generalizations\"?\n \n I was EXPLICITLY SAYING that Barber was wrong in his claim that a \"majority\" of \"conservatives\" and Christians believed in Buttar's statements...\n ... and you can't realize that is EXPLICITLY saying that a \"sweeping generalization\" IS WRONG ???\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I would NEVER claim that Christianity is the biggest threat to the nation.\n \n This is hilarious.\n I want equal rights, but you claim I have \"no concept\".\n And the whine about me not knowing \"fair play\"?\n You are REALLY reaching for something to whine about.\n I point out how pathetic Buttar's statements are, and you criticize me for doing so... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Quite frankly, I think there is nothing better at this stage than for me to repeat Buttar's statements. The ones I am condemning, and the ones you are trying to defend Barber's defense of Buttars on.\n \n My condemnation of the following is what is prompting Archie to say I \"have no concept of equal rights or fair play in a civil society\"...\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Sen. Chris Buttars: \"Homosexuality will always be a sexual perversion. And you say that around here now and everybody goes nuts. But I don't care.\"\n \n Just one year ago, Buttars found himself in hot water locally and nationally for this comment on the senate floor.\n \n \"This baby is black...this is a dark, ugly thing.\"\n \n And even though Buttars says in the documentary interview,...\"the ACLU - bless their black hearts...,\" it&#8217;s his other comments which may get the strongest reaction.\n \n Like this one which the documentary maker confirms is about gays.\n \n \"They're mean. They want to talk about being nice. They're the meanest buggers I have ever seen.\"\n \n And just seconds later, Buttars draws a comparison between some gays and radical Muslims.\n \n &#8220;It's just like the Muslims. Muslims are good people and their religion is anti-war. But it&#8217;s been taken over by the radical side.&#8221;\n \n Buttars also claims he's \"killed\" every gay rights bill in the legislature for the last 8 years.\n \n He also talks about gay marriage being the beginning of the end.\n \n Buttars: \"What is the morals of a gay person? You can't answer that because anything goes.\"\n \n And finally, this is how senator Buttars refers to the \"radical gay movement.\"\n \n \"They're probably the greatest threat to America going down I know of.\" \n I condemn these statements, and Archie condemns me for doing so... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n =\n \n =\n \nI condemn these statements, and Archie condemns me for doing so...\n\n \n True, I condemn your hypocrisy and the double standards you represent since you are totally blind to, support and personally do much worse by posting any and every thread OP you can find which represent what individuals do as you attempt to paint all christians with the same sweeping generalization, not to mention your communities militant ministry of imposing your warped world view on the rest of us without regard for the negative impact it will have on the larger society. But if any of us dares to speak openly in condemnation of you represent, you consider that hate speech. If you can spew your hate against our moral and traditional values, then surely we have the right to speak honestly about the immoral values your community represents. ",

You SHOW this when you quote racists in your eagerness over the fact that they had something anti-gay to say as well.\n \n You \"missed the part where he compared them to terrorists\"???\n That is PART OF THE MAIN POINT.\n Would you, for just ONCE figure out what's going on before you pretend to tell everybody what \"truth\" is?\n \n \n \nTrue, I condemn your hypocrisy and the double standards you represent since you are totally blind to, support and personally do much worse by posting any and every thread OP you can find which represent what individuals do as you attempt to paint all christians with the same sweeping generalization...\n\n At this stage, your repeated claim that I \"paint all christians with the same sweeping generalization\" is either a sign of your thorough refusal to recognize what I am saying, or you're just plain telling another stupid lie.\n At this stage, I don't care which.\n \n I DO NOT \"paint all christians with the same sweeping generalization\".\n I have REPEATEDLY said that I believe the vast majority of Christians ARE APPALLED by the mentality of Buttars.\n I have REPEATEDLY said that most Americans, and even most Christians, are in favor of MOST forms of gay equal rights. The ONLY exception to that is \"gay marriage\".\n \n And in reply to all that, you're just going to ridiculously continue to repeat that absurd claim, aren't you... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n... not to mention your communities militant ministry of imposing your warped world view on the rest of us without regard for the negative impact it will have on the larger society.\n\n What negative impact?\n Gay marriage is legal in many countries, and present in Massachusetts.\n WHERE is the negative impact?\n \n It doesn't exist, and people like you love to make that claim cause you want others to give into the same fear that grips your lives.\n Heaven forbid that rational thought creep into your head...\n \n \n \nBut if any of us dares to speak openly in condemnation of you represent, you consider that hate speech.\n\n I never said anything about \"hate speech\", so stop putting words into my mouth.\n With that said, what Buttars said was vile and reprehensible.\n MOST Christians would be appalled by Buttar's mentality.\n \n \n \nIf you can spew your hate against our moral and traditional values, then surely we have the right to speak honestly about the immoral values your community represents.\n\n I ask for equality and criticize those who say I should not have it, and Archie labels it as \"hate\"\n \n I condemn a man who compares gays to terrorists, and Archie condemns me for it.\n \n I say that most Christians would be appalled by Buttar's statements, and Archie accuses me of generalizing statements onto \"all Christians\"...\n emoticon_frazzled",
