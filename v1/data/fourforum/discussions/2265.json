   "Which is the better philosophy of the two? Or is there a more appropriate balance?\n What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\n \n Individualism - (egoism, selfishness, objectivism)\n Altruism - (collectivism, selflessness)\n\n Excellent question. The problem with altruism is that it requires you live your life for the herd, and individual flourishing can get squished in the meantime. Plus, the egoistic impulse is much stronger than the altrusitic one, so altruism works against natural motivation. \n \n The problem with egoism is that I think the psychology of most people is to belong to something bigger than self--self is too small. Individualism can fill one with a sense of purposelessness, and can degenerate into short-term hedonism which long-term will not fulfill a person. Man is more than a cow who needs his stomach filled. And individualism can easily degenerate into a willingness to step on others to get what you want, and life is not good when everybody is exploiting everybody. \n \n My thinking is that the better ethic is to value achievement. Devote your life to accomplishing the most you can achieve and supporting achievment in others. You will be working for your own achievement, so you're going with the natural motivation, and will have a cause that is bigger than just you--the cause of greatness--but your devotion to the cause will end up rewarding you the individual.",

I will not be a master nor a slave. I will not sacrifice myself to anyone - nor sacrifice anyone to myself.\" \n \n Rand I think is very rhetorically savvy but her theories don't seem to hold water for me.\n \n First of all, its unstable and inconsistant. Look to her third quote (\"an individualist is a man...\"). In effect, the man is being \"ruled\" in that he is conceding his ability to take certain actions (ex: enslaving others). He is a slave to a certain dogma. While I don't have a huge problem with this insofar as it means I am morally bound not to kill others for example, I think it also hurts more noble ends. Specifically, when she claims that one must \"not sacrifice [oneself] to anyone,\" that goes beyond saying that one isn't obligated to help others and moves into the realm of saying one is OBLIGATED not to help others, even if one wants to. That isn't true freedom, because it enforces a certain view of the world onto individuals who may \"freely\" see it differently (I may WANT to help others, b/c I'm a nice, friendly guy!)\n \n Second, Isiah Berlin points out one major problem with her perception of liberty \"Liberty does not just mean freedom of action, but also (and equally) freedom from the consequences of other's actions.\" The consequentialist aspect of liberty needs to be valued too. Look to her first quote. There are at least as many situations where the MEANS are just, but the ends AREN'T to certain people. This generally happens when their is a gross power imbalance between two negotiating groups (Rand claims that the ideal relation between humans is as merchants or traders, because they theoretically can freely enter agreements w.out coercion. But she doesn't seem to realize the socio-political realities that make even nominally \"non-coercive\" negotiations into entirely onesided affairs). If I find a man stranded on a desert island, and I offer to rescue him for the price of him becoming my man-servant for the next year, that isn't a \"just\" action even if we both agree to it, because the power structure is so skewed. For the man on the island to be truely free, he must also be free from the consequence of my decision not to take him off the island, but he's effectively bound to me because the alternative is death. The Randian world doesn't offer him solvency because it refuses to step in and give me a positive obligation to take him off the island. Keep in mind that this \"contract\" is entirely consistant with Rand's second quote, as the person IS being rewarded (with food). Essentially, ONE of us will lose his freedom, but the tunnelvision Rand uses (which only deals with half of liberty) doesn't account for it. This ends up being the worst problem with the Randian ethos, because ALOT of rights violations come out of oppressive relations between the privileged and the subordinated. The poor consistantly are bargaining with the rich but they have no leverage and thus can continually be exploited. The rich neither have an obligation nor an incentive to change the terms of the contract to put the poor on equal terms. So while the poor may be \"free\" in one sense of the term, they are effectively locked into an exploitative system. Monwarul Islam remarks \"The call for a level playing field sounds so convincing as to make us often forget that a fair game on a level playing field can only occur amongst comparable players, not between giants and dwarves.\" Rand may create a level playing field, but the giants can still stomp on the dwarves. And since the giants have the same advantage in political negotiations as they do in any other negotiation, they can \"rig the rules\" so they are maintain the status quo and insure that the framework by which we view \"fairness\" in the game is one that helps the giants. Rand herself, for example, is a product of a viewpoint that sees theoritical liberty as the ultimate value. However, this can hardly be made into a normative claim. A starving street urchin would probably value provision of basic needs higher. Within Rand's framework, feeding poor people at the expense of agrobusiness freedom isn't fair. Within the poor person framework, allowing agrobusiness total freedom while people starve isn't fair. The Berlin/Mill view of freedom, reconciles the two by bringing into the equation substantive liberty (the second half of Berlin's formulation).\n \n Third, Rand only protects a narrow definition of rights. First of all, any notion of a positive right is entirely lost in a Randian world, I am not \"owed\" anything, I only \"possess\" rights that can't be taken away. This may be a fine formulation, but it is constricting and I am certainly hesistant to catagorically close off any possibilty of the existance of positive rights. Are individuals \"owed\" basic needs? How about human dignity? And even if adults aren't owed them, are children? I would assert there is a positive right to equality of oppurtunity at least, but Rand doesn't provide a mechanism for enforcement of it. Actually, enforcement is a big problem in a Randian world, even in terms of negative rights, because how do you account for someone simply ignoring the morality of the system? Since the ends of protecting others rights DOESN'T justify the infringement on the rights of the aggressor, the system is self defeating.\n \n Finally, Rand's logic in creating her formulation seems to beg the question. She claims altruism is bad because it is a moral formulation that requires suffering for one to be virtuous, while egoism doesn't. However, this seems abit Ivory Tower for me. Suffering does exist, the question is how we deal with it. I'd agree that if there was no suffering, we shouldn't create it so we can feel good about ourselves. But Rand confuses the syllogism that altruism operates off of. All altruism claims is that where suffering exists, one has an obligation to mitigate it. Where there is no suffering, one has no obligation. Rand proposes we stick our head in the sand, if we pretend we don't see suffering it will go away (or at least carry no moral weight). But since I am profoundly skeptical that the suffering DOES go away (or that ignoring it removes its importance), Rand's warrant collapses on itself.\n \n The bottom line is that Rand/egoism presents just one aspect of individualism. I don't like objectivism because I think its defense of rights is unconvincing, further more, I think it enables an oppressive system under the guise of equality by purporting to \"level the playing field.\" I think Berlin and Mill present a superior system because of the broader definition of liberty. I have the negative right to live my life free of interference except where I'd be interefering with someone else's liberty, and I have the positive right to anything which is required for me to exercise my liberty fully.",
