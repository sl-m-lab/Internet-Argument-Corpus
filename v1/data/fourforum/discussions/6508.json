   "I would like to start by saying there is only a small percentage of people out there who still judge by skin color most of these are elderly not to kick the elderly but they just grew up in a different generation. I am 18 years old and my generation did not grow up in a racist time no matter how much you want to believe it. I have been around black people too long to no like someone based on skin color. There are many problems with black culture. 1. Black people are more predjudice than white people. This comes from teaching kids who are in the first grade about slavery and the civil rights movement when their brains aren't developed enough to understand what happened. This breads the seed of hate. 2. Blacks are told from and early age that they don't have a chance at making it because they're black. This makes so many blacks feel if theres no need in trying. 3. Blacks in the north are different than blacks in the south. I met a black man from the north and he was so much more respectful to authority and me than blacks from the south. Im not saying all blacks in the south are like this but so many are. 4. I have to say that blacks dicipline their children very tough. This is a good thing. But I dont care how much you whip a kid to get them to respect you if you dont respect others and you dont respect them they will not respect anyone. Kids learn by example. 5. Black music promotes violence, abuse of women, and drug use. 6. Affrimitive Action is killing the black race. It was necessary in the 70s but when you get to the point where you come up through the same school system and you are judged on a different scale in school and in the work force thats not only unfair to whites but its a slap in the face to blacks as to say you cant do it on your own. This is wrong. Pollitical Correctness is hurting everyone. Black Culture in the past has donated so much to this country and now its donating hate and violence. This is not the dream Martin Luther King spoke of. He wanted people to be judged by the content of their character and judged on the same scale. The only way to bring the black community as a whole up is to put them on the same scale as you put whites because what we are doing now will never make things equal.",

I am 18...\nSuffice it to say that I work in the real estate field in a city in the US. Not that long ago (1990's). I purchased a house in the city to restore and rent or sell. I have some good black friends who have a small contracting company so I have them the job. I met them on a Monday morning and they started work. I met them on Tuesday morning, unlocked the door to the house and there was a noose hanging from the living room chandelier. After that, the building department of the city came and shut down the job they were doing for me for no reason. I know because I had to get the job reinstated and was told that no one could understand why it was shut down. This happened three times. I ended up in a fight with an inspector because I I stayed at the house waiting for him and he told me to my face that this job was not going to be signed off (approved) as long as these \"niggers' remained the contractors of record. This was in 1996 in a major US city.\n \n My daughter is of your generation (20 yrs old) and she went to public grammar and high schools. White teenagers whom she knows have been arrested and convicted of jumping black teenagers who happen to come into their neighborhood on more than one occasion. Many Arabs have been assaulted by white young men (under 21) whose names she recognizes.\n \n There is an illusion in certain areas of the country that racism has past. It hasn't. I have witnessed it first hand in the last ten years. If you have black friends and they do not tell you that racism still exists, they do not trust you to understand. I have not met one - repeat, not one - black man or woman who tells me that racism does not exist. That is in the construction field, the real estate field, the banking field, the investment field, the medical field (my brother is a well known specialist at a major hospital), the legal field and the political arena. Go into Detroit, Cincinnati, Newark, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, New York, Broward County, Jersey City, (New Orleans would go here). I might give you a different understanding.",

   "This is a very touchy subject. I can agree, somewhat, but I choose to avoid these topics as anytime a person like me (white) touches on the shortcomings of the African American population, they are immediately branded racist by the more extreme liberal minded people. and it's not as if we white people don't have enough shortcomings of our own to address. But for some reason, \"politically correct\" people prefer to give the African Americans a free pass when it comes to critique.\n \n I know that the former Secretary of Education is in a whole lot of hot water (as he should be) for saying:\n \n \nAddressing a caller's suggestion that the \"lost revenue from the people who have been aborted in the last 30 years\" would be enough to preserve Social Security's solvency, radio host and former Reagan administration Secretary of Education Bill Bennett dismissed such \"far-reaching, extensive extrapolations\" by declaring that if \"you wanted to reduce crime ... if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down.\" Bennett conceded that aborting all African-American babies \"would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do,\" then added again, \"but the crime rate would go down.\"\n \n \n Source \n \n Although his remarks were taken out of context by the time they hit the airways, it just goes to prove that criticizing the African American race is a no-win situation.\n \n I certainly agree with point #1. But I am just speaking from personal observation and am not declaring that as fact. It is a general observation.\n \n Point number 3, by my observations, is wrong. Having lived both in the north and south, I see very little difference in this regard.\n \n As far as point #4 goes, my friends who teach black students will strongly disagree with that. I have no personal knowlege of this however, not being in the homes where this supposed dicipline takes place. My friends who teach get cursed out daily and threatened by these students. One friend in particular refuses to teach in a predominantly black school. Her experienc with that left her quite tramatized.\n \n I'll stop there. \"Nice\" people don't talk about this. We turn a blind eye and pretend it doesn't exist. That's the liberal thing to do. Maybe it will go away. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I would say that both culture and skin color effect how a person is treated. Among white people as well, the culture a person projects through behavior, clothes, speech, etc. will influence how much respect that person is shown. Why should it be surprising that the culture that certain African American people project should also affect the respect shown them? \n \n From my own experience, I have often enough dealt with African American professionals who project a culture and speech no different than typical white professionals. Most of the time, it doesn't even really register with me that they are black - they are simply people. The same holds true for non-professional African Americans whose projected culture is the same as white culture.\n \n The way a person speaks (be they black or white) also affects my impression of them and urban or ethnic (as opposed to foreign) accents often do give the impression of lower culture and intelligence. (This was the premise behind the movie \"My Fair Lady\"). My mother once worked with an African American co-worker who told her that she uses a \"white\" accent at work and another in her home life - precisely for this reason. White professionals also improve on their ethnic accents in order to be taken more seriously.\n \n All of these points deal with a persons projected culture. However, I do admit that when the projected culture is that of a \"tough\" attitude, then I am more biased against black people than white people. I would be a lot more nervous encountering a group of young African American men in gangster-style outfits than I would a similar group of young white men. Mostly, I would feel that, as a white person, I could be targeted by them more so than if I were faced by a white group. \n \n Anyway, I just wanted to give my own example in showing how both culture and skin color can affect the image one has of others.",

You at least gave me something that was intelligent instead of just calling me a racist. I want this question answered for me by you. I do not go to a white private school. I go to a public school. Namely a black public school. I feel that the teachers and resources at my school are just as high as those at private schools. I want to know why is it that the white students are are doing so much better than black students. Take into effect that I have been going to school with this students since kindergarden. We have all had the same education. This generation of african americans are not like the fat kid who got hurt when he was a kid. Its important that we remember our history in an effort not to make the same mistakes. But you have to see how telling a child about how his race has been treated at such an early age will do to that child. That is very damaging. Everyone will have someone judge them by race at some point in their life. I don't know how many times I've been told your white you can't do that. You are somewhat right on Affirmitive Action. The previous generation did need Affirmitive Action and that was too get a position where the next generation wouldn't need it. We never stopped it though. Either way you cut it African Americans are losing here and I dunno why you guys can't see that. African Americans will never succeed in school as long as their culture portrays as a whole that school is a white thing. It doesn't matter how much easier you make it for them to succeed until they change their view and start trying to bring themselves out of where they are at they will never rise above. Will power has to come in somewhere. If you happen to be and African American who excels you are not looked upon fairly among other blacks b/c you are showing that you can excel and so many want to ride this wave of I can sit here and do nothing and b/c of my skin color I'll just get a free pass. We have to change the way so many in the black community think before any of the other stuff we try will make a dent.",

   "I'd guess that the reason for blacks generally being poorer educationally than whites is that they really haven't been 'equal' for long enough. For example Weimar Republic Germany saw a change from effective dictatorships under the Kaisers to one of the most democratic countries in the world at the time in a few scant years. But this didn't lead to instant stability, people weren't used to the breakdown of some social boundaries, weren't used to the voting system and weren't used to high-quality propaganda. It took a long time for Germany to become a working democracy. It will take a long time for blacks to become equal educationally, if they ever do.\n \n Another example would be racists; if your parents are racist, your grandparents were racist and your great-grand parents were as well, then there's an increased chance that you too will be racist. It takes several generations to stamp things like this out, just like, I expect, it will take several generations for blacks to become educationally equal to whites.\n Some of this is down to black music/ films/ idols etc. and its associated morals, but I'll point out, that in the UK at least, white wanna-be gangstas are the main buyers of 'black music'/ 'gangsta films'. Then again, there's so much black music out there that isn't 'gangsta rap', but it's not so controversial, so no-one really pays attention to it. Black Eyed Peas, Saul Williams, Destiny's Child, TLC and so on are examples of this.\n \n Another reason may be different values; education and scientific advance have been advanced the most by mainly white countries in the last few centuries. This has often been at the peril of other nations. Not everyone values education in the same way as others. For example, a guy I know has 3 As at A-level, something that's impressive by anyone's standards in a state school, yet he choose to become a tattoo-artist and didn't go to University. Does that make him stupid? No. It means he doesn't value education in the same way as I do. I don't think that's bad at all. I think 'African American' culture doesn't value education in the same way as most white people do. If this is bad/good or neutral, I'm not sure. From what I've heard, until 16/17 or something, education seems poor in the US. If you're poor, then waiting that long before getting somewhere in school, would put someone off further education in favour of just getting a job.\n \n I don't really have a solution to the problem of poorer black educational standards. I don't think limiting 'African American' culture is the right way to go, nor do I think that the state as a whole should make any laws based on skin colour. Personally, I think anyone who wants to get a decent education should be encouraged as much as possible to attain that, which may mean it benefits blacks, or whites more. Maybe reform the educational system in some way?\n \n -Wez",

   "It's funny to me that African Americans in the 60s thought more of education and wanting an education than they do now. Isn't this a step in the wrong direction. The black community needs another leader who will show them the first step to equality is making sure that you are doing everything in your power to obtain the same education as the white race. If you are doing that and you are still not getting what you want then its time to point fingers. But we know that this isn't the case. African Americans who do the best they can succeed. Just like Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice did. These two African Americans show that you can make it in this world being black. Yes, their is racism but I live in the heart of the south and the lower educated in both races seem to judge more by someones skin color. No race really judges more than the other. Thats the truth. I'm sry if you don't feel that way but I live in it. I'm really having trouble dealing with the fact that I was called a southern racist. I'm tired of being discredited like that because I am from the south and I don't agree with the politically correct bull that is widely thought.

   "Middle class African Americans commit crimes and do poorly in school also. The fact that they are poor makes the more likely to commit crimes but it always comes down to the individual. We all choose are destiny. Their are some poor kids that struggle with life but I have a strong moral and ethical background to know that violence and crime aren't the way out. Black Culture has to show that to African Americans who are struggling. Resorting to violence and crime will only continue the cycle. I am interested to hear what you think can be done to lift them out of poverty. This is hard because their will always be poverty. You will never make a society where no one is poor.\n\n \n Lol... Socio-economic status carries no explanation power because \"it`s up to the individual\" but race makes all the difference? You don`t understand what the other posters are trying to say, do you? \n \n To put it more precise. Poverty makes an individual more likely to commit crime (for various reasons). Poverty is more prelavent among blacks (for various reasons). Hence, crime rates are higher among blacks.\n \n Wether it is possible to explain all of the difference in crime rates between blacks and whites in the US, I do not know. But it`s certainly the biggest piece of the puzzle.",

Many black areas have very poor school systems with very low budgets. When kids have the ability to have choices other than crime then they may find that the crime will decrease. Also, more after school programs which many poorer areas cannot afford. Kids need alternatives.",

   "Having education funded on a federal rather than local level could help I guess, from what I gather most of US taxes seem to be more at local government level than national so schools and public facilities are better in rich areas, which is obviously going to lead inturn to giving people from rich backgrounds even more of a head start.\n \n Just focusing on personal responsibility is not enough, its half the problem. You are not purely responsible for yourself but partly responsible for everyone else as well, especially in a democratic society. Simply put, if you don't want someone stealing from you, help him get a decent job and he won't.",
