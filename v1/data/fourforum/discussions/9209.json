   "From the Economist, a left-leaning but pro capitalist paper:\n \n \"Advocates claim more than politics on their side. They argue that a higher minimum wage also makes economic sense. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-wing think-tank, recently published a letter signed by over 650 economists, including five Nobel prizewinners, which advocated a rise. Since the federal minimum wage was last raised in 1997 its real value has eroded dramatically. It is now less than in 1951 (see chart). Not only would a modest rise have \"very little or no effect\" on employment, the letter said, it would be an important tool in fighting poverty.\n \n Strong stuff. But, laureates notwithstanding, it does not reflect a consensus among the dismal scientists.\"\n \n I'd post more, but this is copyrighted material. The article goes on to demonstrate with many details why raising the minimum wage causes more harm than good. The same arguments can be found in ANY independently published economics textbook.\n \n A higher minimum wage will mean fewer jobs for the poorest people who are willing to work. It will ensure higher prices for essentials like groceries and clothes. It is a social, regressive tax that will be born by those who can least afford it.

Who the heck wouldn't want the minimum wage raised if it is reflected 3 to 6 times in their own paycheck?!? A brief example:\n A skilled painter can do a job in the same amount of time it takes 3 unskilled painters. The unskilled painters charge minimum wage per hour for their job. It is only justified that the skilled painter should charge 3 times the minimum wage for his services per hour (maybe a little less to make his prices competitive). So he charges around $15.45 an hour for his service. (5.15 x 3 = 15.45) The minimum wage is raised to the new indexed $7.25 to help the little man. Well, the unskilled painters now make $2.10 more per hour while the skilled painter makes $6.30 more per hour. Of course the painter would be for a minimum wage raise. I just want to know how this closes the gap between the poor and the wealthier. In the short term, the little man loses jobs and in the long term, the dollar becomes less valuable, prices adjust to the new minimum wage, and the gap between the classes has made zero to negative gain.",
