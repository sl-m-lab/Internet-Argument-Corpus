I can see this causing a slow down in many of our resource based economic activities.\n\n \n First, CAD is not especially high. It is high against the dollar because the dollar has fallen. CAD has actually fallen against many other currencies recently (most notably the Euro). \n \n I don't know that a fall in resource based activities is necessarily a good prediction here. The US buys resources from canada because we no longer have them. There have been a lot of dire predictions of late about the canadian resource markets. Most of them do not make much sense.

We use canadian oil because we have used up most of our own. \n \n Trust me, there is not a guy sitting in some US corporate boardroom right now saying \"OK, now the loonie is on par....we will have to use our secret tree growing formula that provides old growth forests in 90 days\". Nor is there somebody contemplating taking the caps off of our secret oil fields. \n \n The US will continue to buy candian resources, and investing in candian resources, because that is where the resources are. We don't have them here, we have to buy them from you.\n \n Eventually US consumers will probably start buying less because our economy is failing so they will become too expensive. deabsing canadas currency to make your resources cheaper for American consumers is jsut plain foolish. You are talkign about sending your own economy down the tubes to keep pace with ours. Not a good policy.\n \n \nCanadian manufacturers, retailers, and anyone looking to sell big ticket items - cars, boats, snowmobiles, etc... are gonna face a tough hit as the value of goods on either side of the border levels out - this is also my primary good.\n\n \n No, they won't, because the price of goods will not actually level out. They will have to be increased on the US side of the border to make up for increased production costs due to increased materials costs caused by the weaker dollar.\n \n \nGood - I just bought a boat in Tulsa, OK for HALF of what I would have paid for the exact same boat here.

These are examples of the failing middle class in the US. The canadian dollar has been within 5 cents of the US dollar for 6 months now.

Luxury goods are things like boats, horses, horse trailers, pickup trucks (for individuals), luxury cars, motor homes, etc...\n \n that index is considered to be one of the best indicators out there when it comes to the economic health of the middle class. When the middle class starts feeling pinched, they sell off their recreational equipment, their lexus, and their F450. The glut on the market causes prices to fall.

As the US economy slides, we need to explore new markets. Going down with the ship would be rather foolish like you said. That being said, it will NOT be easy. I think to many Americans, including the current administration, Canada is a mega mall where they go to get what they need, a mall that essentially belongs to them.

They will have to be increased on the US side of the border to make up for increased production costs due to increased materials costs caused by the weaker dollar.\n\n \n Another good point. You're likely bang on on that what as well. I hadn't thought of that. I guess the question then becomes, how high can they go before they become too high? \n \n Will the average American shell out the $50,000 that a boat is worth up here instead of the $25,000 that same boat is priced at down there? Or will they simply no longer buy boats? I guess that ties into you next point...\n \n \nNeither of these are examples of a strong canadian dollar.

I've been looking since April, and I finally found the right deal. \n \n I consider myself and my family pretty avant garde when it comes to stuff like this, buy/sell, take the risk, do what it takes to turn the buck.

When the dollar hit close to par, I think it was the finally push over the edge that people needed. I know people that I wouldn't have dreamed in a thousand years would venture south of the border, that all of a sudden did just that. That's when I realized we passed a critical point. I think there are actually as many or more people going south as buying locally.

   "I see this, it seems to me it's a weakening of the USD more than a strengthening of the CAD that's got us to this point.\n\n \n If you look at the loonie the last few days, it has lost value against most currencies eitehr because traders have a mental expectation that it will stay at par and not appreciate more, or because the Canadian central bank is manipulating it. \n \n \nI agree on continuing demand from the US in particular.\n \n I think short term, and I may be wrong, it will hurt our resource based industries. Long term, the resources have to come from somewhere, so yes, I think the Canadian outlook is bright.\n \n I also agree that we need to somewhat extricate ourselves from the joined at the hip relationship we have with the US.

I think to many Americans, including the current administration, Canada is a mega mall where they go to get what they need, a mall that essentially belongs to them. Any break from that scenario won't be without some serious political pain.\n\n \n That would depend on yoru definition of \"long term\" and \"short term\". The next couple of months will probably be OK for your resource industries. After that the falloff of the US economy will have filtered through and they will be suffering to some extent...not so much because of the strength of your currency but more because the US economy is failing. \n \n There is some very definate downside risk to your resource industries right now, but it has more to do with the credit crunch and the colossal failure of the US housing market than it does your currency. For example, if your lumber industry is not hurting, it soon will be. The oil industry is another good place to look for problems. There has been a massive influx of investment from the US in the last several years to the canadian oil industry. The credit crunch will slow this to a trickle as lenders are no longer willing to loan billions of dollars on projects that carry any risk at all. We are already seeing this in many sectors of the US economy as the lines of credit that allowed private equity investors to make risky investments have dried up.\n \n As far as cutting loose from the US, I agree that it will be painful, but unless you want to see things go completely to hell in Canada, I don't think that you have any real choice. Not only do you need to build other trade relationships, but the time will come when you need to withdraw from NAFTA in order to keep your own house in order and standing. \n \n \n \nI consider myself and my family pretty avant garde when it comes to stuff like this, buy/sell, take the risk, do what it takes to turn the buck. My dad's been doing it all his life, and he passed on the know how and guts to his sons.\n \n My point in this, tons of people up here talk about, but very few actually do it.

I think there are actually as many or more people going south as buying locally. I am VERY happy I'm not trying to sell anything right now.\n\n \n Eventually things will hit closer to equilibrium. Americans still have the option of going bargain hunting in Mexico, but the novelty wears out after a while. More likely what will ultimatly happen is that once the trend is well established, enterprising Canadians will go into the business of importing second hand goods. There will be some pain as holders of fixed assets see their values drop, but in the real world, how much does it REALLY matter if you are upside down in your boat??? In the end it will result in a higher standard of living for canadians as they will be able to buy luxury goods cheaper, even if they are second hand. It will also help drive down prices on new canadian goods as the secondary market starts to look more attractive.\n \n An attractive secondary market has a LOT to do with how manufacturers ultimatly price their goods. If you can buy a durable good that is 1 yr old for $1000, and the price for a new one is $4000, there is a LOT of incentive there for the manufacturer to lower prices and to attempt to improve their product. We all hope that durable goods will hold their resale value, but in the long run it is almost always better for comsumers if they don't because it drives prices down.\n \n \nDo you have a link to this index or data? I'd be very interested in checking it out.\n\n \n You are going to need a subscription data service. I have never seen a secondhand index posted publicly. On my data service it is called \"Secondary luxury market\". when I first saw that I kind of went \"what the hell is that??\" Luckily I had some knowledgable people who explained that it was the only leading indicator that actually worked or mattered. I have found that typically they seem to be right. \n \n Consumer confidence tends to rise and fall pretty frequently for no apparent reason, or for irrational reasons. When the yuppie scumbag down the street ends up having to sell his skidoo and his brat kids pony, THAT is worth taking note of. When a LOT of yuppie scumbags are selling their skidoos and their brat kids ponies, you know there is a real problem out there, regardless of what other data may say.",
