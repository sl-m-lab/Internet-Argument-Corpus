   "RUSH: Now, somebody tell me how in the world anyone could take that out of context. That is a full 43 seconds, no edits, we didn't take sentences out of order and assemble them in a way we wanted. A single payer health care plan, universal health care plan, that's what I'd like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately, because first we have to take back the White House, we have to take back the Senate, and we have to take back the House. Now they've done that, now they're going for single payer health care. I don't know why they did this. We think of these people as brilliant in the Alinsky sense. All they're doing is calling attention his lies. All they're doing is calling attention to his deceit. All they're doing is causing people to go back and get these full fledged clips and play them all over the place, radio, television. Linda Douglass looks like a sap. Linda Douglass looks like what she is, a propagandist former employee of state-controlled media.\n \n On page 16 of the House bill, it's right there, and you've heard people quote from it. I'm going to summarize it, page 16 : private insurance will become illegal. Insurance companies cannot write new policies, people will lose their existing policy if they change jobs, if they change coverage, or if they change prices. Once any aspect of your private health insurance changes after this bill goes into effect, you can't renew it. You have to go public option. On page 29 of the House bill, it is admitted that our health care will be rationed. On page 42, the health choices commissioner will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. Page 58, every person will be issued a national ID health card, and it will probably have that stupid logo that reminds me of World War II, frankly, when you look at it, you'll say the same thing. The federal government will have direct, real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer to pay. Yes, my friends, the federal government will have direct, real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer, meaning from your account to them. They will be able to debit your account for health expenses. That's on page 59, go get the bill. I'm summarizing here for you.\n \n On page 72, all private health care plans must conform to government rules to participate in a health care exchange. Any individual who doesn't have acceptable health care defined by the government will be taxed two-and-a-half percent of their income each year. Officers and employees of government health care bureaucracy will have access to all American financial and personal records, page 195. Page 203, the tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as a tax. I'm quoting from the actual bill. I've got numerous examples but I'm way over time here. But, Ms. Douglas, you've been made a sap on this, and you've only caused even more attention to be focused on what your boss actually intends and what is in the House bill. It's there. This campaign of fraud and deceit is exactly why the American people are up in arms, and it's exactly why you and your party are looking at them with deep contempt. This wasn't part of the plan. The American people weren't supposed to figure all this out. They are just supposed to bow down and say, \"Thank you for caring about us.\" \n \n Well, guys, if you ain't never paid a 'tithe' you're going to pay this health tithe royally. The presumption to take your last hundred bucks for health care is simply the foot-in-the door to take it for anything.",
