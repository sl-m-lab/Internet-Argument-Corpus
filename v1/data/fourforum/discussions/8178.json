   "Do you use a GPS? What do you use it for?\n \n I bought a Garmin Model 12 a few years ago and use it very simply: Mark the spot where I begin and return to it.\n \n But newer GPS' are quite a bit more sophisticated, so I'm wondering if any of you have experience in the newer models and advice about the latest bells and whistles.",

   "I have GPS in my pickup and my car and do not use it at all. In fact, I hacked the screen int he pickup, got rid oft he GPS, and had my little brother interface it to a carputer. Movies and MP3s are a lot more useful than the GPS was.\n \n Almost every year somebody decides I need a GPS unit. I have at least a half dozen of them in a drawer. I DO keep one in my saddle bags and take one when I go backpacking, but don't use them (they are for in case I get lost).\n \n Personally, I just don't find them particularly useful. I generally do not need to know where I am within 10 meters or whatever. I prefer a map.\n \n My wife, on the other hand, uses hers religously. Of course, she can't seem to get the hang of reading a map. \n \n What do you use it for, billsco? I know you said to mark a spot so you can return to it. Isn't it just as easy to look around, see where you are, and remember how to get back?",

   "The best work I've gotten from mine is boating on Lake Vermillion in northern Minnesota. It's a huge lake with hundreds of obscuring islands. Using the GPS has allowed me to quit dropping mental bread crumbs that needed to be retained over the course of a weekend, and has instead allowed me to relax and enjoy more.\n \n I've used it grouse hunting also. I'll ATV to a promising spot, mark it, and head off in any direction that looks good, unconcerned about losing the ATV. Marking a deer stand before the season has worked pretty good too. Your partner can be in the stand and I can make a drive with better precision. \n \n But I was curious about the new features. A repairman called me the other day to schedule an appointment. I asked him if he wanted directions, he said, \"No, I'll put your address in the GPS.\" He showed up on time so it must work pretty good; I could probably get some use out of that. My brother-in-law downloads maps into the GPS where we'll be ATVing and can tell me specific locations that will be appearing, such as a lake, well before it's visible. I could make some use out of that as well. \n \n That's probably about all I'd use it for if I got a new model.",

   "GPS works great for me. I used to run a Lowrance GlobalMap 3000 in the truck. With it, you had to mark your destination with the crosshairs, then say \"go to\". I could set Way Points and Symbols and return to any one of them, but it never showed the proper route to get there.\n \n That particular unit was stolen from my unlocked vehicle on a cold winter's night just before Christmas 2004. The only thing I worried about was that the thief has all my WayPoints now. Oh, well! Nothing seems to have come of it, so I've written it off as a sunk cost.\n \n I recently bought a Garmin c340 StreetPilot. All I have to do is key in the street address and choose whether I want the fastest, the shortest, to avoid toll roads, etc and the little sucker draws a purple line for me to follow, speaks at every turn and fork in the road where I need to make a decision and recalculates the path everytime I get off of it. It's extremely handy if you know the address of where you want to go.\n \n The night time screen is cool, too.\n \n There's another model with MP3. integrated traffic reciever and bluetooth wireless to work with compatible phones, but I'm happy with the one I have.",
