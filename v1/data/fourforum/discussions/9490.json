   "\n Quote:\n Guns were used in 4,120 robberies last year - a 10% jump - including a 9% rise to 1,439 in the number of street robberies where guns were used.\n \n There was also a rapid and unexplained increase in the number of times householders were confronted in their own homes by armed criminals. Residential firearms robberies show a 46% leap, a record 645 cases in England and Wales - up 204 on the previous year and four times the level recorded in 2000-01.\n \n sorce http://www.breitbart.com/news/na/paFiguresThurs18Crimefiguresud2Substitute.html\n\n So the argument there seems to be that gun crime has been rising despite the strict gun laws of England. The statistics show both a rise and fall in gun crime:\n \n \"In the year ending 31 March 2005 provisional figures show a:\n \n \"16% reduction in the use of handguns \n 9% reduction in robberies involving firearms \n 6% reduction in serious injuries from firearms offences \n Despite these figures, the number of overall offences involving firearms has been increasing each year since 1997/98. And crime involving imitation weapons was up 55% in 2004-05 compared to the previous year. (Source: Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005)\n \n \"Also of concern is a rise in the number of young people carrying real or imitation firearms in an attempt to boost their image or from a mistaken idea about self-protection.\"\n http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/gun-crime/\n \n In addition, the rise in gun crime may be mostly due to the big rise in the number of replica and air guns being used in crime:\n \"Imitation weapons were used in 3,332 offences in 2004/05, an increase of more than half (55%) from 2003/04....Ball-bearing (BB) guns are easy to purchase and often look like real weapons....Anti-firearms campaigners would like to see much tighter controls for all other types of weapons, including an outright ban on the production, sale, and possession of BB guns, airguns, and replica guns....The police say that in 2003 replica firearms were used in an estimated 60% of robberies and four out of five of all firearms offences. Nearly three quarters (72%) of firearms seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2003 under Operation Trident, set up to tackle gun crime within London's black communities, were replicas, air guns, or starter pistols.\"\n http://www.crimeinfo.org.uk/servlet/factsheetservlet?command=viewfactsheet&factsheetid=102&category=factsheets",

   "England has been \"disarmed\" for years, right? So any increase can't be caused by lack of home owned guns, it must have some other source. \n\n \n The idea that all the effects of policy changes are immediate and immediately apparent is an obvious fallacy, albeit an extremely common one. I'm surprised to see such a claim made seriously this directly though, it is usually just implied indirectly because of how nonsensical it is.\n \n \n One other fallacy more specific to gun ownership is that only \"gun crime\" is important. If banning handgun ownership results in a 10% decrease in \"gun deaths\" but a 500% increase in stabbings, we can hardly say that it is effective. It is perhaps testament to the power of anti-firearm propaganda that many people seem to believe gun-related deaths and injuries are inherently so much worse than knife-related deaths or injuries that they aren't even worth considering.",
