   "National Rifle Association chief lobbyist Chris W. Cox said the last two decades have shown a strong shift toward gun rights laws. \"We believe it's time for Congress to acknowledge these changes and respect the right of self-defense, and the right of self-defense does not stop at state lines,\" he said.\n \n Gun control groups were strongly in opposition.\n \n Concealed handgun permit holders killed at least seven police officers and 44 private citizens during a two-year period ending in April, according to a study by the Violence Policy Center. \"It is beyond irrational for Congress to vote to expand the reach of these deadly laws,\" said the center's legislative director, Kristen Rand.\n \n Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill would \"incite a dangerous race to the bottom in our nation's gun laws.\" He said his own state, which has strict gun control laws, would have to accept concealed weapons permits from states such as Arizona, which issues permits to people with drinking problems, or Alaska, where people with violent misdemeanor convictions can get permits.\n \n \"Folks in Minot, N.D., and New York are going to have different conceptions about what's right for their locality,\" said Jim Kessler, vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank that supports gun rights. \"In some states you have to show a real need\" to get a permit, he said. \"In other states you have to show that you can stand on two feet.\"\n\n Senate to vote on concealed weapons measure - Yahoo! News\n \n So what kind of message is the NRA sending? That it doesn't really matter if people who carry around deadly weapons are able to hit a target at the shooting range or if they understand the law about when they can legally use their weapons or if they have drinking problems and sometimes get in fights? The NRA talks about respecting the right of self defense but it's clear they want rights without responsibilities. If they really believed in self defense then it seems that they would be pushing for legislation that required people that carry to obtain a minimum level of training so that they would be in a better position to defend themselves and understand their legal responsibilities rather than supporting legislation that undermines state gun laws. Now come the slippery slope arguments or the \"well it's a right\" arguments....",

First a biased claim repeated on Yahoo from canned propaganda source, VPC with a few quotes from staunch marxists that would like to ignore the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution, then you include the suppositions and dire warnings which have never come true but you are not finished yet. Your quote contains the usual lies about training and education plus an appeal to interfere with State Rights which 34 States have specifically stated their support of through their State AG. Not enough yet? \"well it's a right\" is no longer an argument, it is fact. Read Heller v D.C. and the myriad of cases including 35 Supreme Court cases that have always held the Second Amendment protects those individual rights. Even Roe v Wade states the rights found in the BOR such as ...\"the right to keep and bear arms\" to be a fundamental right.\n \n What you have is an unConstitutional right being demeaned by a person who swore an oath to protect and defend it...making them/him a traitor.",
