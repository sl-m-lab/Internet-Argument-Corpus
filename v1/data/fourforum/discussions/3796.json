   "My comments in blue...\n \n Richbee - \n Your first mistake is a basic misunderstanding of our position in the World today. We are the only Super power, and if not us, who?\n We are absolutely *NOT* \"imperialistic\". Note that in Iraq, there were numerous U.N. Resolution over 12 years costing $25 Bill'\n \n DEAL WITH IT!\n \n I made no mistake. The term Super Power is nothing, but a code word for modern empire. Who that empire may be is only relevant in that as a democratic citizen in this neo-empire, I can criticize the injustices of this particular political manifestation. As long as the masses do not take heed to my voice and others will a similar tone, I and others will not be killed for our dissent.\n \n \n More nonsense. As an example, just how much money has Halliburton made in Iraq?\n \n I don't see your point here? Halliburton is run by neo-conservatives (such as its former CEO, Dick Cheney).\n \n In the Balkans under Clinton/Gore? (Note without U.N. approval). \n \n Unlike the War in Iraq, the Kosovo conflict was a purely humanitarian intervention. I believe more diplomatic efforts could have and should have been pursued, however. We invaded Iraq for its alleged WMD programs and collaborative ties to al-Qaida. Both allegations were questionable, and now have been proven false. Iraq is part of a much broader plan to extend our influence in the Middle East and secure control of key oil reserves through regime change. The invasion of a weaker country for political and economic gain is by definition called imperialism. You seem to have no problem with this. As a Christian and an African-American I am predisposed to be against all forms of oppression.\n \n Just hubris, pure Hubris! We are the World's greatest and most powerful Nation, and have wonderful people like Engineers with fantastic Corp's backing us up!\n \n I believe hubris is yelling \"We are the World's greatest and most powerful Nation.\" Or maybe that comment wasn't meant to be taken seriously.\n \n Pontius Pilate was not only part of an evil pagan empire that hated the Jews, he himself hated the Jews and murdered innocent Jews by the thousands.\n \n I agree. But, I would qualify that he primarily killed those Jews who rebelled against Roman authority, not the subservient, Herodians. \n \n More manure. GW is sworn to uphold the U.S. C' - even if he were an Atheist.\n \n If GW were an atheist, or at least openly atheist, he would have never been elected president. But, again, what's your point. The invasion of Iraq has nothing to do with our Constitution. As a matter of fact, traditional conservative thought is antithetical to global imperialism. Domestic slavery and virtual genocide maybe, but visions of a global takeover, no.\n \n Our Churches had nothing to do with this War, but many Churches have been active in Charities helping of troops and the Iraqis.\n \n Tell that to the millions of Christians who just voted Bush back into office.\n \n We will bring Saddam Hussein and the Terrorists to Justice, or bring Justice to the terrorists.\n \n I think we have different concepts of justice. Saddam Hussein was not a member, nor sponsor of those who attacked us. What happened to Osama bin Laden? Oh, it's the old bait and switch technique.\n \n Note, that we are the only Nation on Earth to bomb our enemies and feed and care for the civilians at the same time.\n \n That's why their is a difference between charity and justice. Perhaps you weren't aware that civilians often die in larger numbers than the \"enemies\". Killing my family and then giving me a sandwich as consolation, is not the justice of Christ, and that's the only justice I am concerned with. I just wish our president felt the same way.",

From what I know of organized religion, it's about neither of those things.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Yes, a book has been written about Karl Rove serving as \"Bush's Brain\". Let me say that, at least in the case of Bush, he is driven by certain religious, and in some ways Christian convictions. He just is not aware or simply doesn't care that he is probably being even more influenced by materialism and imperialism. I can't speak for \"organized\" religion for that is much to broad of a term. I can only speak for the Christian tradition as I understand it. The faith and practice that was enacted through the person of Jesus from Nazareth and what Christians believe is an extension of Judaism, does not closely resemble conservate politics. Exceptions arguably could be their position on abortion and gay marriage. \n \n The problem with (Christian) conservate pro-life advocates, is that they really tend to be pro-birth. They seem to care little about the quality of one's life after one is born. They are in effect Social Darwinists and \"Survival of the Fittest\" is their mantra. Much of the opposition to gay marriage centers on the idea that same-sex marriage poses a threat to traditional marriage. The fact is the primary threat to heterosexual marriage is heterosexuals. The divorce rate is over 50% (and is comparably high among those who call themselves Christian). Yet we do not see anyone advocating laws which make it more difficult for people to get divorces. \n \n As far as the masses being blind consumers, I would argue that this is evidence of the fact that most Americans do not in actually follow the Way of Christ. Christ preached a message that was counter-cultural and subversive. His teachings undermined the Hebrew priestly class's consolidation of power and Pilate, though he very well may have rather spared this particular revolutionary, simply did what he always did, that which was politically expedient. All empires must ultimately do that which preserves itself, which oftentimes may not be what is just.\n \n NeoNegro",
