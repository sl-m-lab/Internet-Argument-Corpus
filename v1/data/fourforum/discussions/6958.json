If the audit was typical, the $2.4-million was only about 25% of what he took, what could actually be verified. \n \n Anyone familiar with our system of government is aware few politicians hold positions of committee power without accumulating personal wealth. With trustee law firms shielding interlocking trusts holding offshore assets and not-for-profits employing relatives and cronies receiving government grants, most politicians aren't as blatant about graft as Cunningham. Putting a stop to those practices is about as likely as current administration admitting they made a mistake spending our money on Iraq. I think one has to have personal association with politicians in power at any level to understand the arrogance they possess. As has often been said, the only good politician is one you own.",

As I recall, he was an Exalted Cyclops, or whatever the stupid designation for a local leader was back then (his father was also a KKK member). My favorite nickname for him is \"Sheets\" Byrd. There is a political expression that states, \"The best way to get in office is to be in office\", and Byrd is the perfect example of the truth of that. As long as he keeps the treasure flowing to W. Virginia, those that bother to vote will keep sending their cash-cow back. He could rape a girl scout on the Senate steps at high noon and probably get reelected. I used to believe that the vote was the best way to limit terms, but that would be true only if an informed electorate exercised the right ...... not going to happen.\n Term limits, like real tax reform, gets a little mention from time to time, but has little chance of actually happening ...... kind of like asking the mafia to reduce crime. I still prefer terms set by law rather than life span.\n Dono",
