   "Most of the miracles I've heard about, at least that have happened in the last century, involve the human body. I'm discounting things like potatoes that \"miraculously\" look like Mother Teresa, if you want to include those, pipe up. Anyway, concerning miraculous things happening to the human body, I'm much more likely to attribute these things to the human will than divine will. While we see \"miracles\" occur while people pray, we also see them occur through zen meditation, zoodoo frenzies, or extreme stress. All these are conditions in which the mind is put in a different state than normal, with the result that the body reacts in a way different than normal. I'd be much more likely to attribute something to miraculous causes if it wasn't potentially under the subconscious control of people.\n \n P.S.\n Twice in your post you said you weren't trying to start a fight. Just so you know, nothing in your post would lead anyone to that conclusion. This is a debate forum. You're supposed to ask questions and state positions. :)",
