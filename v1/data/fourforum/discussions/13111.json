   "The House Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages of new documents concerning the firing of nine US Attorneys under the Bush Administration - and they heavily implicate the office of onetime Bush adviser Karl Rove.\n \n Moreover, former Bush Supreme Court pick and legal adviser Harriet Miers fingered Rove during her testimony to Congressional investigators.\n \n In an effort to provide an earliest glance at the documents' contents, RAW STORY has reprinted highlights from a release issued by the Committee Tuesday afternoon. The Committee released, in total, 5,400 pages of White House and Republican National Committee e-mails.\n \n Emails obtained by the Democrat-led committee reveal that Rove and his office were involved in the firing of New Mexico US Attorney David Iglesias, who Republicans had criticized as not aggressively prosecuting voter fraud cases - which would have benefited Republicans. According to the committee, Rove and his staff were involved \"months earlier than previously known.\"\n \n \"For example,\" the release notes, \"in May and June 2005, Rove aide Scott Jennings sent emails to Tim Griffin (also in Rove's office) asking 'what else I can do to move this process forward' and stressing that 'I would really like to move forward with getting rid of NM US ATTY.' In June 2005, Harriet Miers emailed that a 'decision' had been made to replace Iglesias. At this time, DOJ gave Iglesias top rankings, so this decision was clearly not just the result of the White House following the Department's lead as Rove and Miers have maintained.\"\n\n Raw Story White House emails, Bush aide implicate Rove in firing of US Attorneys\n \n Can't say I'm surprised...",

If it's true though, why wasn't it wrong/illegal whatever, when he did it?\n\n There are two separate actions here.\n EVERY president has proceeded to do that. Bush did it at the start of his presidency as well.\n \n The issue of concern here is firing a an attorney SPECIFICALLY for how their prosecutorial approach affects politics.\n While Bush did what Clinton did when he took office, and nobody really cared...\n \n ... Bush LATER proceeded to fire REPUBLICAN US attorneys, because their prosecutorial actions were not as beneficial to Republicans.\n If I found out that Clinton chose US attorneys based on how they would possibly prosecute Democrats less and/or Republicans more, you can bet there would be a LOT of concern. emoticon_xgood\n \n From the article: \"...Republicans had criticized as not aggressively prosecuting voter fraud cases - which would have benefited Republicans\"\n \n This brings back to mind the whole situation with Obama, the Democratic Convention in Denver, and those meth-head racists who were planning on killing him.\n A Republican prosecuting attorney made some defense attorney excuses, and REFUSED TO PROSECUTE for the conspiracy to kill Obama. emoticon_wow\n A prosecuting attorney should be arguing AGAINST the defense attorney's arguments in court. Not trying to use them to drop a legitimate case. emoticon_xdonno\n I guess that's a pretty extreme example of putting party politics above the law in the prosecuting attorney's office, but it helps show some of the concerns being discussed...",
