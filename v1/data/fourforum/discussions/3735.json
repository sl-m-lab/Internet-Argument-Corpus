   "the bush administration's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism is focused around the theory of crippling terrorism by reducing the capability and scope of terrorist organizations. it suggests that terrorist organizations need resources and state sponsorship to survive, as well as political/religious support. it also suggests that certain environments are more suitable for the emergence of terrorism than others.\n \n 4 goals that the plan discusses (the 4 D's)\n - Defeat terrorist organizations by attacking their sanctuaries, leadership and financial support\n - Deny further sponsorship and support\n - Diminish the underlying environment that causes terrorism to fourish\n - Defend the country from terrorist attacks, and extending our defenses abroad\n \n the details are all in the link\n \n to me, fixing a problem by adjusting the environment around the problem is much more expensive and less effective than simply removing the cause of the problem. lets say in a town, we have a problem where a gang is running pedestrians over with cars. the way bush would handle such a problem (following the logic of his strategy) would be to remove all cars from the town. of course the problem would be solved, but it is highly impractical and ineffective compared to simply arresting the gang members. but apparently our administration doesnt believe things work that way",

It has been suggested that the prinicipal reason we have not seen new attacks is not becuase of our less than stellar intelligence or law enforcement efforts, but because AQ is so busy trying to organize under the flood of new members that they have not had the capacity to organise new attacks. Teh upside to this scenario is that we have been attack free while they sort out their new members. The down side to this is that once they get theri new members through the membership manual so to speak, they will have the manpower and funds to launch attacks that make 9/11 look like nothing.\n \n \n- Deny further sponsorship and support\n\n \n See above about their funding\n \n \n- Diminish the underlying environment that causes terrorism to fourish\n\n \n Since the terrorists stated goal is to keep the US out of the ME, sending our military to kill tens of thousands of civilians in an illegal war is probably not helping much.\n \n I think that bushs thought on this is that if we turn the entire world into little versions of America, terrorism will die. this, of course, only works if his assuption that everybody wants to live in Aemrica or an Americanized society. For some reason a lot of people seem to have a problem with the idea. \n \n \n- Defend the country from terrorist attacks, and extending our defenses abroad\n\n \n These are good ideas. We should try it. God knows we haven't yet.\n \n \nto me, fixing a problem by adjusting the environment around the problem is much more expensive and less effective than simply removing the cause of the problem. lets say in a town, we have a problem where a gang is running pedestrians over with cars. the way bush would handle such a problem (following the logic of his strategy) would be to remove all cars from the town. of course the problem would be solved, but it is highly impractical and ineffective compared to simply arresting the gang members. but apparently our administration doesnt believe things work that way\n\n \n I actually support their thinking on this. If we just kill the terrorists, there will be a new generation of terrorists created almost immediatly. \n \n The problem with their thinking is in what is causing the terrorism. In order to make it stop, we will have to re-examine our foreign policy and make a conscious decision not to do evil things or support those who do (Hussein, Pinochet, Noriega, House of Saud, etc...). Short of that, we simply will have to tolerate the occasional attack (including the nuclear ones which are almost inevitable if this goes on for too many more years).\n \n Unfortunatly, our leaders are going to stay the course, that is, stand by and use us little folks as cannon fodder so they can really show the world who the boss is. This is what you get when you don't elect leaders who are man enough to stand up when they are wrong, or when we as a nation have been wrong. \n \n I think that everybody here can agree that installing and supporting ruthless dictators and tyrants is a bad thing to do. I think everybody here can agree taht using predatory trade tactics, such as giving starving people food on the condition that corporations can use their children as slaves for the next 30 years, is a bad thing. I think that everybody here can agree that when you do a bad thing, a thing that is hurtful to people who have never caused you harm, that is wrong.\n \n And yet what these terrorists want is nothing more for us to stop doing things that we can all agree are wrong anyway. It is amazing what the sheeple will buy into if you wrap it in the flag.\n \n Lets take a quick look at AQ's strategy and see how it is working.\n \n Their stated goal, layed out very clearly, is to bankrupt America. We are spending a trillion plus per year on homeland security. We have spent close to a trillion on invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan, neither one of which seriously seemed to affect AQ. We are paying record prices for energy.\n \n Their strategy seems to be working well.\n \n So, of our 4 point strategy, we are loosing on every point.\n \n In their single point strategy, to make us spend ourselves to death, they are up roughly 2 trillion, plus whatever the higher energy costs are running (most of the esitmates I have seen are in the 500 billion per year range).\n \n Looks to me like they are beating us, 2.5 trillion to nothing.",

AQ now has more members and more money than ever before, and from a defensive standpoint America is in worse shape than ever before. Our military has been sent all over the world, with a huge chunck of it off \"liberating\" Iraqis. A large scale attack by AQ would be a emergency management nightmare. A large portion of our readiness and response plans depend on our military and national guard being around to lend a hand. \n \n We ahve not done anything which might encourage AQ not to attack again, and now there are more of them, and they are using the virtually unbeatable cell structure developed by our own intelligence people. \n \n As far as a draft having to be popular, it wasn't popular during the vietnam era, but it still happened. The government has some really effective ways of encouraging people to cooperate, like puttting them in prison if they don't, or shooting them. \n \n What the young people believe has little or no relevance to what is likely to happen.
