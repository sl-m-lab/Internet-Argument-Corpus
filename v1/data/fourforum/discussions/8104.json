   "Of course it does . . . so he can repeatedly badger you irrelevantly about how you supposedly know NOTHING about Catholicism . . .\n\n \n I find these conversations rather odd sometimes...they go something like this.\n \n poster: \"are you gay\"\n me: \"no\"\n poster: \"then you can't talk about anything that evolves gay issues\"\n \n poster: \"are you a female?\"\n me: \"no\"\n poster: \"then you can't talk about anything related to abortion\"\n \n Now both of these are fallacies that are often committed on these forums. I don't have to be blind to know I don't want to blind..to which someone will respond and say \"yeah but you don't know what is feels like to be blind until you are\"...which means that a gay person doesn't know what it is like to be straight and what it means to us. Which begs the question why they say gay marriage doesn't concern us...you aren't straight so you wouldn't know...according to your inconsistent logic atleast.\n \n So from now on can we just attack the point instead of the credibility of the person presenting the point? The answer to this is probably not and we will surely debate the moot details of this post. Sigh",

Steeeeve has said several times that one MUST follow the Pope to be Catholic. That's just plain not true. There are a few -- very, very few -- issues where a Pope has claimed infallibility (one of which was declaring that a Pope could, in fact, claim infallibility). There are different levels of authoritative teaching in the Catholic Church, and the current topics dealing with gay issues are NOT among them. If they were, they wouldn't have been changing so much over recent decades -- in both directions.",

Those two concepts are not necessarily the same, exactly. I agree with you Steeeeve, I think most Catholics would readily admit that what the Pope says is to be followed. They don't always do it, but they understand the authority of his office. The difference is that there are SOME statements the Pope says thoughout history that are more crucial than others. Some are so significant that not following them would be excommunicable. Others (like gay marriage) are not, but that doesn't mean that Catholicism doesn't expect one to follow the words of the Pope (Christ's vicar on earth, according to Catholics). \n \n Now, let me go ahead and cut Bob off at the pass by saying that I'm not Catholic.
