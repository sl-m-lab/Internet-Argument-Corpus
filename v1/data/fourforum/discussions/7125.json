   "Anyone seen King Kong yet? All I can say is WOW. It actually did the original justice - unlike the lame remake with Jessica Lang in the 80s.\n \n I liked the new Harry Potter as well. Really good character development. \n \n I still need to see Walk the Line, Narnia and the latest Pride and Prejudice (love this story).\n \n I also want to see Casanova and the DaVinci Code when they come out. (Although I wonder about Tom Hanks playing the lead in the latter.)",

   "I just saw Kong last night. Black and Watts were brilliant, and the story was excellent. I did feel that the movie could have been trimmed a bit; some scenes dragged. Still, fantasitic movie.\n \n I'l probably catch Narnia in the theaters, the rest I'll wait for HBO.\n \n Excepct for DaVinci Code. I'll be sure to have a root canal scheduled when that's playing.",
