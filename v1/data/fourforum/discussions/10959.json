You don't share your testimony of actually meeting or following Him with your life. All you do is spew hatred for a dedicated brother in Christ who reached out to you in a friendly and cordial way when you joined, only to be immediately attacked with the same irrational bitterness that you are showing here.\n \n I challenge anyone to go back to your first 8 posts on this forum and see how I approached you and how you responded to me. Talk about an agenda of hate! you define it dane, my self declared christian brother. What a sick joke that is. \n \n And one thing more, you titled this AA lying about my religion/faith. Well that is another lie on your part because it is you who is lying about having any faith at all in God through Christ. And as for lying about your religion, I haven't even had to comment on it.

   "I am never dishonest about my beliefs, nor are my arguments dishonest either.\n\n \n This brings me back to my point in this forum about delusional. You have stated that your arguments and beliefs not never dishonest. \n \n Yet you have used misquotes, quote mines, fabrications and outright lies from quotes on Kitts and Patterson, dynamic stalling vs fixed wing calculations, tv props as evidence of creation and a whole long list of dishonest arguments. Since you genuinely believe as stated, you are never dishonest nor are your arguments, you must therefore believe that the things I listed are indeed factual. If that is the case, you are indeed not lying. You are just delusional and refuse to accept anything that you do not like as fact. \n \n \nThat is your debating tactic. And regarding your evidence that chimps are creative? Bullpucky.\n\n \n Apparently those who spend time watching, training and caring for them don't matter in evaluating their creativity. So, by that logic we should not ask anyone who is an expert in their field about that subject but instead ask people who are arm chair generals without any formal training or experience in those fields. Who should NASA consult since we can't trust their scientists' opinions on space flight? After all, your logic dictates that their keeper and trainer's opinion is worthless, therefore NASA's opinion on space flight, their key interest and expertise area is also worthless by the same logic. \n \n \nI was asking why no other animal has every attained creativity on par with human inventiveness and you post a typical link pointing out that chimps use sticks to dig out insects or some such foolishness. Nothing close to meeting what I was referring to. So it wasn't worthy of consideration of any valid evidence of anything. So it is you who is lying and/or delusional.\n\n \n You stated that chimps have a creativity level that is tiny and nowhere near humans. I posted a link that had input from one of their keepers who refuted you and now you are saying I, who linked the article from a Chimp's Keeper is delusional, but you who has no experience with them and posted nothing of value to refute are not delusional. \n \n Wow. I think I'm going to order my DSM-IV copy now. \n \n \nNot one of you dealt with that question at all. you all completely evaded even touching it even though I reposted it repeatedly.\n\n \n Obviously you failed to read the thread properly. There at least least three posts detaling with just that. \n \n \n\"]JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE MY ANSWERS, IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M LYING. AND AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO FLAME WITH YOUR SLANDEROUS CR*P, WE WILL NEVER GET PASSED THIS NAME CALLING\n\n \n See first paragraph. You're not lying. You're delusional. Many of your arguments have been proven to be using dishonest evidence. Since you stated your arguments are 'NEVER' dishonest, you must think they are honest. As they factually wrong and dishonest, you therefore believe otherwise despite being corrected. \n \n \nYou don't have any more a clue as to what defines a true chritian than he does so what are you talking about?\n\n \n Nice true scotsman's fallacy. And we all know that your definition of a True Christian is one who believes exactly the same things you do. Of course that doesn't mean you are a Christian either. \n \n \nHe defends abortion too, and every other godless perspective he debates about. He also takes positions against everyone here with any spiritual perspective at all. One can't claim to be a believer, and then stand against every believer in every debate. It just doesn't work that way in reality.\n\n \n Nowhere in the Bible does it say abortion is wrong. Furthermore, God commanded the Israelites to kill the Cannite's unborn children. And Augustine has stated that the soul only enters the body when it is fully formed. And you don't know who every believer is either. You can't make such assumptions and expect them to be taken on fact. \n \n \nSince when are you the final or ultimate judge of what is proof of anything child? You make your ridiculous claims and they are true to you; I make claims based on my beliefs and all of a sudden they are just foolishness. Your double standards know no bounds.\n\n \n Cite or I assume you are being delusional. This is going to be fun. I'd rather use delusional then liar. Care to discuss the 20+ page flood thread? Where you never got around to addressing the arguments? \n \n \nNOTE THE BOLDED: The only persons assumptions that are wrong, stupid, ignorant and based on nothing are yours. Because if you think that after being a believer in, and follower of Christ for 32+ years, that I can't recognize another born again believer, well, again; note the bolded above because it's describing you and your arrogance to make such unfounded assumptions.\n\n \n Obviously you think you are the ultimate authority for stating who is and who is not. Again, you haven't proven your interpretation is correct (this is what, like the 50th time I've pointed that out?) and you keep tying your interpretation to what Christanity is rather then honestly admitting that your interpretation is just an interpretation, no more correct then anyone else's.\n \n If you truly mean what you mean in your first paragraph, you are by all measures, delusional.",

I think you are delusional, well use to. As you stated, you never intended to deceive. However, your refusal in the past to admit your arguments used dishonest evidence and your deliberate avoidance of discussing such evidences when it was brought up in your claims on honesty seems to suggest otherwise. \n \n \nMany times I post on the run. I do a search, find a supporting link, write an opinion and add the link. I then hit submit and go do other business. Later I come back and check the progress of the debates I am involved in. That is my S.O.P. here. Never have I posted any link with the intent of deceiving anyone.\n\n \n I believe this. Hence why I have been suggesting to you for quite some time to spend more time on posts and do some fact checking. You stated to me a while back that there \"was nothing wrong\" with how you made arguments. But obviously there is as the amount of inaccurate, false or deliberately deceptive evidence you have found that makes it into your arguments is alarmingly high. A simple fact check on google will prevent this. I just don't understand why you are so averse to using google to do fact checks. Every time I suggested that you were massively abrasive and abusive to me. \n \n \nAnd my habit with quotes for siggys has always been if the statement reflects my beliefs, I will use it. Never have I ever been so anal as to worry enough to fact check what the originator of it intended or originally wrote.\n\n \n Maybe you should change that attitude. It would save you a lot of flak. And I don't think you intended to misquote your signature. After all, I posted several links where that quote was misquoted and suggested that you, unknowingly copied it from one of those sites. But, as I noted before, if you just admitted you pulled it from a site that already misquoted it, no one would have held it against you. I think the second biggest problem you have is timing. Just admitting that you got it from a bad site in the beginning would have been the easy way to prevent that discussion. Zardoz did this when we were discussing illegals and their W2 withholdings. He just admitted that he got info from a bad site. And that was that. \n \n \nSo just as I never changed the content of any quote I have used, so have I never fact checked one either. I'm just not that anal a person. And neither have I fact checked quotes anyone else has used, as again, I'm not that anal.\n\n \n If you are going to use a quote in an argument, you should fact check it. Just as a politician would quote someone, they want to be sure that the quote is indeed accurate.\n \n Now why can't the rest of our discussions be this polite?",
