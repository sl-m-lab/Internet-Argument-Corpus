Also often an ardent admirer or enthusiast (as of a celebrity or pursuit). Fanatic is an adjective used to describe a fan marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense, uncritical devotion.\n \n I will concur that fan is derived from fanatic which comes from Latin fanaticus and is definitely a shortened version of it, but they have distinct meanings in polished English.\n \n I can be a fan of jazz without being fanatic about it.\n I can be a fan of jazz and a fan of folk music and a fan of celtic music...all at the same time.\n I can be fanatic about jazz, folk and celtic...all at the same time without hating classical.\n \n Fanaticism is not the same as bigotry.

He said the statement was bigoted, not that I should stop acting like a bigot. He clearly said that he's not saying Archangel is a bigot!!! Point 2) this statement was reintroduced from a past debate weeks ago and had nothing at all to do with my demand that Dane prove anything I said in the debate in question was bigoted at all. I made that statement when i did in response to some baiting statement made by moose or you or someone to be sarcastic just to get your goat. \n \n What is frustrating is that I knew you infants would make a federal case out of it. But notice that neither Dane, nor one of you produced any other statement I ever made from that thread, or any other that could be deemed bigoted. Yet you people insist on throwing the word around every time you're losing a debate and can't respond to the evidence I post in support of my arguments. \n \n Point out one other christian around here who has stated on uncountable occasions how gays are like everyone else when it comes to being saved by grace, even though you guys love to insist that all christians assert that gays are dammed just because they are gay. I'm the only believer that constantly say's gays are not condemned for being gay, and yet that is always ignored by your side as you spew your hatred for what I represent. So who really are the bigots around here kronus? Do you think that because there are many of you and just one of me that your cries of bigotry are anymore true or valid? I think not. Not at all.

I've said nothing of the sort. I'm inferring nothing of the sort. I believe nothing of the sort. I believe that Archie believes in creationism. (I don't understand how he can believe something so contrary to every piece of scientific evidence on the planet, but that's a different matter entirely.) What I object to is the repeated presentation of points that have been refuted and refuted and refuted and never supported. What I object to is the blatant quote mining and intentional mischaracterizations of statements, passages, and entire books. What I object to is the consistent presentation of assertions and the complete unwillingness to support the assertions with evidence. What I object to is the constant trolling devoid of any hint of connection to reality.\n This is supposed to be a debate forum. This is not how debate works. Debaters who have any semblance of integrity will support their points with evidence when challenged. Debaters who even pretend to be reasonable don't slander their opponents and then pretend that the onus of disproof is upon said opponent. Debaters with any interest in actual debate for knowledge will not lace every passage with deceit.\n \n \nThe truth is that I think the same applies to people like lyte.

He accepts what he believes as absolute fact even though it is no more provable in reality than creation is.

Even in this post, you've greatly misrepresented my position and argued against the strawman. Why should anybody believe you are capable of mature debate?\n \n \nSo lyte can be as convinced that he's right as he wants to believe he is, but he should just remember that believing he's right in no way PROVES anything, much less that he is right at all.\n\n I agree! My belief proves nothing. The evidence proves everything. I shape my beliefs with the evidence, as opposed to shaping my interpretation and rejection of evidence with pre-existing beliefs.

It's a bunch of your own opinions which are no more valid or correct than marcs are.\nNow, I know that there is the possibility that Archie will go back and edit his post, in the same manner that he tried the revisionism during his quote mined signature fiasco, so here is a link to my post where I quoted his posting of the link.\n \n Let's analyze this. Archie cited and linked my post and challenged me to \"show one actual fact\" that I produced in the post. I asked him if he had the integrity to stand by his slanderous commentary.\n \n Now look what has happened.\n \nI never even read that post before posting it. But because it was your most recent post and you said you had just written it to admin, I assumed this was the one.\n\n It appears that he's pretending that I'm talking about another post.

He didn't even read it before he called me a liar.\n Pretty sad, huh?\n \n But, fortunately for me, he repeats his statement and now claims that he really means it.\n \nAnd after just reading it now, It's your typical insulting response made up of your opinions that, as I said are of no more value than anyone elses opinion.\n\n So, Archie, I'll repeat my challenge:Are you willing to back up your words with your actions?

   "A) I didn't imply that you directed that post to admin at all. But you were speaking to admin about JUST responding to a poster who was blah blah blah, with your typical accusations of dishonesty.\n\n R) Ah, I see the problem. I foolishly assumed that your reading incomprehension didn't spill over into your writing with the same ferocity. I never even read that post before posting it. But because it was your most recent post and you said you had just written it to admin, I assumed this was the one. [bold added]\nWhat you wrote, by standard interpretation, is what I said you wrote: that I allegedly wrote it to admin. What you meant is that I said to admin that I had just written it. A big difference. Obviously no dishonesty on my part. Obviously a major inability of yours to communicate clearly.\n \n \n2) I then saw that your post to marc was your most recent post and produced that specific link which I just reposted above, again. Nothing dishonest or deceptive at all.\n\n 5280) Let me get this straight: You understand that the post you're talking about here really is my response to the post I was referring admin to? The one you said you didn't read, but you attacked as being fruitless and full of lies?\n \n \nAnd C) I quickly scanned your post and saw it was about AIG, had no supporting links, as usual, so i saw enough to know it was your opinion only which is precisely what I said in the post.\n\n &#8730;7) Very little of my post discusses AiG. You don't know when to read, you don't know how to read, so why the hell are you putting any stock into your \"scanning\" technique?\n Here, let's see my post again. Man, look at how many times I refer to AiG...\n \n \nBut please do feel free to finally, just once support your opinion with actual evidence regarding what you said to marc. I would love to see you prove any of what you said in the post. But you wont.\n\n Do you truly believe that my statements are incorrect, or are you just trolling? I would love to see you accept my challenge. You can accuse me of being full of cr*p, but it takes 'nads to make your accusation mean anything. Either I show that my points are substantiated and you shut your trap for a week, or you refute every single one of my points and I'll take a weeklong break.\n \n \n... because your like a peacock who likes to sashay his brightly colored tail to intimidate the other birds because you have no other real defense at all to rely on.\n\n Again, I can't expose your ignorance of topics any better than you can if you'll just start pretending that you're stating facts. You really think that a peacock's tail is to intimidate other birds in lieu of defense? You know no more about evolution than my engine's dipstick.\n \n \nSo go ahead and back up your talk with actual facts; what an interesting change of pace that would be around here.\n\n Go ahead and make it clear that you still think that my post is nothing but opinion and has no more merit than marc's statements. If you do that, and if you accept my challenge for a weeklong self-imposed 4forums vacation, you'll get exactly what you're asking for.",

   "Why the childish games lyte?\n\n Because I want your rampant accusations of dishonesty to carry some implications. Why won't you accept the consequences of your actions, little boy?\n \n \nI haven't followed the debate at all so I don't even know the details of your subject matter which is proven if you weren't talking about AIG.\n\n I didn't say I wasn't talking at all about AiG, did I? I said that very little of my post discusses AiG, and that's the truth. Why can you not interpret standard English words?\n \n \nI looked back at the post and noticed that marc mentioned AIG, but your response to him said nothing about it, so what kind of a response is that?\n\n Perhaps I didn't specifically mention the letters AiG, but I addressed his points: He claimed that AiG represents mainstream Christianity and pretended to evidence the claim by saying that Catholics accept YECism. They do not, and if marc had read Miller's book as he keeps saying he has, he'd know that.\n \n \n \nI don't know, but just support your opinions, but don't drag me into your childish games with foolish bets because I have no desire to play games with you. I neither have the time nor the inclination.\n\n And I don't have the time or inclination to jump through hoops for you when YOU'VE ADMITTED THAT YOU DON'T READ MY POSTS before dismissing them as lies. You've accused me of lying, you said that nothing I said was factual, and then you reneged on your challenge when I attached consequences to your actions. You won't even clearly state for the record that you actually disbelieve any of my specific points. Why not, Archie? Why is it okay for you to call me a liar yet not have to specify any single instance of my lying? Why won't you accept accountability for your accusations if you truly believe that your accusations are true?\n \n \nNow like a typical juvenile, I'm sure you'll say I'm afraid of some thing only your mind can dream up. But I assure you, it isn't fear but maturity that causes me not to play your games.\n\n Look, all you have to do is state for the record which statements you claim I'm lying about. It'd be great if you'd actually pretend that you had half of the intellectual integrity to stand behind your statements instead of hoping that none of us notice that even you -- rife with willful ignorance of facts and the dueling cases of unwillingness to read and inability to read for comprehension -- know that my statements are true and are hoping not to get nailed on it.\n \n Now, will you fess up like a man, or can we expect more of this trolling?",

I suspect you would rail against the techniques, but fail to recognize them when you do them.\n \n 3) I compared your two statements because they exemplify how you correct your own mistake. Your inconsistency.\n Instead of trying to continue with the \"Just because the catholic church accepts evolution today in no way proves evo is true or right.\" mentality, you instead later ACCURATELY identify (at least part of) electrolyte's real approach.\n \n It's kind of like interrogating a guy who claims that John is black, and then the guy admits that John is actually white.\n You slipped up.\n \n 4) I post the above for the sake of others on the board.\n You never admit to ANY mistake, and I'm not foolish enough to think you will now.",

Proclaiming \"bitchy as a gay\" isn't bigotted, even though everybody can see it is. Proclaiming that other statements don't mean what multiple people repeatedly tell you.\n It's like everybody is telling you there's an elephant in the room, and you insist it isn't there.\n \n And for the record Archie, you might want to stop calling us names so you can resume your pretend pose of being \"victimized\" by others calling you names...\n \n So Archie, in conclusion:\n Archie, just because the bible is old doesn't make it true.\n Archie, just because evolution doesn't include fairy tales doesn't make it false.\n Archie, just because you're white doesn't make you right.\n Archie, just because you use the alias \"Archangel\" doesn't mean you can fly.",
