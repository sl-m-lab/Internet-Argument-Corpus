   "If I read this right, the Democrats are calling for gun registration, licensing, and microstamping. Is this the gun control platform the Democrats are going to pursue? \n \n  Pelosi Calls For Gun Registration, - Opposes D.C. Gun Reform Legislation\n However, on Tuesday, on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Pelosi said, \"we [members of Congress] have to find some level of compromise\" on guns. She noted that the Supreme Court, in District of Columbia v. Heller, ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to guns. But, she said, \"We want them registered.\" \n \n Pelosi also used the word \"draconian\" to describe legislation before Congress to reform D.C.'s gun laws. Apparently referring to the provision of that legislation that would permit residents of D.C. to buy handguns in Maryland and Virginia, Pelosi added, \"we don't want them crossing state lines.\" \n \n Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the Senate sponsor of the now-expired federal \"assault weapons\" ban, said on a CBS \"60 Minutes\" program to be aired on Sunday that she is only temporarily holding off on introducing legislation to reinstate the ban. \"I'll pick the time and place. No question about it,\" Feinstein said.\n\n \n Gun writer Jeff Snider point out.  Obama: No AWB for Now? \n He&#8217;s not saying he won&#8217;t renew the AWB, just that it will be difficult. And, &#8220;tracing of bullets and ballistics. . .&#8221; certainly sounds like he&#8217;s like to see some sort of registration &#8212; a fired bullet database, or microstamping implemented.\n \n \n: . . . One more thing &#8212; one more thing I forgot to mention. One other thing we can do is to track the weapons that we have in Mexico. If we manage to detect weapons sold illegally in the United States in violation of this law on the control of weapons exports, or if, in the United States, they can have &#8212; probably move forward on a good registry of armament or on the prohibition of certain massive sales of weapons, for example, to a hunter or to a common citizen &#8212; we know that these people do not usually buy hundreds of rifles or assault weapons or grenades &#8212; if we can move forward in those areas, I do believe that security both of the United States and Mexico will improve because those weapons are pointing against Mexican people and Mexican officials today.\n\n\n \n  President Obama Backs Inter-American Arms Treaty \n The treaty requires countries to take a number of steps to reduce the illegal manufacture and trade in guns, ammunition and explosives. \n \n In addition to making illegal the unauthorized manufacture and exporting of firearms, the treaty calls for countries to adopt strict licensing requirements, mark firearms when they are made and imported to make them easier to trace, and establish a cooperative process for sharing information between national law-enforcement agencies investigating arms smuggling. \n\n \n \n  Gun Registration \n With registration, people have to apply for a licence to own a firearm and in most cases successfully complete a Firearms Safety Course before the licence will be issued. \n \n With gun registration, the government has the right to deny a person permission to own a gun. This seems to be a direct contradiction of the premise &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221;. Gun owners are worried that total gun registration will eventually lead to the disarming of the people and cite the Nazi disarming of the Jews after gun registration became law in Germany. They also cite examples from Great Britain saying that after gun registration became law, different kinds of guns will gradually be outlawed until no one will be allowed to own a gun of any kind.\n \n No amount of gun registration will effectively wipe out crime in either large cities or rural areas. In Russia, for example, private possession of firearms is illegal, yet there are accounts of mass murders. Modern day serial killers all had guns that were bought through legal channels. Even if gun registration does become law, the government has no idea who owns guns in the country. People who disagree with the law will simply choose not to register their firearm and no one will know anything about it. The fact of trying to get everyone in a country as large as the United States or Canada to register their firearms is a very costly venture and one that will not achieve its objectives.\n\n \n  Gun registration part of the plan all along \n Got that, boys and girls...registration and prohibitions on transporting some firearms across state lines? If the Dems thought a new AWB was going to be a s&%tstorm of epic proportions, wait until they wade into registration and bans on transportation of firearms.\n \n Any doubts now as to what the leaders of the Democratic Party really want to do? The \"compromise\" Pelosi is talking about would lay the groundwork for door-to-door confiscations, which has been the end game all along.\n\n \n Is this what you guys are after?",

   "Full quote of the abstract for the publication FIREARMS REGISTRATION - COSTS VS BENEFITS - A SURVEY OF STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON FIREARMS REGISTRATION:\n \n FIREARMS REGISTRATON IN ITS SIMPLEST AND PUREST FORM IS DEFINED AS THE RECORDING OF FIREARM SERIAL NUMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING A MEANS OF TRACING A FIREARM TO ITS OWNER. BILLS CALLING FOR NATIONAL FIREARMS REGISTRATION HAVE BEEN DEFEATED IN CONGRESS, BUT MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PASSED REGISTRATION LAWS. GROUPS OPPOSED TO SUCH RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION QUESTION THE BENEFITS OF GUN CONTROL LAWS. A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE TO SEE WHETHER IT IS FEASIBLE AS THE ANNUAL COSTS OF A GUN CONTROL PROGRAM WOULD TAKE UP A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR CRIME CONTROL AND PREVENTION. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO A MORE THROUGH STUDY OF COSTS AND BENEFITS LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXTENSIVE FIREARMS REGISTRATION PROGRAM, A QUESTIONNAIRE (NOT INCLUDED) WAS DEVELOPED AND SENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN ALL 50 STATE. IT REQUESTED INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF HOMICIDES, ASSAULTS, AND ROBBERIES WHICH WERE SOLVED BY TRACING THE SERIAL NUMBER ON A GUN. WHEN A STATE REPORTED CASES SOLVED IN THIS WAY, MORE INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. A TOTAL OF 44 STATES SUPPLIED ENOUGH DATA FOR THE SURVEY. VERY FEW STATES REPORTED CASES SOLVED BY TRACING THE GUN. HOWEVER, MANY STATES UTILIZED REGISTRATION RECORDS IN CASES OF STOLEN OR LOST GUNS, AND MANY LESSER CRIMES WERE SOLVED WITH THE AID OF THE REGISTRATION DATA. AT LEAST 6 HOMICIDES AND 6 ROBBERIES IN THE 44 STATES REPORTING IN THIS SURVEY WERE SOLVED BY TRACING THE GUN'S SERIAL NUMBER. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT, WITHOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF MORE PRECISE COST FIGURES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE THE VALUE OF FIREARMS REGISTRATION PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF A COST-BENEFIT RATIO. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL GUN CONTROL AND REGISTRATION LAWS IS PROVIDED; A RELEVANT SUPREME COURT DECISION (HAYNES V. UNITED STATES) IS DISCUSSED. TABULAR DATA AND BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE INCLUDED.\n \n I have not read the publication. I would like to read it, particularly since the summary says it talks about the impact of the then recent Haynes case. But I'm not interested enough to buy it since it is almost 40 years old (published 1970). I note the corporate sponsor for the research was the NSSF, and with this in mind I would be very surprised if the publication would cast mandatory registration laws in a positive light. Claim bias now if you will....\n \n With the current system we use:\n \n For firearms recovered in crimes, we trace them by contacting the manufacturer, who then tells us when and where the gun was shipped for sale. The FFL dealer is required to keep all records of his sales, and the purchaser's name is recovered from those forms. BATFE does all this background research for local LE, and it sends the local agency a printout with the date of sale-name, address, etc. of dealer-and the name, address etc. of the purchaser. The purchaser can then be contacted so we can find out from him what happened to the gun. Traces very rarely help solve crimes because they almost never assist us in proving who brandished or fired the gun at the crime scene. The trace records are helpful if the gun is newly bought (say less than one year ago), and the original purchaser is already the suspect (and it gets better if he has also already denied any connection to the gun in the first place).\n \n Lost/stolen firearms are entered into a nationwide database by serial number. This requires the owner to report it stolen and to have the serial number available (if you ever want to see them again, then write them all down and store them in a secure place guys). We recover quite a few stolen firearms, and sometimes its years after the theft. We find them carried by felons who have them in a car when they are stopped and arrested for an outstanding warrant, or lying around raided crack houses, etc. And it's not just firearms, my friends. Any property with a serial number can be entered into the database (TVs, chainsaws, riding movers, etc.).",

Frat boy pranks become morally equivilant to cutting off Danny Pearl's head. Sure yer right. \nMurder is killing without society's sanction. It exists in all cultures true, but when the society sanctions killing varies. That would demonstrate relativity. The rest of your bluster has no relation to my own morality so I'll leave you to it.",

   "I pondered what would happen to our Constitution if the Controllers were ever successful in killing the 2nd Amendment. Having killed the 2nd they would have a perfect blueprint plan of attack.\n \n Their argument will go like this. Said in a whinier voice. \n \n Let me get this straight! You believe that you should be able to say and report ANYTHING you want! Does THIS sound REASONABLE and RATIONAL to YOUR mind? The First Amendment was written ages ago; surely you do not think that it applies to our modern society today! Back when it was written there were no Internet, computers, radio, no television, no cameras, and no microphones. Now we can even get news over Blackberries and our cell phones. There was no instant reporting back when the Constitution was written! It took days, weeks, and even months before people could get the news. Back then, they had to set type by hand. \n \n Lets start by having a three-day cooling off period, before anything can be written. Come on, let's be reasonable. Lets just have a few common sense controls on the First Amendment. No one is trying to take away your First Amendment Freedoms, but Children are being kidnapped, and killed because of the Internet. We need to protect our children. Do you remember that dragging death, and all of the other hate crimes? They could have been prevented, if we did not have so many Internet hate sites. Lets have the attorney General look at everything before it can be printed. What are you afraid of? \n \n That Radical Group The National Association of Broadcasters is totally unwilling to help us by even proposing common sense censorship limits. Who are you trying to protect? I'll bet that you and that Ultra Radical Group The National Association of Broadcasters, are just trying to protect your pedophile buddies, aren't you? We destroyed the 2nd Amendment and people are still killing each other. Something has to be done! \n \n We have computer games, newspapers, television, movies and Rap music that is killing our society with these poisoned images. Come on lets be reasonable! You know, nothing is written in stone. We use to have something called a Second Amendment before we came to our senses and repealed it from that dead out dated, archaic document. There is your proof that the Constitution is too old and antiquated for our modern society! We know that you think We the People, and especially you, have an Inalienable First Amendment Right. Well we say Bull! We say Repeal the First Amendment! \n \n We know that we 2nd amendment supporters sometimes look radical because we are not willing to compromise away what is left of The Second Amendment and our Constitution. After 22 to 30,0000 gun laws and the massive intrusion already taken place into our Second Amendment Rights, there is not any more room to compromise. Let's just see how congenial, composed, and rational you will look when they start wholesale jack hammering away at the foundation of the First Amendment. Lets see just how congenial you will be when you finally realize what is happening to our Great and Unique Constitution! Let us start this discussion by YOU describing the 20 censorship restrictions that YOU AGREE to put on the First Amendment. Come on! Let's be reasonable! Compromise! Who are you trying to protect? :) \n \n In my opinion, if our First and Second Amendment fall, there will be no Constitution! There will be no America, as we know it today!",

We know we could never get We the People to go along the changes to the Supreme Law of the Land, so we need to do it with a wink and a nod from a good portion of the people in one political party. \n \n However, if you think you have the votes go for it!\n   Article V \n The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. \n\n The only thing We the People ask is, for you to Obey the Law, just like we have to!",
