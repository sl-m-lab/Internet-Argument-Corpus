Am I wrong?\n \n A father and son were charged with lying to federal agents about the son's alleged training at an al-Qaida camp for a mission that a judge said was \"to kill Americans whenever and wherever they can be found.\"\n =============================\n Feds Charge Father, Son With al-Qaida Link\n June 08, 2005 7:54 AM EDT\n \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. - A father and son were charged with lying to federal agents about the son's alleged training at an al-Qaida camp for a mission that a judge said was \"to kill Americans whenever and wherever they can be found.\"\n \n According to an FBI affidavit, Hamid Hayat first denied any link to terror camps, but then told agents he attended an al-Qaida camp in 2003 and 2004.\n \n \"Hamid advised that he specifically requested to come to the United States to carry out his jihadi mission,\" according to the affidavit. \"Potential targets for attack would include hospitals and large food stores.\"\n \n Hayat and his father, Umer Hayat, were arrested over the weekend, FBI agent John Cauthen said Tuesday. Two other men have been detained on immigration violations, he said. The court complaint alleges that Umer Hayat lied about his son's involvement and money he sent for the son's training.\n \n Both men were being held at the Sacramento County Jail. Umer Hayat's attorney, Johnny Griffin III, called the allegations \"shocking\" but said his client \"is charged with nothing more than lying to an agent.\"\n \n U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter A. Nowinski denied a bail request for the elder Hayat, saying he was a flight risk and a danger to the community.\n \n \"He just returned from Pakistan where he built a new home and contributed financial assistance to an al-Qaida sponsored program training his son and others to kill Americans whenever and wherever they can be found,\" Nowinski said.\n \n Hamid Hayat's attorney wasn't in court, and Nowinski set his bail hearing for Friday.\n \n Umer and Hamid Hayat are American citizens, and the younger man was born in California.\n \n According to reports in the Los Angeles Times and The Sacramento Bee, Hamid Hayat was trying to return to the U.S. on May 29 when the FBI told its Sacramento office that he was on the federal \"no-fly\" list.\n \n The plane was diverted to Japan, where Hayat was interviewed by the FBI and denied any connection to terrorism. He was allowed to fly to California, but was interviewed again on June 3-4. He then acknowledged spending time at the training camp, the affidavit said.\n \n Cauthen identified the two other men as Shabbir Ahmed and Mohammed Adil Khan. He said he couldn't give any further details, citing an ongoing investigation.\n \n The Lodi News-Sentinel reported that Ahmed is the imam of a mosque in the town, and Khan is the former imam. The Bee reported that the men were detained after meeting separately with Umer Hayat on Saturday...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://start.earthlink.net/article/top?guid=20050608/42a66d40_3ca6_1552620050608627533120",

Not surprisingly, the leaders of every other major Muslim organization shunned the march and declined to take a public stand against terrorism and extremism.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=6579\n When its leaders speak to mainstream media, MSA presents itself as a campus-service organization not much different from other collegiate faith groups. But the reality is very different, and deeply sinister. MSA is a key element in the Wahhabi lobby, and a cornerstone of the conspiracy by Saudi-backed extremists to control American Islam, as well the public discourse about Islam in America. \n Above all, MSA now seeks to present itself as moderate and opposed to terrorism, even though its chapters have distributed the propaganda of Osama bin Laden on its websites, along with publicity-recruiting campaigns for Wahhabi subversion of the Chechen struggle in Russia. \n \n \n http://www.conservativebookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6649\n The ultimate goal of these subversives, according to Sperry -- quoting verbatim from some of the most respected and \"mainstream\" Muslim leaders in America -- is to replace the U.S. Constitution with sharia (Islamic) law and turn America into an Islamic state. And, as Sperry details point-by-point, they have been aided and abetted in their sinister aims by tireless champions of spiritual and cultural relativism in the media and academia, who have mitigated the threat in the public's mind by \"mainstreaming\" Islam.\n \n Infiltration, at bottom, is a story of mass deception -- a disturbing tale of how the American people have been played for fools, victims of an elaborate fraud orchestrated by the \"mainstream\" Muslim establishment to protect a faith from due scrutiny, while concealing an underworld that secretly plots to infiltrate and overturn the American system of government. \n A small sampling of Paul Sperry's disturbing revelations: \n \u00b7 \"One Nation Under Allah\": how some of the most respected American Muslim leaders -- the so-called \"moderates\" who have broken bread in the White House, prayed in Congress, advised the Pentagon, and even lectured cadets at the FBI academy -- are harboring a secret dream about the future of American culture \n \u00b7 The influential American Muslim leader who has repeatedly told Muslim audiences that their goal is to turn the U.S. into an Islamic state, even if it takes \"a hundred years\" \n \u00b7 How an Islamic activist obtained a sensitive intelligence post at the Department of Homeland Security even though he failed to disclose his past association with a confessed terrorist -- an omission overlooked by a federal personnel agency he happened to previously advise as one of its top internal lawyers \n \u00b7 The senior White House official who once lobbied Congress and federal agencies to make it harder for federal law enforcement to deport Middle Eastern immigrants with suspected terror links \n \u00b7 The FBI's translator program: a den of deceit and dual loyalties, where mistranslation of al Qaeda intercepts by Muslim and Arab linguists is commonplace, say agents and translators who have worked there \n \u00b7 How the FBI is putting its agents through \"Muslim sensitivity training,\" which includes inviting Muslim clerics and leaders to preach about the allegedly peaceful attributes of Islam \n \u00b7 The growing threat posed by the more than 20,000 Muslims in America's armed forces -- and by the estimated 200,000 Muslim prison inmates in America, many of whom have been converted by radical chaplains sympathetic to al Qaeda \n \u00b7 The Arabic translator in the Minneapolis field office of the FBI who had a relationship with an al Qaeda suspect for seven years -- and was quietly let go only recently \n \u00b7 How, in their rush to recruit Arabic translators after 9/11, both the FBI and Pentagon cut corners on background checks and hired Muslim translators in spite of their ties to military and intelligence agencies in Syria, Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey \n \u00b7 How laptops with classified intelligence about al Qaeda investigations have gone missing from the translation unit in the Washington field office of the FBI \n \u00b7 The Muslim FBI agent who refused to wear a wire to secretly record a Muslim target of a counterterrorism investigation -- and his friendship with the bookkeeper of the target \n \u00b7 How Arabic instructors at the Defense Language Institute, where U.S. Army translators are trained, gloss over Arab terrorism and focus instead on Arab arts and culture \n \u00b7 The deal the White House struck with Muslim-rights groups to avoid describing terrorism as \"Islamic\" \n \u00b7 How a Republican-tied Islamic institute has been running influence operations against the federal government \n \u00b7 The \"moderate\" Muslim advocacy group that, according to IRS financial records, has donated money to terrorist front groups, while also employing three officials recently arrested for terrorist-related activities \n \u00b7 How the same group has received substantial foreign support for its operations, despite public denials by its officials \n \u00b7 The Saudi-bankrolled American social studies teacher who is educating public-school children about Islam through sugarcoated textbooks and role-playing exercises in which kids \"become Muslims\" for weeks \n \u00b7 The Saudi-funded Washington-area mosque that ministered to at least two of the 9/11 terrorists.

I have many friends who love America, love Americans that I would stand with side by side, through thick and thin, who are Muslim. \n \n I do not like it, but the fact is, sometime in the future, maybe not today or tomorrow, maybe not next month, or even this year, but Muslim terrorists will attack the United States of America again. They may not fly planes into buildings again, but maybe they will. They may go after high profile targets such as DC, NYC, Vegas, or LA. They may attack the \"heartland\" of America. Recently in Columbus, Ohio, an arrest was made of a Muslim who planned an attempt to attack a Columbus area shopping center. Terrorists may try to attack rail roads, bridges, or other means of mass transportation. Credible sources have confirmed that Muslim terrorists may use a dirty bomb. A dirty bomb would be devastating. A small nuclear bomb, if exploded, could completely destroy an American city, making it not habitable for many years. \n \n Muslim terrorists hate America and their only pathetic, sadistic goals in life are to kill Americans. It is time for Muslim-American leaders to speak out against Muslim terrorists. When a very small percentage of Catholic priests were accused of assault, the rest of the Catholic world and priests in America denounced the bad priests, and made it a goal to get the word out that they did not support any priest who assaulted others. Muslim-American leaders need to get out on every local and national news outlet and denounce all anti-American Muslim terror organizations. Muslim leaders need to stand up against the terrorists that are misrepresenting their noble religion. Muslim leaders need to get the word out to Americans that they do not support terrorist Muslims and they need to do it fast. If, and unfortunately, most likely, when, Muslim terrorists attack again and kill hundreds or thousands of innocent Americans, Americans may not be as tolerant as they are now. If or when the United States is attacked by radical, militant, Muslim terrorists again, innocent Muslims may suffer the consequences. I would never condone any mistreatment of any group of people. I can say this, though. Not all Americans will be as kind as me. If Muslim leaders in American do not start speaking out against terrorism, many Americans will not know the difference between the radical Muslims and innocent, America loving Muslims. During World War II, Japanese Americans were rounded up by FDR and put in to camps. If America is attacked again, Muslims could only hope that this would happen to them. This could be the only way to save themselves. Americans will take it out on many innocent Muslims. Americans will turn on Muslims in America and see them as the same people that kill innocent Americans, and the results will not be pretty. \n \n I need to make sure that my point is crystal clear. I do not hate Muslims. I do not like radical, militant, Muslim terrorists that want to destroy America, and kill Americans. Most Muslim Americans are good, hard working, honest, loving people. I have many Muslim friends who I would go to the mattresses with and I would stand with side by side and defend them to the end. Muslim American leadership must be more vocal in their distain for terrorism. Muslim American leadership must prove to their fellow Americans that they stand with America in the face of radical Muslim terrorism. IF they fail to do this, and IF the United States is attacked again by Muslim terrorists, and IF hundreds or thousands of innocent Americans are killed, Americans will vow revenge. Americans will not care that Muslims in America, for the most part, love America. They will see the face of death and evil in all Muslims (wrongly) and take it out on all Muslims. I invite all Muslim Americans to stand up, and speak out against terrorism, and show their support and love for America. \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43130\n How Muslim radicals \n are penetrating Washington\n 'Infiltration' reveals shocking truth about Islamic spies, subversives in U.S.\n \n \n Posted: March 14, 2005\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \u00a9 2005 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n While Americans continue to promote cultural diversity and religious tolerance as society's highest values, radical Muslims masquerading as \"moderates\" have insinuated themselves into the very fabric of American society, to the nation's extreme peril, says a startling new book by veteran investigative journalist Paul Sperry.",

   "I guess time will tell. However, recall that there was a time when Christianity was a religion of the sword. When conversion by torture was the norm, and Crusades and Inquistions were common. These weren't the acts of some radical outsiders, this was church policy. But despite that, Christianity managed to grow into a religion which preaches love and peace. If Christianity can overcome having its core be based on violence, then I have hope that Islam can overcome having a violent fringe element.\n\n \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm\n \n The Crusades were expeditions undertaken, in fulfilment of a solemn vow, to deliver the Holy Places from Mohammedan tyranny.  \n \n \n http://www.holysmoke.org/sdhok/crus04.htm\n CRUSADES: \n Military expeditions undertaken by Western European Christians between 1095 and 1270, usually at the behest of the papacy, to \"recover\" Jerusalem and other Palestinian places of pilgrimage from Muslim control.  The name \"crusade\" (from Lat., \"cross,\" the emblem of the Crusaders) was also applied, especially in the 13th century, to wars against Pagan peoples, Christian heretics, and political foes of the papacy. \n \n BACKGROUND. \n \n The origin of the Crusades is rooted in the political upheaval that resulted from the expansion of the Seljuk Turks in the Middle East in the mid-11th century. Western Christians viewed the conquest of Syria and Palestine by these aggressive Muslims with fright and alarm. Turkish invaders also penetrated deep into the Christian Byzantine Empire and subjected many Greek, Syrian, and Armenian Christians to their rule. The Crusades were in part a reaction to these events,  as well as serving the ambitions of 11th-, 12th-, and 13th-century popes who sought to extend their political and religious power. Crusading armies were, in a sense, the military arm of papal policy. \n \n Beyond all this, the Crusades coincided with a time of dramatic growth of European population and commercial activity. The Crusades provided an area of expansion to accommodate part of this growing population. They also offered an outlet for the ambitions of land-hungry knights and noblemen. At the same time, the expeditions offered rich commercial opportunities to the merchants of the growing cities of the West, particularly Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. \n \n Crusading thus had a broad appeal to numerous Europeans. Some went on Crusades out of greed, some out of religious fervor; almost all Crusaders sought adventure, and many of them believed that their participation would virtually guarantee personal salvation. Every Crusader probably had different reasons for participation. \n \n \n \n Thank God for the Catholic (Christain) swords. If not for them, we'd all be facing Mecca three times a day!",

The French had been dividing properties amongst their sons for generations, causing bloodshed between brothers over small pieces of real estate. In reaction, Pope Urban II expanded \"The Truce of God\", which outlawed fighting from Sunday to Wednesday, and banned fighting involving priests, monks, women, laborers and merchants on any day of the week. Italy was a collection of city-states, constantly being overrun by invading hordes, the latest of which were the Normans, who had just started to become \"civilized\".\n \n There was also the Byzantine empire, ruling from Constantinople, whose emperor at this time was Alexius Comnenus. To his East, the Turks were rapidly encroaching on his empire, and had begun attacking pilgrims on their way to - and in - Jerusalem, causing him great distress. He wrote to his friend Robert, the Count of Flanders, in 1093, telling him about supposed atrocities committed by the Turks on the Christian pilgrims, and Robert passed this letter on to Pope Urban II. Urban, an opportunist, saw this as a perfect way to solve some of his local problems. He personally promoted a Holy Crusade to reclaim the Holy Lands from the barbarian Turks. Thus, the First Crusade was launched in 1096 CE.\n \n \n \n Read the links. I trust them a lot more than I do you.\n \n Look up some more links to history.
