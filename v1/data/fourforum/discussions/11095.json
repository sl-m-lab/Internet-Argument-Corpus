Relatives in California called police said they were concerned for the girl. Police took the girl to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.\n \n According to the parents \"they didn't have enough faith.\"\n \n The police continue to investigate the situation and the parents could be facing charges in the death of their daughter.\n \n\n \n When does the life a a child over ride a parents religious beliefs?",

How about the FLDS compounds , if it can be shown that they are arranging and giving in marriage underage girls?\n\n \n First, I really do think that underage marriage is a separate issue from people seeking doctors and medical care.\n \n Second, again, IMO the issue here is neglect and mistreatment, period. Not their religion. Religious freedom is an issue independent of these other matters. If a specific case of harming people is against the law, then it shouldn't matter if it's done out of religion or anything else. I think if you want to debate parenting, seeking medical care, underage marriage, etc., then these issues are all issues in and of themselves.

   "Sounds like typical Word of Faith cultic-clap trap.\n \n \n If you'll note from the site linked to, the minsiter of UBM comments on the bible, using verse.\n In the 'by his stripes you are healed' verse, he shows his biblical ignorance. Confusing the forgiveness of sin with the curing of illnesses. This is very common in most contemporary evangelicalistic religions like WofF who's pastors often rely on 'personal revelations' on what the bible means rather than actually learning what it means. \n Jesus used healing to show he was the messiah. His death on the cross was to heal sin. Biblically ignorant people still confuse sin as causing illness.\n \n Often, they'll try to push off a pseudo-knowledge of the original languages by straight-translating the Greek or Hebrew to English. Ommitting grammar and context.\n This is how you get the 'God Kind of Faith' that the whole WofF theology is based on. Mistranslating 'Have faith in God' to mean 'Have faith of God'...have the God Kinda Faith. \n In their revelations, they believe god used 'faith powers' to create everything and do everything. The links comments on 'Jesus perfect faith' reflects this. \n If one only has 'the faith of a mustard seed' they can do all things. So, if you want something, have faith that it HAS happened. Don't let doubt into your life. After all, 'faith pleases the lord' and the opposite, doubt, must be displeasing. Logical, no? \n Thus, taking your child (or yourself) to the doctors is permissable...if you simply admit that you don't have faith in God...and His miracles. \n The pastors (and I've heard MANY in person) do state, as a caveat, that 'if you need the doctor, then by all means, go! But, if you have the faith like I do, then you'll have perfect health. Why, I've been attacked by the devil several times who's visited symptoms on me, but, I just \"confess my faith\" and I'm instantly cured.'\n Such commentary by pastors and others is manipulative and implies that they are the visible models to live by, he IS a mand ob gawd after all. \n The levels of psychological manipulation put upon a congregation are unimaginable.\n \n You'll also note that in that link, the pastor dishonestly focuses on the biblical passages that have the person's faith healing them (not Jesus/God). They often push this message and will violently oppose (even twisting scripture) that is is your faith that heals you...not God. You command it, God has to do it...that's how it works. it's part of your 'conenant deal'.\n \n This would be basic heresy to any Christian who was worth his salt. \n And note, when they suffered a loss of a child, the pastor, in typical WofF fasion, places all the blame on their shoulders for not having enough faith. Or having 'unconfessed sin' in some unknown area...\n \"Sometimes we stumble because of lack of faith or repentance in an area but hopefully we correct this and get back up.\"\n \n It's never the fault of the false message they pushed.\n \n I wonder if their daughter will 'get back up'.\n Maybe if they're tru WofFers like Hobart Freeman, they'll keep the body around a few months and pray for it's ressurrection...cause, once, in band-camp, the pastor raised a pair of drowned twins who everyone else said were dead...\n \n edit: oh snappity snap!\n \" We are sure Kara does not want to come back but we have asked God to send her for her parents' sake and as a testimony of His love for us.\"\n The DO want Kara to be physically ressurrected.\n Wonder who'll steal the body from the morgue.\n \n \n Here's the cultist's web site UBM.\n \n And, here's the loons last press release from his site.",

   "Yep, another couple face charges in the death of their child.\n \n Linky McLink Link\n \n \nOREGON CITY, Ore. (March 31) - A couple whose church preaches against medical care are facing criminal charges after their young daughter died of an infection that authorities said went untreated.\n \n Carl and Raylene Worthington were indicted Friday on charges of manslaughter and criminal mistreatment in the death of their 15-month-old daughter Ava. They belong to the Followers of Christ Church, whose members have a history of treating gravely ill children only with prayer.\n \n Ava died March 2 of bronchial pneumonia and a blood infection. The state medical examiner's office has said she could have been treated with antibiotics.\n \n Dr. Christopher Young, a deputy state medical examiner, said the child's breathing was further hampered by a benign cyst on her neck that had never been medically addressed, The Oregonian reported.\n \n Laws passed in the 1990s struck down legal shields for faith-healing parents after the deaths of several children whose parents were members of the fundamentalist church.\n \n Since those laws took effect in 1999, \"We haven't seen any cases of significant medical neglect ... until now,\" said child abuse Detective Jeff Green of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office.\n \n The Worthingtons could face more than six years if convicted on the manslaughter charges and up to a year on the mistreatment charges, said Greg Horner, chief deputy district attorney. They were released on $250,000 bail, he said.\n \n Horner said he didn't know whether the couple had lawyers to speak for them. A number listed for the couple was disconnected. A man who answered the phone at the church Monday would not identify himself and said: \"We've been told 'No comment.\"'\n \n The Worthingtons also lost a baby boy in 2001, but an investigation was closed after family members told police the child was stillborn. Several other Followers of Christ children have also been stillborn or died during home births in recent years, and none of the deaths resulted in criminal charges, authorities have said.\n \n AP\n\n \n They should have used the force...\n \n Because we all know that prayer really doesn't work.\n \n \n \n Ya know, with all these deaths that have occurred when prayer was relied on as the sole cure, I would like these people to push forward one, just one, bona fide case of it working.\n If the miracles of healing happen as many believers are wont to say, you'd think there'd be some actual evidence to show that to everyone.\n \n This might help illustrate the issue.",

The waters rose so high that one man was forced to climb onto the roof of his house.\n \n As the waters rose higher and higher, a man in a rowboat appeared, and told him to get in. \"No,\" replied the man on the roof. \"I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me.\" So the man in the rowboat went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.\n \n The waters rose higher and higher, and suddenly a speedboat appeared. \"Climb in!\" shouted a man in the boat. \"No,\" replied the man on the roof. \"I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me.\" So the man in the speedboat went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.\n \n The waters continued to rise. A helicopter appeared and over the loudspeaker, the pilot announced he would lower a rope to the man on the roof. \"No,\" replied the man on the roof. \"I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me.\" So the helicopter went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.\n \n The waters rose higher and higher, and eventually they rose so high that the man on the roof was washed away, and alas, the poor man drowned.\n \n Upon arriving in heaven, the man marched straight over to God. \"Heavenly Father,\" he said, \"I had faith in you, I prayed to you to save me, and yet you did nothing. Why?\" God gave him a puzzled look, and replied \"I sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more did you expect?\"\n ====================================\n \n Lesson learned?\n When God sends you doctors to help, it can be perceived as arrogant if you refuse and insist he come down himself and do the job... emoticon_rolleyes",

Praying people just can't win, with you.\n\n \n \n Nope. They can win.\n \n All they need do is follow some simple principles.\n 1) document that a medical condition actually exists\n 2) show that the ONLY treatment plan for said condition was prayer.\n 3) show that said medical condition disappeared.\n \n This is a fairly simple request and can easily be followed by any honest person.\n To date, those who've made such outlandish statements of healing via prayer have not been able to comply.\n Benny Hinn is one noted proponent of faith healing and makes many statements of seeing it's effects. In the handful of attempts he's tried to show proof, the medical records have not passed simple inspections. Having been forgeries or having shown that a medical procedure was done to enact the healing claimed.\n \n Here's a list of some of the claims this particular minister has made about healing. \n \n\"Last night, during our Unleavened Bread Bible Study, I looked to my immediate right and left and saw those who had been totally and freely delivered by God&#8217;s method without any bad side effects -- one delivered of alcoholism, another of numbers of allergies, another of the crippling after-effects of a stroke, another from the crippling effects of a wreck and drugs, another from 14 years of being a drugged up zombie to cope with crippling arthritis, and finally, myself, delivered of heart problems, cancer, eyesight, etc.\"\n\n I've known people to heal naturally from a stroke without the use of medicine or prayer. It happens.\n Allerigies...mine healed once I realized what I was allergic too. No easy task when you have no sense of smell. But, all I need do is avoid the item in question. I even helped one lady learn of her allergies that turned out to be cause by my same cause (bleach).\n Atheist can be cured in the same mysterious ways of alcoholism. Even without a 12 step program. Same odds. No miracle there. Same with drugs.\n As to the persons claims of being cured of cancer. 10 to 1 says he'll never present any proof that he even had cancer to begin with. It's a common schtick in these groups. Seems 'cancer' is a big thing with them. I've personally heard it hundreds of times. Just tonight for one. Yet, no evidence of it even existing.\n Just recently I thought I may have had cancer. Doctors couldn't find anything. Being a fairly intellegent person, I'll surmize I didn't have it to begin with no matter my personal feelings.\n If I were a cultist, I'd simply praise Jebus for my miracle and, from personal experience with these types, over time, slowly exagerate the story and embelish it until the tale I tell is that I DID have cancer.\n 'Heart problems' is another 'vague' condition such pastors and congregants suffer from that get's cured with prayer and faith all the time too.\n The grandfather of the WofF movement, Kenneth Haggin made the claim that he was cured of a mysterious heart and blood condition and had perfect health for life (occasional 'symptoms of illness' such as a headache were demonic attacks). He believed this right up until he died an old man of heart problems in a cardiac ward of the hospital.\n \n But, here's a list of UBM's 'testimonies' on healings. \n Wow! 'Beast Cancer healed' Note that at no point do they even say that a lump was verified as being 'cancer'. They exagerate a common lump into being cancer...and attribute it's going away (healing) to prayer.\n Praise tha lard!\n And Here someone named Vicky tells a 2nd hand story on healing of cancer by someone she knows and a friend of a friend.\n I've heard countless urban legends and known frauds preached from the pulpit. 2nd hand stories passed off as really happening. Hearsay.\n Once, I sat and listened to a pastor recall how an entire camp meeting of Pentacostals was poisoned by food poisoning and immediatly went into prayer and were all saved. No evidence of this miraculous event could be found anywhere...save from the imagination of the pastor...who pushed the agenda that he was specially anointed to heal cancer and the sick. He also sought numerous 'love offerings' and donations for his 'ministry'.\n \n Here's some testimonies of getting assistance from their members.\n Here's one comment. \n \nLast Dec 16, at 5:35 pm I was in a car accident when I pulled onto a road in front of a car driving without lights after sunset. THe lady plowed into my 99 4Runner tearing out the front-left suspension, fender, and misc. parts. I was uninjured but had a reaction and went into shock, so they ambulanced me against my will to San Jose Regional Medical. the ambulance driver kept saying \"SIR, YOU COULD DIE!\" (because I had passed out). I refused IVs and any intrusive care, but they forced me to the Trauma Center and did all their tests. \n \n They wanted me to stay overnight for observation, but I refused, hearing your words of testimony about your motorcycle accident \"I just want to go home\" go thru my mind. \n \n I kept telling them: \"Let me sign your papers, I am fine, I want to go home\" and I kept repeating until they released me. We had to pay at the office, THAT NIGHT, $10,314.00 (because we believe God and live by faith, we have no medical insurance, they reduced the trauma care from $18,000+ down to $10,314.00).\n \n So we paid and my wife took me home at 11:30 pm that night. There were other medical charges for lab, the ambulance, etc., plus my car. The total out of pocket for the accident was well over $13,000. the car insurance paid us $5,000\n \n At the Bible study Dec. 18, you all prayed for me.\n \n In May we sent a gift to the Work.\n \n TODAY: Unbelievably, we opened the mail and there was a check from the hospital corporation for \"overcharges\":\n \n $8,261.00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There was absolutely never any indication we would ever see any of that money paid to the hospital and doctors again.\n \n PRAISE GOD. God did this, glory to Him forever.\n\n \n Ummm, wow!\n Faith didn't prevent them from getting into an accident to begin with.\n Nor did it prevent him from experiencing shock.\n Nor did it interceed to prevent him from being taken to th hospital.\n Nor from being charged thousands when he didn't even WANT the treatment.\n But, living on faith, he decided to SHOW it (as many WolFs are wont to do) and refuse to waste his money on insurance...such funds no doubt wen to line the pockets...erm coffers...erm Storehouse Mal 3 of the church.\n But, it's a miracle of God when state mandated car insurance pays for a paltry 5k and the hospital 'corrects' the other 8k.\n \n Some people are soo desperate to find their miracles that they see everyday common occurances that happen no matter what as something special for them.\n I like this too: \"In May we sent a gift to the Work\"\n I wonder how much the $gift$ was for? Part of these peoples theology is that you must show faith by planting seeds and giving abundant offerings. 99.9% of said offerings do go to line the pockets of the pastor and his family.\n So, that's 13k owed initially, minus car insurance coverage (which will no doubt increase his premiusm) plus the 8k mark down to get to zero loss...except for this 'gift' and anything else he's not stating.\n \n Some miracle of faith.\n \n I've had better blessings for doing nothing. \n Just got a property tax rebate check in last week.\n \n I don't even want to touch this...\n \n \n So, yeah, decry that those like us will deny miracles and that prayer works when shown...\n But the problem is...they have YET to show any proof.\n \n What I find odd is that some people will defend this horrendous examples as if though it were a personal attack on their own, distantly related beliefs.\n \n \n As the old Russian proverb goes:\n 'If you happen to be in a lifeboat after a shipwreck, pray all you want for salvation...but continue to row for shore.'\n \n edit:\n Wow...OMG Wow. The dancing these people go through to justify how they are still right...even when they get it wrong.\n \n Their web site is a gold mine of how a cult works.\n Charles Manson wouldn't have anything on these folks if they decided to look more closely at God's OT commands to go forth and slaughter...",

You can \"believe in prayer\" and think that God will sincerely grant you health, and still go to the doctor. The only reason not to do so would be if going to the doctor would make God NOT answer the prayer, and that doesn't make any sense.

   "The more I hear people who take issue with prayer and the way they characterize people who pray and their prayers, the more I realize that part of the problem is a lack of understanding on the part of these skeptics about the mindset of people who pray. I think most people who pray don't view prayer as some magic token, rabbit's foot, or medicine--they view it simply as a way to communicate with God, about any number of issues. It's not like a medicine. The criticism I hear most often is that \"statistics show it doesn't work\" usually because statistically people often don't recover even after they've been prayed for. But that's like approaching it as if it were a medicine or cure. If prayer works even ONE time, EVER, then it's a worthwhile to engage in and hope that God will intervene. I don't think people who pray view it as something that's going to always bring about a positive result every time the way they want, or even necessarily a majority of the time. Their view is that's entirely dependent on God. By definition, at it's simplest, prayer is simply asking a higher power for something. By necessity, that is going to always involve the possibility they may not get what they're praying for. Prayer should be understood by its critics as nothing more or less than communicating with God, and therefore isn't really statistically measurable (at least in any reliable way)--just like many things having to do with theism. It's not the pray-er who effects a result, but God, who still has full autonomy, either way. \n \n Think of it this way. A teenager decides to measure if it \"WORKS\" or not to ask for the car keys from his parents. He decides to look at it statistically, and if he gets a positive result enough, he'll conclude that \"key-asking\" WORKS as a means to getting what he wants. He does this over a period of time, making notes and compiling his statistics. Now, can the teenager reliably conclude that he's ALWAYS going to get the car keys just because he did during a certain time frame? Maybe he didn't get them ANY during that time frame, but will at some point later. Or maybe he got them every time he asked during that time frame, but suddenly, for whatever reason, the parents don't let him. Should he conclude that \"key-asking\" doesn't work and never ask again? Well, it might yet work at some point! It is not really something you can or cannot conclude \"works\", because it is dependent on what the parents do on a case-by-case basis.\n \n The point is, that's sort of the way prayer works from the standpoint of religious people. In my opinion, they often don't approach it as some cure that's going to work every time--which is the way that skeptics of prayer sometimes seem to approach it in their criticism. Religious people simply hope that God will grant them what they're asking for, but I think most know that He may not, for whatever reason. So it's sort of meaningless to say that statistics show that prayer doesn't work. Even if only 1% of people who pray get a positive result on any prayer, then that alone is reason enough to pray. They may or may not get the car keys, but they feel they might as well ask. If the teenager only got the car keys 1 time out of 1000, then he can't really conclude that key-asking \"doesn't work.\" I think skeptics are expecting religious people to take the same sort of approach they would with something reliably measurable, like a chemical compound (a medicine), that is predictably going to always give a certain result, or not. But I don't think most religious people THEMSELVES have that view of prayer to begin with. I don't think they've claimed that it is like that. They simply view it as making a request of their God, with their God still having full autonomy in any case.",

   " It just doesn't work that way in many cases. Faith toward prayer and going to the doctor are not incompatible in that way, for most people. You can \"believe in prayer\" and think that God will sincerely grant you health, and still go to the doctor. The only reason not to do so would be if going to the doctor would make God NOT answer the prayer, and that doesn't make any sense.\n\n It makes perfect sense, if you read your Bible. Matthew, chapter 17. The disciples couldn't cast out a demon, but Jesus could. When they asked why they failed, he told them it was their lack of faith. Their prayers weren't answered because they didn't have sufficient faith. And clearly nothing screams lack of faith like hedging one's bets. Jesus says that if you believe, God will answer your prayers, if you don't believe he won't. If you pray for healing but see a doctor too, then you clearly don't believe that God is going to heal so, and so he won't.\n \n \n\n So you're now saying that your blanket statement of \"If you pray, but go to the doctor too, then you're not counting on the prayer, which means you don't have real faith that the prayers will work\" only applies to some and not everyone who prays? That it only applies to the ones who aren't sane? \n\n \n You lost me there. Your paraphrase of my position is correct, but then your conclusion on who it would apply to isn't. Obviously it applies in all cases, it's just that most people don't really believe that prayer will cure them. If they were counting on the prayer, if they really believed it would heal them, they wouldn't see any need to go to the doctor. QED",

   "The more I hear people who take issue with prayer and the way they characterize people who pray and their prayers, the more I realize that part of the problem is a lack of understanding on the part of these skeptics about the mindset of people who pray. I think most people who pray don't view prayer as some magic token, rabbit's foot, or medicine--they view it simply as a way to communicate with God, about any number of issues. It's not like a medicine. The criticism I hear most often is that \"statistics show it doesn't work\" usually because statistically people often don't recover even after they've been prayed for. But that's like approaching it as if it were a medicine or cure. If prayer works even ONE time, EVER, then it's a worthwhile to engage in and hope that God will intervene. I don't think people who pray view it as something that's going to always bring about a positive result every time the way they want, or even necessarily a majority of the time. Their view is that's entirely dependent on God. By definition, at it's simplest, prayer is simply asking a higher power for something. By necessity, that is going to always involve the possibility they may not get what they're praying for. Prayer should be understood by its critics as nothing more or less than communicating with God, and therefore isn't really statistically measurable (at least in any reliable way)--just like many things having to do with theism. It's not the pray-er who effects a result, but God, who still has full autonomy, either way. \n \n Think of it this way. A teenager decides to measure if it \"WORKS\" or not to ask for the car keys from his parents. He decides to look at it statistically, and if he gets a positive result enough, he'll conclude that \"key-asking\" WORKS as a means to getting what he wants.

He then doesn't ask for a week, and he never gets the keys. So is asking better than not asking?\n\n \n Perhaps a different analogy would be more convincing; this one is flawed from the outset because there's no way the teenager can get the keys if he doesn't ask, whereas it's perfectly possible to be cured of an illness without praying.\n \n Say instead that the teenager decides to see whether asking for lasagne for dinner increases his chances of getting it. The family already has lasagne once in a while, but it's the teenager's favourite dish and he would like to have it more often. So every day for two months he asks for lasagne for dinner. Sometimes he does indeed get lasagne when he asks for it - but how can he tell whether there was a causal link on those occasions? He therefore conducts a second experiment, and for the next two months does not express a preference. At the end of this 'control' experiment, he finds that he wasn't served lasagne significantly more or less often during either period, and concludes that his efforts had no effect.\n \n The same statistical tests have been performed with prayer. While those who advocate the power of prayer invariably point to the occasions where it coincides with recovery as evidence of efficacy, it is not true that those who debunk the power of prayer point only to the occasions when it fails. Rather, they observe that prayer does not increase the percentage of recoveries across a large sample. Only two possibilities exist to explain this: either prayer has no effect, or prayer has a zero-sum effect, helping some people who are prayed for at the expense of others who are also prayed for. The second possibility is intriguing, as it suggests a scenario where god divides humanity into those who pray and those who don't, and then allows the devout to compete amongst themselves for their slice of good fortune while giving non-believers an unbiased chance.\n \n It would be ironic indeed if prayer were akin to the old joke about two hikers coming face to face with a grizzly. One stops to change into running shoes. \"Are you crazy? You can't outrun a bear!\" \"I don't need to; I just need to outrun you.\"",

   "A comment today from a former member of the Followers of Christ sect, where a 15 month old died last month from pneumonia:\n \n \nA former member of the church, who is a mother herself, is now speaking out. \n \n \"I totally believe it's a cult, now that I'm out of it,\" she said. She does not want to be identified because she is deeply afraid of a backlash from family members who are still with the church.\n \n The woman was raised in the Followers of Christ Church and was taught, from her earliest memory, that doctors are a temptation and if you go to one, you are losing faith in God.\n \n She said she had mixed emotions when she first heard of Ava Worthington's death.\n \n \"Her parents are victims too, victims of the church, and they were just following their beliefs that they've been taught since they were born,\" she said. \"But then the other part of me was like, it's about time.\"\n \n She said she found the strength to leave when she realized no one in the church could answer the questions she had about their beliefs.\n \n \"It takes a lot to leave because you lose everything,\" she said. \"I lost my whole family. And it's hard. It's hard to lose your family and they won't speak to you.\"\n \n She is now thankful that her own children are healthy, especially since she did not take them to doctors while she was a member of the church.\n She does not believe the church members will alter their beliefs if the Worthingtons are convicted.\n \n \"They'll probably be looked up to, that they made this sacrifice for the love of God, for the church and for all of the members,\" she said.\n \n\n link\n \n Interesting point of view and it helps me understand a little how they think.

   "The more I hear people who take issue with prayer and the way they characterize people who pray and their prayers, the more I realize that part of the problem is a lack of understanding on the part of these skeptics about the mindset of people who pray. I think most people who pray don't view prayer as some magic token, rabbit's foot, or medicine--they view it simply as a way to communicate with God, about any number of issues. It's not like a medicine. The criticism I hear most often is that \"statistics show it doesn't work\" usually because statistically people often don't recover even after they've been prayed for. But that's like approaching it as if it were a medicine or cure. If prayer works even ONE time, EVER, then it's a worthwhile to engage in and hope that God will intervene. I don't think people who pray view it as something that's going to always bring about a positive result every time the way they want, or even necessarily a majority of the time. Their view is that's entirely dependent on God. By definition, at it's simplest, prayer is simply asking a higher power for something. By necessity, that is going to always involve the possibility they may not get what they're praying for. Prayer should be understood by its critics as nothing more or less than communicating with God, and therefore isn't really statistically measurable (at least in any reliable way)--just like many things having to do with theism. It's not the pray-er who effects a result, but God, who still has full autonomy, either way. \n \n \n The point is, that's sort of the way prayer works from the standpoint of religious people. In my opinion, they often don't approach it as some cure that's going to work every time--which is the way that skeptics of prayer sometimes seem to approach it in their criticism. Religious people simply hope that God will grant them what they're asking for, but I think most know that He may not, for whatever reason. So it's sort of meaningless to say that statistics show that prayer doesn't work. Even if only 1% of people who pray get a positive result on any prayer, then that alone is reason enough to pray. They may or may not get the car keys, but they feel they might as well ask. If the teenager only got the car keys 1 time out of 1000, then he can't really conclude that key-asking \"doesn't work.\" I think skeptics are expecting religious people to take the same sort of approach they would with something reliably measurable, like a chemical compound (a medicine), that is predictably going to always give a certain result, or not. But I don't think most religious people THEMSELVES have that view of prayer to begin with. I don't think they've claimed that it is like that. They simply view it as making a request of their God, with their God still having full autonomy in any case.\n\n \n J, there are MANY types of prayer.\n And, in the case of these people being discussed, Word of Faithers and those with a pentacostal mindset, YES, they DO use prayers as a form of magic. They DO expect it to work ALL the time.\n When it doesn't, well, they just need to work on 'building their faith up'.\n Most theologans who are opposed to the WofF style of religion see a strong corrolation to how they go about doing it to witch-craft and pagan styles of worship.\n I myself have extensive experience with these people as well as fairly decent experience with Wiccan, New Age and Generic paganism and they are more closely related, in practice and origins, to those non-Christians than they are to nearly ALL other sects of Christianity.\n The sad fact is that most of the practioners derided and discussed here have NO real working knowledge of the Christian bible and are spoon fed disjointed passages tied together to support their pastors agenda.\n The past 2 days, I've clicked on some of the TBN channel and got the double barrel version on how they're seeking to 'fundraise'. \n Numerous, out of context passages from the bible are used to support the notion that the viewer is to give sacraficially (meaning you give even if you can't afford it or even if it hurts you and endangers your living) to them. They have no concern for you at all. They promise (magical) rewards of '100 fold return' that they say the bible promises for your gift. And people believe it.\n They push that you need to have blind, unquestioning faith in their message or you won't get your (magical) rewards.\n And by (magical) I DO mean that out of Nowhere you will be blessed with what you need and want and you don't have to do anything.\n \n The pimps do push the message on healing too.\n You are to command it to happen. God HAS to do it for you due to how they interpret the 'covenant'.\n Since you're going to get healed, why waste money and time going to the doctors? Not logical. Especially if you can use that money to sow a seed in their ministry and reap that 100 fold return when it's your harvest time.\n Don't you know that going to a doctor just shows that you doubt that God will heal you? Doubt will kill you!\n \n \n Here's some types of prayer:\n \n Praise/Adoration = You's an awsome God!\n Intercession = Help someone else.\n Faith = I KNOW you're going to do this for me.\n Agreement = We of the community will see this rain end/start for it is writen that if two or more come together in my name, it will be done.\n Supplication or Petition = Yo, I need something important...and a new dress too, if it's your will though.\n Expiation or Contrition = I'm sorry, forgive me.\n Thanksgiving = Thanks for this grub and that raise and that Mercedes.\n \n There are other forms, including just having a 'personal relationship' with God and telling Him about your day.\n Babbling in gibberish (tongues) is often called a form of prayer and many Pentecostals say there are different (tongues/gibbering) styles for different prayer. \n \n What often happens, is like you, believers focus on a particular set of prayer types to the exclusion of others.\n The WofF is often taught to demand their blessings (Agreement and Faith styles of prayer) and often let babbling substitute for praise and thanks (not always though).\n They see the various passages of the bible that support 'God wants only good stuff for you' as being inclusive (as it is written) of even being their hearts desires. So, they'll demand that relatively frivelous things be given to them too. Like luxury items.\n As the intensity of their beliefs increases and the proven fact that prayer doesn't work (or, at least we can probably agree not like that) they start looking to force it to happen. Up to an including engaging in illegal and immoral, unethical practices like stealing.\n For example, you've given all of your money to the Pastor/ Church because he's promised that the faithful will get rewarded as the bible states.\n Well, you can't pay the mortgage.\n All of a sudden, while cashing a check for 20 dollars at the bank, the teller gives you back 2,000 dollars. Rather than be honest and state the number was 20.00 not 2000, you decide it's a blessing from God and keep the money.\n Or, you borrow money from your friend. No arrangements are made to pay it back in a format, just pay when you can. Next thing you know, that was a gift from God who used your friend to bless you! Cause the Lords moves in mysterious ways.\n You'll often find a lot of financial infidelity in marriages also as one spouse gives money to the church and then manipulates banking accts to ensure they're 'blessed'. \n Further more, as shown in the links, any windfall, even one that would occur no matter what your faith level or belief system will be construed as magical blessing of God. I've seen people argue that the inheritance they got from their dead parents were a gift from God...even though their unbelieving siblings got an equal share.\n \n The down side of this is that the believer who doesn't have the naturally occuring windfalls or opprotunity to get 'blessed' due to circumstantial issues will grow despondant.\n As pointed out, the theology pushes the notion that if you're not getting blessings by 'working the system' then it's your own fault for not having faith OR for having unconfessed sin. This leaves the believer wracking their brains trying to find out what they did to sin and feeling like a miserable wretch OR going to even greater lengths to 'show their faith'.\n \n It creates a loop that unless broken with a windfall to show that they harvested their seed, they eventually have a break-down.\n This can often be seen in many other cultic groups too.\n \n Their rational and logical abilities as humans is almost non-existant. It's a chief requirement it seems for one to become suckered into this. But, it isn't helped due to the cultic practices of the leadership. Thought blocking is one method to get a believer to comply.\n \n \n \n \n I know J, this thread is discussing the extremists but, if you took time to get to know them, you'd probably find them very scary.\n Not all 'Christians' are the same.\n \n And the super scary thing is, this type of 'Christian' is growing. Replacing others sects.\n It's popular and has an active evangelical push to get new converts. \n And with their 'everyone can be rich and perfectly healthy pie in the sky' message, it's MORE easily swallowed by the greedy, lazy and truely desperate.\n You show up to service. \n Listen to loud music and run and jump around like at a concert.\n You have a demagogue with a loud voice to bash all of your enemies and to praise you when you do as they command.\n You're given promises of abundant rewards (life and more abundantly) in this life as well as the next.\n You have the same pimp in front of you being an iconic example of lavish richness...never mind that the riches he lives off of come from your pockets.\n When things suck, it's the devil's fault or that of the ungodly.\n You ARE told to take back what the devil's stole from you, the rightful inheritor of God's blessings (see above, this IS the license to steal from the 'unrightious'...which is anyone you think it is.)\n \n I can go on.\n \n \n In the end, all I can see prayer doing is making people 'feel' better.\n \n \nNo, I'm saying that going to a doctor doesn't constitute a lack of faith. No where in the Bible does it say if you have faith, you can't do what's already in place for you to do to help yourself. There's just no reason there can't be both.\n\n Actually the bible is FULL of passages of people being miraculously healed via prayer and commands in God's name and NONE of people going to a 'doctor'. What is in place in the bible is Godly Healing and ONLY Godly healing. Physician...heal thyself comes to mind. \n Going to a doctor DOES constitute a lack of faith in God's promise for miraculous healing based on your faith. It shows that you don't trust in a PROMISE made by God. \n All things are possible through Faith.\n \n The problem J, is you're trying to interject reason and sense into your belief system. Muddy it down with 'Mans reasoning' as they'd say. \n \n You haven't a clue as to the mindset of the hard core believer.\n You're taking an 'I am the world' approach to this subject. \n From my point of view, prayer seems to be used by you as a zero cost, possibly works, won't hurt to try addition to your normal activities. Many are of that notion and in times of crisis, yes, even some hard core atheists will engage in it...right along side selling their souls to Satan or who ever else is listening.\n \n \n \n Note: Many phrases in my commentary are literally taken from WofF teachings.",

   " Your logic breaks down when you assume that going to the doctor is 'hedging one's bets', and going AGAINST faith. Going to the doctor is not hedging one's bets--it's simply taking part in what God has provided for us. \n\n So what you seem to be saying is that those praying for health aren't expecting miracles, they aren't expecting God to step in and do anything directly; you have to work with what's already there. Which is what I've been saying all along; most of those who pray don't expect anything miraculous to happen. \n \n However, and I don't know how many times I've had to say this, that isn't the sort of person I'm talking about here. I'm talking about the sort that does believe in miracles. The sort that believe that, though prayer, God will step in and change the order of things to make things happen in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise. For that sort of person how could going to the doctor be anything but hedging your bets? There's nothing miraculous about a doctor, he's just a guy. Jesus healed with a touch, not by making the local doctor more competant. If you want a divine miracle then you must put your trust in God, and not in your local M.D. If you don't believe in miracles, like most people, then by all means go see the doctor.\n \n \n\n If someone eats food that's growing on his garden, he's not hedging his bets. He's partaking in what God has given him. Doesn't mean he doesn't have faith when he prays for food, or that he shouldn't pray for food.\n\n If you think this is a good example then you have no idea what I'm trying to say. Does anyone actually pray for food and expect it to show up on their plate? I don't think so. \n \n \n\n Frankly, I don't understand what it is about this that is so difficult. \n\n Mostly your refusal to actually consider what I'm saying.\n \n Let me give some real examples of hedging one's bets.\n \n \"I have total faith in my wife's fidelity, but I hired a detective to follow her around anyway\"\n \"I have total faith that it will be sunny tomorrow, but I'll bring an umbrella just in case\"\n \"I have total faith that the Sox will win the series, but I've got 5 bucks on the yankees to be safe\"\n and finally\n \"I have total faith that if I pray to God he'll cure my disease, but I'm still going to see what the doctor says anyway\"\n \n You see how the bits after the comma show that the speaker does not, in fact, have total faith?",

Which is what I've been saying all along; most of those who pray don't expect anything miraculous to happen.\n\n \n Then you have a VERY black/white way of looking at this, to the point of being rather unrealistic IMO. The concept of a 'miracle' is a VERY relative term. Suffice it to say that it's sufficient for plenty of people that they believe God is at work, whether it be via medical care or some other means--e.g. a \"direct healing\" (which seems to be the only thing that qualifies for a 'miracle' to you). Even then, there's no reason that a miracle (as you define it) has to be the only thing people can have faith toward. I haven't brought the term 'miracle' into the picture--you have. Am I to assume you define miracle as something magic-like that doesn't include doctors or medical care of any kind? If so, that's not a qualification most religious people put on their requests to God.\n \n \nHowever, and I don't know how many times I've had to say this, that isn't the sort of person I'm talking about here.

The sort that believe that, though prayer, God will step in and change the order of things to make things happen in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise. \n\n \n Why do they have to be in a way that wouldn't have happened otherwise? Regardless, if you're only talking about them, you're probably talking about a VERY small number of people out there, because I don't think most people have problems with God intervening through other means he has put in place ... like medical care. If you're only talking about people who think in such an either/or way (and it seems you are) then what you're saying doesn't apply to many religious people at all. Most are content to believe that God works THROUGH doctors.\n \n \nIf you think this is a good example then you have no idea what I'm trying to say. Does anyone actually pray for food and expect it to show up on their plate? I don't think so.\n\n \n Well that's my point, basically. I don't think hardly anyone DOES 'hedge their bets' in the way you seem to think. (and that's not a weakness of faith.) At least that certainly hasn't been my experience in religion, with pretty much anyone I've ever known. I've never known anyone who wasn't completely open to God working VIA medical care.",

Baptists who gamble. Catholics who divorce...and people who go to these churches who DO sneek off and visit a doctor.\n \n \n The problem is, their numbers are growing faster than other Christian sects.\n As stated, and posted in other threads before, they style of belief is infiltrating other sects (Catholicism and generic Protastant denominations). \n \n And remember my statements on what they say when prayer doesn't work.\n It works for all who are in true covenant with God. 100% of the time. You'll be healed and showered with blessings.\n If you're not getting your own over flowing cup of such abundant gifts...it's because you don't have the God kinda faith, you have unrepentant sin. You've not sowed enough seed to harvest. You just gotta give it time and 'tweek' it. Some excuse to place the blame on the shoulders of the person not getting what's said is offered.\n \n Have you ever seen the movie 'Devils Advocate' starring Keanu Reeves?\n Note at the end of the movie how the devil will state to Keanu that he wasn't the one who led him there and all along the devil stated that Keanu shoud 'do the right thing'...but, at the time the devil said it, he had different inflictions of his voice and was actually meaning something different that his literal words. That's sort of what many of these preachers do.\n They push that you can be healed through prayer alone but...if you don't have the type of faith the big dogs have, you won't get nothing. If you neeed to go to the doctor, go on, do it. But, those with perfect faith walking in th light like he is...are fine...all the time.\n It's a caveat diclaimer to get them out of liability if something goes wrong but the implication is, you're nothing, you're a small time faker living off of the anointing of others like a parasite and God don't jive with that and neither will they for long.\n And yes, some have stated that. I've heard it with my own ears.\n \n \n Oh, and they ARE dropping like flies in the 3rd world and suffering without medical attention. \n \n \nI've been writing very closely.\n\n From my POV, it's the same thing. You've just been very flexible in your interpretations of Gods desires to include medicine. \n \n However, the biblical verses you're looking for to support your attitudes are the one where God uses an XXX to speak to what's-his-name.\n It's an oft used passage to support such attitudes 'God can use anything He wants to get his plans enacted'. It's also been used to support the notion that females can be preachers over men. It's a catch all passage. \n An attitude that God can use evil things to accomplish good things.\n \n I think the logic is faulty because what ends up happening is that people look to the evil things as answers to their prayers...and that distracts from the worship, adoration and thanksgiving to God.\n \n The question of you is,\n Why would God use the medium of doctors who have to learn from secular sources to enact His healing when the bible clearly states the opposite?\n The XXX situation is a rare passage compared to the NT's position on 'doing this in My name' and laying on of hands and having people healed by faith.\n Why would the believing Christian go to a dabbler with herbs when they are given clear instructions on what to do? WWJD?\n \n Can you biblically support your beliefs or are you just putting everything in a blender and seeing what comes out? Making assumptions on God's will?\n \n So far, I've seen your own logic. Maybe it's even something learnt from a pastor or Christian sect. 'God's all powerful and in control of all things, so everyhing is part of his plan...except when we say the devil is doing it.'\n Got anything biblical to back you up?\n \n I know I've sprinkled biblical passages in my past postings (mostly gleaned from the pimps pushing the faith-healing message...but, triple checked in the bible personally).\n \n \nWhy do you think people pray things like \"Lord, guide the doctor's hand as he performs surgery on brother so-and-so ...\"? \n\n Because they's heretics who don't read the bible and co-opt Christian concepts to apply to other situations. \n No different than crying out 'Oh God' in the throws of orgasm is a form of thanksgiving. \n Or praying to strike a gold seam as you're prospecting so you'll have enough money to open a brothel.\n \n People use prayer for all sorts of illicit and inappropriate things. Things that aren't biblically supported.\n \n The prayer is over complicated to boot.\n All that's needed to be prayed for is that 'Lord, we pray that brother so-and-so get's better in accordance to Your perfect will and sovereign desires.'\n \n The more specific you get in your prayer the more demand you're placing on God to act in accordance to your desires.\n When the surgeons hand isn't the instrument of divine healing, you're prayer really isn't being answered.\n That Jr. Mint that Kramer dropped into the open wound could be it.",

I have a better idea. Alongside accepting people believing what they want, emphasize going to the doctor. (After all, that's what many do already in parenting and so forth, even though they also believe in prayer.) That way the real problem of not going to the doctor is addressed, and people won't feel they shouldn't believe in prayer if they want to. That is, after all, the way we normally handle things like that in a country where individuality and autonomy is considered important. For instance, it's often found to be annoying and meddling to hear people say \"don't have sex before marriage because you might get an STD.\" But in fact, one can have sex and not get an STD if he or she does so with protection. Yet, just like the issue of belief in prayer, there are some out there who don't use protection and do the wrong thing. (as someone in the article did the wrong thing.) Some let their belief in prayer be a SUBSTITUTE for going to the doctor. But we don't deal with that by saying everyone shouldn't have sex before marriage since others may be influenced to do so. We stay out of peoples' business and teach them protection, so they have liberty AND are protected. In fact, that will probably be easier in regards to prayer belief since religion is a very ingrained thing in society. Teach people to go to the doctor REGARDLESS of their belief about prayer; that they can do both. And we know they can do both, because we see it all the time. It's not the complicated, really.\n \n \nSo you don't care if poor people get conned out of their money? If their belief in prayer makes them an easy target for charlatans, that's their own \"bidness\"? Ok, that's an interesting opinion.\n\n \n Again, people are free to spend their money how they want. There are chalatans in all walks of life--and many ministers who believe in prayer AREN'T charlatans. I agree with you we should discourage charletans and people following them. But that's not the same as saying we should discourage people from giving their money to ministers if they want, even if those ministers teach about belief in prayer. The ministers may also teach other things--even things you'd consider good. Your implication here that prayer-teachers = charlatans is an over-simplication.",

What we CAN conclude is that the thing that leads to people dying is when they believe in prayer as a substitute for going to doctors. The article was about someone who believed in it as a substitute for doctors. Yes, some people are going to believe in prayer. As long as religion is on this earth, that's going to happen. And religion isn't going away anytime soon. It's sort of like the sex thing--people are going to have sex. Tell them they should take precautions, rather than to stop having sex.

People can do what they want and you won't judge them for it and would have the same live-or-let-live view that you probably do for other things? It seems that for you, a lack of disclaimer is the problem. And for that matter, I've already stated it should be taught with the understanding that people should be encouraged to go to doctors. See, from my standpoint, belief in prayer is getting the raw end of a double standard here. Many people are going to believe in prayer, and with numerous other things (some of them more 'deadly' than prayer, for sure) we take the approach that people can do what they want as long as they don't MISUSE it. But your argument seems to be based on the lack of a disclaimer, so as long as churches don't ignore the fact that some have found it ineffective and point it out, then you'd approach it just as tolerantly as society generally does other things that are potentially harmful? I have to assume you would, since that's the crux of your argument here. And yet, no offense, but I have my doubts about that.\n \n \nYour version of religion is, based on the arguments you present, a fairly sophisticated one. You rationalise away its ineffectuality by crediting it indirectly with all the successes of human endeavour, like science and medicine. When you're sick, you do all the things medical science recommends and pray they're going to work - and since medical science is pretty good, you get to stay healthy and chalk up lots of safe wins to your faith. \n\n \n Well, I don't think you realise that what you're saying is MY version of religion is actually a very common one. People pray all the time that medical care will go well. And for that matter, it doesn't take credit away from medicine and doctors. It simply ALSO credits God. It's not a doctors -versus-medicine issue. It's not an either/or scenario.\n \n \nYou cross your fingers, wear your lucky shirt, knock on wood - but you still bet on the favourite and wear your seat-belt. If you'll pardon me for saying so, that's not faith. That's not believing in intercessionary prayer. That's just keeping a little Tamagotchi Jesus alive in your head for your own amusement.\n\n \n No, that's the same over-simplication that Kronos had about the situation. Prayer often isn't this thing where 'prayer is turned on so medical care is turned off.' There's really no problem in the thinking of many religious people between going to get medical care and praying. Why do you think people pray for doctors?? Heck, why do you think a good many doctors pray for their patients and for themselves that they'll do a good job? This idea that faith and medical care are juxtaposed seems to only exist in the minds of two types of people: religious nutcases like in the article AND people who don't really like prayer and religion, who argue against it, like you guys. Others don't think that way. They don't have this idea that the two are inversely proportional.\n \n You're speaking here as if you haven't read anything I've posted so far. Faith can include the idea of God using other things. And yes, it's still faith. Do you think people in the Bible prayed that they would instantly be transported from one place to the other, instead of walking? There's no evidence of that--no they walked--they believed God gave them two legs for a purpose. But your fundie-like perception of prayer belief would indicate people would pray for things like not having to walk somewhere. The idea that people shouldn't go to doctors is NOT normal. And by you assuming that someone doesn't have faith who does, you're falling prey to the same thinking as the people in the article that was posted earlier.\n \n \nIn effect, you describe your religion as one would a harmless pass-time; something any reasonable, pragmatic individual can safely dabble with, so long as he keeps his feet on the ground. You're probably right, too - but you don't get to say which is the right or wrong way to practice religion. Nobody does. So all your protests about religion being misused amount to nothing - there's no such thing.\n\n \n That's good! So oppose where people don't go to doctors, not where they pray or have faith. By condemning people has having a lack of faith, YOU'RE trying to take the position of getting to say which is the right or wrong way (or at least the correct one). You guys are the ones arguing from a more limited, intolerant position here by essentially saying 'that's not real faith.' Well, who are you to say my faith isn't real or not? heck, perhaps my faith is even GREATER, because I'm open to God working in other ways than JUST a direct instant healing that doesn't require doctors.",

   "That depends on a number of factors, such as to what extent prayer is a part of a person's message. If it's a case where the issue if prayer is the central issue, then sure, it would probably be good to share the conclusions of secular studies. And for that matter, a lot of people attest that prayer HAS had an effect,\n\n Irrelevant, for reasons repeatedly restated: every study ever made concludes that such people are seeing prayer coincide with recovery, with no causal link.\n \n \nWell I don't think it would be too difficult to come up with other examples that DON'T have disclaimers too. So since you're argument is about warnings and disclaimers, if churches were to put a disclaimer on teaching about prayer that studies found it didn't have an effect in those studies, then you're be completely open to people having belief in prayer at that point, and you won't tell them they shouldn't be doing so?\n\n I think if someone is given the facts and decides to accommodate prayer in some way into their life regardless, that's up to them. We've had a very similar discussion before: the problem is faith.\n \nInstead would approach it from the standpoint that it's the misuse that's the problem? You'd, at that point, really would view it the same way you do something like junk food or alcohol? People can do what they want and you won't judge them for it and would have the same live-or-let-live view that you probably do for other things? \n\n Yes, because it's not up to me to force decisions upon people. That's primarily why I object to religious evangelism, because it usually does everything it can to prevent the recipient making an informed decision, to effectively 'force' you to choose one way rather than another.\n \n But your argument seems to be based on the lack of a disclaimer, so as long as churches don't ignore the fact that some have found it ineffective and point it out, then you'd approach it just as tolerantly as society generally does other things that are potentially harmful? I have to assume you would, since that's the crux of your argument here. And yet, no offense, but I have my doubts about that.\n\n You shouldn't, because we've had more or less the same discussion before: the problem is faith, faith promoted as a virtue in its own right. I don't have a problem with you, and you don't seem to have a problem with religion (in the sense of an alchoholic having a problem with drink), but what I'm getting at is that it's not the case that religion and alchohol are equally subject to legislative restrictions.\n \nWell, I don't think you realise that what you're saying is MY version of religion is actually a very common one. People pray all the time that medical care will go well. And for that matter, it doesn't take credit away from medicine and doctors. It simply ALSO credits God. It's not a doctors -versus-medicine issue. It's not an either/or scenario.\n\n I know, that's why it's becoming common: like I said, it's a mental excercise in accommodating religion within the overriding context of rationality that keeps you in one piece. But it's not faith. It can spawn faith, if sown unwisely, which is why I still view it with a certain disapproval, but my primary concern is the special treatment religion gets with regards to the claims it can make and the lack of accountability for its advocates.\n \nNo, that's the same over-simplication that Kronos had about the situation. Prayer often isn't this thing where 'prayer is turned on so medical care is turned off.' There's really no problem in the thinking of many religious people between going to get medical care and praying. Why do you think people pray for doctors?? Heck, why do you think a good many doctors pray for their patients and for themselves that they'll do a good job? This idea that faith and medical care are juxtaposed seems to only exist in the minds of two types of people: religious nutcases like in the article AND people who don't really like prayer and religion, who argue against it, like you guys. Others don't think that way. They don't have this idea that the two are inversely proportional.\n\n I think I must have failed to express myself clearly: I completely understand that you accommodate both prayer and rationality. But you do that by squeezing the former into the gaps presented by the latter: you don't pray for your broken leg to get better and the gangrene to go away, you go to a doctor and pray for him to do a good job. Strike that: you go to a good doctor, and pray for him to do a good job :) \n \n You can entertain the notion that you're doing this because you know that's how god answers prayers, but that's hard to distinguish from yet more Tamagotchi button-pushing: you've tamed your faith, neutered it and made your rationality the master of it, rather than the other way around. That's not faith, it's just a mental execise in let's pretend.\n \n \nFaith can include the idea of God using other things.\n\n And really good faith only includes those things that happen to work reliably :) \n \n How is it faith if you structure your beliefs around what's proven to be effective?\n \nAnd yes, it's still faith. Do you think people in the Bible prayed that they would instantly be transported from one place to the other, instead of walking? There's no evidence of that--no they walked--they believed God gave them two legs for a purpose. But your fundie-like perception of prayer belief would indicate people would pray for things like not having to walk somewhere. \n\n Oh no, not at all - I wouldn't presume to assert that fundamentalism is consistent. Far from it. Believing that prayer could replace locomotion would be a rational conclusion of believing prayer can heal.\n \n Why should you have to go to a doctor if prayer can heal? What justification can you provide for these rules and qualifiers about exactly how prayer can and cannot help - especially when no kind of prayer, however applied, has ever been shown to influence matters positively?\n \n In short, what makes you right to say that praying for a doctor to do a good job is the right way to go about praying for healing? Answer: because going to a doctor works. It's a totally rational decision and therefore is not faith. You're seeking and finding an excuse for prayer, a way of sneaking it in without discommoding yourself. You're not believing in it.",

But, many cases (and appeals to continue) of miraculous healings with little more than laying on of hands. I can cite verse if needed.\n Saying 'a lot of people do this like I do' doesn't hack it either.\n \n The bible says what God can do and what he can't.

It seems prayer is not effective at all except as a pacifier placebo.\n \n \nSure I am. I believe God can help people get well any way he wants, including via medical care.

You can see the results of their work to know if they're successful or not. You can even learn to do it yourself.\n Doing what you're told and trusting that it's the right course of action. Kinda like what the bible pushes. That's faith.\n \n \n Now, having faith that prayer will work is faith...especially in the face of evidence that it doesn't.\n So, I'll admit that in that context, you do have faith.\n But, when it comes to going to seeing a Hindu doctor for example...you're just doing the rational thing.\n You could believe in magic ant farts and have the same results as you do from using prayer.\n \n \n As to the benefits of prayer.\n I'll go out on a limb and say the act has some psychological effect that could be seen as useful.\n Is it worth a few deaths though?\n \n \n \n \n @Peeling,\n \nprayer is safe if used correctly\n\n That is soo sig worthy.",

   "Asked before but,\n Where do you get this belief from?\n It sounds like the excuses some preachers made up that contradicts the bible. Possibly to get around their inability to heal via laying on of hands.\n\n \n That's like asking where do you get the belief people use their own feet to walk places instead of praying God would teleport them there so they won't have to use what is already there. I'm curious, why do you have this religion-can-do-no-right approach to where you always assume this sort of thing is a given in religion? Even with the numbers you've given (300 million) of people who believe this sort of thing, that's only approx. 15% or so of Christianity in general. Obviously most Christians don't necessarily think that way. And since it's the more stringent standard, you're the one who needs to tell where you get YOUR belief, not me. It's everyday normalcy for people to think in terms of the care of doctors fitting into God's overall plan. The Bible does say \"everything works together for good for them that love God and are called according to His purpose.\" There's no reason the care of doctors wouldn't fit into that picture as well. \n \n \nYou mean, the way the bible says it will happen? Like magic?\n In comparison to the bible and Christianity, many self-professed Christians don't share much in common with their only religious text describing their faith system.\n\n \n Where does the Bible say healing will only come THAT way?

You have your OWN way of 'hacking' it up, such as your apparent view that healing can only come in the instant and \"magical\" non-doctor way. You claim here regularly that Christians do that, but they way you argue against them does the same thing--you tend to cherry-pick a fundamentalist approach and judge the rest of Christianity because they don't do that.\n \n \nThe bible says what God can do and what he can't. And while you can concieve of Him using a doctor to enact His will, the appeals of Jesus contradict that belief. I think that's why we have nutters like those discussed here.\n\n \n Such as?

As I've outlined, the bible doesn't really support that belief. \n\n \n If God uses all things for good, as the Bible says, that you're wrong. The Bible does support that belief. You're the one arguing from the standpoint that there's a limit on the way(s) God might heal people.\n \n \nSee, what most people understand by faith is believing without seeing.\n But, with the use of doctors, you don't need faith. \n\n \n Then maybe you should tell that to the good many Christian doctors out there who pray they'll do well, and pray for their patients.

   "J,\n \n I ask you where you get your beliefs from because they ARE NOT reflected in the Christian bible.\n You know, THE source on what a Christian is and believes in.\n \n This has nothing to do with 'Christians can do no right' and has EVERYTHING to do with You're just making stuff up...and calling yourself a Christian.\n \n The beliefs you have about God working through doctors contradicts what the bible instructs. If the bible (God's word) says to heal through faith, prayer and verbal commands made in Christ name, then WHY do anything opposing that simply because you can stretch some vague reference to cover it???\n \n IF, you're not using the bible as the template for your belief syste,m I have to ask you, what are you using?\n \n The bible NEVER refers someone to go to a doctor, herbal dabbler or secular healer. BUT, makes numerous decrees to lay on hands, command healing in Christs name and the like.\n The bible simply doesn't back up your position to use what works and call it from God.\n As said, it says do A. It's God's word. You don't trust A. So, you do B instead and pretend it's what God wants all along.\n And you appear to get upset at those who point this oddity out.\n \n \nThen maybe you should tell that to the good many Christian doctors out there who pray they'll do well, and pray for their patients. You guys seem to have a more fundamentalist view of faith than some fundies themselves, it seems\n\n \n See, here you go again.\n You're making an illogical connection.\n \n Just because someone 'prays' to God in a manner that contradicts the teachings of the bible you assume that they're still Christian.\n It's called heresy and apostacy. \n If we're to go on self-labeling, I'm God then. So, you're prayers are to me. And why not? You get the same results. Nothing.\n What does the bible say about self-labeled Christians?\n Matthew 7:21-23\n And how many verses warn of the wolves who will come from your midst, preaching heresy and a false doctrine?\n \n \n \n Most people don't comprehend nor even read the book to begin with.\n Rather, they listen to some preacher dude, who most often is passing off a mish-mash of beliefs he either made up himself because it 'sounds good' or is regurgitating what he's heard himself.\n \n \n In the end, healing by this magic formula is the ONLY form of healing pushed in the bible.\n Anything else and you're simply extrapolating or making up from whole cloth.\n \n And no, I'm not hacking up the bible. (other than showing contradictions)\n You just don't know much about it or want to take the risk is following it's instructions as presented. You'd rather play it safe and go to a doctor and say it's all part of Gods plan.\n \n \n So far, your arguement is a belief that God works through doctors because He can. The magic-only faith approach that's actually SPELLED out in the bible (the one that doesn't work) is to be ignored because ??? the bible is no longer the standard to go by? \n You push the notion that millions if other people do the same thing you do, it must be the right thing to do...which is a fallacious form of debate. \n \n My overall push is that 1) Christians know little about their own faith and merely follow what their pastors push and that their practices contradict their instruction manuel (the bible). 2) That there is a resurgence of people who are trying to follow the manuel (the 300 million and growing number) and they are proving that the big book of nonsense doesn't work and is causing harm. 3) You follow what's been proven to work because you're no dummy and you end up shoe-horning a secular system of healing into your alterable religious system because it's what everyone else is doing.\n \n I sincearly doubt you've ever tried the biblical approach to healing. To pray through faith and with the authority of Jesus Christ that you (or someone else) are healed.\n \n As for Christian doctors in particular, I'll rehash this again.\n Anyone can call themselves a Christian.\n Anyone can go to a church or pray to the Christian God.\n Just because you self-label yourself something don't mean you are.\n \n The majority of religious people are extremely secularized in our time. Most just having a thin vail of religiousocity to drape themselves in for tradition and comfort. When you stumble upon those who really believe and really have faith...they're the fanitic cultis who others lament and laugh at.\n From the FLDS to the WofFers. They're ignorant marks for con men to exploit and end up having little to show for their faith other than the ever pleasing suffering and self martyrdom.\n \n Now, let's review you're understanding of \"God uses all things for good\"\n Romans 8:28 is the passage I think you're looking for.\n \"And we know that God causes all things to work together for the good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.\"\n \n This in context (something many pushers of your creed ignore) this goes to state that it's only those whom love God, HIS followers, the ones He's called, who are the ones receiving good. No exception made for this 'ineffiable plan' where even non-believers benefit...which is what's happening with a secular doctor system.\n See? The position you're trying to take is a mere extrapolation of what the bible actually says.\n You get that when the pimps you follow start watering it down, drop by drop. To make the message of God (the bible) fit in with secular reality.\n In the end, the results are people like you and the 'majority of Chritians' who don't seem to understand what it is they're doing or believing. And argue that they're right because they say they are. Self-labeling.\n \n As I pointed out in a previous post. What happens is people go to a doctor when the practices outlined in the bible don't work (faith healing), this casts doubt on God's power, promises and belief in actual miracles and puts belief and faith into a non-God centered system. It detracts from the glory and veneration of God. Sure, you may give God credit and thanks for the end results but, is He really the one behind it?\n Eventually, you get what you see. More people going to and placing faith in a human rather than their religious belief system.\n \n One of the MOST COMMON forms of derission by these faith preachers is this: \"Why is it you can go to a doctor and believe in him but you can't believe in the God almighty? You'd much rather trust in a mere human that the unchanging, eternal truth of the holy word of God. If you only had a small part of that faith placed in Jesus, all of these things promised in this book would come to pass. *shaking bible*\" \n \n \n On a side note, my kids family doctor is a Christian.\n Swell guy. Skilled and educated at what he does. But, in other areas...a little simple.\n Youngest sons ear doctor was a Muslim (a little uneasiness for a moment when the sons name is Moses).\n A couple of Hindus and a Buhddist.\n \n It's nice to know that God (according to you) is using competing faith systems to show His might and glory.\n I mean, you say it's Jehova.\n Maybe it's really Allah.\n Or some cosmic spirit or even Vishnu or the dreaded Shiva or Kali.",
