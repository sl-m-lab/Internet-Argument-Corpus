   "Ruby Ridge occurred during the presidency of George Herbert Walker Bush in August of 1992.\n \n According to the Wall Street Journal, in an article published in 1995, the U.S. government screwed up:\n \nWhile federal officials have claimed that the violent confrontation between the Weavers and the government began when the Weavers ambushed federal marshals, the report tells a very different story. A team of six U.S. marshals, split into two groups, trespassed onto Mr. Weaver's land on Aug. 21, 1992. One of the marshals threw rocks at the Weaver's cabin to see how much noise was required to agitate the Weaver's dogs. A few minutes later, Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and 13-year-old Sammy Weaver came out of the cabin and began following their dogs. Three U.S. marshals were soon tearing through the woods.\n \n At one point, U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper \"told the others that it was ['expletive deleted'] for them to continue running and that he did not want to 'run down the trail and get shot in the back.' He urged them to take up defensive positions. The others agreed.... William Degan ... took a position behind a stump....\"\n \n As Sammy Weaver and Kevin Harris came upon the marshals, gunfire erupted. Sammy was shot in the back and killed while running away from the scene (probably by Marshal Cooper, according to the report), and Marshal Degan was killed by Mr. Harris. The jury concluded that Mr. Harris's action was legitimate self-defense; the Justice report concluded it was impossible to know who shot first.\n \n Several places in the report deal with the possibility of a government coverup. \n\n Massacre at Ruby Ridge\n \n Next year, little more than a month into the new presidency of Bill Clinton, the Waco standoff occurred.\n \n And, my quick assessment is that this is another governmental screwup, with essentially people from George Herbert Walker Bush's administration still in place to carry out policy. It looks like a looksee at the events of Ruby Ridge were not scrutinized until well after this event. \n \n I've got to say I think that Randy Koresh, which wasn't even his real name, was one helluva a creepy guy, and I think he should have been taken down, but...\n \n So now you've got the anniversary of the poster baby of the TeaBaggers, Tim McVeigh, coming up.\n \n Tim McVeigh seems to have been a totally screwed up dude, but I'd have to say he had a number of decent grudges against George H. W. Bush, but you don't take out a bunch of innocent people on that account. Jesus! Stupid!\n \n I think that Clinton handled this situation really well, in comparison with the Repubs. Too bad we didn't have our sights focused on the militia movement then. Maybe the slaughter at Oklahoma City could have been avoided.",

   "\n So now you've got the anniversary of the poster baby of the TeaBaggers, Tim McVeigh, coming up.\n\n \n Hey, just out of curiosity, how do you come to the assumption that McVeigh is some kind of idol of the tea party?\n \n I've never met, talked to, listened to, or heard of anybody in the tea party movement that said anything even hinting at that. Dude is a straight up homicidal nutcase, who decided to end the lives of innocent men, women, and children.\n \n Don't confuse that with people peacefully excercising their 1st amendment right.\n \n That's exactly the difference, too. McVeigh blew people up to get his point across. Tea Party people hold rallys, make banners, all that. Sure, it looks goofy as hell, but they're not blowing anybody up.",

   "Simone,\n \n You're correct about the blame for Ruby Ridge and Waco and Oklahoma City but what you may not know is that those names were ACTUALLY a coverup! In the woods was really President Bush, his son George W Bush (who would later purposely blow up the world trade centers), and non other than good ol' Dick Cheney. \n \n The story I got from inside sources is that the three were tired of people like the Weavers questioning the Bush's lust for oil. I won't get into the details here but lets just say there is more to this oil story than just money. So the Bush's go their best friend Cheney to go hunt these SOBs down under the cover of being US Marshals. As they approached they heard people in the woods and the Bush's and Cheney taunted them making them run away and then shooting them in the back. Now, being smart, the Bush's had extra guns on them and set up a stage to make it look like the Weaver's had guns..in reality they had none.\n \n So there you have it. The REAL story you won't read in textbooks.\n \n You really nailed it this time Simone!",

   "I challenge you to find where I share beliefs in common with JD that relate to his motivation for murder.\n\n \n You're missing the point here.\n The fact that someone shares a belief with someone who uses said belief as \"motivation\" to murder isn't really relevant. \n For instance, any number of people may share the view that they don't want anyone cheating with their spouse. Is it really relevant that they share that view with someone who murders the person who cheated with their spouse? The fact someone had that as a motivation isn't a referendum on the belief itself. You're taking an indicting stance on the Tea Party movement's views when those views are actually quite mainstream and don't involve murdering people at all. T.McVeigh was a murderer. That's the bottom line as far as he's concerned--he murdered people.\n \n \"In general, the Tea Party movement supports constitutionally limited government, balanced budgets and free markets. More specifically, the movement is anti-stimulus, anti-deficit, and anti-bailout of the financial industry. Some demonstrators have also opposed the federal government bailout of the U.S. auto industry.[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement )",
