They have nothing to say about the infanticide of abortion and only seem to get excercised about liberal politics such as claiming the war against terrorism is unchristian.

If i had to recomend a church, it would be Lutheran Missouri Synod. Also, if you are referring to christians as \"religious types\", i would say you are wrong. Instead call them theologians. Theology - the study of God. Theology and religion are not the same thing.",
