Teenagers do need someone in their life to tell them that it's okay, safe, cool, and good to be abstinent. And you're right, if they don't get it in the home, someone else needs to say it for the kids that will be reached this way. The problem is, I just don't think all that many kids are going to be reached that way. Therefore there needs to be additional education. I also haven't seen any evidence supporting the effectiveness of abstinence only education.\n \n\"But the fact of the matter is, teenagers have sex\" with adults, \"at least let them do it with condoms.\" Does this work?\n\n Again, I don't agree with the connection you have made between safe sex education and statutory rape laws\n \nWe put barriers in place with the laws that are meant to discourage the behavior, not encourage it.

I would never claim it does. We need to do the best we can to enable people to make good decisions. Sex education shouldn't be just about abstinence and birth control. It should also be about decision-making processes. But, in the end, this is also primarily a public and private health issue that is being addressed. Some kids are simply not going to be reached by the abstinence method. This is where education about birth control steps in. So that the people that are not going to choose to remain abstinent can do the best they can to protect themselves and the rest of us.\n \nYou may be right but I'm not absolutely certain. I am sure\n there are groups that tell kids to explore their sexuality too early because it is \"normal\" and \"natural.\" They also disseminate a self-fulfilling prophecy by saying I know they're going to do it so it might as well be safe.\n\n What \"groups\" exactly? I've never heard a health teacher tell their students to go explore their sexuality. Besides, if that were to happen, that's a problem with the teacher, not the idea of sex ed as whole.\n \nPeace.\n\n Ditto",

I haven't done any looking yet, but I imagine you'd run into a couple problems. One, I imagine that it'd be hard to find stats in the first place. Two, any stats found are probably not going to be too reliable. This is because, as abortion was illegal at the time, we have no way of knowing how many teen pregnancies ended this way. Also, in many instances at the time when a teenager had a child, the pregnancy and birth were kept as secret as possible by the family and the child was immeadiately put up for adoption without consideration of the mother's wishes.\n In other words, it would be nice to know and have a comparison, but I doubt this is really possible.",
