   "This isn't interesting at all. What did these magical \"light-sensitive cells\" evolve from?\n\n \n I'm confused. Are you saying photo-sensitive bacteria aren't scientifically possible? Obviously, they evolved from bacteria without the ability to sense light. The mutation that allows a bacterium to sense light catches on with a generation, and natural selection takes hold. A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light. From there, it's a fairly obvious chain of events: photosensitivity becomes more efficient.\n \n \nWhy do bats continue to rely on sonar to \"see?\" Why haven't they evolved eyes over time?\n\n \n Most bats have eyes. Aside from that, the answer to your question is, once again, a big \"Duhr...\". Echolocation is superior to vision because it works no matter how much light exists. Optical vision only functions if there's light, and low and behold, most bats feed and live in darkness.\n \n \nIn my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built.

Show me some intermediates. \"\n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n You know, these forums give me a good opportunity to teach people the basics of evo theory. That's because I have to constantly state what the theory is and what the evidence is to creationists who don't have a clue. I could tell you about horse evolution, or human evolution or eye evolution if you'd like. But since we are on the eye, let's look at that (we can save horses & humans & archeopteryx for later).\n \n Here is how Darwin originally explained eye evolution in Molluscs, complete with examples from living molluscs:\n 1) we start out with a simple pigmented eye spot\n 2) the pigmented region folds into a depression to increase the surface area\n 3) the depression becomes a hollow ball with a pinhole for a pupil, as seen in the present day nautilus; the pupil helps to focus light to make for a clearer image and it allows for vision in a specific direction\n 4) a lens and cornea develop, helping to accomodate for distance more accurately\n 5) a fully complex eye is seen in the squid & octopus with an iris to accomodate for light intensity.\n \n Each of these adaptations helps to improve vision. Note also, that each added feature comes from already existing tissue that has been reshaped. Not only that, but these stages can be seen to unfold in the embryo. Vertebrate eyes show a similar structure and embryogenesis, except that the vertebrate retina comes directly from an outpocketing of the brain, instead of a light sensitive spot on the skin, causing the unique \"inverted cup\" form of eye with a blind spot. But let's get back to Molluscs.\n \n The stages in Mollusc eye evolution become even more telling when you realize that they from a natural nested grouping in the animal kingdom. They all have the same two larvae, the trochophore larva which looks like a spinning top, and the veliger larva which has a shell and foot similar to an adult snail. There is also an evolutionary progression seen along with the various eye stages where the various nerve ganglia become more closely associated 'til they end up in one big clump in the head region to form a sophisticated gangilonic brain in octopi & squids. In other words, the evolutionary steps seen in the Mollusc eye are paralleled by other evolutionary steps in the other Mollusc systems as you go from snails to oysters to octopi & squids. \n \n I don't mean to get overly complex for a debate forum, but it is hard to explain in simple terms the extent of the evidence for evolution. I could also give you a rundown on those horses, explaining all the intermediate steps as seen by the actual fossils, spanning about a dozen different genera from the 3 & 4 toed Hyracotherium to the modern horse. But that's another topic for another day. All for now...",

In other words WRONG.\n\n \n Are you actually seriously using this as an argument against theistic evolution???\n \n No, wrong IS relative. Our eyes WORK. They function and we have better eyesight than many animals. (though there are many that have better than we do, particularly the nocturnal ones or birds that have to spot prey from high up). You might as well be arguing that there's no theism behind evolution on the basis that we don't have eyes in the BACK of our head as well so we can see behind us. Or that we don't have 4 arms instead of just 2 (Hey, more to carry things with!). We're always going to be able to think of something more optimal than we are. The fact that the photoreceptive cells are under the optical neves doesn't prove anything other than that the photoreceptive cells are under the optical neves.",

Refer to the link below for a discussion:\n \n http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&action=view&ID=2476\n \n This article, found through a simple google search, as well as articles by pro-evolution scientists, explain why serious evolutionists no longer put forward the backward retina argument. \n \n I have read, as some of you no doubt have as well, dozens of pro-evolution books and dozens of pro-creation books. My view may differ from all of you that have posted or perhaps not.\n \n The pro-evolution books state over and over that there is overwhelming evidence in support of evolution. But whenever I try to find that overwhelming evidence, it does not seem to be there. Where are all the millions of fossils that should exist in the fossil record to show evolution? I see lots of evidence of microevolution--bacteria evolving better defenses against drugs; or a type of animal gradually evolving so that it is better suited to this environment or that environment; but I see no real evidence, and if one is honest, it should be in the fossil record on a massive scale, showing one animal gradually evolving into another animal. Punctuated equilibria? Bah--that is but an excuse to cover up the lack of fossil evidence. \n \n Darwin himself said that in the years to come following him there should be a lot of fossil evidence discovered to either prove or disprove his theory. Does the lack of this evidence prove that God exists and created everything? No, it does not.\n \n On the other hand, the pro-creation books state over and over that there is no evidence for evolution and that therefore God created everything. But it does not prove that at all.\n \n I have read arguments by Richard Dawkins (evolutionist) and by Michael Behe (intelligent design biochemist) about the eye. I do not recall how many parts there are in an eye--12, 18, but there are many. Behe makes a strong point that minus any one part of the whole, the eye does not work and he asks how it could it be that for millions of years an organism would evolve parts of an eye that were useless to millions of organisms that had the parts and lived and died until finally all parts were present and connected to each other and working appropriately. I do not see how natural selection adequately addresses this. About the eye, Charles Darwin stated: \n \n \"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.\"\n \n Frankly, I find Darwin's explanation a desperate reach to explain an organ of incredible complexity. Richard Dawkin's explanation in his book is also not persuasive.\n \n Does this mean that therefore there must be a God who did it? No.\n \n Until you have as objectively as possible read many pro-evolutionary, intelligent design, and pro-creation books, you cannot really speak with knowledge about this subject. Believe it or not, if you read the literature, you will come to realize that not all evolutionists are God-hating atheists and not all creationists are Bible-thumping fundamentalists. In fact, there are people of serious intellect among the evolutionists, the intelligent design group, and the creationists. Some of these have studied all three points of view and honestly disagree in their conclusions. \n \n My point here is that you should not assume that you have it all right and the other view points have it all wrong, especially if you have not really read at length and over a period of time the arguments, evidence, and rationale put forth by all three groups. If you have only read criticisms of another group, then you have not really studied the matter. \n \n Whether it is the eye, the horse, or some other matter, all three groups have reasons for what they believe. To follow one group blindly and not study what all three have to say is your right, but if you do that, when you post you should realize that others who have read all sides of the argument, will not take seriously what you say as you will simply be showing your blind faith in evolution, intelligent design, or creationism.\n \n If there was overwhelming evidence for evolution, it would become known as the Law of Evolution, but it remains a theory. Just as the evolutionists can argue but cannot prove that macroevolution occurred, neither can the creationists prove that it was all created by a God. The evolutionists, the intelligent design group, and the creationists all agree that microevolution occurred and is occurrng--the disagreement is over macroevolution. \n \n For now, what you believe must remain a matter of faith. Whether you choose to believe that natural selection led to the present state; or that all living things show evidence of design and complexity with complex coding indicative of some kind of designer, be it God or something else; or that a supreme being created all in six days or over a period of gelogic ages; it must for now remain a matter of faith.

The design is still suboptimal for this very reason. A perfect design would have bypassed these complications and had the eye wired more directly to avoid having a blind spot in the first place. It's like having an electrician rewire your house to accomodate the addition of a new room. There may be unecessary extra lengths of wire added and rerouted to accomplish this, while there would have been a much simpler wiring pattern employed if the room were part of the original design. The new, suboptimal design may still be perfectly functional with few problems, but the evidence for rewiring is still there. \n \n Biology, in general, is full of evidence for such revamping. It's especially evident in embryology, with many unecessary twists & turns that point to an evolutionary history (3 generations of kidneys / extra Aortic arches / resorption of the tail etc...). The particular anatomy of the vertebrate eye has to do with developmental restraints, since it comes from an actual outpocketing of the developing brain, rather than a light sensitive spot on the skin. Such developmental & phylogenetic restaints are strong evidence for evolution.",
