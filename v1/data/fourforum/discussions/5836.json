A nice Jewish girl dating a goyim (non-Jew) just didn't happen with the knowledge of her parents. My wife has told me stories of her high school and early college years where she and her girl friends had several male Jewish friends who would 'beard' for them, picking them up at their homes for dates, going through parental grilling regarding family, temple, etc. and then driving them to meet their 'real' dates.",

   "That HAS to be a joke. Right?\n \n \n\"The core argument on one side is that Jewish day schools should foster the value of Jews marrying other Jews and building Jewish families, and that value should [permeate] the culture of the school, including the prom,\" Kramer said. \"The other argument - equally valid, but wildly different - is that ... a policy saying students can only bring Jewish dates to the prom oversteps the boundaries of what a school should dictate.\" \n \n \n Sounds like a white supremist tenent.\n \n \nSpeaking to The Jewish Week on the condition of anonymity, this mother added, \"Students whose parents have chosen to attend Jewish day schools expect there to be all Jewish students at social events sponsored by the school, especially when they involve dating, relationships or future relationships.\" \n \n \n Does that mean that we non-jewish have the same right to expect our schools, socials events, etc., be free from having any jews present? Hmmmmmmm.... emoticon_idea \n \n \n\"Face the facts or abdicate from them: We are the next generation of Jews and we cannot afford a diluted Judaism in times of mixed marriages and anti-Semitic sentiment all over the world,\" he wrote. \"How will we, the next generation of Jewish adults, make decisions rooted in Jewish faith without the proper guidance during high school?\" \n \n \n I believe Hitler said something much similar to this, did he not?",

I see no harm in any ethnic group attempting to adhere to such a rule.\n \n I was \"smitten\" by a Jewish girl in high school. I was a senior, she a sophomore. We dated for almost a year. When her mother and aunt realized how serious we were, they gently reminded her and broke the news to me that a marriage between us would be frowned upon and discouraged. I understood. I went off to college, she eventually married a Jewish boy, they are now divorced.\n \n We should be more concerned about stopping forced marriages of 12 year old girls in Ethiopia than about the possibility of hurting some Aryan's feelings by excluding them from a prom.
