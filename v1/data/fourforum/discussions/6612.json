A 'cap' consisting of fine gunpowder encased in a tin cap is placed on a nipple at the rear of each cylinder opening. The revolver hammer is pulled back (cocked), trigger pulled which releases the hammer to fall and crush the cap, which creates a small explosion of fire directed by the nipple to the measure of gunpowder creating a larger explosion which propels the projectile (ball).\n \n These are black powder guns, low velocity and a mess to clean after firing. Lots of websites on the history and and many, many excellent reproductions.",

   "Also, let me add that these revolvers have a built in loading lever, which helps facilitate the packing. The cylinder is completely removeable, and often people would carry several loaded cylinders at once to reload quickly in a pinch. This is demonstrated well by Eastwood in Palerider.\n \n Percussion revolvers are a whole hobby in and of themselves.",

   "Though I have no personal experience I have heard good things about the Uberti replicas. Here\n \n Uberti revolvers are fairly inexpensive. People in the US can purchase them through mail-order without any sort of ID/background check as they are considered \"antique firearms\".\n \n I would also go with a steel frame because the brass framed ones tend to \"loosen up\" after repeated firing.\n \n Just for fun, here's a picture:\n http://www.uberti.com/firearms/images/prod_1861-navy.jpg",

Those pieces were a significant part of firearms evolution, the last of the percussion revolvers and considered by many collectors the most attractive design. One reason for their rarity and associated high value was the common practice of converting them to a cartridge revolver, less expensive (then) than Colt's 'new' cartridge revolver line. You'll be amazed (and enveloped in a cloud of smoke) when you first fire yours.",
