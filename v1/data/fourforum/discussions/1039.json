   "It seems to be politically correct to be Anti-Christian (hence AC/PC).\n \n Some pagan writers have attacked Christianity's 'bloody past' especially the Crusades.*\n \n It is easy to forget two things;\n \n a) Christ's original message of peace and hope\n \n b) paganism's attacks on Christianity for it's first 300 years of existence.\n \n In general, the Roman state was tolerant of other faiths; pagan faiths. It allowed into its pantheon of gods and additional gods that other cultures would bring. You could go from one temple to another to pray to the different sets of gods. Like many modern heathens, they had no one set of beliefs, but were tolerant of all other pagans. However, into this world came a new faith. As exclusive in its claim to truth as the Jews, yet more dangerous because it accepted into its ranks anyone from any race or class or gender.\n \n The tolerant Romans could not tolerate this new faith.\n \n Christians were persecuted because of their faith. These persecutions were often state-sponsored. The crime was 'being Christian'.\n \"Yet no human effort, no princely largess nor offerings to the gods could make that infamous rumor disappear that Nero had somehow ordered the fire. Therefore, in order to abolish that rumor, Nero falsely accused and executed with the most exquisite punishments those people called Christians, who were infamous for their abominations. The originator of the name, Christ, was executed as a criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius; and though repressed, this destructive superstition erupted again, not only through Judea, which was the origin of this evil, but also through the city of Rome, to which all that is horrible and shameful floods together and is celebrated. Therefore, first those were seized who admitted their faith, and then, using the information they provided, a vast multitude were convicted, not so much for the crime of burning the city, but for hatred of the human race.\" From Tacitus as quoted at http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/tacitus.html\n \n The pagan world's cruel persecution of Christians, simple because they were Christian is generally known. Tertullian wrote in the 2nd century wrote \"If, again, it is certain that we are the most wicked of men, why do you treat us so differently from our fellows, that is, from the criminals, it being only fair that the same crime should get the same treatment? When the chares made against us are made against the others, they are permitted to make use both of their own lips and of hired pleaders to show their innocence. Christians alone are forbidden to say anything in exculpation of themselves, in defence of the truth, to help the judge of a righteous decision\" Tertullian, \"Apology\" chapter 2. He was appealing to the Roman sense of justice.\n \n But the crime of being Christian was sufficient for the state to order more deaths: \"This was the nineteenth year of the reign of Diocletian in Dystrus [March] when the feast of the Saviour's passion was near at hand, and royal edicts were published everywhere, commanding that the churches [should] be razed to the ground, the scriptures destroyed by fire, those who held positions of honor degraded, and the household servants, if they persisted in the Christian profession, be deprived of their liberty.\"\n http://patriot.net/~carey/afa/latinclub/persecution.htm\n \n \n \n \n \n *Bloody though the Crusades were it's been very PC to look on these as Christian aggression alone. This is not to deny they were vicious or even misguided, but the fact the lands the first Crusaders attacked had been Christian lands is always overlooked by PC'ers. The Holy Land, Asia Minor, North Africa had been Christian, and these were taken by force by Mohammedans.\n Therefore the Crusades weren't an 'action', they were a 're-action'.\n \n Furthermore these Mohammedan states persecuted, and continue to persecute Christians. My own parish is Antiochian Orthodox, they come from Syria and Lebanon. They know first-hand about persecution.\n In many Mohammedans nations \n a) it is still illegal to convert from Islam.\n or\n b) to build a new church\n \n Christians are persecuted in China too.\n \n Christianity is the most persecuted faith on the planet. All around the world it faces hatred.\n http://www.domini.org/openbook/",

   "Pikeman850 I am responding to your last two posts. These are ones I've never come across before. One of which said...\n \n [QUOTE=Pikeman850\n The term Christ is a generic term for saviour. Christos = saviour, I think it's an exact translation, or at least fairly close. All of these deities, Mithra, Dionysius, Osiris, Jesus, and about 10 others, were called Christ.

Your alleging probably the greatest mix-up in the history of history... that the term Christian (derived from the Saviour) is therefore a generic term.\n \n This would work if you found that the Romans equally oppressed all 'saviour' cults at or after the time of Jesus. That is, when they issued a proscription of 'Christians' they attacked ALL 'saviour cults.' That would enable you to show that the Romans had the same understanding of the word that you do.\n \n However this simply is not what I've been able to find.\n \n \n \"The survival of a religious faith depends on a continual renewal and affirmation of its beliefs, and sometimes on adapting its rituals to changes in social conditions and attitudes. To the Romans, the observance of religious rites was a public duty rather than a private impulse. their beliefs were founded on a variety of unconnected and often inconsistent mythological traditions, many of them derived from the Greek rather than Italian models.\n Since Roman religion was not founded on some core belief which ruled out other religions, foreign religions found it relatively easy to establish themselves in the imperial capital itself. The first such foreign cult to make its way to Rome was the goddess Cybele around 204 BC.\n From Egypt the worship of Isis and Osiris came to Rome at the beginning of the first century BC Cults such as those of Cybele or Isis and Bacchus were known as the 'mysteries', having secret rituals which were only known to those initiated into the faith.\n During the reign of Julius Caesar Jews were granted freedom of worship in the city of Rome, in recognition of the Jewish forces which had helped him at Alexandria.\n Also very well known is the cult of the Persian sun god Mythras which reached Rome during the first century AD and found great following among the army.\n Traditional Roman religion was further undermined by the growing influence of Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism, which suggested the idea of there being a single god. \"\n http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/religion.html\n This seems to suggest to me that the Romans accepted all the foreign cults, including Mythras and Osiris which were very popular.\n \n There's more...\n \n \"During much of the Roman Empire, the civil government enforced religious tolerance. Within the empire, many religions flourished: the Greek and Roman Pagan religions, mystery religions, Christianity, Judaism, Mithraism, etc. It required only that its citizens perform certain routine civic duties. Unfortunately for the Christians, everyone was required to make nominal sacrifices to the Roman Gods, and sometimes to recognize the Emperor as divine. Many of the early Christians refused to meet these requirements, and so were seriously oppressed under some emperors.\"\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_tol1.htm\n \n \"In religious matters, apart from their dislike of the Druids, Roman tolerance allowed pagan, oriental and mystical worship and belief to co-exist. Just how Romanised the ordinary native population in rural areas became is a matter for debate\"\n http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/early_history/politics.shtml\n \n \"To all its subject peoples, Rome granted religious toleration as long as they also honoured Roman gods.\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/bria/bria134.html#tolerance\n \n Thus it is widely understood that the Romans were intolerant of this particular 'saviour cult' because it was exclusivist. The Christians didn't say \"This is our God, the head of all other gods\", or \"This is our God, we worship Him, but it's okay for you to worship Him in your own way, and to worship Him and other gods\". No! They said \"This is our God. He is the only God. Stop worshipping your wood and clay!\"\n \n Thus the Romans understood \"Christian\" in regards to a specific type of 'saviour cult'; that is the followers of Jesus Christ.\n \n I said I'd never come across these ideas before; simply because everyone else has understood things in common; until these people now propose something new based on an old use of the word 'Christ' or 'saviour'.\n \n It is like the word 'upset'. It once meant to set-up, that is the opposite. Or, sophisticate meant to manufacture, or lie. If you rediscovered this fact and then said that everyone using the word are using it not as they now intend, but in it's original form, you'd be wrong! The term Christian is widely understood to refer to the followers of Jesus Christ, regardless of the origins of the word.",
