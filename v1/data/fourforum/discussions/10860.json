Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?\n \n And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?\n \n Smiley",

I must warn you though that you have argued so perfectly and similarly all of the points I just argued on another thread about abortion, that some people around here might just accuse you of being me with a new handle. No problem though, I hope you have better luck than I did. emoticon_smile",

When a mature ovum leaves the ovary, it has every potential of turning into a human being. How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted, unfertilized? No; clearly, it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed.

   "Looking at the issue of abortion, relying solely on reason which is a requirement of being a Deist, it becomes obvious that abortion for convenience sake is wrong. The key argument for proponents of this act is that a woman has a right to her own body. This is a true and correct statement. All people have a right to do to their own bodies what they will. However, the fetus, or unborn baby, is a distinct individual. Even though it resides inside its mother, it is a separate entity genetically. Its DNA is completely its own, and different from its mother's DNA. From the moment of conception, it is an entirely separate genetic individual. Therefore, the argument in favor of abortion on demand, or abortion for convenience sake, that a woman has a right to do as she wishes to her own body, is not applicable to the question of abortion, since the mother's body is different from that of her baby, or fetus. It does not matter what a group of men in the form of the US Supreme Court said about the issue in Roe v. Wade. What matters to a Deist is reason, reality, and life, not opinion.\n \n Regarding abortion for medical reasons where the mother's life is in jeopardy, that should be left to the discretion of the mother, family, and doctor. It's true, the mother and the unborn baby are still two separate individuals/entities, but under these difficult circumstances, it's truly a personal decision for those directly involved. It's akin to a mother and child falling into dangerous river rapids and a family member or bystander must decide who to save. It's a terrible decision that must be made. Regardless of the decision, one life will be lost and one saved. This situation differs so fundamentally from abortion on demand, which is to kill the unborn baby for convenience, as opposed to choosing which life will be saved.\n \n Abortion in cases of rape and/or incest should be treated the same as abortion for medical reasons. It should be up to the victim of the rape or incest what she wants to do in this rare and terrible situation.\n \n The overwhelming number of abortions in the US are done for convenience. As the State of California reported, \". . .abortions for medical reasons are extremely rare ...\" http://www.os.dhhs.gov/dab/decisions/dab665.txt . Thus, if abortion on demand was made illegal, many thousands of lives would be saved every year. And life is the most valuable gift anyone can give or have.\n \n For alternative choices to abortion visit: http://www.abortion--alternatives.org/",

   "On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion.\n\n \n This is so wrong in so many ways it's mind-boggling.\n \n \nLife begins at the point of conception.\n\n \n Nope. Life began at some moment of abiogenesis, billions of years ago. Sperm and ova are both alive. They do not suddenly become alive after being dead because they meet.\n \n \nNo one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue.\n\n \n Unfortunately for this argument, nature denies this a lot of the time. Most conceptions spontaneously abort. \n \n \nWhat astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death.\n\n \n What is astounding about it? If we had been aborted, we wouldn't have known anything about it. Untold billions of conceptions have been spontaneously aborted. Do you shed tears for those, too?\n \n \nWould these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence?\n\n \n Wouldn't have mattered to me.\n \n \nAbortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions.\n\n \n This is just plain dumb. Abortion is NOT the primary means of birth control. If it is used as birth control, it's because others have failed or haven't been tried. \n \n \nThey prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created.\n\n \n You puritans are always getting your knickers in a twist because someone, somewhere, might be having a good time. What is wrong with recreational sex? Just because you don't get any doesn't mean you get to rain on other people's parades.\n \n \nWhat ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country?\n\n \n If the foetus is aborted, that IS taking responsibility for one's actions. leaving it for someone else to take care of is irresponsible.\n \n \nIs it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? \n\n \n Yeah, yeah, you Christians are just queuing up, desperate for the chance to adopt every single one of these aborted geniuses. \n \n \nNine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter!\n\n \n Spoken like a true man. \n \n \n Does the father of the child have a say in this?\n\n \n Nope. However, he does get to pay child support if he gets caught.\n \n \nAnd what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?\n\n \n Actually it's all men.\n \n \nI believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed.\n\n \n I think the same about religion. Why should you get your way and tryannise women, and I not get mine?\n \n \nWe need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.\n\n \n It's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy. It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves.",

Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.\n The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.\n \n A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts.
