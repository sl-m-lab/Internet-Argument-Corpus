   "Speaking out two years after being embroiled in a gay sex scandal, former evangelical pastor Ted Haggard said Friday his sexual identity is complex and can't be put into \"stereotypical boxes,\" but that his relationship with his wife is stronger than ever.\n \n In an interview with The Associated Press, Haggard did not rule out a return to public life or the pulpit. He spoke before he appeared before TV critics in Los Angeles to promote \"The Trials of Ted Haggard,\" an HBO documentary on Haggard's exile after his confession to \"sexual immorality\" and fall as a top evangelical leader.\n \n \"I am guilty. I am responsible,\" Haggard, 52, said Friday in a phone interview. \"I got off track, and I am deeply sorry and I repent ... I'm moving along in a positive direction.\"\n \n Haggard resigned as president of the 30 million-member National Association of Evangelicals and was fired from the 14,000-member New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colo., in November 2006 amid allegations that he paid a male prostitute for sex and used methamphetamine.\n \n In a written apology at the time, Haggard confessed to a long battle against feelings contrary to his beliefs and admitted buying the drugs but said he never used them.\n \n ....\n Asked whether he could define his sexual identity, Haggard said: \"The stereotypical boxes don't work for me. My story's got some gray areas in it. And, of course, I'm sad about that but it's the reality.\"\n \n Later Friday, in a Q&A session with reporters at a Television Critics Association meeting in Universal City, Calif., Haggard said he should have been more open with his family and his congregation earlier, calling his actions \"hypocrisy.\"\n \n Asked to expand on his attitude toward homosexuality, Haggard said, \"I believe all human beings fall short of the standards they believe in.\"\n \n He added, \"I would say the biggest change is I now know about hatred than I ever dreamed, and I know it doesn't help. And I know more about judgment and I know it doesn't help. Since my experience, I know more about the power of love and forgiveness. I know a lot more about the necessity of people not judging one another.\"\n ....\n \n The nature of Haggard's return - and his harsh words in the film for his former church - is drawing criticism. Haggard is also is to tape an \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" appearance next week for an episode scheduled to air this month, a spokesman for the show confirmed Friday.\n \n \"If you're going to come out and begin a new life, why would you choose an HBO documentary, then meet with the liberal Hollywood press?\" said H.B. London, a former counselor to Haggard and an executive at Focus on the Family in Colorado Springs. \"The fact that he's attacking the church or New Life Church, when they did so much to help him and his family, is below the belt.\"\n \n Haggard lashes out at \"the church\" in the documentary, which was produced by Alexandra Pelosi, daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He said \"the church has said go to hell\" and \"the church chose not to forgive me.\"News from The Associated Press\n \n Looks like Haggard has learned some life lessons. He has seen how some \"loving\" Christians treat gays.\n \n I would love to get a statistically random survey from \"ex-gay\" patients from religious organizations so people could see exactly what type of \"love\" is involved in tearing a person down by telling them something innate is wrong ...\n \n I hear Anita Bryant (the woman who spear-headed the venomously anti-gay measures in the 1970's) also went through a similar transition after the church and her backers abandoned her due to her \"sins\".\n One of the reasons why I think people on these boards should walk a mile in gays shoes before they pretend to \"know\" gays or speak lightly of the discrimination against gays...",

Just as when someone confesses they participated in homosexuality wouldn't get excommunicated. What you happen to be clueless of is that men or women who are placed in authority within the body of Christ are held to a higher standard than regular parishioners because they have responsibility as leaders in the church. Here are the requirements the bible lays out for overseers and deacons. Haggard definitely fell under the heading of an overseer as a Pastor and the head of the evangelical association.\n 1Ti 3:1 It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires {to do.}\n \n 1Ti 3:2 An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,\n \n 1Ti 3:3 not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.\n \n 1Ti 3:4 {He must be} one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity\n \n 1Ti 3:5 (but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),\n \n 1Ti 3:6 {and} not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.\n \n 1Ti 3:7 And he must have a good reputation with those outside {the church,} so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.\n \n 1Ti 3:8 Deacons likewise {must be} men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain,\n \n 1Ti 3:9 {but} holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.\n \n 1Ti 3:10 These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.\n \n 1Ti 3:11 Women {must} likewise {be} dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.\n \n 1Ti 3:12 Deacons must be husbands of {only} one wife, {and} good managers of {their} children and their own households.\n \n 1Ti 3:13 For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.\n \n 1Ti 3:14 I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long;\n There is no way the church could keep him on in his position once he was exposed publicly in this activity. He needed to first seek help and get his life in order before being given responsibilities again as a leader of the church.",

   "Speaking out two years after being embroiled in a gay sex scandal, former evangelical pastor Ted Haggard said Friday his sexual identity is complex and can't be put into \"stereotypical boxes,\" but that his relationship with his wife is stronger than ever.\n \n In an interview with The Associated Press, Haggard did not rule out a return to public life or the pulpit. He spoke before he appeared before TV critics in Los Angeles to promote \"The Trials of Ted Haggard,\" an HBO documentary on Haggard's exile after his confession to \"sexual immorality\" and fall as a top evangelical leader.\n \n \"I am guilty. I am responsible,\" Haggard, 52, said Friday in a phone interview. \"I got off track, and I am deeply sorry and I repent ... I'm moving along in a positive direction.\"\n \n Haggard resigned as president of the 30 million-member National Association of Evangelicals and was fired from the 14,000-member New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colo., in November 2006 amid allegations that he paid a male prostitute for sex and used methamphetamine.\n \n In a written apology at the time, Haggard confessed to a long battle against feelings contrary to his beliefs and admitted buying the drugs but said he never used them.\n \n ....\n Asked whether he could define his sexual identity, Haggard said: \"The stereotypical boxes don't work for me. My story's got some gray areas in it. And, of course, I'm sad about that but it's the reality.\"\n \n Later Friday, in a Q&A session with reporters at a Television Critics Association meeting in Universal City, Calif., Haggard said he should have been more open with his family and his congregation earlier, calling his actions \"hypocrisy.\"\n \n Asked to expand on his attitude toward homosexuality, Haggard said, \"I believe all human beings fall short of the standards they believe in.\"\n \n He added, \"I would say the biggest change is I now know about hatred than I ever dreamed, and I know it doesn't help. And I know more about judgment and I know it doesn't help. Since my experience, I know more about the power of love and forgiveness. I know a lot more about the necessity of people not judging one another.\"\n ....\n \n The nature of Haggard's return - and his harsh words in the film for his former church - is drawing criticism. Haggard is also is to tape an \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" appearance next week for an episode scheduled to air this month, a spokesman for the show confirmed Friday.\n \n \"If you're going to come out and begin a new life, why would you choose an HBO documentary, then meet with the liberal Hollywood press?\" said H.B. London, a former counselor to Haggard and an executive at Focus on the Family in Colorado Springs. \"The fact that he's attacking the church or New Life Church, when they did so much to help him and his family, is below the belt.\"\n \n Haggard lashes out at \"the church\" in the documentary, which was produced by Alexandra Pelosi, daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He said \"the church has said go to hell\" and \"the church chose not to forgive me.\"News from The Associated Press\n \n Looks like Haggard has learned some life lessons. He has seen how some \"loving\" Christians treat gays.\n \n I would love to get a statistically random survey from \"ex-gay\" patients from religious organizations so people could see exactly what type of \"love\" is involved in tearing a person down by telling them something innate is wrong ...\n \n I hear Anita Bryant (the woman who spear-headed the venomously anti-gay measures in the 1970's) also went through a similar transition after the church and her backers abandoned her due to her \"sins\".\n One of the reasons why I think people on these boards should walk a mile in gays shoes before they pretend to \"know\" gays or speak lightly of the discrimination against gays...\n\n \n So now, Haggard tells us what the church has said. Well, let's have him tell us who said it. Am I to believe that fourteen thousand members said this? Was it the new Pastor? Was the Elders? Who really said it, or is he doing what so many ministers do when they are in front of a camera, just saying things to get publicity?",

   "I came across some Haggard statements that were interestingly distinctive as compared to most who oppose gay marriage.\n \"I think the government should recognize the union between people whether they're gay or not in whatever the language they choose, whether they call it a marriage or a civil union, it's up to them. If the government is going to be in the business of recognizing people grouped together as couples, then they need to that across the board. It's a big change for me.\" \n \n \"It's not a change in my view of civil liberties. I've always believed this. It's a change in semantics. I'm saying prior to the crisis, I would defend marriage as the sacred term for the church to use for heterosexual monogamous couples. Now I've broadened that and said it's not worth having a war over the definition of a word. I believe that under civil law people should be respected. And it should be equality under the law. So either the government needs to get out of recognizing that couples are together and make everybody file the same tax returns, etc. Or they need to recognize all of them. I don't think it's wise for the government to separate based on what goes on in a person's bedroom.\"SFGate: Politics Blog : Ted Haggard is OK with gay marriage but not really\n emoticon_wow\n Yowza huh?",
