I have even found that coil-over-leaf is a good route if you add the rails to prevent axle wrap. (Of course coil-over-leaf is bad in the front and drop-shackles or re-arched springs might be better.) For the front I have even removed leaf springs from the rear of donor trucks and installed them on the front. Not much difference if you do a little searching.\n \n BTW - Haulingboat, I have noticed that you are an unknown quatity at this point. Whose chain did you pull this time?",

If my wife overheats and doesn't notice the gauge before she has reached the extreme at least I know her oil is not going to break down. \n \n For me, it is worth the extra money.
