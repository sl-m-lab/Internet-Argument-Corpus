   "Burglars fear residents more than the police Knoxville News Sentinel\n \n \nToday burglars fear the homeowner much more than the police. They know the police cannot shoot them for crimes against property and cannot chase them if they flee in a vehicle. When was the last time you heard of the Supreme Court handing down a ruling in favor of the victim and their property or more authority for the police to apprehend?\n \n Burglars are familiar with how the criminal justice system works to their benefit from slap-on-wrist judges who hand out probation five or six times to sympathetic jurors who view a burglar's drug addiction, abusive father or alcoholic mother as a valid excuse. They are also aware of jail overcrowding and budget cuts which lessens punishments for their crime.\n \n Hardly a day goes by that a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, behaviorists, criminologists, etc. aren't doing Q & A surveys in prisons and jails seeking answers to antisocial behavior.\n \n The most profound and undisputed survey I reviewed was asked of convicted burglars by an FBI behaviorist:\n \n 1. Would you B&E (break and enter) a home if you thought it occupied?\n \n A. No - 88 percent (the other 12 percent are hard-core burglars).\n \n 2. Would you B&E a home if you knew the owner was home and maybe had a gun?\n \n A. No - 95 percent (the other 5 percent are called cat burglars)\n \n 3. Would you B&E a home if you knew the owner was home and did, in fact, have a gun?\n \n A. No - 100 percent (I told you they fear the homeowner).\n \n No other survey I studied in my 27 years of law enforcement in Miami Metro Dade County did I see a 100 percent, not even for a Mother's Day holiday.\n",
