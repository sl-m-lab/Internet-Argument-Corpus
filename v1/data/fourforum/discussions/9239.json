The officer, believing that the man was armed and that trouble was imminent, left the club to warn his superior and other officers. \n \n Kelly continued his description of events: Outside, the officer came upon a group of eight men who seemed to be harassing a lone man. One of the men, Guzman, said, \"Yo, go get my gun.\" Another man, Bell, threatened the lone man. Then the group stopped harassing him and split into two groups of four, with Bell, Guzman, Benefield and another man heading to a Nissan Altima on Liverpool Street as the undercover officer followed.\n \n In quick succession, Kelly said, the following happened: The four men got into the Nissan just as an unmarked police Toyota Camry passed them. The undercover officer crossed Liverpool and stood in front of the Nissan. An unmarked police Ford minivan rounded the corner onto Liverpool. The Nissan pulled forward, struck the undercover officer, scraping his shin, and then crashed into the minivan. The Nissan backed up and then struck the minivan again. \n \n That's when the shooting started, Kelly said. \n \n Kelly and other police sources said the fourth man fled the scene.\n \n Is this excessive force or justified police action? It occured outside of a club known for narcotics, prostitution, and weapons. One man supposedly made a remark about getting a gun. An undercover officer had his shin scraped by the victim's car, and a police van was also rammed twice. One officer fired 31 shots. In order to accomplish this feat, he had to reload twice. Three men were hit and one ran away. One man died, one man is critically injured (shot at least 11 times), and the other man is stable (shot 3 times). Now let's analyze this event. First of all, the efficiency of the police officers is terrible. How did they manage to shoot one person AT LEAST 11 times yet allow one suspect to escape? They are really lucky no innocent bystanders were shot. Of course, the question still remains if firing their weapons was justified in the first place. At no time did any of the officers report actually seeing a firearm. They only heard one of the men say, \"Yo, go get my gun.\" This presents a very difficult situation for a police officer. If he waits until the gun is actually brandished, he risks getting shot or, even worse, allowing a fellow officer or innocent bystander to be shot. If he acts on just what he heard, we are faced with the present predicament. Assuming the story is accurate, I feel discharging their firearms was warranted. However, I feel they were excessive in the number of rounds discharged. After firing around 50 shots, one man still escaped. This boggles the mind considering one man was shot 11times. The action taken with the vehicles could have been interpreted as threatening to the officers as well. Ultimately, this is a horrible tragedy. It will be turned into a race circus as well, because a couple of the cops were white and the victims were black. Most of the cops were of a minority race, but this will not make much of a difference to the race card players. I saw a man on TV tonight basically threatening to riot in New York if there isn't \"justice.\" Too bad justice means the cops are automatically guilty.",

   "Good point DrNo. \n The fellow driving that Nissan could easily have stood down long enough to attempt to convince the police that they were simpy playing with the guy they were harrassing and took a butt chewing by cops and went off to a wedding. He chose to attempt to intimidate the officer as they had attempted to intimidate their last victim as they had attempted to intimidate the guy in the bar by patting the imaginary weapon. \n The guys headed to a wedding were playing games in a place where the price of losing can be high.",
