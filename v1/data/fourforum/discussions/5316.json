   "\"Why are they afraid to put a black woman on the court?\" asked Bishop Harry Jackson, chairman of a group of black pastors, standing next to Majority Leader Bill Frist at a news conference outside the Capitol. Referring to Janice Rogers Brown, a California Supreme Court judge whom Bush has named to the federal appeals court, he called her \"not only a legal hero for black America, she is a legal hero for all America.\"\n\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050520/ap_on_go_co/filibuster_fight\n \n they aren't aganist her because she's black. They are aganist her because she has a history of disregarding law and she is a true activist judge. \n \n http://schumer.senate.gov/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/press_releases/PR01165.html\n http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=1748\n http://www.newswriter.us/?p=69",
