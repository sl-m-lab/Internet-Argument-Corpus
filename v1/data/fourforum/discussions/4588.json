Its part of society. It just feels more norm to see a women cry than to see a full grown man cry of something trivial.",

   "Women's TV shows that become popular feature a lot of crying it seems. Every time I see Oprah some woman is crying; same with soaps or any reality show you care to mention.\n \n Is there some evolutionary advantage to all this?\n\n \n Human society is a system, of communication. communication requires feedback. Crying is just one of many forms of feedback.\n \n Crying let's others:\n 1. Know you are in emotional distress\n 2. Compels others to comfort you (attention, pain alleviation, etc.)\n \n If my wife cries, I respond. Is it a conscious response? In part, but that's probably my rational brain rationalizing my compulsion to comfort her and stop the crying (by helping in some way).\n \n As to why some women also enjoy TV shows like this...from what I understand emotional distress is a \"high\" of sorts. Some men like it too, but I think we all know, despite PC nonsense, that men do not seem to, on average, have the same emotional range of women. Rage/anger are the man's speciality (no surprise testosterone also increases this). \n \n -Mach",

They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.\n \n There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.\n \n \n BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticon_wow",

   "I'll give you several reasons why women cry:\n \n 1.) Women's brains are geared better for communication. They have additional speech and audio receptors. They are more sensitive to and from the communication process.\n \n 2.) They have smaller frontal lobes than men, which is the part of our brain that determines and differentiates logic from emotion.\n \n 3.) Women are still a vocal minority in this country. Crying is often the only way they know how to get attention.\n \n 4.) Our society still clings to stereotypes about women that they would prefer to keep for whatever reason. Most women still like to be considered 'delicate and feminine' while wanting to appear 'equal and independent.' I forgot what my point was, but it has something to do with upholding dual responsibilities and stereotypes.\n \n 5.) Hormones. If you started shooting estrogen, you would feel some of the same intensities that they do.\n \n 6.) Stress relief. Men usually deal with it in frustration or anger. Hormone related as well.",
