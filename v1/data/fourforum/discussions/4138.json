The two terms of Reagan's presidency were largely aimed at maintaining the arms race, which bankrupted the USSR into eventual democratic reform.\n\n This is republican mythology.\n We tend to forget the things that were really bankrupting the USSR.\n Like the Afghanistan war, and it's lame trade policies.\n And the USSR broke up. Most of the Republics went into some sort of democratic reform, and Russia made it look like it was doing the same, but the trend is going the other way these days.\n http://www.culture-of-peace.info/soviet-collapse/page9.html\n \nThe Soviet Union, in contrast, never received imperialist profits to offset the counter-productive cost of military production. Throughout the post-war period, Soviet trade with socialist partners has been structured to benefit the other socialist countries. Their purpose was reasonable: to build up the economies of the other socialist countries and create a thriving world socialist economic system as an alternative to that of the capitalists. This was most marked in Soviet trade with Cuba and Vietnam, but it could be seen as well in trade with Eastern Europe which received Soviet oil at below-market prices. The CIA was well aware of this drain on the Soviet economy, and argued that it would eventually drive them bankrupt. Their contracting firm, the RAND Corporation, estimated that the Soviet Union was losing $30 billion to $50 billion a year by the beginning of the 80s.\n\n http://www.essaydepot.com/essayme/3113/index.php\n \nSome claim that United States President Ronald Reagan's escalation of the arms race between the superpowers caused the USSR to bankrupt itself and collapse. In reality, massive Soviet military spending during the 1970s had caused the USSR's economic problems. George F. Kennan, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union and father of the theory of \"containment\" of the same country, asserts that \"the suggestion that any United States administration had the power to influence decisively the course of a tremendous domestic political upheaval in another great country on another side of the globe is simply childish.\" He contends that the extreme militarization of American policy strengthened hard-liners in the Soviet Union. \"Thus the general effect of Cold War extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the Soviet Union.\" \n\n \nThat's (bolded) speculation on your part. I counter-speculate that if some appeaser or namby-pamby, weak-on-defense President had been in control, we wouldn't have forced Russia to try and keep up, thus freeing them of a tremendous drain on their economy.
