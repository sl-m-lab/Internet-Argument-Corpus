   "WARNING:Weird and a little out there-\n \n If it is stealing, then why is it called filesharing? Sharing suggest a willingness to let someone have something for free. Stealing is taking something that you were not allowed to have in the first place and also not paying for it. This makes file sharing an oxy-XXXXX. Now let's say it is music. If you down load one song by an artist and that's it, that's more of a sample to see if it is actually worth getting the album. If you down load an entire album, then that is when the stealing comes in. But with movies, you can down load an entire movie without paying for it and that would be considered stealing. If you watch the movie on HBO and record it onto a tape with your VCR (for those who still own one) you now have a free copy of that movie that you can watch over and over (until the tape gets ruined) and let your friends see it for free and this is all legal. I guess it depends on who(what) the middle is. With HBO, the movies have a contract with them to show it. On the Internet, there are many times no assigned middle man.

   "Firstly, I believe that file-sharing is legitimate given that the file-shared is not violating copyright laws. \n \n However I disagree that sharing of copyrighted materials is somehow justifiable. You are stealing the someones income. The problem lies in the nebulousness of music. For example a piece of artwork will have an initial sale value and following that the artist no longer recieves \"royalties\" when people look at it. The owner (gallery) then charges a fee (or not as the case may be) for you to look at (ie entry price to the gallery). If you were to enter the gallery without paying, would you be stealing? Would it be wrong?\n \n What if everyone downloaded music and NO-ONE (except for that first person) paid for it? What would that do to the artists in question? What would that do the music industry? How is that fair to those people (not just the musicians, but the studio technicians, etc) who put time and effort into the project?\n \n What if as a plumber, someone paid you once to do something and then made you do the same thing for all his friends without paying you again? Would you be ###### off? Damn straight you would.\n \n As far as I know, the radio companies pay extremely large fees to play certain songs on the radio (and others are released at low cost for promotional purposes) and then much like a public art gallery they simply let you listen for free.\n \n Is file-sharing stealing?

   "This is just the restatement of whether there is such a thing as intellectual property. The legal notion of intellectual property has only been around a couple hundred years, and came about simply because publishing books started to become big business and people wanted to be able to monopolize profits from any work they produced. \n \n So ultimately, copyright is simply whatever the law wants it to be. So if they say one can own only paid-for \"intellectual property\", then that is the law. But obviously laws are not always enforceable, so the law typically is balanced so the majority of the people find it reasonable and not everyone becomes a scoff-law. In the past, normal difficulties in physical reproduction restrained the ability of people to distribute other people's work, so notions like \"fair use\" could actually be utilitized with a straight face. \n \n Because traditional \"fair-use\" is no longer functional as a concept with modern consumer electronics and the internet, there is a power struggle in the legal community to redefine intellectual property and make its use more restrictive. There are even international copyright treaties in place so that you can not hide from legal prosecution from a copyright holder in another industrialized country. Borders of legal reach are now just defined by who is signatory to such a treaty.\n \n Intellectual property is just one of the machines invented during the Industrial Revolution...but it does make sense if you believe profit is the motivation of good ideas. I am not entirely convinced of that, however...but it does seem fair to reward someone who has created something new that has value, whatever the motivation.",

   "COMMUNISM & THE DEVIL WORSHIPPING COPYRIGHT LAWS \n 4/4/09 \n \n \n Yep!! You heard me right! Copyright laws are straight from the communist party and second cousin to the devil. \"How's that work?\" you say? Well when article 1, sec 8 of the constitution was written it started the largest \"bailout\" in American history. The founding fathers just wanted to protect artists and inventors from the pirates, and that was very noble of them. Now I have nothing against protecting inventors, after all they do a very large service to all mankind. So this complaint is against the arts only! \n After a couple hundred years and billions of dollars later we are still protecting the artists from what? The answer is, protecting them from competing in the business world. Plain and simple they have a free ride with the aid of the communications and entertainment industries unions, guilds, associations, and their contractors. Unions and that's what I'm talking about! The largest collection of unions in America bonded together by one kind of glue, \"copyright protection\"! It's nothing new, \"Ayn Rand\", \"Red Star over Hollywood\", \"Roy Brewer\", \"and Communists in America\", \"How Communists Seduced the American Film Industry\", and the list of evidence goes on. The proof is there to be had for anybody that wants to view it. Let's change the perception that the anti-copyright crowd is always a left wing action. A strong Christian moral right that supports less government and more self-sufficiency can replace copyright laws. Government intervention into the business world has always had some kind of repercussion. In this case the artists have found a way to live like kings off the royalties from some simple country song or just a cartoon drawing of an animal. In some cases the \"one hit wonders\" can support an entire family for several generations from their simple production. \n So what's wrong with somebody making big bucks from a one hit wonder? First of all it's \"golden calving\". When Moses came down from the mountain and saw that some people had made a golden calf and were worshipping it, he was angered. As should any man of God be! It's a shame when you see young girls swooning and even fainting in idol worship of a musician or entertainer. That's what happened when the artists were making the golden calf. The women stood around them remarking on the quality of art, and what great and talented artists they were. In these day's they would have even gotten a copyright on that calf. Copyright laws suborn IDOL WORSHIP OF GRAVEN IMAGES! Is copyright law part of the Mark of the Beast? Do we treat this kind of idolatry indirectly, going roundabout and with a backhanded ambiguity ignoring it's true nature? Is it arrogance and folly to claim copyright over God? (Mark 7: 21-22)\n GOD DESTROYED THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA FOR THEIR IDOL WORSHIP. In the mid 1800's Alabama was a prosperous thriving state. Mineral explorations found large deposits of iron ore. The state grew wealthy and Birmingham was once named the \"magic city\" because of its incredible growth and prosperity. In 1903 the people of Alabama built a 52-foot tall iron statue of the underworld God Vulcan. It was made completely of iron ore from Alabama, and is the largest statue of its kind in the world. The abomination was created to celebrate Alabama's great iron industry wealth. People didn't fall to their knees and pray to this god, but the Lord God of us all was still offended. In just a decade after this Vulcan (largest iron statue in the world) was built the enormous prosperity of Alabama disappeared completely. To this day as the statue sits on a perch overlooking Birmingham the people of Alabama remain one the poorest of all the states. A testimony that idol worship goes beyond praying and serving a false god. \"Thou shall have no other Gods before me\". Exodus 20:3, Jeremiah 25:6, Deut 6:14 Is the Vulcan the largest demigod graven image in the world? If so what a shame it is here in America! People of Alabama, God is not slack! If you don't remove this demon god from your midst our father may bring it down by shaking the ground it stands on! \n THE PARABLE OF THE SIRENS OF ULYSSES. We all know Homers story, and how Ulysses tied himself to the mast of his ship, even as some men jumped to their deaths for want of the sirens song. Those of us who took heed from such tale know there is a real life to it. Men and women drunk and drugged take their lives by the thousands every year. Many are encouraged and hypnotized to end their life with the assistance of seductive music and art. Come on now, its time to \"cheapen \"the stranglehold hold art has on us. Remember it could be your children next to commit suicide while listening to some Sicko horrible rock song! Hollywood glitter is the real life Sirens of Ulysses!\n \n AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF COPYRIGHTABLE EXPRESSIONS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A REDUCTIO AB ABSURDUM FIGURE OF SPEECH! Copyright advocates have had a thousand years to develop the perspective that there are an infinite number of copyrightable expressions. Using the word \"infinite\" almost hypnotizes people. They have cloned in the idea that we must have government protection of the arts. That art as a business could not survive without the assistance of the government. Complicated math combined with the abuse of the infinite and eternal identification leaves today's copyright lawyers unchallenged. You see THERE REALLY ISN'T 6 BILLION NAMES FOR GOD. That's just another example of word magic. Oh, if you want to start calling God names like Fred, Bill, Susie, or horse and dog then you will find 6 billion names. Call him rumplstilskin for all I care, but it's not a true name for God. If it is true then we would see some new kinds of art, we very seldom do! Now we have talking French Fries and Milkshakes because artists can't find uncontested designs. They are scrapping the bottom of the barrel of creativity. And the only thing under the bottom of the barrel is nothing. HOW MANY MELODIES ARE THERE IN THE UNIVERSE? Go to \"everything2.com\" and see one guy's answer. According to the author it almost rivals the infinite. Unfortunately he should have made it \"how many copyrightable and tuneful melodies are still uncopyrighted\"? Don't forget to factor in the annual 25 million + hits on the copyright office website (an indication of increased copyright literacy). Multiply exponentially the human population growth rate (approximately 75-80 million per year). Add any increase in Berne convention countries, etc., plus any new systems on recognizing unregistered copyrighted works, any new tech to speed up the copyright application process, and I'm sure many other variables. When it's all said and done you may not like what you see. IT MAY BE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE NEW MELODIES WITHOUT INFRINGING ON EXISTING COPYRIGHTS! The problem is mathematics, which can be applied to all things, must be demonstrable and logical to be useful. Any formula would be rife with rifts for debate. I guess that's why the U.S. Copyright Office has not responded to my request for \"how many copyrightable and tuneful melodies are left in the universe\". SO WHY IS CONGRESS PASSING LAWS WITHOUT THE STATISTCS? The Sony Bono copyright extension and all the other new laws are in contempt of science if they didn't at least try to create a mathematical summary of the number of available uncopyrighted expressions. Just how much does it cost to pay for an inquiry by a team of professionals? The answer will most assuredly be in the reductio ab absurdum, as there isn't an infinite number of expressions that can be copyrighted. I like using country music as an example. It all has pretty much the same twang and lyrics. I have not heard anything different and new from the country music industry in 30 years. The lyrics may vary a little and the names of the artists are different, but country is still just country. You may say the same of rap music or heavy metal, etc. and contrary to what the industry experts say \"You Are Right\"! We may never in this lifetime prove or disprove how many expressions of any one category can be used for copyright, but at least we can try. Why should FEAR rule the day as it has done so often before? The ancient Catholics banned translating Latin bibles into native languages because they feared losing power. \n One sin begets another! You have let in the golden calf in America. Then the communists took the next sin by unionizing the artists and controlling free enterprise! How many times can they remake King Kong before people stop paying to see it? The answer is forever, as long as the unions make sure it's the only new release at the cinema. The consequences are we are still living in the dark ages of art. The day the government gets out of the copyright protection business is the day we will see A NEW RENAISSANCE OF ART IN AMERICA. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, thousands of new arts will arise, along with millions of new jobs and businesses. A thousand years of government control in this business has left us weak and dependant. We can prosper and probably make even more money without the government's protection. YOU SEE PEOPLE WILL PROSPER WITHOUT COPYRIGHT LAW. In fact the artists will probably make more money. They will find ways to distribute their product more effectively. Simultaneous distribution will allow them to maximize their profits. Oh. Sure a small handful of artists might get lost in the shuffle. The true artists will manage by being qualified to create new art on a continuous basis. Manufacturing and distribution will replace the government's copyright protection. They will control in such a manner as to maximize distribution that will eliminate infringement. No longer will the artists of the gray zone be left out in the cold, having to resort to under the table shenanigans. LAISSEZ-FAIRE- It's only art. For once let the people run the business without the government!\n Millions of pieces of art that manufactures and distributors will not touch because it might be infringing will immediately be available. They do not want to risk the lawsuits! These gray area arts can have a high probability that is not infringing. Unleash this art into the new renaissance of a copyright free world. Open the market and utilize the manufactures, so they no longer serve the pirate industry. \n WE ARE LIVING IN THE DARK AGES OF ART. My favorite example is the theatre industry. The theatre industry services have not changed much in the last 100 years. We have the same old dusty dark box seating. Soft drinks that have that chemically treated taste, and popcorn with the \"other\" butter. They don't have to compete because copyright laws protect them. The new movies are sent to the theatre for a month or two, then on to the cable, and finally on DVD. If we took away copyright protection for the arts the producers and corporate bosses would panic. We'd have them in the sweatbox! It's fairly obvious they would opt to release all new movies on the same day to the theatre, cable, and DVD. Let them compete for customers! Free enterprise would prevail! We are in the dark ages of movie theatres because futuristic theatres don't exist. The theatres would have to offer new amenities to attract customers. FUTURISTIC THEATRES COULD INCLUDE: dining options, theme park simulation, cubicles for those that want to talk while viewing (like an old fashioned drive in theatre, but indoors), download availability, and who know what else?\n It's time for the government to get out of the copyright bailout of artists. Say no to the AM/FM royalties!!! \n COPYRIGHT PROTECTION MADE SENSE HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO. Today we have millions of people per year accessing the copyright offices website. This mushroom cloud of copyright savvy is accelerating into a real monster. Our courts can't even handle deciphering what is and isn't infringement. The judges create an enigma of myriading formulas to work with. They have the abstraction test, the subtraction test, the patterns test, and the totality test. Is it extrinsic or intrinsic, is it contributory, and is it similar? The real question is do the judges even have a remote idea of what they are doing? Can we tolerate infringement suits because 4 notes in a melody are similar? Is the copyright mongering corporations creating derivative works solely to expand their percentage of infringement protection? Example: If your percentage of similarity is 20% then create a derivative work that is 20% different and you have a protection from infringers that is 40%. Do the judges know the difference between the eastern scale and western? It is time to take the founding fathers advice and call \"Time Out\" to copyright protection for the arts! So many people would like to see an end to copyright law. The ease of copy machines, cd, and downloads render copyright obsolete. Those that defend copyright ignore one very important factor. A world without copyright law doesn't mean artists will be without protection. People are adaptable, and in this high tech generation it's probable that we can do it better without the government. Even the judge that presided over the NAPSTER TRIAL proposed a plan to reform copyright laws. A plan that would employee manufactures and developers with public and private administrators to oversee rules and regulations, etc. Patel said, \"Our copyright laws have become a patchwork of amendments that are adopted as emergencies arise\". Honest people waste hundreds of hours searching for copyright permission only to reach a dead-end. They are more than willing to pay the royalty fee but some times can't even find out who owns the copyright. What a bunch of crock the government has given us! Then they offer to let us pay an orphan fee, money that goes to the government not the author. It's like a deadbeat dad paying off the gov instead of the kids. Look how heinous our courts have become that you can't even place a Christmas bow around a statue. In Prise de Parole vs. Guerin edituer Ltee (a Canadian case) the courts ruled that it's a MORAL violation to alter art with something as simple as a piece of ribbon. \n REVERSE ENGINEERING LAWS VIOLATE THE AXIOMATIC AGE OLD AND ACCEPTED CONCEPT \"SCIENTIFIC INVENTION, DISCOVERY, AND INNOVATION.\" Innovation ceases to exist, because we cannot study what has already been created. We become like the Eloi of the H.G. Wells movie, \"The Time Machine.\" Obey and never ask the How or Why of things. If invention and discovery are the fruits of civilization then innovation is the stem and stalk that makes the flower grow. If our copyright laws existed 10 thousand years ago we would still be talking the wheel. Our modern airplanes are not solely the product of the Wright brother's invention. \n \n \n COPYRIGHT LAWS ARE DEAD\n Like a dinosaur on the verge of extinction it is dead. The belief that there is an unlimited, infinite, bountiful supply of untapped art is now over. It has been replaced by the computer that can create an endless supply of art overnight using computer programs and robotics. Mass production and distribution can delivery billions of pieces of art globally in just a few hours to your doorstep. Only a handful of \"uncle toms\" still believe that copyright protection serves any useful purpose. As more and more art is created the number of infringement related altercations ties up our courts, creating an enormous backlog. How many times can you copyright a picture of a circle and it still have the identifiable appearance of being a circle? So a small group of people gets copyright and the rest of the world can't make a living drawing pictures of circles without making it a square and calling it a circle? How is that right for us all? The world is a lot more complicated than it was in the 6th century when King Diarmed copyrighted baby calves. \n \"IF CREATIVITY IS A FIELD, COPYRIGHT IS THE FENCE\"-John Oswald\n \n IS CREATIVITY A LEARNED BERHAVIOUR? There sure seems to be some experts that say it is developed. Another thing, is a personal one for me, I call it Universal Thought. Whether or not it's some kind of mental telepathy or communication from God it does exist. Which means many artists have been given their inspiration, sometimes subconsciously and sometimes directly from the hand of the Father? So it really isn't your art, its Gods.\" For the earth is the lords, and the fullness thereof\" 1 Corintians10: 26 Don't believe in God? There is a unity of thought and perception that is dependant upon the wholeness of life's experiences. No man is an island! (John Donne)\n Please don't let a few desperate sour pusses destroy our heritage by making free music on radio disappear. That's what will happen if the stations have to pay to play. Many will switch to talk radio or use more talk to serve as filler between songs. Those artists knew what they were getting into when they began a career in music. The free music on radio has been around for almost 100 years; let's keep it going awhile longer, for the sake of our American culture and heritage. God said, \"Give and it shall be given unto you\" Luke 6:38 Oh!, and don't forget PATTERN THINKING. Pattern thinking is defined as one who organizes ideas and things together in a way that allows them to become useful and fitting to the product or endeavor. Our minds form patterns beginning on the day we are born, and we cannot have them without other forces allowing them to interact with us. Many tattoo artist's trace from a pattern. It may look complicated but they trace it just like paint by numbers coloring book. Many other artists are using patterns memorized from some earlier study. If you really think about it most artists with the help of pattern thinking are almost all infringing to some degree. THE GOOD, BAD, AND UGLY OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. In some cases the pattern is set in gold. Did you see Clint Eastwoods movie \"Pale Rider\" 1985? It was marvelous, everybody loved it!! Yada,yada,yada. Go see it, but before you do check out Alan Ladd's movie \"Shane\" 1953, when you are finished watching both movies I think you'll understand why copyright laws need to change. Makes me wonder if some of the professional writers are using some kind of copyright loophole software to recreate old flicks and alter them just enough to circumvent the infringement bounty hunters. Copyright infringement bounty hunters! Hmmm mmm will we see the reality show someday? Now if the copyright laws were really \"tight\" we would never have had the opportunity to see Pale Rider. Can you imagine how many other artists less financially backed that can't risk production like Eastwoods have really good art they would like to distribute? Was there even one scene in Pale Rider that wasn't in some way similar to Shane? \n EXPERTS LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT COPYRIGHT LAWS SECURES FIANANCIAL REWARDS FOR AUTHORS. I challenge these experts to prove it. Validate that protections would not happen without the governments hand. These experts would also have us believe that copyright policy serves as a stimulus for creativity. Again I say, \"Where is the proof\"? It is just as plausible to say \"copyright laws stems and stymies like a brick wall against the road of imagination, blocking many artists and inventors from every finding the final destination\". The lack of clarity that infringement brings has the potential for millions of authors to be left out of the design frame. The gray area of legitimacy sparks fear and resentment against the establishment that is manipulated by the upper class of authors and artists. The privileges wealthy copyright holders have garnered afford them monopoly powers capable of batting lesser artistic creations out of the ballpark. Ruthless tactics designed to preserve old stale art and keep competition down adorn our halls of entertainment. Pray that their time is done. The end result is the established dominant authors are not really the genius they have been likened to. Perhaps they are just old tired worn out has beens, unable to compete with new art and clinging to the government protections like a dog that covets his bone collection. And the copyright office may very well cater to these wolves. I've heard that it can take up to a year to get some works copyrighted. This can be construed as a tactic to leave new artists standing in the soup line.\n I reiterate that you cannot scientifically prove the necessity of copyright law on our modern society. In all likelihood authors may find greater rewards by learning to protect their works without the government. Quality industrial services in a globalize system of accessibility will prove to be the ultimate protection, and provide greater rewards to the artists. It's like someone offering to buy 1 million dollars of your product for 5 years of use. Then he offers you an extra 125 thousand if you are willing to take 5 annual payments instead of the lump sum. Anybody that's owned a small business knows to take the 1 million, because the customer might not come back next year. You'll have a larger lump sum payout vs. the trickle down royalties that the copyright laws give you. \n Remember copyright protection is ONLY A RIGHT FOR A LIMITED TIME. The founding fathers didn't authorize eternal services. \n IN THE END BY BREAKING FREE OF THE HOLLYWOODLAND UNION CONTROLS AND GOVERNMENT INDULGENCES WE WILL UNLEASH A TORRENT OF ART, A RENNAISSANCE LIKE NEVER SEEN BEFORE ON THIS PLANET EARTH, AND THE PROFITS WILL SOAR BEYOND IMAGINATION!\n When the transition happens some people will lose out, but new jobs and businesses will be created to replace government control. We will survive and prosper like business as \n Usual. The fluency of the art will resonate without copyright, producing enormous profits for authors, yet keeping a natural check and balance by filtering out the old stale art that has outlived its usefulness.\n THE COURT JESTER IS NOW THE KING. Well it worked out for the better with Reagan, but that doesn't mean every singer, dancer, actor that has a hair to become a politician will be as good as him. We've given to much power and wealth to the artist community. Reduce their stranglehold on our country and let the real politicians get the votes. Hey! Hey! Vote for me I've got Big Muscles. Check out my biceps, just the right size for president eh! \"Oh what a wicked web we weave when a first we do deceive\". You sowed us copyright law and now the vines of government abuse will suffocate the lifeblood from our souls. Radio paying royalties will equal \"HARDCORE\" paid advertising and that will be the end of free radio. It was the free music that allowed radio to survive the television. Now we will see an era of RUSH LIMBAUG and Howard Stern SPAWNS spewing up across the country like little demons returning to their haunt 10 fold. It won't matter what side of the fence they represent just as long as it doesn't exceed the company budget. Let us keep the court jesters in their field of entertainment by eliminating copyright laws. Do you want some Bozo as your circuit court judge or would you have Judge Harvard Yale, a man learned in the science of law and politics? Copyright laws have turned the Bozos into the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me and they have developed the knack to jump careers into politics at a whim (thanks to the success of Reagan). Don't expect every song and dance act to be as good as he was! \n AS THE RECESSION ROLLS ON CONGRESS PLOTS TO DESTROY MORE JOBS AND FAMILIES. Millions of unemployed and more businesses on the chopping block of Bill # H.R. 4789. If hundreds or even thousands of radio stations cannot afford to pay the royalties, the next step will be to the poor house. Why take a chance with this bill during the great recession? Just to satisfy a small handful of old washed out artists that cannot compete any longer. They cannot cut new music so they have found the proverbial buried bone in the back yard to dig up. I say, \"Bury the old bone\", they are still young enough to learn a new trick or song. Say NO to BILL H.R. 4789\n ARE THE ATROCITES OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC EYE BY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND SLAP SUIT TACTICS? Before congress acts they must get the whole story. Look at the case of Beatty Chadwick a lawyer imprisoned 11 years for not paying child support. Just one example of the dark side, and a government in need of more safeguards. Has anybody in congress seen a categorical survey of the arts potential? If drawing a picture of a carton animal is a category then how many times can you draw a cat without becoming an infringer? It must have some resemblance of a cat, some identification pattern to fit the category. THE CASE OF DMITRY SKLYAROV, he was arrested for creating tools to read encrypted books. In the Middle Ages the Catholic Church persecuted scholars who tried to translate Latin bibles into the common languages. In some MUSLIM countries today they still permit Arabic wording only when copying the Koran. Does history repeat itself or not brothers and sisters?? Is there any difference between Islamic fascists that will put a man to death for translating the Koran in another language other than Arabic, and the government copyright laws that arrested Dmitry for translating encrypted books? \"Necessity hath no law. Feigned necessities, imaginary necessities are the greatest cozenage that men can put upon the Providence of God, and make pretenses to break known rules by\". Oliver Cromwell What copyright boils down to be simply a monopoly approved by the government. We are fighting a war in Afghanistan because some people have decided they are the property owners (copyright holders) of the KORAN and its translations, interpretations, and enforcements.\n IS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY A CONSECRETED RIGHT SOLELY FOR WEALTY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS? Doesn't our conscience owe us an equal opportunity for all? Many of today's copyright holders avail themselves to mass production strategies in lieu of simpler age-old systems. Crafters in flea markets, craft and art fairs, basements, and in the garage create art that is outside the realm of big business, and is frequently found to be infringing. It's not fair to the street corner musician and all the others that work out of a car, bus and boat to make an honest buck. Simple remakes of ancient art altered and online by clever vendors out for a quick buck, along with a plethora of other types are forcing the issue of right and wrong. Yet the only way people can have this art is through the underground and on the Internet. There is obviously a lacking of brotherly love and charity from the copyright holder. The Grand Architect bids us to the common mans struggle like a crusade and an obligation against ignorance, fanaticism, and error. Because in the end we are responsible for our own actions, which means there is a system beyond government copyright law.\n IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE TO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO GET OUT OF THE COPYRIGHT BUSINESS. The constitution has already promised that the government will limit its time of involvement into to this private sector business. Obviously, the Founding Fathers knew that there are not an infinite number of copyrightable expressions.\n \n \"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively posses as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.\n Its peculiar character, too, is that none possess the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\n That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instructions of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, Like fire expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.\n Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.\" -THOMAS JEFFERSON\n \n IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GET OUT OF THE COPYRIGHT BUSINESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN? One possible action is people could step in and replace the copyright office anyway. Create a system to help poor people get their art copyright protected by registering it online so the time stamps of the Internet could be a partial protection. Such an action would help put the courts in a backlog and tie up litigations for the next hundred years. Free enterprise copyright assistance already exists thru the attorney, but the mantra of service is lacking and they are only out for the quick buck. A discount copyright clearinghouse for the unregistered could take us to a new playing field. With the help from the FOIA freedom of information act one could copy the entire copyright offices business and figure out how to operate it better than the government does. Thank God for the \"Creative Commons\" people, they are trying to do the right thing by encouraging authors to share their works. Maybe they should be allowed to take over management of the copyright office?\n \"WHATS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS ALSO GOOD FOR THE GANDER\" or another way to say it is communists work from within the capitalist system by embracing copyright laws as a source of money and influence. Maybe they did outgrow true communism after the fall of the Soviets, but the system is still in place for their eventual take over of the U.S.\n COPYRIGHT LAWS INSTIGATE AN ABOMINATION AGAINST GOD! They allow a conglomeration of the arts to gain momentum and unity for no divine purpose. Where as individuals they may be harmless ungodly works, combined they are a monstrosity of evil that feeds solely on the human palate for passion and greed. Look at how black and white television was replaced with color, and radio with TV. We will dispose of cartoons and sitcoms, dramas and anything else as soon as we are bored and ready for something new. History repeats itself! Do not embrace copyright laws out of fear. Seek the truth in mathematics. \"The great architect of the universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician\" Sir James Jeans\n \"GIVE AND IT WILL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU\" What you put into the public domain may come back as new works in some way or fashion. \n \n Now wouldn't it be something if thousands of radio stations refused to play any more music rather than pay royalties? We could have an enormous boycott of the new law (if it gets passed). How about if everybody in the world stopped buying music completely? More likely that the stations will start using extortion contracts to promote new music. Locals bands will sign on to get their sound out and never get paid a cent in royalties until they make it to the top, then the will hire a high priced lawyer to find a sympathetic judge.\n \n Who are the Crowned Martyrs of Copyright? I would start out with Eric Eldred; can you fill in the list for me? We will probably never learn of the people that couldn't afford an attorney and opted to submit to the demands of the copyright holder's attorney. \n \n Copyright law multiplied by exponential growth factors (EGF) = AAD art at death\n EGF could include: 1. Human population growth 2. Copyright literacy 3. Mass production 4. Copyright laws. 5. Accelerated copyright evolution 6. Convergence factors 7. New technology\n \n \n \n This article is copyright free. Use it or lose it any way you want.\n \n \n \n DARN DOG CAN'T FIND ANY REAL FOOD, SO HE DUG UP THIS OLD BONE FROM OUR BACK YARD!

   "And there was me thinking it was the GW legal team...\n \n Last week the staffers at the local GW let a few of the long term Imperial Guard players have a good look at the upcoming IG codex, play around with the list and playtest the thing, (I think only the manager collects IG so they were learning from us how the list altered things...). One of the playtest games was posted on a Gaming forum in the form of a battlereport, how we came to have a copy of the list wasn't made clear and we've been swamped by Muppets* asking us to email the list to them.\n Obviously these requests have been laughed at as even thinking about it would ruin our relationship with the staffers who let us get at the list early in the first place, quite apart from any legal run-ins with GW HQ.\n If we were to copy the list to anyone it wouldn't be theft, but more akin to espionage. (Don't get any ideas about dinner suits and vodka-martinis either, having had some experience with Intel espionage usually involves being very uncomfortable in very dingy places, to put it mildly)\n I don't care much for \"Squatters Rights\" brigade which usually translates into using peoples gardens as an open cesspit. \n Though GW may be a bunch of profiteers wringing every penny they can out of us it is ultimately my choice whether to buy something.\n Which brings up the recasters, Recasts are pathetic quality which you wouldn't fork out for if you saw them on the shelf and you do feel ripped off when you find that the bargain deal on the Net may as well be thrown straight in the bin.",

   "Both stealing and copyright violations are violations of the law. However, both are also specific terms for specific violations of the law and are not synonimous.\n \n Both rely on the deeper underlying structure of the society and law about how to regulate property. This in turn will differ from state to state, and will be subject to regulation change.\n \n Well, up to a point. Copyright is regulated by the Berne convention (read a synopsis somewhere, it's quite a big deal). Still, nothing is stopping a state from withdrawing from it.\n \n As for how copyright SHOULD be regulated, that's a different question. Personally, I'd like to have it quite radically changed to the concept of a \"personal licence\" - ie, a person acquires a personal license to \"enjoy\" the copyrighted item in any form, separate from the carrier, allowing full range private conversion, portability and similar uses that do not multiply the number of persons \"enjoying\" the copyrighted item.\n \n Oh, and I also would support the shutting down of file sharing and similar - but would also demand the media stop forcing their products down our throats. Let's see if the music industry can survive better without file sharing AND being able to peddle \"small samples\" that you are forced to hear a thousand times just driving to work...",
