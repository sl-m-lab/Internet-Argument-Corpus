   "Thoughts by Zardoz.\n \n Just this week, I got to cover a TV segment on winemaking in France and how the heatwave there is helping grape production.\n \n Last night, I ran to the grocery store and noted a a sale on corn of the cob. I bought 10 ears and jumped for joy that they were huge. Unlike past purchases where they were small and pathetic.\n \n I also bought the wife some grapes.\n When she went to eat them, they were huge and yummy.\n \n \n So, if this is the short term benefit of global warming (which from many reports I've seen, it is) I want to say thanks!\n \n If it's the product of genetic engineering...thanks too.\n \n It's nice to know that I can feast before the famine that's to come in a couple of years.\n \n It's also nice to know that my neighbors can too.\n \n Considering I'll probably have to eat them then. \n At least they'll be nice and plump and last a while in the larder.\n \n Go Obese Americans! Go!\n \n :bouncer:",
