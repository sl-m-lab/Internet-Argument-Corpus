America has an obligation to learn that people with a different culture and way of life have a right to live!\n\n \n I think it is time to end the sanctions as well. They were put in place for a good reason but those reasons are long gone now. Castro is a shadow of his former self and the country is no longer a threat to us in any way. It won't be long before Castro is dead and the country is ready to start over either with another dictator or with a democracy. I think lifting sanctions would allow for us to have more influence on Cuba and try to organize a democratic movement there which would not only benefit us but also benefit the people of Cuba.",
