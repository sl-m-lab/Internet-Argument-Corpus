Such a test makes it harder for gun manufacturers to evade the law by making slight modifications in design of banned weapons.\n\n \n LMAO. \n \n The video is completely ridiculous. \n \n First, \"assault weapons\" were not invented for trench warfare. They showed up during WWII and were primarily aimed at urban combat. Second, they were specifically designed to be LESS powerful than \"standard\" weapons in order to make them more controllable and so soldiers could carry more ammo. Most assault weapons are far LESS powerful than the guns they replaced....battle rifles chambered in 7.62x54 or .308. Third, there does not exist an \"assault weapon\" that is designed to \"spray bullets from the hip\". Look at the angle of the hand grip on an assault weapon...if you were designing something to be fired from the hip, why in the world would you put the pistol grip sticking out the bottom at 90 degrees so the weapon is in your way? \n \n Finally, gun makers did not \"evade\" the assault weapon ban. The assault weapon ban was a ridiculous piece of legislative trash that focused entirely on the cosmetic aspects of the firearms. The law banned certain combinations of features. Gun dealers stopped using those features in the configurations that the law prohibited. That is not \"evading\" the law, that is what is known as \"complying with\" the law. \n \n The lesson here is that if you create a law using made up definitions (\"Assault weapon\") and then base it entirely on cosmetic features of a weapon, CONGRATULATIONS, you have just wasted a buttload of taxpayer time and money.",

Such a test makes it harder for gun manufacturers to evade the law by making slight modifications in design of banned weapons.\n\n \n Alright let me explain something to you Galileo. There was no \"evading\" what you call the assault weapon ban. Congress set forth a legally recognized description of what qualifies as an assault weapon. The gun manufacturers read this recognized description and legally changed their designs to comply with the law and not qualify as an assault weapon. This was fully legal and an example of obeying the law. To try and call the newly designed guns assault weapons would require disregarding the law as written.\n \n If you want something to complain about then complain about those in congress that wrote the definition is some an obscure way that it didn't outright ban guns entirely. Any supposed loophole the gun manufacturers used for supposedly evading the ban, the congress critters left that in there on purpose.\n \n There's also the little issue of the DC v Heller ruling going into great detail about how the Second Amendment protects the legal ownership of arms that are \"in common use at the time\" and there are few guns more common right now than the guns that would be banned under the law you're calling for. So legally you can't have the law you want because it violates the Constitution.\n \n And another thing. Give us a justifiable reason for why no person should ever be allowed to own an AR-15 or AK-47 or any of these other weapons you classify as assault weapons.",

   "What's funny is that some people are so obsessed with owning guns that were actually designed to be spray fired from the hip by soldiers in trenches!\n\n \n Peter you're just plain ignorant and have no desire for constructive debate. AR-15s were never designed for spray firing for the hip by soldiers in trenches.\n \n You see that thing on the back of the gun? That's a shoulder stock. You see those things on the top of the gun? Those are sights. The entire design was made exclusively for firing from the shoulder like any other rifle. Such features would never be incorporated if the design was meant for shooting from the hip. And I dare you to show me how a gun is supposed to spray rounds when you can only fire them one shot at a time.\n \n And even if they were I've got news for you. This is America! We have a legal right to own guns of our choosing that other countries around the world would kill to get their hands on. If you don't like that fact then that's just too bad for you.",

   "  Miller decision said this.  \n These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time. \n\n Also referred to a few times in Heller. \n \n Now note the significance of this article. http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/15358-nbc-article-modern-sporting-rifles-rise.html You guys had been snake bit, but you haven&#8217;t realize that fact just yet!\n \n When I posted it, I figured most of you antis would miss the relevance. emoticon_smile\n \n Remember that, before you guys started all of this So Called Assault Weapons stuff, they weren&#8217;t really considered cool. There were military collectors and buffs who wanted these civilian style replicas, but most people thought they only needed a bolt-action rifle. You changed all of that!!!!! You first brought attention to them, because you wanted them banned, which made people want to get them before the ban, you made the ones with the banned cosmetic features rare, and that made them valuable. After the ban lifted, people just had to get them because you guys might try to ban them again, and now they are also very cool to own! Verry, verrrrry, verrrrrrrrry cool to own! \n \n Keep up the good work antis! Keep talking! That should drive up sales a bunch. emoticon_smile",

   "The reason why gun bans are silly is simple.\n \n Criminals will get their hands on them no matter what you do. When civilians have them, it becomes drastically harder for criminals to do any thing. You go to hold up a store, with gun control, no one but the criminal has a gun. Without, you could be legally shot from any of the customers, from the store owner, at any time. The risk versus reward goes down, and so does crime.",
