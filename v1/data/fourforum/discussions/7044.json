I consider my office desk drawers private, and expect people to respect that privacy. In the case of a prisoner though, I think they deserve little physical privacy. I support the idea that prison officials and guards should be able to search a prisoners cell, work area, recreational area, and even their rectum whenever they want to. With prisoners comes the dangers of drugs, contraband, shanks, and other weapons that can harm the guards or other inmates. I think physical privacy is one thing prisoners absolutely should not have, and thankfully, they for the most part do not.",
