   "I think there's some confusion. I think I'm talking to zachvac about me taking the affirmative in a debate with him. I think you are thinking the same thing.\n \n Perhaps we could both take him on in different threads? A lot of typing (maybe) for the poor bastard, but, if we were to make similar arguments, at least he could cut and paste a bit.\n \n The reason I suggested mandatory as opposed to optional teaching of ID is that making the case for teachers having latitude to present non-curricular ideas might be easier than making the case for ID being part of the core biology curriculum.\n \n Zachvac, let me know if you're ready to debate either of those things, or if you'd rather debate Doug or both of us or whatever.\n \n Thanks,\n \n C\n\n \n \n Sorry, but I would only like to debate one person on this, that will be hard enough :)\n \n Doug, I'm sure you can find someone else to take the affirmative, but for now...\n \n To Cerebro:\n \n you said \"The teaching of Intelligent Design should be mandatory in public schools, particularly in the science classroom.\"\n \n I would like to take out the word particularly. I agree with you that in a philosophy class or religion class it is acceptable, so how about<b></b>:\n \n \"the teaching of Intelligent Design should be mandatory in the science classrooms of public schools\".\n \n This does seem a bit slanted to my side however. I would be ok with the wording:\n \n \"Intelligent Design should be part of the public schools' science curriculum, taught as a valid alternative to the Theory of Evolution\".\n \n Whichever one you want to use is fine. The one thing I think we need to do is get judges. And to the technical parts:\n \n I think we have agreed to the 5/4 post structure, you start and end.\n \n As I said above we need to find and agree on judges.\n \n In terms of a time limit, I would prefer a week, 7 days, rather than 4 days mainly because I will most likely do my writing on the weekends, and it is possible I could get 4 days where there is no weekend. I will try to get my posts up ASAP but would rather a 7-day time limit.\n \n If you can agree on the time limit, then the only thing we need to do is find judges. I'm not sure exactly how we do that, are there any volunteers?",
