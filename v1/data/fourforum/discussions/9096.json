That reeks of ignorance or self-service. Why not just kick the women of S. Dakota back to servitude status by removing their rights to own property and vote? No need to stop at limited social structure regression when you can have dark ages mentality legislated into the present. \n \n Who are these pro-choicers that support total abortion bans?
