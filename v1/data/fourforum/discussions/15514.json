   "So now we are posting predominantly from Anti-gun, Anti-Bill of Rights sites? Don't you think they MIGHT be a little biased? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Only one problem. Gun control is NOT Crime Control.\n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. National-Academies.org | Newsroom\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n Gun Control is NOT Crime Control! And even the Anti-gun CDC nor the predominantly anti-gun National Academy of Sciences can prove that is it. Our Constitution deserve proof that things will work before one starts stripping away one's Constitutional Rights. \n \n I am sure all but the Antis would agree.",

For examples of mass shootings in the United States that involved Glock pistols, please see the chart below.\n\n \n For the sake of facts, the Glock series of firearms are standard issue for many police departments, making them the primary tool for law enforcement and keeping the peace since 1982. One would be hard pressed to find a law enforcement agency that doesn't use the Glock as their standard issue firearm. Simply because murderers choose to use them is irrelevant.

The combination of these features makes semiautomatic pistols efficient killing machines.\n http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/GlockBackgrounderJuly2011.pdf\n\n \n You are approximately 76 years too late in making your claim Brady. The first semi-automatic pistol equipped with what you claim to be is a high-capacity magazine, was first sold in 1935. It was known as the Browning Hi-Power and came with a magazine capable of holding the unheard of amount of 13 rounds of ammunition, nearly double the amount of its competitors. It also possessed a greater muzzle velocity than most of its competitors at the time, making it more likely to penetrate the primitive body armor available in that era.\n \n This effectively makes the semi-automatic pistol and the high-capacity magazine older than the gun control movement itself. The current hype and scare about their use by criminals is far too late to be accurate or relevant.\n \n \nWhereas a mass shooting in Norway is an extraordinary event, it is a regular occurrence in America. Whereas 84 shooting deaths in a single day is a historic event in Norway, described by the nation's prime minister as a 'national disaster,' 84 dead is essentially the everyday toll of fatal gun violence in America. \n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence : Media\n\n \n I see you are continuing to quote outdated information. The Norwegian authorities have lowered the shooting portion of the death toll to 68 rather than 84.\n \n 84 is also not the correct number for the daily firearm-related murders that take place in the United States. Such a rate would put the yearly homicide rate at 30,660. Upon last check the reported annual firearm-related homicide rate for the United States was between 10,000 and least and 15,000 at most.",

   "Rather an interesting read. But it serves to raise more questions than it answers. If Breivik's rant was primarily against the muslim community why were his victims of non-muslim nature?\n \n A better question would concern Breivik's choice in arming himself. Why did he not deploy any bombs at the youth community on the island where they could do more damage than against a building? Why did he choose to go through the paperwork process for acquiring an inferior weapon when he previously owned a Ruger Mini-14 carbine and enough magazines to hold 300 rounds of ammunition?\n \n Further searches about the weapons used in the Norway Massacre talk about Breivik acquiring a Ruger Mini-14 rifle for deer hunting, and later purchasing 10 magazines capable of holding 30 rounds each. Certainly sufficient for such a massacre, a far superior weapons platform than the Glock series pistol he chose to acquire later on.\n \n The legitimacy of the integrity of the first article also needs to be called into question. It goes on to talk about the use of bullets designed to disintegrate inside the body and cause maximum internal damage. Exactly what ammunition is this that is capable of such a feat? And why does the article continue to repeat the 85 figure when Norwegian authorities lowered the number to 68?",

   "Norway Shooter's Mini-14: The \"Poor Man's Assault Rifle\"\n\n \n To express surprise on the speed of which you chose to jump on this issue would be false in nature. It was entirely unlikely that you wouldn't bring up this article at some point in the future.\n \n However that said the article is quite misleading. The Ruger Mini-14 is not an assault rifle, nor is it a cheap substitute for one. At one point the Mini-14 may have cost less than an AR-15, but this is no longer the truth. The Mini-14 variant used by Breivik is hardly cheap when compared to other available models. The Ruger website lists his chosen variant as costing $921, which is a price equal to or even greater than several brands of AR-15 rifles, such at those made by the DPMS company.\n \n A poor man's rifle for use in a massacre would far more likely be the Romanian brand of AK-47, which can usually be found for $450, less than half of what a new or used Mini-14 would command on the open market, and chambered in what consider to be a superior caliber. Even cheaper still is the SKS rifle, which can be found for $200 to $300 on the market.\n \n \nThe attack in Norway by Anders Behring Breivik, apparently involving a Ruger Mini-14 assault rifle, is only the most horrific of the mass shootings involving the company's products.\n \n Founded in 1949, the \"corporate motto\" of Sturm, Ruger & Co. is \"Arms Makers for Responsible Citizens.\" But Sturm, Ruger firearms are also often found in the hands of mass shooters: last year's attack at a Connecticut beer distributor, leaving eight victims dead and two wounded; the 1999 shooting at Wedgewood Baptist Church in Texas, leaving seven victims dead and seven wounded; Oregon's Thurston High School in 1998, leaving four dead and 22 wounded; the 1993 Long Island Railroad shooting, leaving six dead and 19 wounded; the 1991 Luby's massacre, leaving 23 victims dead and 20 wounded; and, a 1987 shootout at a Florida shopping center, leaving six dead, including two police officers...\n Josh Sugarmann: Norway Shooter's Mini-14: The \"Poor Man's Assault Rifle\"\n\n \n Criminal misuse of a product is hardly telling of what the product was designed for. Sudafed wasn't put on the market for the purpose of it being used in the production of methamphetamine. Simply because the Mini-14 has been found in the hands of a few notable criminals is hardly the fault of the Ruger company itself.\n \n \nToo bad Norway didnt learn from the tragedies that happened in the US involving Ruger assault rifles.\n\n \n In his application for the Mini-14 rifle Breivik listed \"deer hunting\" as a reason for ownership. His application was later approved. Apparently Norway believed the Mini-14 was a suitable hunting firearm and not a weapon of massacre.\n \n As said previously the Mini-14 is not an \"assault rifle\" and cannot legally considered as one. It doesn't fit the criteria set forth for determining and defining something as an assault rifle. It is no more an assault rifle than, as you said earlier, \"your grandfather's shotgun\" is one.",

As it has already been pointed out Breivik's selected variant of the Mini-14 commands a price of $921 as advertised on the Ruger website; hardly the most affordable of firearms. Adding further to the fact is Breivik having paid $550 for a total of 10 magazines, which breaks down to $55 for each magazine, bringing the investment up to $1,471, not counting taxes and shipping fees. This price greatly exceeds the market value of a number of Bushmaster AR-15 variants which come with only two magazines standard.\n \n There is also the fact that Breivik possessed sufficient funds to purchase 12,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, which is hardly a cheap investment by any measure.",

This firearm has no bayonet lug, nor a barrel shroud. It is not a full automatic firearm. And the Ruger mini 14 was given protected status in the original 1993 Assault Weapons Ban as something that would never be banned. \n \n And Poor man's gun? What financial class does one have to ride in, not to call a thousand bucks for a firearm something that is befitting a poor man? \n \n Lastly: \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n One of the things they studied was: Bans on specified firearms or ammunition. \n Prohibit acquisition or possession of certain categories of firearms. (e.g. Machineguns or assault weapons or ammunition (e.g. large capacity magazines.)) \n \n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. National-Academies.org | Newsroom\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n ...\n The Justice Department's interviews also showed so-called \"assault weapons\" are not a major cause of gun violence. Only about 8 percent of the inmates used one of the models covered in the now-expired assault weapons ban, signed into law by the Clinton administration in 1994.\n\n The whole anti-gun pronouncement on the Mini 14 is nothing but a strawman!\n \n Gun control is NOT crime Control. Neither is it Bomb control, which he made a horror fill effective one. But what this was, was a failure of strict gun control, yet again!\n \n So I have a question.

   "What Norway needs is some SENSIBLE gun laws; the kind they gave up after WWI and WWII.\n \n \nWashington, DC --(Ammoland.com)- &#8220;The Storting, the Norwegian Parliament, should repeal immediately that nation&#8217;s restrictive firearms control laws,&#8221;gun law expert John M. Snyder said here today.\n \n \n &#8220;The Norwegian Government should allow law-abiding citizens to acquire, carry and use the guns they need to protect themselves and their loved ones from mass murderers and other violent criminals,&#8221; he added.\n \n Snyder is the Gun Dean here in the United States, according to Human Events.\n \n Snyder noted the Norwegian gun control laws did not prevent the recent mass murder of about 70 civilians near Oslo. However, they did prevent innocent citizens from being able to stop or interrupt the slaughter.\n \n Currently, Norwegians must get a government permit to own a firearm legally and give government officials a reason for wanting the gun. Norwegian policy prevents citizens from acquiring automatic firearms, although the alleged mass murderer used a semiautomatic firearm which reportedly had been converted to a fully automatic firearm.\n \n \n &#8220;The gun laws had no effect at all on preventing the mass murder,&#8221; said Snyder. &#8220;They did prevent anyone from legally stopping or interrupting the killing. It took police an hour and a half to get to the scene of the horror, during which time the murderer picked off the innocent one by one. As The Telegraph of the United Kingdom pointed out, there was &#8216;no one able to stop him.&#8217;\n &#8220;Restrictive gun laws are the products of sheer idiocy. Hopefully, the Norwegian Prime Minister, Jens Stoltenberg, and King Harald will demonstrate they hold dear the right to life of Norwegians. Let them encourage the Storting to free Norway from this oppressive idiocy and allow Norwegians to acquire, carry and use the guns they need to defend life.&#8221;\n \n John M. Snyder\n Manager\n Telum Associates, LLC\n Arlington, VA\n \n",
