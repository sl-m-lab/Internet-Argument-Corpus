   "The Nordic Model\n \n The Nordic Model might not look that different from the Rhineland modell at first glance. Both modells are concerend with general wellfare and economic security and uses cooperation between various institutions and actors to pursue these goals. However, there are a few striking differences. \n \n Full employment\n The Nordic Model emphasizes the need for high employment figures as the number one prioritee. Through labour market polycies, the government should promote employment and fight unemployment. A broad labour market will decrese the need for interbvention by social authorities as well as promote equality and encourage equal opportunities. A broad labour market will also provide a broad tax base and decrease governmental expenditures.\n \n A strong state with an extensive public sector\n In order to promote full employment as well as provide universal wellfare to all citizens, an extensive public sector is needed. The effect of the public sector on employemnt is two-fold. First, it creates a huge amount of job opportunities, especially for women and other marginalised groups that otherwise have a problem finding jobs in the private sector. Secondly, it also correspond to labour supply by promoting the ability for both individuals in a two-person households to seek and attain employment. Childcare, schools, healthcare, care for the elderly have always to a certain extent been the taken care of at home. By relieving the household from these choirs through establishing institutional childcare, schools, hospitals and nursing homes, you free up a large portion of the labour supply.\n \n Extensive social insurance\n By employing extensive and universal social insurance, equality and solidarity is promoted. An idea is that everyone should contribute via taxes, and everyone should get \"something back\". This means that you pay income tax even if your earnings are low, and you are eligible for certain grants and free services provided by the public sector, irregardless of high your income is. This way of employing and financing universal social insurances and services is thought to promote solidarity and a willingness to support the economic and social system, irregardless of socio-economic status.\n \n Strong and responsible labour actors\n The ideal is to have relativly free labour markets, but strong institutional actors as in unions and employers organisations. This will encourage the goal of full employment as well as foster solidarity and equality between workers and employers. In order for the system to work, the actors needs to be responsible enough to pursue national interests rather than individual interests and strong enough to be able to reach their goals. A trinity, labour unions, employers organisations and the state, where the state is expected to act as a moderator should be established. A coopoerative spirit and understanding between employers and workers will lead to peaceful and stabile labour markets. It will also promote long-term thinking and investments rather than short-term individual profit maximation.\n \n Sharing the wealth\n One of the most important aspect of the Nordic Model is the ideal of sharing the wealth. Whereas the rhineland model is primarily concerned with providing a social safety net, the nordic model is primarily concerned with promoting economic equality. The public sector, the strong labour unions and full employment are ways to improve economic equality.\n \n \n Yet a bit shorter again but I think I got the gist of it. Next up, certain characteristic effects of the various models.",

   "@ Eddie:\n \n Your description is comprehensive, but here's a few of my thoughts on the Nordic Model or the Compromise of Social Democracy.\n \n Isn't the Nordic socio-economic model a variant of the Rhineland prototype? The differences being merely of emphasis, but Nordic economies are probably more collectivist and egalitarian in effect (and outlook) than is the case in the rest of Europe. \n \n Scandinavian states actively interfere with the free market in the name of the collective social will. There is extensive state regulation for the purposes of universality and equality - universal social rights, equalized incomes, and flat-rate benefits funded by progressive taxation. Nordic peoples also benefit from high levels of investment in business and human capital. \n \n The economic and social success of Nordic countries is much envied throughout Europe; but they did inherit certain advantages, among which I would list:\n \n 1). Small and socially homogenous societies:\n \n 2). A long period of social peace and absence from foreign wars:\n \n 3). No wasting of money and effort on maintaining colonial ambitions or a post-imperial posture:\n \n 4). Rich natural resources and very productive economies with many high value manufactures:\n \n Finally, and I'm on shaky ground here, but there is possibly a \"Scandinavian psychology\" that values co-operation and negotiation and which prefers to avoid social conflict by levelling out economic differences.\n \n I have not mentioned any perceived negative effects of the Nordic Model, but I will if you are interested.",

   "@ Alan\n \n I would say that there are important distinctions between The Rhineland model and The Nordic Model in terms of labour market regulations, universal wellfare and the explicit attempts to equalize the wage structure. \n \n The Rhineland Model is prone to regulate the labour markets wheras the Nordic Model emphasizes the need for strong labour and trade unions and generally shuns labour market regulations. \n \n The Rhineland Model is concerned with supplying a safety net for its citizens that is supposed to act as a last defence against poverty and missery, wheras the Nordic Model is concerned with supplying universal wellfare for all it`s citizens, irregardless of income levels or employment (this is one of the biggest reason for the higher tax pressure in Scandinavian countries). \n \n The Rhineland model has no real ambition of equalizing wages, even though certain political parties in countries with this model may advocate it. In the Nordic model, wage equalization is accepted, irregardless of political majority (even though the extent of this equalization is contested).\n \n As for your lists of advantages I would like to challange them a bit (even though I certainly think you have a point with them)\n \n \n1). Small and socially homogenous societies:\n \n\n \n This might have been true 20 years ago, but have changed dramaticly since then. Both Sweden and Denmark have been very liberal regarding taking in refugees and immigrants. Today, about 10-15% of the population in Sweden and Denmark have either been born in a another country or have had parents born in another country. Finalnd, Norway and Iceland are still quite homogenous population-vice.\n \n \n \n2). A long period of social peace and absence from foreign wars:\n\n \n This is true for Sweden, but not true for Denmark, Finland, Norway and to a lesser extent, Iceland. Denmark and Norway was invaded and occupied by Nazi-Germany and participated in the second world war. Iceland was occupied by american forces during the second world war (allthough I`m pretty certain this didn`t cause any significant economic or social problems). \n \n Finland on the other hand has suffered most of all scandinavian countries in terms of armed conflicts this century. First ravaged by a bloody and brutal civil war (failed communist revolution) and then invaded by the Soviets just prior to the second world war. And then the Finns joined the axis in their capmpaign against Soviet, where beaten back and once again invaded by soviet troops. This all led to massive military and civilian casualties and serious social and economic consequences for the Finns (up until the fall of the Iron curtain, Finland was in a constant position between a soviet satelite state and a free western democracy). \n \n \n \n3). No wasting of money and effort on maintaining colonial ambitions or a post-imperial posture:\n\n \n Hehe.. Sweden had colonies in both America and the West indies. They where eventually lost to the larger powers in Europe though and had no real effect on the Swedish economy after the 19:th century. So I guess your point still stands :)\n \n \n \n4). Rich natural resources and very productive economies with many high value manufactures:\n\n \n This is true for Sweden, Norway and to a lesser extent; Finland. However, Denmark has virtually no significant natural resources. I don`t know enough about Iceland to say anything about this though. \n \n \n \nFinally, and I'm on shaky ground here, but there is possibly a \"Scandinavian psychology\" that values co-operation and negotiation and which prefers to avoid social conflict by levelling out economic differences.\n\n \n I think you are correct in this. The nordic countries all share similiar values and culture, and avoiding social conflicts is among those values. Some would call us spineless, others cautious but I think we would prefer to be called peace-loving ;)\n \n \n \nI have not mentioned any perceived negative effects of the Nordic Model, but I will if you are interested.\n\n \n Please do. In my opening posts on each model I`ve tried to stick with the ideals of the models rather than evaluating them. But there are naturally drawbacks with every model and they are quite interesting to discuss.",

   "@ Eddie :\n \n I cannot, as I know you can, make all the necessary distinctions between Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland - and I know nothing about Iceland - so I shall just talk about Sweden as the Scandinavian norm. \n \n As the richest and most industrialized of the Scandinavian societies which reached an historic compromise between capital and labour, Sweden is envied throughout Europe as a kind of socio-economic utopia. From the time of the Saltsj&#246;baden Pact, it looks like Sweden has prospered through good times and bad, so we have to dig deep to find any negative aspects in this success story. I must emphasise these turn out to be (mostly) psychological negatives, and they are asserted by conservative critics (of course). They are concerned with the darker side of the all-embracing state which is striving to produce a contented society through physical and economic security. \n \n It is said that the social peace in Sweden has been bought at the price of a featherbed society that encourages passive collectivism rather than innovative individualism. Swedes suffer the \"psychic damage\" of having an all-mighty state that provides nearly everything and forbids almost nothing.\n \n It is said that too much economic security and centralised direction produces a kind of moral paralysis, and the ruthless redistribution of private profits for public ends facilitates social complacency. \n \n It is said that Swedish people are self-interrogating to the point of profound melancholy, and there is a propensity to depression, alcoholism, and high suicide rates. The dramas of Strindberg and the films of Ingmar Bergman seem to confirm this diagnosis. (Sibelius ought to have been born in Sweden to make the case more plausible). \n \n It is said that the authority and intitiatives of the Swedish government are accorded far too much legitimacy by an unquestioning population and this can allow, and has allowed, unfortunate experiments in social engineering. \n \n All this adds up to not very much: I can't think of any cogent reasons why Sweden should dismantle its compromise of social democracy on purely economic or political grounds. Despite their \"psychological difficulties\", Scandinavian populations live longer and enjoy healthier lives than most other people in the world.",

   "@ Alan\n \n I recognize these following critiques in your post. Feel free to correct me if you find the false or unsatisfactory:\n \n 1) A sort of paternalistic psyche where \"papa government\" is expected to take care of virtually everything and anything that is needed as well as wanted.\n \n - I think this is a good observation. A case in point would be the reaction after the tsunami in south-east asia. The government was accused of the most ridiculous things and at the time it was almost like the media and populace was blaming the Swedish government for all the dead swedes. Some would point to scandal journalism and political opportunism, but I would certainly claim that it`s just an aspect of our culture. We simply expect the government to protect us from presisly everything, nevermind the fact that the event occured on the other side of the planet... Does this stiffle individual ingenuity and entrepeneurship? Quite possible.\n \n 2) Economic security and economic redistribution creates moral paralysis and social complacency\n \n - I don`t really know how to respond. Perhaps. It`s one of those things that are hard to spot from the inside, me think.\n \n 3) Melancholy, suicides, deppression and alcoholism.\n \n - There is certainly truth to this. Allthough I would blame the long winters with virtually no sun at all. I got at least two friends who are chronicly deppressed, and neither of them are originally from sweden (one from Angola, the other from Poland) so it`s not a genetic thing. But since they grew up here and are very assimilated (completly), it could be a cultural thing.\n \n 4) The legitimacy of the government in the eyes of the public is so high that it may, and have led to attrocities carried out in the name of social engineering.\n \n - Certainly the case, even though this was particularily a problem before 1970 when the social democracy lost the aura of sacredness (?).\n \n I`ll comment on your appendix later. All in all, It hink you have made good observations",

   "Nordic Stars\n By CHRESTEN ANDERSON , DAG EKELBERG , HJORTUR J. GUDMUNDSSON , JOHNNY MUNKHAMMAR AND MARTTI NYBERG\n March 16, 2006\n All Europe needs to do to save its ailing welfare states, goes the current thinking in Brussels, is copy the \"Nordic Model.\" By this popular notion, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland have found the magic formula to marry high growth with \"social justice.\" This much misunderstood model is likely to be discussed at a European Union summit next week devoted to the economy.\n \n As economic and social analysts living and working in the Nordic countries, we feel duty-bound to warn against an uncritical embrace of the Nordic Model, which remains as ever an extreme version of the cradle-to-grave state most Western European nations already have. But the Nordics are a model in a different sense than understood in Brussels. Much of their economic success in recent years stems from the introduction of free-market reforms, not the welfare protections these countries are famous for. These reforms are the nucleus of a new, second-generation Nordic Model that ought to inspire Europe. A brief look at each country shows how it happened.\n \n Sweden\n Between 1890-1950, it had one of the highest growth rates in the world, with an average tax burden (taxes collected as a percentage of gross domestic product) of 10-20%. This period explains much of today's wealth. Of Sweden's 50 largest companies, only one was started after 1970. That's no big surprise as by 1980, the average tax burden had reached 50% (where it remains today) while the labor market became highly regulated and the size of the welfare state reached epic proportions.\n \n Sweden would pay dearly for these follies. According to the OECD, the country's per capita GDP ranking slid from fourth place in 1970 to 13th place today. Officially, unemployment hovers around 6% but once all those on sick-leave, early retirement or otherwise subsisting on state aid are included, the figure balloons to around 20%. Between 1995-2003, 11 of the EU-15 countries saw greater employment growth than Sweden.\n \n In the early 1990s, though, market reforms were enacted that improved Sweden's economic performance. The telecom market was deregulated, marginal tax rates were cut to 65% from 87% (in 1979), companies were allowed to provide private health care coverage and the pension system was reformed. As a result, between 1995 and 2004, average GDP growth per capita was 2.6%. This compares to only 0.8% between 1985 and 1994.\n \n Denmark\n Here's a similar, though less extreme, case. In 1970, in terms of GDP per head, Denmark was the world's third richest country, surpassed only by the U.S. and Switzerland. In 2003 -- after more than 30 years of expanding welfare statism -- Denmark dropped to seventh. Recent changes, such as easing firing rules, have ensured that this drop in prosperity was not more dramatic. For instance unemployment benefits are now limited to four years and the unemployed are forced to take training programs to qualify for support. Long-term unemployed -- as well as young people -- also risk losing benefits for refusing a job offer. This has reduced the jobless rate. Even more jobs could be created by cutting the top marginal income tax rate, which stands at a confiscatory 59%. \n \n Finland\n The country suffered a severe economic depression in the beginning of the 1990s, resulting in the bankruptcy of countless inefficient companies. That's when the government started cutting costs, accelerated privatization and eliminated the double-taxation of dividends. As a result, private wealth, corporate profits and tax revenues skyrocketed. This, in turn, made it possible to lower the personal income tax rates by six percentage points in all income groups, on average to 35% from 41%. These dramatic changes galvanized the Finnish economy.\n \n Norway\n It's is a special case as its incredibly generous welfare state can only be financed by enormous oil and gas revenues. And yet, even there, market-oriented ideas enjoyed a certain renaissance when the hegemony of the Labor party was broken in 1981 and a coalition of nonsocialist parties liberalized the financial markets, abolished the state's broadcasting monopoly and introduced private hospitals. When a more \"moderate\" Labor party came back to power in the early 1990s it chose not to reverse these policies. The center-right coalition, returned to power in 2001, went further, introducing competition between private and public schools. As one out of three Norwegian workers works in the public sector and revenues from oil and gas will decrease over the years, the demands of an aging population can only be met with further reforms to strengthen the private sector. But that's in doubt. The current Socialist coalition won the 2005 election promising \"less markets and more government.\"\n \n Iceland\n Today, this Arctic island is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. But until the late 1980s, Icelandic society was deeply socialistic with many state-owned enterprises, high taxes and excessive government interference in business. Starting in the early 1990s, Iceland has steadily liberalized. Corporate taxes were cut to 18% from 45% in 1991 and income taxes to 23.75% from 32.8%. During the same period, most state-owned companies were privatized and streamlined regulations.\n \n Iceland's GDP grew on average 4.3% annually between 1995-2005. The sole exception was 2002 when the economy contracted 1.3% mainly due to a decrease in investments as a result of the Icelandic Central Bank's actions to curb inflation in that year. Purchasing power, though, has grown every year since 1995 and unemployment is 1.6%.\n \n So please don't use the Nordic countries to try to validate the big-state model. It's just the opposite.\n \n Mr. Anderson is president of the Copenhagen Institute. Mr. Dag Ekelberg is deputy director of Civita in Norway. Mr. Gudmundsson is director of Veritas in Iceland. Mr. Munkhammar is director of Timbro in Sweden. Mr. Nyberg is an economist at the Finnish Business and Policy Forum EVA.",

(Sibelius ought to have been born in Sweden to make the case more plausible). \n\n Again, the lack of hard fact arguments creates the need base criticism on something else. Imagine blaming Englands woes on a post-Imperialist hangover or Frances on an atavistic wont to return the pastoral wineyard in the national conciousness.\n \nIt is said that the authority and intitiatives of the Swedish government are accorded far too much legitimacy by an unquestioning population and this can allow, and has allowed, unfortunate experiments in social engineering. \n\n That is true. We swedes are the opposite of the french that riots at the drop of a hat. We have something to learn. The problem is that we have had it so well for so long so there isn't much to get riled up over. Enter hard times and I bet we'd become like everyone else.\n \nAll this adds up to not very much: I can't think of any cogent reasons why Sweden should dismantle its compromise of social democracy on purely economic or political grounds. Despite their \"psychological difficulties\", Scandinavian populations live longer and enjoy healthier lives than most other people in the world.\n\n Indeed.",

   "As the richest and most industrialized of the Scandinavian societies which reached an historic compromise between capital and labour, Sweden is envied throughout Europe as a kind of socio-economic utopia. From the time of the Saltsj\u00f6baden Pact, it looks like Sweden has prospered through good times and bad, so we have to dig deep to find any negative aspects in this success story. I must emphasise these turn out to be (mostly) psychological negatives, and they are asserted by conservative critics (of course). They are concerned with the darker side of the all-embracing state which is striving to produce a contented society through physical and economic security.\n \n This is the paragraph from my post #4 which formed the basis of the negative generalisations about Sweden that you find inadequately supported. You make no reference to it in your talk about 'grasping after straws'. \n \n Perhaps you should have noted that Eddie had already outlined an economic and political case, and I was merely commenting on some 'psychological aspects' of the Swedish success story.",
