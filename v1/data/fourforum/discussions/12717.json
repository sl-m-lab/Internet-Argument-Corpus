   "\" ........ Like other would-be nucleotide synthesizers, Sutherland's team included phosphate in their mix, but rather than adding it to sugars and nucleobases, they started with an array of even simpler molecules that were probably also in Earth's primordial ooze.\n \n They mixed the molecules in water, heated the solution, then allowed it to evaporate, leaving behind a residue of hybrid, half-sugar, half-nucleobase molecules. To this residue they again added water, heated it, allowed it evaporate, and then irradiated it.\n \n At each stage of the cycle, the resulting molecules were more complex. At the final stage, Sutherland's team added phosphate. \"Remarkably, it transformed into the ribonucleotide!\" said Sutherland.\n \n According to Sutherland, these laboratory conditions resembled those of the life-originating \"warm little pond\" hypothesized by Charles Darwin if the pond \"evaporated, got heated, and then it rained and the sun shone.\"\n \n Such conditions are plausible, and Szostak imagined the ongoing cycle of evaporation, heating and condensation providing \"a kind of organic snow which could accumulate as a reservoir of material ready for the next step in RNA synthesis.\"\n \n Intriguingly, the precursor molecules used by Sutherland's team have been identified in interstellar dust clouds and on meteorites.\n \n \"Ribonucleotides are simply an expression of the fundamental principles of organic chemistry,\" said Sutherland. \"They're doing it unwittingly. The instructions for them to do it are inherent in the structure of the precursor materials. And if they can self-assemble so easily, perhaps they shouldn't be viewed as complicated.\" ....... \"",
