   "Some of these days 6 pro-Chechen technical experts were arrested during police raids in Istanbul. Moreover, it was detected they had technical operational instructions for explosive devices. But it is pure and simple window dressing. It's ridiculous to expect Europeans to be such XXXXXX! Turks simply try to deck themselves out in lambskin. But we know the score in Turkey. In reality anyone can observe the growth of nationalist sentiments there now. And it is no mere chance that Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf has become best seller in present-day Turkey. In the proper time wide network of cells of notorious Turkish terrorist organization \"Grey Wolves\" appeared in the Western Europe under the image of sporting and cultural centers. There were over 130 branches of the Grey Wolves in Europe. And even now this extreme-right paramilitary organization has been characterized as Europe's largest terrorist organization, because it would be na\u00efve to assume that all these cells passed into nothingness right after the liquidation of the Grey Wolves during well-known Turkish military coup in 1981. Up till now there are a lot of conspiratorial sections of the Grey Wolves in Europe that are only watching the time. And there is no secret for us that the Turkish government also employs and supports this neofascist organization. The Turkish security forces always cooperate with its militants and certainly they continue to do it now, when the Grey Wolves have become the world's top sponsors of terrorism not only in Chechnya or in such post-Soviet republics as Azerbaijan (where \"Grey Wolves\" gangs were responsible for many war crimes perpetrated in Nagorno Karabakh) but also in Europe. I think, you can imagine how Turkish intelligence service may use \"Grey Wolves\" cells, located in European countries after Turkish entry into EU...",
