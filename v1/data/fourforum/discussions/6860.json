   "Prime Minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called upon Turkish citizens, lived abroad, to escape being involved in turmoil. But when one looks more closely, it was an excellent diplomatic manoeuvre. Beside his speech was rated at ovation, the matter is that he is the one of all people who knows exactly who stands behind the current disorders in France. It's obvious Turkey does it as a penance for high profile that Paris was adopted on an issue of Turkish entry into EU. Moreover, Mr. Erdogan not only uses his statements as a smoke, but also threatens to Europe. He insinuates that Turkey has more than 4 million of own agents in Europe. And many things might happen... It is not improbable now France will be more compliant on \"Turkish subject\" of EU.",
