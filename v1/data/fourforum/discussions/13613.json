The perfect screamer to sit beside Empress Palin.\n\n \n I don't think we're ever going to see a successful radio talk show host on a presidential ticket, or in elective office in any way. As Rush has said, he couldn't take the pay cut. The top 3 or 4 in talk radio have a job that is simply a higher level than any political office. Right now - Saturday night - the Senate is in session, and talk radio hosts are home on the sofa. That's just one example - entertainers don't have public pressure like elected officials do. \n \n Palin is both loved and hated with intensity in the U.S. right now. The fact that she's an attractive woman is what causes it, both ways. It's a new thing in U.S. politics. We're used to it with men, but not with women. Let's face it, how many U.S. Senators & Representatives are ugly? Women vote, and they like good-lookin dudes. It's being made all too clear that brains and looks don't go hand in hand. \n \n Palin was in my area (Cincinnati) on Friday, signing books.

I've seen a few local people with lightning fast wits that couldn't hold a job for any length of time. \nwit isn't intelligence, I agree with this. It's hard to explain in a forum such as this but when you get down to it she lacks foresight and free thinking. Nothing really wrong with this since I think most people can't do this on such a grand scale. The first George Bush could and Clinton could. This also doesn't make you a good president without it you get manipulated too easily by party politics. \n \n Palin has basically admitted she would do a \"WWRD\" (what would reagan do\" approach. Well guess what. It isn't 1980. The principles are the same since 1776 but the solutions are different and the problems are different. \n \n \nI've seen no evidence that she was manipulated/pushed around in Alaska. \nWell how much do you know, honestly? We do know that Alaska was the best run state in 2008 which was an improvement from 2005. The thing is, she has been manipulated after the fact. All of a sudden she is for lower taxes and no handouts. Well she got a lot of handouts in Alaska as Simone is quick to point out. Her thoughts are not original and don't address the problems at hand. This is fine for a spokesman and someone doing what she is currently doing but as president you can't operate like that. \n \n I'm just saying...don't buy into the hype over her. Good spokesman for the republicans but wouldn't be a good president.",

   "Actually, the exact opposite is true. McCain didn't win because no one liked McCain. Palin probably caused a few moderates to jump ship but chances are they were more liberal than anything. More republicans probably didn't vote for McCain than moderates didn't vote because of Palin. This might be evidenced by the recent governor's races..mainly VA where moderates voted for the hardcore republican (notice I said republican and not conservative) over the democrat. \n \n\n \n I suppose that is possible. I can only speak to my own experience. When my old man, married to the super-xenophobe (not my mother), backed Obama I nearly had a heard attack! And he is not the only example.\n \n \nIf they republicans want to win again they need a 100% conservative.\n \n\n \n But what is exactly a 100% conservative?

He makes me want to do more, to better, for my country and fellow man. I have seen that impact in my neighborhood.\nMaybe so but there is no Cheerleader in Chief. When it comes to making a tough decision the man is like a deer in headlights. He also cares too much about what others think. Give W. Bush some credit here...he never cared at all but others thought of him which is actually good for a leader (better than the opposite extreme). Worst of all, he doesn't have any ability to think in the abstract. By this I mean he can't hear something and go \"does this make sense?\". Instead he hears something from someone who is \"respected\" and assumes it to be true no questions asked. Thus we get things like the stimulus bill which we can all conclude was a failure on numerous levels. \n \n But this thread is about Palin and frankly Palin is like my last point about Obama. Without that rare ability to have superior common sense you end up with a bad president. I'm sure Palin is a nice person and is smart and has some good ideas but she is not presidential material...but you know what, neither am I :)",
