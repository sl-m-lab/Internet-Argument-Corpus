   "Actually, God's creation is being killed by British Petroleum PLC and other corporations.\n \n Corporations are anti-God.\n \nJean-Michel Cousteau, one of the world's leading ocean explorers, has spoken of his \"frustration at the human species\" over the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster and called for it to become a catalyst for political, industrial and environmental change.\n \n Describing the slick as \"the worst oil accident anywhere on the planet\", the 72-year-old son of Jacques Cousteau, the pioneering underwater ecologist, said that the consequences for Man and nature would be monumental. \"The sad side of the human species is that we talk a lot and take very little action until we have a catastrophe on our hands,\" he told The Times.\n \n .... \"It's also a kick in the butt for those industries that are making a huge amount of money to invest that money, not just talk about it as they all do, in renewable energy.\"\n\n Disaster Must Be Catalyst for Change, Says Jean-Michel Cousteau | CommonDreams.org",

Earthquakes, volcanic activity, storms and other natural events are not disasters unless you add 1 thing....people. Otherwise they are part of a cycle that renews the planet. \n \n And yes these corporations are doing tremendous damage to the planet.
