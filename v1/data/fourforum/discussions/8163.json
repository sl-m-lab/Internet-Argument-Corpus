   "Over and over again al Qaeda's 'asleep' members get ominous warnings through the I-net. I think that there is no secret for you that the web is used by terrorists' organizations for coordination of its members actions. Chechen rebels' website 'Kavkaz center' spreaded next covert message for 'asleep' cells that American Harper's Magazine published again 12 Danish cartoons on Prophet Muhammad. And as a result of it we can draw only one conclusion: the wave of protest actions and disorders are awaiting USA in the nearest future, which will be organized by 'faithful Muslims' (al Qaeda members). It will happen at best. But under the unfavorable circumstances it could turn into such act of terrorism as September, 11 was. \n But FBI and CIA are occupied by 'main tasks' in Iraq and Iran! Who will think about simple citizens? How long arbitrariness in Internet will continue? Look, today they are spreading some directions but tomorrow your child could buy a 'dirty bomb' by E-Bay. We need to do something but sitting on our hands or looking for Bin Laden.",
