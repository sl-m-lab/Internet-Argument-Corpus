   "OK, I was challenged, so here's a topic that few will likely be interested in, but that has really got my goat lately.\n \n The province I live in, Alberta, is about to post a $3 Billion surplus for this year.\n \n The reason is simple - skyrocketing oil and gas revenue.\n \n Here's a link to the story, or just Google it.\n \n http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1094004180547_89413380/?hub=Canada\n \n Amazing considering that even the second most powerful province, and the center of Canada's population, Ontario, is running in the red, and that the surplus is net dollars AFTER the transfer payments to the other provinces. In fact, it's quite possible that Alberta might be the only Canadian province to be in the black this year.\n \n Given this huge \"surplus\", the province has circulated a questionaire to all of its residents (I can just imagine what that cost. emoticon_rolleyes ) asking how the money should be spent.\n \n People have been real impressed by this, and have all kinds of ideas as to how to spend this \"surplus\". \n \n Here's an idea - don't spend any more than we are now, we already spend the most per capita of any province, and CUT TAXES.   :xbanghead \n \n The survey is so left leaning, that isn't even an option anywhere in it. \n \n All of this is what is supposed to be the most conservative province in Canada. emoticon_xdonno \n \n I realize there isn't much to debate here, unless I suppose you think we should be spending the money, but like I said, this has really been chaffing my hide so I thought I'd post it.\n \n Waxy",

   "how's canada's population growth? \n \n If it's anything like the US's, you better save that cash.\n\n \n Alberta is a freight train. The economy feeds off of itself and creates an ever increasing population. The immigrants are mostly drawn from the neighboring prairie provinces (Saskatchewan (me) and Manitoba) that are consistently in population decline, as well as the Maritimes.\n \n Personally, I feel a combination of tax cuts, (eliminating user fees on healthcare for example) and piling the rest away for a rainy day in the Heritage Fund as suggested is the right way to go about it.\n \n The oil won't last forever, and when it gets scarce, so will the money and people that are driving AB's economy.\n \n Waxy",
