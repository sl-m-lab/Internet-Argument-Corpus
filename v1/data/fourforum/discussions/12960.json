   "I'm a taxpayer and I'm tired of taxpayer subsidization of the health insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry - and I'm tired of so many Americans not getting health care.\n \n I'm tired of health insurance industry CEOs getting enormous bonuses on my dime.\n \n We should go single-payer but Democrats don't have the huevos to do that. Congress should not sell out America on the public option in health care because of the $1.4 million the health insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry spend every day on lobbying senators and congresspeople.\n \n Congress was not elected to represent those bastards. They were elected to represent people, not corporations.\n \n Single payer. If not that, the public option in health care. If not that, to hell with the Democratic Party and it's time for the Green Party to become an American force.",

   "NY Senator Charles Schumer said that the public option is going through; the President wants this and it's going to happen. He was quite convincing. He said, too, that the issue now is, in what form is the public option going to take shape? Is it going to be all horse poopy? The devil is in the details. The President has given them a deadline of twenty-something days to get this done.\n \n The public option has been challenged by single payer activist, Donna Smith. It doesn't quite do the job as commonsensibly as one would hope, given the position of the medical establishment.\n \n Whatever takes place now is going to weigh heavily on President Obama's reelection bid and the position of many Democrats running for reelection in Congress.\n \n No one should have any doubts about the Democrats' position on the military industrial complex, at this point. The differences between the two parties are essentially strategy, that's all. (Do we go after the Taliban in Iraq? Iran? Pakistan? Aghanistan?)\n \n Without healthcare going through in an effective manner, and especially since they've double-crossed so many in the single payer community, I don't think they'll have anything to distinguish themselves enough from their Lunchtime In the Capitol martini pals.",
