   "Hi, Ive recently came back to 4forums.com and it's been a long time since I'm in the Navy and have been very busy. I felt obligated to voice my opinion on this war because I've seen what it has done out and taken an analytical approach to it and to the reasoing and justification of both side.\n \n I am totally now against the war in Iraq. Not because of the what if's or the there were no weapons of mass destruction or any of that. it's because of the people who suffer on the front lines daily and who will never return to the shores they gave their lives to defend in the name of liberty.\n \n I recently met (I think i said this before on another thread but for good measure i will post it again due to its relevance) a soldier who was in iraq for well over 2 years. he identified bodies at the morgue and was also blown back from a mortar round that damaged most of his hearing and left him dazed and confused. he currently is on very high doses of drugs to help him sleep at nigh because he twitches and wakes up in cold sweats and screams in his sleep.\n \n he has dealt with over 200 bodies in his time in iraq in identification from beheadings to bomb blasts. As a result from the trauma his marriage is strained and now he is the shadow of a person that he once was. \n It's sick and sad to see that Americas finest suffer for so little and no appreciation and with no common goal to work for no moral backing and as a result soldiers who were supposed to come home after thier term of duty are still serving extnded contracts beyond what they signed up for. their being held against their will. This all needs to stop for the welfare and well being of those who fight for the very basic rights and principles we all take for granted.",

   "Thank you for your service. Speaking for myself, I respect your view on this. But I have also read plenty of accounts from soldiers who are not against the war, and feel that what they are doing is a worthwhile endeavor. I personally do believe the decision to go to war by our government was ill-advised, but in terms of the effects and perspectives from people who have been there, I will take both your view from direct experience as well as others' views too, which in fact sometimes present a much different view.",

   "There is a simple answer. Withdrwal all US forces, and cut funding to balckwater. If the Iraqi government wants to retain the american blackwater mericinaries then that is their business and let them pay for it not the american tax payer.. Get the troops out NOW.",

Get the troops out NOW.\n\n \n \n true but we all know the neocons who rule this government especially mr cheny and his company haliburton which has nearly all the US govt contracts for the military will make our presence their permanent. Look at the 700 million dollar us embassy. Funny that money could hace gone to infastructure to strengthen the economy and rebuild the framework of the economy and bring jobs, or use it to help the victims of new orleans or maybe even increase the benefits to soldiers families who have died from the war. But this is of course washington and the almighty dollar will always rule over conscience.",

This all needs to stop for the welfare and well being of those who fight for the very basic rights and principles we all take for granted.\nI'm 100% with you! During Nam I flew bodies and body parts back to Dover in boxes for heart broken friends and families to \"welcome\" home. We'd pick up the dead on one leg and pick up live targets on the way back. I've seen holes in my aircraft (C-130E) where enemy were shooting at us, trying to knock the plane out of the sky. I've seen bodies being carried (dragged) in body bags out of harms way. I've smelled dead, rotting, burning, flesh.\n \n Anyone who sees this war as heroic or necessary has never experienced real war. . . .seen it or smelled it. War is a final decision, not one off the top of the head as this one.\n \n Mr. President would have NEVER sent our men and women into Iraq if he would have served his time in Nam instead of disappearing only to send other's kids into battle now. And Mr. VP would have never insisted on striking Iraq if he would have served instead of getting his deferments.\n \n jazyjason, I know enough to use war last and only when absolutely unavoidable and necessary. This was not done. Now we pay the price.",
