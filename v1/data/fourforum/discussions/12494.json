   "There is an article here:\n Hungary's prime minister resigns over economic crisis - The Irish Times - Sat, Mar 21, 2009\n \n March 21st he Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny resigned. \n \n I am of Hungarian descent and many relatives of mine live in Hungary. My relatives are members of the Fidesz (anti-socialist, conservative Christian party), the current minority. MSZP is the current socialist majority party.\n \n Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny was basically a left over of the communism from previous decades. He cursed and cussed in his speeches, using the f-word frequently. We are glad to see him gone!\n \n Nobody ever pays attention to little old Hungary so here is something interesting about what is going on in Eastern Europe. :)",
