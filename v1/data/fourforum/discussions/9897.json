   "Okay smarty-pants people. Help me out here. \n \n Can thorium reactors help in the fight against nuclear terrorism? \n \n As I understand it, thorium itself cannot be used as a critical mass. Furthermore, thorium reactors use thorium fuel in a way that produces fissionable uranium fuel which is then used to power the reactor. A lot less waste is produced. Terrorists who steal some thorium are SOL as they need a nuclear reactor to breed the uranium. Low enriched reactors can have their fuel stolen and then processed like Iran into HEU which can be used as a weapon. Plus LEU and HEU reactors produce alot more waste. \n \n it seems IMO that thorium reactors can limit access to fuel as a nuclear weapon and massively reduce waste as a radiological weapon at the same time while fulfilling power needs. \n \n any problems technically I should know before I put this idea into a paper on weapons of mass destruction & terrorism?",

   "This might not directly address your question, but the idea of terrorists stealing nuclear fuel and building an atomic bomb is pretty remote. Nukes are tricky. They take skilled labor, specialized materials (aside from the nuclear material) and are big, bulky things. It takes full fledged countries years of well funded research to be able to make a nuke, it's not something terrorists could do in their garage. What they could do is take stolen nuclear material and just wrap it around a conventional bomb, making a dirty bomb. So if thorium does in fact produce less waste it could help on that score. But the fact that it won't go critical does not, to me, seem to help much in the \"war on terrorism\".",

A gun type is pretty easy, and several labs have done it with stuff of the shelf of their local radioshack. Making many reliable, durable, small and safe nuclear weapons is hard for terrorists, the kind states want. Making a truck sized, unreliable, not safe isn't hard. Making a implosion kind is the bloody hard way which again would make T reactors a plus as their waste is largely plutonium and you can't make a gun type out of plutonium. \n \n As I understand it, removing the uranium from a T reactor is rather difficult and plutonium waste would be about 70% less. That's a big plus towards ensuring states can't make nuclear weapons. \n \n Mandating that all developing countries can only be sold Thorium reactors could prevent new states from gaining weapons. That's another big plus in the fight against WMD. \n \n And on top of that, simply stopping the priming process within a T reactor results in the ceasing of fission. A terrorist attack upon a reactor trying to cause a meltdown would quickly fail.",

   "A more likely scenario would be a stolen nuke from the former USSR finding its way into the hands of a terrorist group. Terrorists don't need to make a bomb if they can procure one already made. emoticon_wow\n\n \n True, but we should cover all bases. But making a gun type is pretty simple and the US government has classified many of the details of doing so after it asked several labs to try. Furthermore in the 60's several grad students did it, their reports are classified. \n \n But I'm more worried about states. States with access to a Thorium reactor run into much bigger problems. Far less plutonium for a much harder to build implosion bomb, lack of easily usable weapons material (thorium and post reaction thorium are non-weapons usable). Plus simply stopping the priming system makes the reactor cease energy production (big plus in a terrorist attack). If the NPT and IAEA can force return of post production thorium, there's very little a state can do to make weapons. Proliferation essentially halts. That's a good thing.\n \n And building thorium converters in developed states could allow fission of waste material down to nothing.",

   "I don't mean to throw a wrench into this discussion, but as I understand it, a thorium reaction requires a free neutron flux that is only possible from a conventional U-235 or Pu-239 reaction. So you run a conventional reactor and irradiate some thorium and get some fissile isotope of uranium that continues the reaction. That's much like how conventional reactors produce significant amounts of Pu-239 from U-238 by neutron capture.\n \n You don't tell us which isotope. Certainly not all 29 isotopes of thorium are fertile, just as all 24 isotopes of uranium and all 20 isotopes of plutonium are not fissile or fertile. All you tell us is that thorium somehow becomes fissile uranium. Which isotope? Is it neutron capture? Please explain.\n \n Understand that I don't doubt that this is possible.

Once the priming stops, the reaction stops. Good 1 - Terrorists 0. \n \n \nSo you run a conventional reactor and irradiate some thorium and get some fissile isotope of uranium that continues the reaction.\n\n \n As I understand it, you have to remove the irradiated thorium, run into through a chemical bath that separates it into non-irradiated and uranium 233. Forcing a return of the pre-separated could stop the proliferation problem. Without 233, no nukes. \n \n \nYou don't tell us which isotope. Certainly not all 29 isotopes of thorium are fertile, just as all 24 isotopes of uranium and all 20 isotopes of plutonium are not fissile or fertile. All you tell us is that thorium somehow becomes fissile uranium. Which isotope? Is it neutron capture? Please explain.\n\n \n I think it's thorium 232 for the fuel. It absorbs a neutron to become 233, decays into protactinium-233, and then 28 days later into fissile U233. \n \n \nUnderstand that I don't doubt that this is possible. In fact, I am aware that it is possible. I'm actually questioning the trade off.\n\n \n I don't see how the trade off in terms of terrorism and proliferation can hurt us compared to now. \n \n How many terrorists do you know that have access to a reactor?",

Why change over to something that isn't known to be profitable when you have a fat cash cow right now? The French, US and Russians have designed the business models around Uranium and Plutonium reactors. To switch to Thorium would completely screw their investments up and change their core competencies. If I was them, I'd be adamant against Thorium because it threatens my paycheck. Now India has it going on. But they are doing it for completely different reasons. Largely because getting uranium isn't viable as they aren't under the NPT and even the US is sketch as their civilian-military programs are hard to tell apart. They could use their local Thorium sources to breed uranium for weapons. That's basically their goal. Most nations don't have large supplies of thorium.\n \n And you can make weapons from the thorium fuel cycle. It's just a heck of a lot harder and a lot more dangerous. I recall the US only made one and then said screw it it's too damn hard. \n \n IMO, the fewer nukes the better. IMO, deterrence can be done with a single survivable weapon. Would Russians nuke the Chechens if they would lose Moscow? Not likely. Would we nuke anyone if we'd lose NY, or LA or DC? Not likely.",
