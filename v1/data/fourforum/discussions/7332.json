   "LONGWOOD, Fla. - A reportedly suicidal teenager who was shot by police while brandishing a pellet gun in his middle school has died of his injuries, his family's spokeswoman said Saturday. \n \n Kelly Swofford, a neighbor who had been with the family all morning, stood outside their home and confirmed that 15-year-old Christopher Penley had died.\n\n Obviously, by the statements that this child had made and the actions he took, he intended to die. While tragic in itself, I think it shows another alarming fact. We have yet to find a way to prevent children from bringing guns to school (real guns, BB guns, etc.), and until we do, this kind of tragedy will continue to happen. While I agree that part of the solution needs to focus on identifying and helping these children before they get to this desperate point, what other realistic actions can and should we take? \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060114/ap_on_re_us/school_evacuated",

Neighbors, friends, and others at school seemed aware that this was a troubled kid with serious issues. Where were the parents, that they had no idea that this child was this troubled? In almost every case like this, there are warning signs long before the child reaches the point of some sort of desperate action. Someone was asleep at the wheel. But that is another issue.",

Obviously the parents share some responsibility, but it seems harsh and too early to blame them just yet.\n -Wez\n\n I think this goes to the heart of the problem though Wez. In some of the interviews with this childs classmates and friends, it was stated that this kid had made statements that he \"hated his life\", \"hated his father\", and \"wished he could die\". How can anyone who ever heard one of these statements look him/herself in the mirror now? These are huge red flags, especially when heard from one person repeatedly. Sure, maybe nobody pictured him actually taking the exact actions that he did, but that is not something you sit around thinking about on a regualr basis...\"I wonder if Billy is going to bring a gun into school tomorrow and get killed by the SWAT team?\". However, with the warning flags this kid was throwing up, people should have been saying...\"Hmmm...he seems very troubled, and sounds like someone who could end up hurting himself or others, perhaps I should get him some help before it's too late\". We have seen this over and over in our country over the last 15 years. Columbine, Jonesboro, etc. The warnings are there, we just don't seem to pick up on them, or don't seem to take them seriously even when we do hear them. I think this, combined with the apathetic attitude of \"It's not my job to watch over him\" is what is leading these kids to do the things they are doing. We need to start listening to these kids. While I thought Bowling for Columbine was generally a piece of trash, I did really like the quote by M. Manson of all people. When asked what he would have said to the 2 columbine shooters if he had been able to talk to them prior to the incident, he said \"I wouldn't have said anything, I would have listened to them\".",

I wouldn't bat an eyelid if someone said that to me. I've heard it all before.\n \n \"I'm so misunderstood; everyone hates me, life sux blah blah blah\".\n \n *snores*\n \n http://vampirefreaks.com/gothicresults.php?sex=all&sortby=user_rating&title=gothicresults.php?sex=all&sortby=user_datemodified\n \n How much angst can you find looking through those profiles? Half of them hate life but maybe one in every million of them is going to go and start shooting. Some kids will never be happy and just continue hating life and moaning, regardless of what their friends/ parents/ teachers do.\n \n I agree attention should be paid, but it can be overdone. I don't think there's a huge amount that can be done to stop the one or two people from 'losing it'.\n \n -Wez",
