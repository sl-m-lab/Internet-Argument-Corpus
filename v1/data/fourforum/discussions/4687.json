   "In the spirit of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest series, I thought we could discuss what our top 10 favorite albums are.\n \n I think the one criterion that we all share (for some consistency)should be listenability throughout the entire album. What I mean by this is that you can listen to it from start to finish and like the whole thing. This is just to weed out those albums where you like a few of the songs a lot and skip over the rest seeing as this is about albums not individual songs.\n \n I know this is potentiall difficult, so you don't have to order them if you find that too hard (as I no doubt will).\n \n I'll post mine when I actually finalize it.",

   "Ok here are my picks. Took me long enough. :) \n They are in no particular order.\n \n *Rock Spectacle- Barenaked Ladies: It was very difficult for me to pick one Barenaked Ladies album for this list, as I could put any on here and be satisfied. There is not a single thing they have ever recorded or performed that I didn't like and every album holds its own. But I will say \"Rock Spectacle\" as it is their live album and they are never better than when they perform live.\n \n *Straight On Till Morning- Blues Traveler: One of the first records that I personally owned; that was mine alone. I dare say that John Popper is the best harp player the world has ever seen, but he is rarely recognized for it. This is an extremely well rounded album including a great first track, and a fantastic finishing track. Right in the middle is a social commentary on the death penalty that is still a kick-XXX song. On top of everything else, it also has one of my favorite album titles and album covers.\n \n *Innocent Man- Billy Joel: There are individual songs from other albums that I like better, and I was tempted to put The Greatest Hits up here, but this one is good from start to finish and carries a musical theme of 50s doo-wop (done well, not as a cheap concept album) through the whole thing. Every one of his of his albums has a distinctive feel musically and thematically, and that couldn't be truer than here.\n \n *Greatest Hits- Elton John: I like his early stuff the best, and this is the best from that period.\n \n *Legend- Bob Marley: A watershed in music for me, as I think it is for most that discover it. Bob Marley transcends reggae. He is in is own whole category.\n \n *Live at Wolf Trap- John McCutcheon: My absolute favorite live album from a man who is at his best live. Live is the only way to hear folk music, or any music for that matter, but especially folk. That's how it was meant to be. John McCutcheon is also one of he best, if not the best, overall musicians I have ever seen or heard in any genre.\n \n *The Randy Newman Songbook- Randy Newman: A stripped down, piano only version of his best songs. Randy Newman is one of the most unique and best songwriters and piano players of the past thirty years and you never hear it better than here. Nobody plays the piano quite like he does. Few have the guts to be as bold as he is on songs like \"Rednecks\" and \"The Great Nations of Europe.\"\n \n *Sister Hazel-Sister Hazel: This was the band's first album and is not very well known, even among Sister Hazel fans. Despite the not-so-high-end sound recording on this album, the solid songwriting at the core of this band is best seen here.\n \n *Sweet Baby James- James Taylor: The best (and along with Carole King's Tapestry) the most important album of the singer/songwriter era. In fact it defined this era. That's why John Mayer accurately called him \"the blueprint.\" Sweet Baby James is one of my all-time favorite songs as well.\n \n *Rock 'n Roll Party- Virginia Coalition- One of the most pure fun albums I have ever heard. This is a small band that doesn't travel that far west that often (when I saw them here in Kansas City, it was the farthest west they had ever traveled), but if you ever get the chance to pick up one of their albums or see them live, don't pass it up. You won't regret it.\n \n Honorable Mentions\n *Ray soundtrack- Ray Charles\n *American Idiot- Green Day\n *Spirit- Jewel\n *On and On- Jack Johnson\n *Come Away With Me- Norah Jones\n *The John Lennon Collection- John Lennon\n *Hail to the Chief- John McCutcheon\n *Get Away From Me- Nellie McKay\n *O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack",
