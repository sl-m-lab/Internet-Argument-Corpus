   "McCain is now claiming to be responsible for the Blackberry. For those not in the know, the blackberry was created by RIM-a Canadian company.\n \n http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/16/hundt-mccain-blackberry/\n\n \n Pleeeaaasse!!! \"Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years and comes right through the Commerce Committee which McCain was Chairman of. The assertion is that the Commerce Committee opened the doors and created the legislation to allow these innovations to exist in a competitive market place. But of course you must, ONCE AGAIN purposely misstate what is true in reality in order to attribute the false claim to him that he claims to have actually invented the blackberry. And this based on a press conference one of his spokesman gave. McCain himself never said anything about this. \n \n I guess I shouldn't blame you personally though since the link you posted is a leftist propaganda piece which uses the same exact tactics. So monkey see monkey do is par for the course with you, I guess. :xbanghead",

   "This just seems like another run through of the misinterpretation of Al Gore's statements about the internet, except that when the sohe's on the other foot the right scream bloody murder.\n\n \n Actually, it isn't the same thing at all. We have video of Gore making his Internet invention statement, but all this story is about is a statement an UNDERLING of McCain's made regarding work he did as Chairman of the Commerce Committee. Nothing he said implied in the slightest that McCain ever claimed to have INVENTED the blackberry, or any other PDAs or hi-tech tools. \n \n So Jo, just so you can hopefully recognize it the next time you see it, which I seriously doubt, what TQ posted was an extremist liberal hit piece designed specifically to use false information, (OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A LIE) in order to mock, insult and slander McCain as dishonest and out of touch with reality. And TQ has proven that he is only too happy to post such dishonest propaganda, simply because he did post it as if it was a valid and true story. Anyone with even the slightest sense of honesty or decency would have read that story and laughed out loud at its low level of credibility. But NOOOOO, not TQ, he embraced it, and evidently you are shallow enough to follow suit. How proud you must be. emoticon_wow :xbanghead",
