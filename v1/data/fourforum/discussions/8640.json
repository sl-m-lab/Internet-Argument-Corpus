   "For the record, the intrepid folks at Bear Butte are also taking on bikers:\n \n http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2006/08/05/news/top/news01.txt\n \n Protesters ask bikers to stay away\n By Kevin Woster, Journal Staff Writer\n STURGIS - American Indians from throughout the nation marched into the rumbling heart of the Sturgis motorcycle rally Friday to ask bikers to steer clear of Bear Butte, a prairie mountain that holds the spiritual soul of many tribal people. \n \n As the temperature sizzled toward 100 degrees, about 200 protesters - including a scattering of non-Indian supporters of the rally - gathered at Meade County Law Enforcement Center to flash signs and urge bikers passing on Main Street not to drive the stretch of S.D. Highway 79 leading to Bear Butte a few miles northeast of town. The peaceful, three-hour protest was aimed at persuading county officials to create a five-mile buffer zone against development around Bear Butte to protect the mountain from the raucous spread of the rally.\n \n Speaking through a microphone, Alex White Plume, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, told the crowd that county officials had turned \"deaf ears\" to requests by American Indian leaders to block development near the mountain, known as Mato Paha in the Lakota language. More than just a zoning issue, the battle to protect Bear Butte is essential if the Lakota and other tribes are to survive the ongoing attempts by non-Indian governments to assimilate them, White Plume said.\n \n \"We will no longer exist as a people if we lose our mountain,\" he said. \"We have to draw a line today and say we're not going to be assimilated any more.\"\n \n The protest began with a prayer gathering at Bear Butte and moved into town for the rally at the law enforcement center. They then drove to the intersection of S.D. Highways 34 and 79, where the most physically able marched north to their camp at Bear Butte.\n \n At least one protester was treated for heat exhaustion by medical personnel at the law enforcement center.\n \n Protest organizers worked with law enforcement officers to coordinate the rally and march. Officers were scattered around the perimeter of the rally at the law enforcement center, along with young Indian men in military-style and boots and pants, and red shirts that read \"Mato Paha Security.\" The men, members of the Warrior Society, wore bandanas over their faces to represent the \"centuries of invisibility\" they and their ancestors have suffered because of \"colonizing powers.\"\n \n Warrior Society spokesman Vic Camp of Manderson said bikers aren't welcome at Bear Butte unless they come with a respectful attitude.\n \n \"We don't want them at Bear Butte, unless they're going to come in a sober, clean way to pray,\" Camp said.\n \n Part of the state park at Bear Butte is open to the public. But another part is restricted to Indian religious ceremonies.\n \n Most bikers passing on motorcycles or walking on the sidewalk across the street appeared puzzled by the rally and the chants of \"Don't Ride 79.\" Some raised a fist in a gesture of support and a few shouted back in derision.\n \n Biker Bruce Isringhausen of Godfrey, Ill., said he wasn't aware of the Bear Butte issue and hadn't ever been to the mountain. But the rally made him curious enough to go.\n \n \"I think I'll probably go up there now and have a look,\" he said. \"Is it cooler out there?\"\n \n Bob and Joan Brown of Phoenix walked inside the perimeter of the protest and listened to several speakers. They agreed that they would honor the wishes of the protesters and stay off the route to the butte.\n \n \"It's a legacy that should be honored. We're not going to ride 79,\" Bob Brown said. \"We want to show respect for what they're trying to do - to show respect for those who came before us and those who will come after us.\"\n \n Joan Brown said it would be a small sacrifice: \"There's lots of beautiful roads.\"\n \n Carter Camp, a former American Indian Movement leader who helped form the Intertribal Coalition to Defend Bear Butte, said the rally was aimed at the county officials who granted beer and liquor permits for businesses wanting to build near the butte.\n \n But bikers can help in the effort to protect the mountain by honoring protesters' request that they not ride that stretch of highway, Camp said.\n \n \"Our fight is not with the bikers. It's with the government,\" he said. \"We don't care if they (bikers) party their lives away. Our problem is when they do it next to Bear Butte. We're not going to end the struggle until we have a five-mile buffer zone to stop that development out there.\"\n \n As the protest began to wind down at the law enforcement center, White Plume discussed the possibility of a rally Monday, to be aimed at U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. Kempthorne and Josh Bolten, chief of staff for President Bush, will be among a group of dignitaries in Sturgis on Monday for the dedication of new motorcycle stamps by the U.S. Postal Service.\n \n Kempthorne and Bolten also will join in a motorcycle ride to Crazy Horse Memorial.\n \n White Plume said Kempthorne should be meeting with tribal officials on more serious matters.\n \n \"He needs to be addressing our issues,\" White Plume said. \"He's going to be dedicating a damn biker's stamp when we've got people starving.\"",

Then again you stated rather clearly that you don't care. Just because you aren't offended by being called Tommy Totem Pole doesn't mean that everybody will not be offended. Is that how you would define humility? How ironic that given your posts you find nothing wrong with the documents that started this thread. Just as the Church felt that native Americans were wrong in all they said and did and it really wasn't a bad thing to bring them the good news about Jesus. Why should they respect the culture? Why shouldn't we just move in and settle on their land? It's a lot of land they don't need all of it. Most countries call that an invasion and the response is typically considered hostile. \n \n Well it's a good thing Jesus, Peter and Paul didn't think like you. I wonder what you would be if 2000 years ago when the Jewish apostles were discussing the gentiles said Fu#$ the unclean pig eaters!\n \n Again how funny you quote John 15:13 and all you have to do is read the verse above it \n \n 15:12 \"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.\n \n 15:13 No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends\n \n \n Give it a shot see what happens when you care about the feelings of others and not just your own.",

   "That is not what I am saying, you and the political correct brigade are forcing your/their views of what is racist language and what is not down everybodys throats including mine, is that perfectly acceptable?\n \n Wrong again, you must be very comfortable with that by now. Language was being found offensive before the concept of politically correct was ever thought of. You called me all kinds of wonderful things, it is my choice to be offended or not regardless of your intention. The offense comes from the lack of respect or demeaning of the person being spoken to by the speaker. Great you have thick skin to go along with your head and so are not phased by such insults, but does everybody you know have the same experiences as you do? Maybe there are some black people who associate the word ni**er with some very bad experiences, same with fa**ots, g**ks, k**es, sp**s, w*ps and all the rest. If they don't have a problem then your right who cares tell some jokes and friends rag on each other all the time for fun. All I am saying is don't just assume it's ok and don't make the choice for them.\n \n \n No words have no power beyond what the person saying or writing them intended, of course the recipiant can derive from words what is not intended, but that just means his interpretation of the words is wrong.\n \n Ding Ding Ding Wrong again! Someone's experience is their experience. You may have intended to not be an idiot, but my experience of you is that you are an idiot. Later we may discover that you are not, but as it stands right now that's my experience of you. If your words are misinterpreted then you should consider speaking in a way that clearly states your intention. After all you are the one trying to communicate with someone else. Why is it thier responsibility to figure out if your being a jerk or just trying to say hi.\n \n \n \n tommy totem pole does not exist, that is the whole point, I do not know native american names, so I attributed a thing I associate with the native american culture and incorperated it into a name, there was no racist intent, the words I used I myself attributed no racist intent to, however in your interpretation you yourself attributed racism to those words hence you are the one making the words become racist not me, I did not make the words racist, you did, do you understand what i am saying?\n \n \n No tommy doesn't, but out of the millions of words available to you to describe native americans the best that you could come up with is belittling and disrespectful. There are plenty of well intentioned people who are as nice as can be, giving of themselves often to help qu**rs, ni**ers and those lazy who**s who get pregnant to go on welfare. The words are offensive just because they are not offensive to you doesn't mean they are not to someone else and doesn't mean there is some group out there trying to control your thoughts by restricting your ability to communicate. You could have very easily used other words to describe native americans. Among friends that would probably be funny, among strangers just a lack of class and tact, but you already knew that.\n \n \n Yet that is exactly what you are doing by saying that I made a racist slur, you are making that choice for me, I do not get to decide how you interperate what I wrote, but I do get to decide if what I wrote was inteneded to be racist.\n \n The words are offensive to some people no matter what your intention. Gays call each other fa**ot or qu**en and for some no problem, but not for all. If you can't figure it out by yourself ask someone if what your about to say may be offensive.\n \n Tommy totem pole does not exist, how do you respect and have compassion for someone who does not exist. Even if there are native americans on this site who could misinterperate what i wtote like you did, it does not mean I have no respect or compassion for native americans, it simply means they misinterpreate what I wrote.\n \n It must be nice to roam the earth having no responsibility for anything you do. It's not you it's them, the PC Nazi's or the XXXXXX you can't understand what your saying. Have you heard the saying if you get called a jacka** enough you should consider buying a saddle? I hope that doesn't offend you, I was just offering some friendly advice.\n \n Just because my neighbour isnt offended at being called English limey doesnt mean I wont be, but how would you know if I would be, why should you be manipulated into thinking you cant call me an english limey by people who dont even know me, I find no offense at all in it of course I could but for that matter I could find offense in anything at all.\n \n All that is being said is find out if you will be offended first, is that so much to ask?\n \n \n My firend Surrinder is a British born Asian lad, He hated being called paki, so I called him it all the time until he realised that the word paki is not racist in itself, we were great mates until he moved down south he had respect for me and I for him Paki is only racist when used in a racist way.\n \n Well aren't you just the special one! Your just going to do something someone doesn't like until they come to grips with thier ignorance. Wo your such a giver, thanks for making the world a better place.\n \n where does that document say that, your a beligerant fool, your just trying to make argument, your not interested in finding the truth, your only interested in seeing your ego spilled out across the internet and causing strife for no other reason other than you enjoy it, your a muppet and not worth bothering about.\n \n I'm open to truth even when it makes me wrong, I know you can say you are also, but are you really. Billigerent fool, was that the muppet that was an orange bird with the crooked beak? Thank goodness I read your post otherwise I might have found that offensive.\n \n hang on now where does the document say the church doesnt respect the culture, if you bothered to read it the document talks of their culture being one of peace and a people who believe in ONE god and that they seem ready to hear about christ, how is that praise of their culture and religious culture disrespectful & intolerant?\n \n They had many gods, not just one but ok I play do you think that one god was the Catholic God? They did not tolerate anything but thier submission to the Pope and culturely they were considered savages. Where on earth did you learn about American history?\n \n who actually took their land, who actually owned the land in the first place - The church didnt take the land and the indians never owned the land in the first place.\n \n Well if all those history books are true, it started with the pilgrims from England, but then the French, Spanish, Dutch and some others thought it unfair so came and took some for themselves. Please I can't wait to hear this, but who owned the land then? \n \n your a argumentitive nincompoop looking for a fight, how childish\n \n \n Right back at ya big boy emoticon_xgood \n \n \n .\n \n That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life, the wisdom of an idiot it really is\n \n \n Suppose I know about survival and you dont and we are both in the middle of nowhere.....by your messure I am wrong for thinking I should teach you how to survive, no its much more correct and honorable to let you die, your a f***ing idiot\n\n \n Well numnut if you had the ability to think beyond the most basic of concepts you might find that the age of the knuckledragger has passed and most of the intelligent species now walk upright. Your analogy is just weak you should be embarrassed that you posted it.\n You can respond and post whatever nonsense comes to mind but all that this silly banter back and forth wastes time I would rather be doing something else.

When I say \"anything at all,\" I am referring to religious beliefs.

Not true for the people of Europe and the Middle East. Holy wars, crusades, and inquisitions characterized the nature of a problematic belief system. In 1493 this Vatican Document is promoting the spread of it's pollution upon the new world. If you recall the Pilgrims came to Plymouth Rock to escape religious persecution, from fellow Christians. Respecting the beliefs and/or non beliefs that are a reality of the world in which you live, is the ultimate truth. I can't remember the last time I saw an Evangelical Hindu ranting and raving about how sin and decadence will invoke the wrath of Vishnu upon humanity.",
