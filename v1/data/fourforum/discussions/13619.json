   "Gun Laws Effective Only If Enforced -- Courant.com\n \n \nThe Nov. 18 CTNow article \"Probation In Robbery 'Prank',\" which described the sentencing of four former University of Hartford students who robbed two other students at gunpoint, illustrates the failure of our judicial system to deal with gun violence.\n \n These four individuals committed an armed robbery, yet they were allowed to plead guilty to criminal trespass, criminal mischief and interfering with police. One of these individuals brandished a handgun during the robbery. Therefore, at the very least, an additional charge of carrying a pistol without a permit should have been lodged and prosecuted.\n \n Much to the chagrin of law-abiding gun owners, it is common practice in many such cases to drop the carrying-a-pistol-without-a-permit charge as part of the deal for a guilty plea. That practice is indeed unfortunate because it totally emasculates our gun laws.\n \n As a result, we now have armed robbers walking the streets with suspended sentences on misdemeanor charges.\n \n Some deterrent! We don't need more gun laws. We only need to enforce the ones currently on the books.\n",
