And you aren't stopping the flaming you just flee the threads you see you can never possible win ever.\n \n \nWell you sure accomplished that by showing how immature you are. Thanks for clarifying.\n\n \n Not at all. You, in your failure to actually respond to arguments and refute anything have resorted to name calling and attacking people on their screen names. That's pretty sad. Instead of dealing with an argument in a professional way that proves what you're talking about, you use playground insults. Whatever my handle's name is irrelevant: you are still wrong.\n \n \nChild, you are a legend in only one place, in your own mind.\n\n \n Then my mind must be very large as numerous other posters have agreed with my posts, noticed you failed to address my points and solidly backed me up on numerous occasions. Some have even taken glee at watching you flee or get crushed by my posts. Notice that that has never happened for you.\n \n \nIt is easy to claim victory when the playing field is such a subjective arena of unprovable perceptions.\n\n \n No it's not. When you ignore an exponentially increasing number of points, resort to threats of Hell and run away from threads, that is called losing. How you think otherwise.... \n \n \nAnd how great it is for you to be able to take any argument that actually defeats yours and simply twist what its author is actually saying and redefine it as you regurgitate it back by saying, \"to translate what you said\" And then completely rape what they said to imply they said something else.\n\n \n Too bad that doesn't happen. Notice the other thread where virtually everyone agreed you were using threats.\n \n \nIn your mind that might define winning, but in the real World that is called lying and distorting the truth which is why I have labeled you and your cohorts like Lyte, SP and TQ philosophical cowards who must all use the same disingenuous tactics in order to feel like you're winning something here. So I just walk away from those debates too causing you all to claim some imagined victory that allows you to get out of bed in the morning and feel like you have actually accomplished something in your puny little life.\n\n \n So by that measure, Jimmy Carter wasn't an coward when he walked away from Iran. Reagan wasn't a terrorist appeaser when he ran from Lebanon. Clinton wasn't an coward when he tried to distract people from his personal problems. If you think that running away is winning and what people do to you is distorting the truth, then you must agree with my statements on the Presidents. But you'll ignore this like you do everything you do not like. I wonder how you manage to avoid the many Arcturus sized holes in your belief system and arguments.\n \n \nI have hoped that by walking away from debates that you use these tactics in would teach you to debate more fairly in future debates, but that hasn't happened so I walk away and just let you ramble on into infinity.\n\n \n More proof that you are have weak skills. And you're the one who relied on lies, hoaxes and fraud. Remember the Freaky Links TV show prop? You're never going to hear the end of that one. Every new user will be informed of just how dishonest you are and just how much you love lies. But given my discussions with Abe, I somehow don't think that is necessary as they can peg you for who yuo are.\n \n \nSo claim your victories, I'm still waiting to see what you actually won beyond an over-inflated ego. Let me know when receive your actual prize because I believe when rewards are actually passed out, you will be found wanting, and your credibility and lack of honesty will be reasons for that inevitable outcome for you.\n\n \n More threats!\n \n Did I not predict this?\n \n Oh wait I did! \n \n You when faced with defeat will do the following:\n \n 1) Lie, use frauds, use hoaxes\n 2) call people names\n 3) Use threats of Hell or some vague punishments\n 4) Flee like a coward\n \n \nNow I suppose you will say I have personally attacked you again. But I haven't\n\n \n You personally attack everyone who disagrees with you. Not really something new. If we kept a list of just how many times you do this per day, we'd quickly run out of harddrive space even when using simple text files. \n \n \nIf my truthful response offends you then change your tactics of reinterpreting what another poster say's rather than responding to their arguments as forwarded.\n\n \n We already know what you consider truth and what you consider lies.

   "Try and comprehend this child, your siggy is your OPINION. It is evidence of nothing real or imagined. Only in your mind does it prove anything at all.\n \n \n \n Try and comprehend this child, your siggy is your OPINION. It is evidence of nothing real or imagined. Only in your mind does it prove anything at all.\n \n \n \n Another lie, I responded to your first breakdown of my previous post in its entirety. I just see no reason to go back and forth by responding to every childish and flaming post that is directed at me. This is a wonderful example of the no win situation I'm in with you hypocrites. You will call me a name caller for getting down and dirty with you, and when I try and stop the flaming by not responding point by point to your posts, you accuse me of being beaten and running away. \n \n \n \n Well you sure accomplished that by showing how immature you are. Thanks for clarifying.\n \n \n \n Child, you are a legend in only one place, in your own mind. It is easy to claim victory when the playing field is such a subjective arena of unprovable perceptions. And how great it is for you to be able to take any argument that actually defeats yours and simply twist what its author is actually saying and redefine it as you regurgitate it back by saying, \"to translate what you said\" And then completely rape what they said to imply they said something else.\n \n In your mind that might define winning, but in the real World that is called lying and distorting the truth which is why I have labeled you and your cohorts like Lyte, SP and TQ philosophical cowards who must all use the same disingenuous tactics in order to feel like you're winning something here. So I just walk away from those debates too causing you all to claim some imagined victory that allows you to get out of bed in the morning and feel like you have actually accomplished something in your puny little life.\n \n I have hoped that by walking away from debates that you use these tactics in would teach you to debate more fairly in future debates, but that hasn't happened so I walk away and just let you ramble on into infinity. So claim your victories, I'm still waiting to see what you actually won beyond an over-inflated ego. Let me know when receive your actual prize because I believe when rewards are actually passed out, you will be found wanting, and your credibility and lack of honesty will be reasons for that inevitable outcome for you.\n \n Now I suppose you will say I have personally attacked you again. But I haven't, I have just responded to your untrue assertions about having won every debate we have ever had as accurately as possible. If my truthful response offends you then change your tactics of reinterpreting what another poster say's rather than responding to their arguments as forwarded.\n \n If I must constantly back track and explain what I actually meant in the prior post because you have again distorted it, then my debate issues nor the points I am trying to make ever get forwarded at all. That is when I decide it just isn't worth going back and forth with a philosophical coward who is so disingenuous that they will twist and distort what their opposition say's in order to appear like they are getting the upper hand. \n \n So thanks for listening, I feel much better now. Let this post stand forevermore, as a testament to why I CHOOSE to walk away from debates with you and those who must misinterpret, distort and corrupt my arguments before then responding to them inaccurately as you then claim victory. What is sad child is that you can consider such a false and hollow victory, any type of victory at all. And let post #1 of this very thread also stand as evidence of what I am saying here; that you will take a post I made from a prior debate and claim it makes a completely different point that YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I NEVER INTENDED TO MAKE, YET YOU ATTRIBUTE IT TO ME ALL THE SAME. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=296878&postcount=1 That, my friend, is philosophical cowardice to the max and it is SOP for you to such a degree that it has become your normal debating style. My only question is, why must a legend in his own mind such as yourself cheat at every level of debate to feel like you're winning?\n \n ANOTHER CASE IN POINT :http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=296950&postcount=115\n\n \n You almost have to stand in awe of AA's \"reasoning\" here. He makes unfounded assertions. He is called to back them up. He unleashes a torrent of names and threats of damnation. He is asked again to support his assertions. More name calling, more threats, questions of how we can stand our hate filled life. We again ask him to back up his assertions. He runs.\n \n This is his SOP, and yet to hear him tell it, he only responds in kind and walks away because we won't stop insulting him. Tell me AA: What did I post in the entertainment thread that offended you to the point that you had to go find a youtube video of a song calling all Canadians \"XXXXXX\"? Why,when you were told by numerous posters that wasn't a very nice thing to do, did you say the idea that Canadians were all XXXXXX was not your opinion, but a fact? Entertainment thread in question Oh, but you followed it up with the \"thumbs up\" emoticon, so that makes it alright, doesn't it?\n \n The facts are this-you are the one who has posted known hoaxes in support of your opinion. You are the one who consistently insults other posters here. You are the one who runs away when confronted. You do not \"respond in kind\". You do not \"walk away\", and you have yet to post a single solitary example of Electrolyte or myself lying.",
