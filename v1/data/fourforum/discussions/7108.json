   "Marc9000 has challenged zachvac to formally debate the same issue as in the uncompleted debate with Cerebro. Zachvac has accepted.\n \n The resolution is the same. Thus:\n \n Resolved: Intelligent Design should be part of the public schools' science curriculum, taught as a valid alternative to the Theory of Evolution.\n \n The rules are the same as well (5/4 posts, one week time limit). Marc9000 will argue the affirmative, hence he will finish and end.\n \n If there are any issues about posting on time due to the holiday season now upon us, please notify us here on the thread for all concerned to consider. You will likely find us quite understanding.\n \n The judges are JPSartre12, unkerpaulie, and billsco. Their decisions, as always, are final. \n \n A reminder to those who like to follow these debates: posting is limited to the names above only, but subscribing to the thread is a good way to be notified when a new response has been added. \n \n Marc9000's first post is due one week from this time stamp. Good luck to both marc9000 and zachvac.",

   "Awright, enough humanistic humor about ends & finishes - its yet to be determined if the moderator made an error in the first post emoticon_xangel anyway THANKS to the judges & moderator for their endeavors on bahalf of this debate. No problem on the extra week Zachvac. This is a hot topic, hopefully we'll both do a good job of representing the basics of our respective \"sides\" in the defined space we'll have here. \n \n The uncompleted debate was off to a good start.(one post by each) I don't wish to steal from it, but I'll use it as a reference as I start off to hopefully avoid some repetition. I'll do it so as not to require a reader here to have to constantly refer to it, but I suggest anyone interested enough to read here should read through that one once. \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6828\n \n I don't think it is possible on a subject as complex as this to make a convincing argument by focusing on one issue about it, such as what science is or is not, or what intelligent design is or is not. I have to make several distinct points, showing how they all combine to prove the resolution. I don't consider it a \"shotgun\" approach, I think of it more as laying all my cards on the table. New things may come up as we go, but I honestly have nothing else planned. These things should easily fill nine posts, but of course I welcome any new points by my opponent.\n \n 1) \"Intelligent design\" vs. \"theory of evolution\" are not very equal terms. Intelligent design concerns origins, and evolution concerns changes. \n \n \nStudies of the origin of the first life form, of the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe itself do not form part of the theory of evolution. Such studies are pursued within different scientific disciplines. \n\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_state.htm\n \n (there is a lot at the above site that I don't agree with - I use it because I feel that the best place to get an undisputed description OF the opposition is FROM the opposition)\n \n Studies of the origin of the first life form, the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design. Of the several \"different scientific diciplines\" refered to above, they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design, and that's undirected, random, happenstance processes. For purposes of this debate, can we come up with one general two word phrase for the \"different scientific diciplines\" - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design, which \"theory of evolution\" is clearly not? How about \"happenstance origins\"? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit. Does \"happenstance origins\" fit the same criteria? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design, there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins. If intelligent design isn't repeatable, happenstance origins aren't repeatable. Other scientists can't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist, and on and on. Evolutionists imply that with time, they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins. That's no more (or less) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design. If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science, why can't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science? \n \n I've never been to college, but here are some comments from someone who has, on the definition of science;\n \n Stephen Grocott\n \nWhat is science?\n The first place to start is with a definition of science. Many exist, but most of them come down to something like, \"If something is scientific, it is observable and testable (i.e., able to be repeated).\"\n \n Now it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is. However, if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement. In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research, I can't ever recall anyone telling me what science is (and isn't!), showing me what it is, or providing me with an explanation of how it operates. If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me, I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is \"scientific.\" After a pause, most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than \"It is what scientists do.\"\n \n As an undergraduate, I was taught to remember, not to think. Sure, I was given tools which I could use to think, but I wasn't actually taught to think. Then, as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field (as do all Ph.D. researchers), and so the breadth of a question like \"What is the definition of scientific?\" was absolutely irrelevant to me. Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists, the question has never arisen, nor apparently needed to have been asked. My point is that most scientists don't really know what is or isn't scientific, because it rarely affects what they do.\n \n Why make a big deal of this? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and, to know this, you need to know what science is-and as we have seen, most scientists don't.\n \n Neither \"process\" is currently observable, testable or repeatable. Please note that when speaking of evolution, I am talking of the appearance of new (not rearranged) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information. I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals. When talking about evolution, I am not speaking of natural selection, which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species. Creationists, of course, have not the slightest problem with natural selection. After all, it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these. Anyway, the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle.\n\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/isd/grocott.asp\n \n So who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.\n \n 2) Let's look at the dictionary.com definition of religion;\n \n \nBelief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. \n A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. \n The life or condition of a person in a religious order. \n A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. \n A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. \n\n \n When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established, nor prohibited from being freely exercised, they probably wouldn't have considered atheism (the assertion that there is no God) to be a religion, because at the time it wasn't organized, or funded. The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time, as were other types of religion. They weren't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had, they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements, or money issues. They could see atheists needing protection from religion, but they couldn't see religion needing protection from atheism, because it wasn't organized. While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion, it can't be argued that it isn't an EQUIVALENT to religion today, with the organization and funding that it now has. 200 years ago, an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized. With today's communications, it does not. Just type \"atheism\" in any search engine and note the organization, and political action. \n \n I'm not using the term \"atheism\" in a derogatory manner. It's an assertion that there is no God. But today it's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight, thanks to modern communications. It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion, and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion. It cannot claim science as its god, and force it upon public education.\n \n 3) One of the most interesting things about this whole issue is the fact that the same thing, only reversed, was going on in the US 100 years ago. \n \n http://www.campusmagazine.org/articledetail.aspx?id=8d3e3238-facb-433a-9c62-2f7cc3afdb0f\n \n The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time, and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it, and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools. Today, the concept of intelligent design, (void of any certain religion and its associated faith) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists, who are afraid of it in exactly the same way.  I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows. Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding. \n \n If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance. \n \n In the words of biologist Arthur Jones;\n \n \n It is commonly claimed by secular scientists that creationism is a \"science stopper.\" The contention is that to ascribe anything (e.g., the origin of living organisms) to the direct action of God is to cut off all scientific inquiry. This seems such simple common sense that it has been very persuasive. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to show that the argument is fallacious.\n \n A number of general points can be made. First, the argument is based on ignorance of all the different ways in which Christian faith can enter into science and of how fruitful these have been. After all, many of the great scientists of the past were committed Christians and many of those were consciously exploring the implications of their Christian faith for science. Second, whereas the direct action of God may cut off one type of explanation, others will remain and may even be enhanced. To say that God created the different kinds of animals and plants certainly cuts off explanation in terms of evolutionary continuity. However, it leaves wide-open scientific investigation of every other pattern of relationship (ecological, developmental, etc.) between these kinds. Scientists have been so indoctrinated in the belief that all patterns can only be explained historically in terms of the happenstances of Darwinian evolution that many wouldn't even know how to look for explanations in other terms. Third, there is abundant documentation of the fact that evolutionary naturalism has often stopped scientific research. To take just one example, the evolutionary assumption that certain organs or features are vestigial has often long delayed the (fruitful) research into their functions.\n \n More specifically, one can appeal to experience and this is where this essay becomes a personal testimony to the scientific fruitfulness of a commitment to creation.\n \n During my undergraduate days when my \"heretical\" views became known, my professor (Otto Lowenstein, Professor of Zoology) made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department! However, he did allow me to do research. From the pressure that was put on me, I can only assume that it was thought that I could be convinced of the error of my ways. If that was the intention, then it badly backfired. Many a visiting scholar was brought into my laboratory to convince me, from their area of expertise, that evolution was indisputably true. Of course, hardly knowing their field, I never had an answer at the time, but after they had gone I would look up the relevant research and carefully analyze it. I always found that the evolutionist case was much weaker than it had seemed and that alternative creationist interpretations were available which were just as or more convincing. My position was further strengthened by the results of my own research.\n\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.asp\n \n When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools, could it be that he \"hardly knew the field, and didn't have an answer\" that would fit the time constraints of his decision making? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago? \n \n Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first.",

   "OK, first I would like to thank the judges for agreeing to judge this, and my opponent, marc9000 for agreeing to debate. Hopefully this one will be finished and ended with no one disappearing :)\n \n Thank you for allowing the extra time, I should be able to follow the time-frame of 7 days from now until the end. So here is my first post:\n \n \n \n \n I have to say, for a debate, I sure agree with a lot of what you say here, but there is the one fundamental difference which I would like to focus on, which is the definition of science. I like you am a little concerned with the way science is taught in schools, as simply a body of knowledge rather than a method for acquiring knowledge and sharing it with the rest of the world. Biology shouldn't simply deal with the facts about different animals, natural selection, evolution, etc. but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts. Instead of teaching that the Earth was flat we should have taught that we look out, see the horizon, and it looks flat, but the alternative theory is that we live on a round Earth and they believe something about how gravity attracts us to the Earth... (hopefully I don't have to explain the outrageous \"round Earth theory\" :))\n \n But now we get to the actual definition of science. To me at least, science is how knowledge is acquired, different possibilities, and objectively examining these possibilities as well as publishing them to the public for scrutiny. So basically science is the answer to the question of why or how. Why is it that when an apple is dropped, it goes towards the Earth? How fast does it go? When I drop it does it really speed up as it goes along? These are all matters of science, so basically almost everything in the world can be considered science, which is why I believe philosophy is considered a branch of science.\n \n Now we come to the problem with the \"theory\" of intelligent design. There simply has been no thinking involved. The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, \"well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that? We should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity.\" I also offer you this for humor: http://www.venganza.org/\n \n They are requesting that their \"theory\" says that we were all created for the flying spaghetti monster.\n \n The problem with ID is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the Earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was, evolution would be falsified. Intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it. That is the line between religion and science.\n \n If someone were to actually find some proof of ID and the reasoning behind their thinking of why a creator is a valid alternative to evolution, it would be considered science. Right now it is simply some people wanting to put religion in public schools. It would be similar to an attempt to teach \"another valid alternative is that there is no God, and there never was a God, and that people evolved entirely without a God\". Note that currently it doesn't mention the presence or absence of a creator. Evolution deals entirely with the process of life and how it evolves and ID involves creation. \n \n \n \n\n So who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.\n \n\n I completely agree with this here. We need to teach kids how to think, and unfortunately, ID doesn't seem to deal with thinking. Their only argument for allowing it is because school should allow opposing viewpoints. Now opposing viewpoints are a good thing, but science class isn't the place to discuss viewpoints. It is a place to teach kids how to think and the different ideas we have now. ID simply deals with the \"fact\" that there was an intelligent designer. It doesn't benefit science in any possible way, as there is really nothing you can conclude from ID. Through evolution we have been able to trace how life has evolved (which even ID admits) through time. We have been able to understand genetics and how genetics factor into our physical appearance by studying the evolution of humans through time by examining the fossil record. There is simply no benefit to the scientific community if ID is accepted. It's simply a view. No proof, no thinking, and no contribution to science, simply religion disguised as science.\n \n \n \n \n\n When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established, nor prohibited from being freely exercised, they probably wouldn't have considered atheism (the assertion that there is no God) to be a religion, because at the time it wasn't organized, or funded. The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time, as were other types of religion. They weren't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had, they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements, or money issues. They could see atheists needing protection from religion, but they couldn't see religion needing protection from atheism, because it wasn't organized. While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion, it can't be argued that it isn't an EQUIVALENT to religion today, with the organization and funding that it now has. 200 years ago, an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized. With today's communications, it does not. Just type \"atheism\" in any search engine and note the organization, and political action. \n \n\n I will agree that atheism can be considered a religion, after all it is a set of beliefs about the supernatural (that they don't exist).\n \n\n I'm not using the term \"atheism\" in a derogatory manner. It's an assertion that there is no God. But today it's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight, thanks to modern communications. It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion, and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion. It cannot claim science as its god, and force it upon public education.\n \n\n Of course not, but I fail to see how atheists are using science as its god, can you please explain that to me directly? Evolution doesn't refute god at all. In fact with evolution, intelligent design is entirely possible. But that still doesn't make it science.\n \n \n\n The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time, and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it, and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools. Today, the concept of intelligent design, (void of any certain religion and its associated faith) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists, who are afraid of it in exactly the same way.  I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows. Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding. \n \n\n ah, but why do you use the word concept for both evolution and intelligent design? Evolution is a theory that has been studied, given evidence, and offered up for peer review. Intelligent design is simply a concept, a single belief. Evolution is a theory that can be backed up and the world can benefit from it. How can the world benefit from a simple statement that there is an intelligent designer. This has absolutely no application to the natural world today.\n \n \n\n If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance. \n \n\n again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the \"theory\" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief.\n \n \n\n It is commonly claimed by secular scientists that creationism is a ?science stopper.? The contention is that to ascribe anything (e.g., the origin of living organisms) to the direct action of God is to cut off all scientific inquiry. This seems such simple common sense that it has been very persuasive. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to show that the argument is fallacious.\n \n\n I completely agree with this biologist. creationism does not stop science, in fact it is perfectly compatible with evolution today. Science hasn't dealt with the way life began because there is simply no way to objectively study evidence on this, as there has really been no data collected since no one was there. So whether we were created by the flying spaghetti monster, God, or aliens, all of science still applies. No religion stops science.\n \n The problem isn't that ID would stop science, but that it really doesn't contribute anything to it. It is a very valid religious belief, but it simply is not science.\n \n \n\n Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first.\n\n \n I can't speak for all opposing ID, but it is a perfectly valid religious beliefs and can be taught in any religion class. I have no interest in suppressing the idea, it just isn't science. I could complain that since we don't teach my opinion that abortion was wrong in science class we are suppressing it. \n \n But that simply isn't the case. Science class is for science, and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science, which is thinking. Until Intelligent Design can come up with evidence, as well as any potential advantage to the science community to ID, it will be nothing but a religious belief. And religion doesn't belong in the science class any more than politics does. A completely different subject which has it's merit, but not as real science.",

(hopefully I don't have to explain the outrageous \"round Earth theory\" :)) \n\n \n You don't have to explain it because it really has nothing to do with intelligent design. The flat earth thing is nothing more than a form of ridicule. The claim that medieval scientists and theologians believed that the earth was flat for hundreds of years was concocted in the nineteenth century, not by Darwin, and not necessarily with Darwin's approval, but to promote the cause of evolution that was (recently at that time) described in Darwin's 'Origin of Species'. While there may have been a few uneducated sailors that were afraid that Columbus would sail off the end of the earth in his quest to discover the \"new world\", the belief that the earth is flat hasn't really existed for hundreds of years. Of course no one believes it today, yet some people are still described as \"flat earthers\". It can by done to belittle intelligent design, or anyone who disagrees with an atheist scientific philosophy. \n \n \nBut now we get to the actual definition of science. To me at least, science is how knowledge is acquired, different possibilities, and objectively examining these possibilities as well as publishing them to the public for scrutiny. So basically science is the answer to the question of why or how. Why is it that when an apple is dropped, it goes towards the Earth? How fast does it go? When I drop it does it really speed up as it goes along? These are all matters of science, so basically almost everything in the world can be considered science, which is why I believe philosophy is considered a branch of science. \n\n \n We could go back and fourth several times carefully picking and choosing words and phrases to describe what we think science should be, and possibly not disagree all that much. But to focus on this debates resolution, we need to get to what science is in schools today - a murky combination of facts and theories. Considering what Stephen Grocott had to say (in the copy/paste in my first post) about the definition of science, I don't think we're going to get it any clearer than that. Which facts and theories are emphasized to students and which ones are not are determined by the worldviews of the teaching establishment. Scientific facts can be taught without the worldview of the teacher being a factor, but scientific theories cannot. Also, emphasizing one fact or theory over another will most likely reflect the worldview of the teacher, or the curriculum determined by the teaching establishment. So in an imperfect world, it's clear that not all of what is taught as science is actually objective and non controversial.\n \n \nNow we come to the problem with the \"theory\" of intelligent design. There simply has been no thinking involved. The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, \"well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that? We should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity.\" I also offer you this for humor: http://www.venganza.org/ \n\n \n That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your \"apple falling\" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. \n \n \nThey are requesting that their \"theory\" says that we were all created for the flying spaghetti monster. \n\n \n The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term \"flat earthers\" - ridicule without substance. It's much more recent however. It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson, a young college graduate with a degree in physics. He wrote it as a joke, as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools. That web page is a long one, with all the little pictures & everything. It probably started more simply than that, and grew after it became the cult hit that it did. It got attention on many other websites, and in the press as well. The Washington Post reprinted it word for word, and a New York Times headline read \"But is there intelligent spaghetti out there?\" With that kind of publicity for a view that desperately gropes for talking points, it's not surprising that it comes up in many debates here. We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared? :) Both terms, \"flat earthers\" and \"spaghetti monster\" seem to come up much more often than \"happenstance origins\", or even \"Darwinism\", a 150 year old concept that's troubled by several recent discoveries. Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument, and you haven't touched it. Can you? \n \n \n \nThe problem with ID is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the Earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was, evolution would be falsified. Intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it. That is the line between religion and science. \n\n \n The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. \n \n \n \n \nIf someone were to actually find some proof of ID and the reasoning behind their thinking of why a creator is a valid alternative to evolution, it would be considered science. Right now it is simply some people wanting to put religion in public schools. It would be similar to an attempt to teach \"another valid alternative is that there is no God, and there never was a God, and that people evolved entirely without a God\". Note that currently it doesn't mention the presence or absence of a creator. Evolution deals entirely with the process of life and how it evolves and ID involves creation. \n\n \n I agree completely. Why is it then, that the current teaching establishment has no objection to \"scientific\" terms like abiogenesis, and many others that strongly imply the absence of a creator? Atheism has become entrenched in public schools.\n \n \n \n \nI completely agree with this here. We need to teach kids how to think, and unfortunately, ID doesn't seem to deal with thinking. \n\n \n But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins. \n \n \nTheir only argument for allowing it is because school should allow opposing viewpoints. Now opposing viewpoints are a good thing, but science class isn't the place to discuss viewpoints. \n\n \n Then it is also not the place for abiogenesis, and so many other forms of science that presuppose that there is no God. Yet they are there, so ID should be there. \n \n \nIt is a place to teach kids how to think and the different ideas we have now. ID simply deals with the \"fact\" that there was an intelligent designer. It doesn't benefit science in any possible way, as there is really nothing you can conclude from ID. \n\n \n You can conclude that the odds of happenstance origins are more remote than previously thought. Ruling something out, or considering it less likely by using numbers is a very scientific and logical thing to do.\n \n \nThrough evolution we have been able to trace how life has evolved (which even ID admits) through time. We have been able to understand genetics and how genetics factor into our physical appearance by studying the evolution of humans through time by examining the fossil record. \n\n \n That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?\n \n \nThere is simply no benefit to the scientific community if ID is accepted. It's simply a view. No proof, no thinking, and no contribution to science, simply religion disguised as science. \n\n \n As Arthur Jones described in the copy/paste in my first post, there are benefits. You have not addressed what it said.\n \n \n \n I will agree that atheism can be considered a religion, after all it is a set of beliefs about the supernatural (that they don't exist).\n\n \n Then surely you can see that happenstance origins taught in science classes on the level that it is today comes dangerously close to violating the establishment clause of the first amendment! Do we rectify that by attempting to eliminate happenstance origins from science class? Nooooo, we rectify it by allowing the proper amount of ID in science class to balance it!\n \n \nOf course not, but I fail to see how atheists are using science as its god, can you please explain that to me directly? Evolution doesn't refute god at all. In fact with evolution, intelligent design is entirely possible. But that still doesn't make it science.\n\n \n What school child hasn't seen the sequential 5 or 6 pictures of a chimp, or ape, gradually turning into a man? How about all the scientific claims that man and chimps share a common ancestor? Abiogenesis strongly implies that there is no God, as does most of the dreams and theories of what has, and is, going on in outer space. If ID is not science, then none of the above is science, yet it is in today's science classes. \n \n \n \nah, but why do you use the word concept for both evolution and intelligent design? Evolution is a theory that has been studied, given evidence, and offered up for peer review. Intelligent design is simply a concept, a single belief. Evolution is a theory that can be backed up and the world can benefit from it. How can the world benefit from a simple statement that there is an intelligent designer. This has absolutely no application to the natural world today. \n\n \n Intelligent design is a recent concept (not associated with any one religion) and it hasn't had over 100 years to be studied. Why not start now? It can't happen if we block it from future generations. Why not give it a chance, study it, search for evidence, and offer it up for peer review? What are you afraid of? That it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories?\n \n \n \nagain, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the \"theory\" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief. \n\n \n I can't name specifics any more than a Darwinist of 100 years ago could name the specifics of microevolution and genetics that we know today. But I can name one thing in general - it has the potential to mathematically (and otherwise) challenge positive, self serving statements by evolutionists that presuppose that there is no God. Science has been, and always will be, politicized. \n \n \n \nI completely agree with this biologist. creationism does not stop science, in fact it is perfectly compatible with evolution today. Science hasn't dealt with the way life began because there is simply no way to objectively study evidence on this, as there has really been no data collected since no one was there. So whether we were created by the flying spaghetti monster, God, or aliens, all of science still applies. No religion stops science. \n\n \n But abiogenesis, and so much more of \"science\" attempts to stop religion - attempts to alter the worldview of students. In the Arthur Jones copy/paste in my first post, did you notice how he said that his professor, Otto Lowenstien, \"made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department!\" \n \n \nThe problem isn't that ID would stop science, but that it really doesn't contribute anything to it. It is a very valid religious belief, but it simply is not science.\n \n \n I can't speak for all opposing ID, but it is a perfectly valid religious beliefs and can be taught in any religion class. I have no interest in suppressing the idea, it just isn't science. I could complain that since we don't teach my opinion that abortion was wrong in science class we are suppressing it. \n\n \n You said;\n \n Biology shouldn't simply deal with the facts about different animals, natural selection, evolution, etc. but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts. \n \n \n If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.\n \n \n \nBut that simply isn't the case. Science class is for science, and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science, which is thinking. Until Intelligent Design can come up with evidence, as well as any potential advantage to the science community to ID, it will be nothing but a religious belief. And religion doesn't belong in the science class any more than politics does. A completely different subject which has it's merit, but not as real science.\n\n \n It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.",

   "You don't have to explain it because it really has nothing to do with intelligent design. The flat earth thing is nothing more than a form of ridicule. The claim that medieval scientists and theologians believed that the earth was flat for hundreds of years was concocted in the nineteenth century, not by Darwin, and not necessarily with Darwin's approval, but to promote the cause of evolution that was (recently at that time) described in Darwin's 'Origin of Species'. While there may have been a few uneducated sailors that were afraid that Columbus would sail off the end of the earth in his quest to discover the \"new world\", the belief that the earth is flat hasn't really existed for hundreds of years. Of course no one believes it today, yet some people are still described as \"flat earthers\". It can by done to belittle intelligent design, or anyone who disagrees with an atheist scientific philosophy. \n \n\n You completely miss the point here. A long time ago with the Native American creation stories some of them believed that the Earth was flat. It was just a belief, and teaching everyone that is similar to us teaching intelligent design, except at least they taught it as a parent and not as a public school.\n \n \n \n\n We could go back and fourth several times carefully picking and choosing words and phrases to describe what we think science should be, and possibly not disagree all that much. But to focus on this debates resolution, we need to get to what science is in schools today - a murky combination of facts and theories. Considering what Stephen Grocott had to say (in the copy/paste in my first post) about the definition of science, I don't think we're going to get it any clearer than that. Which facts and theories are emphasized to students and which ones are not are determined by the worldviews of the teaching establishment. Scientific facts can be taught without the worldview of the teacher being a factor, but scientific theories cannot. Also, emphasizing one fact or theory over another will most likely reflect the worldview of the teacher, or the curriculum determined by the teaching establishment. So in an imperfect world, it's clear that not all of what is taught as science is actually objective and non controversial.\n \n\n I can not agree with Stephen Grescott. I extremely doubt the fact that most scientists don't know what science is, we learned the definition of science in simple high school biology. Hopefully someone who has a degree in science knows what it is or the college is horrible. You can also not expect the definition given to be accepted as a neutral definition, when it's from such a biased source as answersingenesis.org.\n \n From dictionary.com:\n \n \"The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.\"\n \n This is the first definitioin, let me know if you disagree and you think one of the lower definitions is the correct one, but they don't seem to pertain to actual science in the classroom (packing a suitcase down to a science, etc.)\n \n Science is not \"a murky combination of facts and theories\" in the classroom, but the evidence is taught along with the theories. It is taught that theories are not fact but that they basically mean that the conclusion reached with the evidence we have right now is that theory, since no one has falsified it, and all predictions made have been correct.\n \n ID has no evidence, no predictions, and simply no way to falsify it. It's not science. It has no observation, identification, description, or experimental investigation. \n \n \n \n\n That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your \"apple falling\" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. \n \n\n You are going to have to explain what happenstance origins are, becase as said earlier, I couldn't find any definition from any of the dictionaries I searched, and all I get from google is a theology forum and a 101 contradictions to the bible. Neither is a very credible source. \n \n \n\n The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term \"flat earthers\" - ridicule without substance. It's much more recent however. It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson, a young college graduate with a degree in physics. He wrote it as a joke, as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools. That web page is a long one, with all the little pictures & everything.

We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared? :) Both terms, \"flat earthers\" and \"spaghetti monster\" seem to come up much more often than \"happenstance origins\", or even \"Darwinism\", a 150 year old concept that's troubled by several recent discoveries. Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument, and you haven't touched it. Can you? \n \n\n I understand that the flying spaghetti monster \"theory\" was a joke, but what if it wasn't? Would you give it the same credibility as Intelligent Design? Please explain why ID should be considered science if the Spaghetti Monster shouldn't. Or are you aggreeing that we should teach the Spaghetti Monster in public schools?\n \n \n \n\n The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. \n \n\n Please explain to me how radiometric dating is based on the presupposition that there is no God. You're telling me that if there was/is a God the results of radiometric dating change? \n \n Abiogenesis is not scientific theory, and for good reason. Like you said it just has no evidence. That's why it is considered a hypothesis. It is one of many including creation, which was taught in my public high school. I have no problem with this, but the problem becomes when it is taught as a fact or as a valid alternative to evolution. As long as the truth is taught, that there is really no proof for either abiogenesis or creation, I'm fine. But this debate is whether or not Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution.\n \n \n\n I agree completely. Why is it then, that the current teaching establishment has no objection to \"scientific\" terms like abiogenesis, and many others that strongly imply the absence of a creator? Atheism has become entrenched in public schools.\n \n\n I don't know what is taught other places, but my biology teacher was careful to make sure that we understood that none of it implied the existence or absence of a creator. Also, please support the claim that Atheism has become entrenched in public schools. A pledge is said every day affirming this nation to be \"under God\", but this isn't a pledge debate. Sorry if that's a bit off topic but it is in response and direct evidence against the fact that Atheism has become entrenched in public schools.\n \n \n \n \n\n But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins. \n \n\n You mention pursuing facts? I don't see how that's possible. For now assume that God created the Earth and the science commnity accepts that. What specific experimentation would you do? What would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge? How about some specifics?\n \n Also, you say that not teaching something is suppression? Does this stop you from teaching your kids that God created the Earth and everyone on it? Right now, what is taught invites the most thought. It's taught that a Creator is possible and it's also possible that there is no Creator. What thought does this suppress?\n \n \n\n Then it is also not the place for abiogenesis, and so many other forms of science that presuppose that there is no God. Yet they are there, so ID should be there. \n \n\n hmm, interesting philosophy. This debate is on whether ID SHOULD be in the science curriculum as a valid alternative to evolution. You're justification is that science already has theories that are unproven, so ID should be taught too? Besides the fact that this isn't true, shouldn't you be fighting against abiogenesis instead of for it and ID? We are arguing whether ID is a science, and we both seem to agree that it isn't, yet you justify allowing it into the science curriculum because the curriculum is already messed up so we should add more messed up stuff from the other side to balance it out? Sorry, that doesn't work.\n \n \n \n\n You can conclude that the odds of happenstance origins are more remote than previously thought. Ruling something out, or considering it less likely by using numbers is a very scientific and logical thing to do.\n \n\n Again, I don't know what happenstance origins are, but ruling something out because it's unlikely doesn't work. I have made the poker analogy very often. If you are dealt in order, the 3 of spades, then the 5 of hearts, then the 9 of clubs, then the 4 of diamonds, then the 6 of hearts, would you decide immediately that it was not true? The odds are (1/52)*(1/51)*(1/50)*(1/49)*(1/48) = 1/311,875,200.\n \n This could be done for multiple games. The odds get slimmer and slimmer, but the difference is that something had to happen. No matter what cards you got, the odds of you getting the same card in that order would be this slim.\n \n \n \n\n That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?\n \n\n Again, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one.\n \n \n \n\n As Arthur Jones described in the copy/paste in my first post, there are benefits. You have not addressed what it said.\n \n\n I most certainly did address his claim. I said he was right, God is not a science-stopper. BUT, that doesn't mean you teach it in school. The great thing about science is it is open to anyone willing to put forth the effort to perform experimentation and publish the results. If someone can find something out while assuming there was a creator, they should publish it. That's the great thing, is that no one is telling you ID is wrong, just that we shouldn't teach it as fact in science class. It currently is taught as a hypothesis, but the THEORY of evolution is a scientific theory. I fail to see why ID is even close to the level of evolution. The Flying Spaghetti Monster also has some possible advances, including the decrease in pirates. And science doesn't disprove the Flying Spaghetti Monster, but it doesn't teach it either, because it has no scientific evidence and is not falsifyable.\n \n \n \n\n Then surely you can see that happenstance origins taught in science classes on the level that it is today comes dangerously close to violating the establishment clause of the first amendment! Do we rectify that by attempting to eliminate happenstance origins from science class? Nooooo, we rectify it by allowing the proper amount of ID in science class to balance it!\n \n\n perhaps we should read the first amendment again. Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion (and other stuff, but that's all that pertains to religion). It means it shouldn't single out a religion. It shouldn't teach something just because it's religious, but it also shouldn't not teach something just because it's religious. Making a law banning the teaching of abiogenesis and ID as hypothesies would violate the first amendment because the only reason we would be banning it would be because of the establishment of religion. And even if the first amendment does say what you seem to think it does, you think the solution is to violate the first amendment more to balance it?\n \n \n \n\n What school child hasn't seen the sequential 5 or 6 pictures of a chimp, or ape, gradually turning into a man? How about all the scientific claims that man and chimps share a common ancestor? Abiogenesis strongly implies that there is no God, as does most of the dreams and theories of what has, and is, going on in outer space. If ID is not science, then none of the above is science, yet it is in today's science classes. \n \n\n I actually haven't seen those pictures in school but I'll take your claim that most kids have as true. No one says that Apes turned into men, but they did say that man and apes share a common ancestor. That is established scientific theory. Again, abiogenesis is not a scientific theory, so there isn't a comparison to that and making ID a scientific theory. The common ancestor has been virtually proven by the fossil record. How is that not science? Please explain in more detail.\n \n \n \n\n Intelligent design is a recent concept (not associated with any one religion) and it hasn't had over 100 years to be studied. Why not start now? It can't happen if we block it from future generations. Why not give it a chance, study it, search for evidence, and offer it up for peer review? What are you afraid of? That it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories?\n \n\n It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.\n \n \n \n\n I can't name specifics any more than a Darwinist of 100 years ago could name the specifics of microevolution and genetics that we know today. But I can name one thing in general - it has the potential to mathematically (and otherwise) challenge positive, self serving statements by evolutionists that presuppose that there is no God. Science has been, and always will be, politicized. \n \n\n Again, so does the \"theory\" of the flying spaghetti monster. Please explain how ID should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution but not the flyinig spaghetti monster \"theory\".\n \n \n \n\n But abiogenesis, and so much more of \"science\" attempts to stop religion - attempts to alter the worldview of students. In the Arthur Jones copy/paste in my first post, did you notice how he said that his professor, Otto Lowenstien, \"made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department!\" \n \n\n I believe this is wrong. But this is a private company, and if they want to discriminate based on religion, that's fine, just as a church may outlaw atheists. Do I agree with it? No. But does it have to do with our debate? No. This is about the science classroom. Also, again abiogenesis is a hypothesis, the same level as ID.\n \n \n \n\n If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.\n \n\n of course. But not as scientific theory. Some people believe that the Holocaust didn't happen, you want to teach that as a scientific theory?\n \n \n\n It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.\n\n \n Please explain how ID is suppressed. It is taught as a hypothesis currently, and even if it were banned from being mentioned in schools, scientists can still do all the research they want on it. And you should know censorchip usually makes the idea more popular, just as banning the f word makes more people use it. Scientists would do research on ID, there is no suppression.\n \n \n \n \n You have shown how there may be benefit if there is a God and we assume ID is true. No specific examples, and no proof it's true. This is simply a guess, a \"theory\" as used in normal terms. In the science terms that would be a hypothesis. It is currently taught as a hypothesis.\n \n The point comes down to the fact that the debate isn't about whether it should be taught as a hypothesis, but whether it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. You have admitted that not only does evolution have a lot of evidence, it has also led to many contributioins in science.\n \n You are the affirmative so it is up to you to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. So far you have shown that it's an interesting idea, that may in the future lead to some good things. But you have failed to prove that it is in any way even close to the theory of evolution.",

You can also not expect the definition given to be accepted as a neutral definition, when it's from such a biased source as answersingenesis.org.\n \n From dictionary.com:\n \n \"The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.\"\n \n This is the first definitioin, let me know if you disagree and you think one of the lower definitions is the correct one, but they don't seem to pertain to actual science in the classroom (packing a suitcase down to a science, etc.)\n \n Science is not \"a murky combination of facts and theories\" in the classroom, but the evidence is taught along with the theories. It is taught that theories are not fact but that they basically mean that the conclusion reached with the evidence we have right now is that theory, since no one has falsified it, and all predictions made have been correct.\n\n \n The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word \"phenomena\" is vague. \n \n The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths. \n \n \n \nID has no evidence, no predictions, and simply no way to falsify it. It's not science. It has no observation, identification, description, or experimental investigation. \n\n \n That's simply not true;\n \n \nSo contemporary arguments for intelligent design in both biology and the physical sciences are not only testable; they make predictions and are falsifiable in principle. Of course, if the arguments are true, then they are falsifiable only in principle, but not in fact (hardly a weakness in a scientific theory). We have given only two examples here. There are many other design arguments in biology, origin-of-life studies, and paleontology that are also empirically testable and that make predictions. Therefore, honest commentators should stop claiming that ID is empirically untestable, or that it makes no predictions. The claim itself has been tested and falsified. It's time to move on to other and more pertinent aspects of the debate over intelligent design.\n\n \n http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/intelligent_design_is_empirica.html#more\n \n \n \n \n \nYou are going to have to explain what happenstance origins are, becase as said earlier, I couldn't find any definition from any of the dictionaries I searched, and all I get from google is a theology forum and a 101 contradictions to the bible. Neither is a very credible source. \n\n \n From my first post, starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website;\n \n \nStudies of the origin of the first life form, of the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe itself do not form part of the theory of evolution. Such studies are pursued within different scientific disciplines. \n \n \n \n \nStudies of the origin of the first life form, the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design. Of the several \"different scientific diciplines\" refered to above, they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design, and that's undirected, random, happenstance processes. For purposes of this debate, can we come up with one general two word phrase for the \"different scientific diciplines\" - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design, which \"theory of evolution\" is clearly not? How about \"happenstance origins\"? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit. Does \"happenstance origins\" fit the same criteria? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design, there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins. If intelligent design isn't repeatable, happenstance origins aren't repeatable. Other scientists can't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist, and on and on. Evolutionists imply that with time, they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins. That's no more (or less) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design. If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science, why can't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science? \n\n \n Happenstance origins is my term, taken from two easily definable words. It means origins without intelligence. Origins from random, unguided, natural processes with no supernatural guidance. It is the first of about six different processes that make up the broad term \"evolution\". It's a process that any opposition to ID has to have. It can't be addressed, and it's no more or no less scientifically equal to the unaddressed question of where an intelligent designer came from. If the unaddressable consequential steps of one lead to science, then the unaddressable consequential steps of the other equally lead to science.\n \n \n \n \nYou mention pursuing facts? I don't see how that's possible. For now assume that God created the Earth and the science commnity accepts that. What specific experimentation would you do? What would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge? How about some specifics?\n\n \n As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think. \n \n \n \nAlso, you say that not teaching something is suppression? Does this stop you from teaching your kids that God created the Earth and everyone on it? Right now, what is taught invites the most thought. It's taught that a Creator is possible and it's also possible that there is no Creator. What thought does this suppress? \n\n \n Students become confused when the school curriculum implies that what their parents taught them is wrong.\n \n \n \nhmm, interesting philosophy. This debate is on whether ID SHOULD be in the science curriculum as a valid alternative to evolution. You're justification is that science already has theories that are unproven, so ID should be taught too? Besides the fact that this isn't true, shouldn't you be fighting against abiogenesis instead of for it and ID? \n\n \n No I shouldn't be fighting against abiogenesis, I'm for unrestricted freedom to explore it all! \n \n \nWe are arguing whether ID is a science, and we both seem to agree that it isn't, yet you justify allowing it into the science curriculum because the curriculum is already messed up so we should add more messed up stuff from the other side to balance it out? Sorry, that doesn't work.\n\n \n It works, because we live in a messed up world. In the US, restricting ideas is what doesn't work.\n \n \n \n \nAgain, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one.\n\n \n Neutral? One of the main standards and reference points for science and evolution on the internet is talkorigins.org. It's promoted as an educational site - a place with answers to criticisms of the evolutionary theory. It's every bit as biased as AnswersinGenesis, yet in many cases it's difficult for ID proponents to target. Part of the broad definition of evolution is microevolution, about the only segment of the broad term that is provable. They can masterfully employ that to make an ID proponent appear uninformed or irrational if he questions happenstance orignis, or other unproven evolutionary assumptions. They make their atheism clear in many ways however. They devote a page to comment about the \"International Flat Earth Society\", pretending they believe it to be a legitimate site. Almost any rational adult can see that it's phony. (Wikopedia calls it a hoax) There's nothing neutral, or even agnostic, about that site, and it appears to represent the anti-ID-in-schools mindset to a T. If there's actually a more neutral, agnostic, scientific website that opposes ID being taught in schools, I'd like to see it.\n \n \n \nI actually haven't seen those pictures in school but I'll take your claim that most kids have as true. No one says that Apes turned into men, but they did say that man and apes share a common ancestor. That is established scientific theory. Again, abiogenesis is not a scientific theory, so there isn't a comparison to that and making ID a scientific theory. The common ancestor has been virtually proven by the fossil record. How is that not science? Please explain in more detail.\n\n \n You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools. Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that \"theory\". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis. \n \n Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out. \n \n \n \nIt has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over. \n\n \n Today's students are tomorrow's scientists. They are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it.\n \n \n \n \nYou are the affirmative so it is up to you to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. So far you have shown that it's an interesting idea, that may in the future lead to some good things. But you have failed to prove that it is in any way even close to the theory of evolution.\n\n \n That I have failed to prove it at all is only according to the atheist worldview. A neutral, agnostic worldview may think they are somewhat comparable. The Judeo Christian worldview that is taught to many students by their parents would think that evolution (happenstance origins) isn't in any way close to ID. So we have two one sided worldviews, and one neutral one. Since a free exploration of ideas would give students the most complete picture, would interfere less with altering their worldviews that were most likely formed in the home, and would be most likely to teach them HOW to think, why are we dangerously close (thanks John Jones) to allowing one - one sided worldview to completely suppress another worldview in the science classroom? The answer of course, is politics. Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger. The government that once had limited powers has become more and more discoverers of emergencies and crisies, that entitle us all, particularly organizations, to a share of federal pie. Science has gladly hopped on board - they have the measuring devices, the microscopes and telescopes. \n \n In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion. In 2005 it's $28.8 billion. This is one of many government agencies that science \"serves\", and others have fat budgets as well. Leaf through Science magazine and you'll see that the maintanance of government spending on science is one of it's biggest preoccupations. To maintain it, science peddles hope and fear. Of course, some say that religion peddles the same thing. Science would rather not compete with it, and it certainly doesn't help when the new concept of ID, armed with the latest scientific discoveries, comes along questioning established scientific \"theories\" that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder.\n \n It used to be that religion and science didn't compete, and they shouldn't today. But they do, and there's only one difference from yesterday and today - government money.",

   "just in time for the 7-day deadlines. We just had final exams so my next post shouldn't take as long. But at least I'm within the 7 days. By a whole 15 minutes :)\n \n \n \n \nOh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more. That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post.\n \n\n I never compared the flat earth belief to ID, but yes I did compare it to the flying spaghetti monster. I am completely serious, I see just as much evidence for the flying spaghetti monster as ID. It offers just as much advantage to science as well. Please show me how ID will contribute to science more than the flying spaghetti monster will.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word \"phenomena\" is vague. \n \n\n that's the best thing about a dictionary, it has different words. Let's look up phenomena:\n \n 1. An occurence, circumstance, or fact that is perceptible by the senses.\n 4. An observable event.\n \n 2 and 3 are unrelated, 2 being plural and 3 being something about the philosophy of Kant.\n \n \n\n The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths. \n \n\n \n Of course some paths get more time, there's a finite amount of time in a science class which is never enough time to cover all of science. The problem is that you say it's a murky combination of facts and theories. While I take issue with the word murky, that is the RESULT of science, not what actual science is. Science is attempting to explain phenomena around us. This includes life, and why we're here. And as I said before ID is currently a hypothesis. This is science and it is ALREADY included in science class, just not as a scientific theory. This debate is whether ID should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution, which would be a scientific theory.\n \n \n\n That's simply not true;\n \n\n Which part? What evidence does it have? What predictions does it make? How would we falsify it before death? Please show me where there is observation, identification, description, or experimental investigation.\n \n \n http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/intelligent_design_is_empirica.html#more\n \n OK, I'll give you one. people can draw certain things from ID. But why doesn't he try to write it up as a scientific theory? Design an experiment to test his hypothesis and get it published. I'm sure if he can determine that there is Intelligent Design, there will be no shortage of scientific journals willing to publish his findings. As of now, they are ideas of what might be. That makes ID still a hypothesis, not on the same level as evolution.\n \n \n \n \n\n Happenstance origins is my term, taken from two easily definable words. It means origins without intelligence. Origins from random, unguided, natural processes with no supernatural guidance. It is the first of about six different processes that make up the broad term \"evolution\". It's a process that any opposition to ID has to have. It can't be addressed, and it's no more or no less scientifically equal to the unaddressed question of where an intelligent designer came from. If the unaddressable consequential steps of one lead to science, then the unaddressable consequential steps of the other equally lead to science.\n \n\n ok, thanks for clarifying. The problem is there is no scientific theory that has anything to do with the origin of life or the origin of the Earth. This is a hypothesis, just as ID is right now. In my high school bio class we were taught the hypothesis of ID, life being brought by aliens, and premordial soup I think was the last one, which was pretty much happenstance origins, no designer. Unfortunately we are debating whether ID should be taught as an alternative to evolution, a scientific theory.\n \n \n \n \n\n As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others.

It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think. \n \n\n Of course we should teach students how to think rather than what to think. This is why science avoids answering religious questions altogether. Not one scientific theory gives the answer as to how life evolved on Earth, because it's impossible to prove. You should also realize that what is studied in schools is a reflection on what is being studied by scientists. If there was a valid scientific theory proving that there was an intelligent designer, it would end up in school, too bad there hasn't been yet.\n \n \n \n\n Students become confused when the school curriculum implies that what their parents taught them is wrong.\n \n\n What about the kids who believe that the school is run by the mafia and that there are gold mines in the basement? What about the flying spaghetti monster? Should we teach that global warming is the result of a pirate decline?\n \n The point is that science and school should operate apart from religion. But I'm for teaching the law of gravity even though some may think that God pulls things towards each other. I'm fine teaching the causes of death rather than some guys sitting in a room with a bunch of strings and if they cut yours you die.\n \n If the parents feel that strongly about it, and are unable to convince their kids otherwise (in my opinion parents should teach their kids to have an open mind, but it is the parent's choice how to raise the child) home-schooling is always an option. I don't think I could be exempt from history class though if I said I believed that God created us 5 minutes ago and all that history stuff is XXXX. All the evidence we have so far says otherwise. Now this really doesn't have that much to do with ID. It is taught in schools as what it is, a hypothesis. An educated guess.\n \n \n \n\n No I shouldn't be fighting against abiogenesis, I'm for unrestricted freedom to explore it all! \n \n\n Agreed, but I'm not for teaching it all as fact, or scientific theory, when it isn't.\n \n \n\n It works, because we live in a messed up world. In the US, restricting ideas is what doesn't work.\n \n\n Again, ID is not restricted. It's taught as a hypothesis in science. It's probably covered in religious studies classes, along with philosophy. People are free to study it. Should I complain about my new writing system being suppressed because it isn't being taught in English class? It's another dialect written and spoken by me. Why should I have my ideas oppressed?\n \n It's not the same thing. My ideas aren't oppressed, I just don't get to make it mandatory for everyone else to learn how to speak and write like me. Same with ID. It is taught as a hypothesis and people are free to study it. But to claim that it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution is ridiculous.\n \n \n \n \n\n Neutral?

If it is then I agree with you, it shouldn't be, especially if it's calling the \"International Flat Earth Society\" a legitimate site. But I'm not talking about the website, I'm talking about the classroom. I don't know, maybe I was lucky, my teacher was pretty neutral about it. But then again I know we saw a tape and there was a Texas version that specifically ommitted every mention of the word evolution. I'm sure there are teachers and school districts on both sides of the fight but I believe in a science that is neutral towards religion, simply because of it's nature. Religion is possible, but it is not objectively provable.\n \n \n [qote=marc9000]\n You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools. Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation.

In studying the genetics and the fossil record (we share about 98% of the genes with apes I think), we can realize also through the studies of genetics that there must have been a common ancestor. This doesn't dispute an intelligent designer. God could have created the first life and from there they evolved. I also question the fact that more than half the population of the US believe in the Genesis account LITERALLY. I'm sure many say they believe in the bible's account, but it is interpreted in many different ways and many people believe that God created life to evolve. This claim is like me complaining that my theory of Me creating everyone else 5 minutes ago and implanting memories in everyone is being disputed because history is being taught, which is all lies in my religion.\n \n \n\n Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out. \n \n\n Please open your eyes. ID is already in. It is currently taught as a hypothesis. It is taught as a possibility, but not as a theory, which is pretty much a fact.\n \n \n \n\n In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion. In 2005 it's $28.8 billion.

It's not. It's a pool of knowledge and a method of thinking. Science SHOULDN'T compete with religion. Science deals with the natural world and religion deals with the supernatural.\n \n \n\n It used to be that religion and science didn't compete, and they shouldn't today. But they do, and there's only one difference from yesterday and today - government money.\n\n \n Sorry, you have failed to prove that religion and science compete.

   "just in time for the 7-day deadlines. We just had final exams so my next post shouldn't take as long. But at least I'm within the 7 days. By a whole 15 minutes :) \n\n \n Well, the ball has been in your court during the last 4 weekends so I figured maybe you were stalling around until the last minute to change the pace. You were on time - that's all that matters. :) \n \n \n \n \nI never compared the flat earth belief to ID, \n\n \n Sure you did;\n \nA long time ago with the Native American creation stories some of them believed that the Earth was flat. It was just a belief, and teaching everyone that is similar to us teaching intelligent design, \n\n \n \nbut yes I did compare it to the flying spaghetti monster. I am completely serious, I see just as much evidence for the flying spaghetti monster as ID. It offers just as much advantage to science as well. Please show me how ID will contribute to science more than the flying spaghetti monster will. \n\n \n I AM showing you, you're just refusing to acknowledge it. By claiming to be serious about your monster, you're doing the same thing that talkorigins and much of secular science often does, ridiculing ID instead of addressing it's scientific aspects. Even if it's established that ID shouldn't be taught in science class, shouldn't we also establish that it can't be ridiculed in science class? If the ACLU is waiting to sue if it's taught, should ID proponents have the same legal recognition to sue if it's ridiculed? So another of many good reasons to allow ID to be taught in science class would be to avoid legal complications, something even many evolutionists agree the US already has too much of.\n \n \n \n \nthat's the best thing about a dictionary, it has different words. Let's look up phenomena:\n \n 1. An occurence, circumstance, or fact that is perceptible by the senses.\n 4. An observable event.\n \n 2 and 3 are unrelated, 2 being plural and 3 being something about the philosophy of Kant. \n\n \n And the second best thing about a dictionary is how easy it is to show when someone attempts to leave out an important part of the definition.\n \n \nn. pl. phe\u00b7nom\u00b7e\u00b7na (-n) \n 1. An occurrence, circumstance, or fact that is perceptible by the senses. \n 2. pl. phe\u00b7nom\u00b7e\u00b7nons \n a. An unusual, significant, or unaccountable fact or occurrence; a marvel. \n b. A remarkable or outstanding person; a paragon. See Synonyms at wonder. \n 3. Philosophy. In the philosophy of Kant, an object as it is perceived by the senses, as opposed to a noumenon. \n 4. Physics. An observable event. \n\n \n As we now see, 2 and 3 are very much related, and they show how the definition of the word phenomena is vague, as I said. When the words \"perceptible\" and \"observable\" are included in the definition of the same word as \"unaccountable\", \"marvel\", and \"remarkable\", it's vague enough so that science applies it to happenstance origins, but not to scientific paths of ID. \n \n \n \n \nOf course some paths get more time, there's a finite amount of time in a science class which is never enough time to cover all of science. The problem is that you say it's a murky combination of facts and theories. While I take issue with the word murky, that is the RESULT of science, not what actual science is. Science is attempting to explain phenomena around us. This includes life, and why we're here. And as I said before ID is currently a hypothesis. This is science and it is ALREADY included in science class, just not as a scientific theory. This debate is whether ID should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution, which would be a scientific theory. \n\n \n I think you take issue with the word murky because you're not acknowledging much of the imperfect human worldviews and presuppositions that form much of the \"result of science\". \n \n \n \nWhich part? What evidence does it have? What predictions does it make? How would we falsify it before death? Please show me where there is observation, identification, description, or experimental investigation.\n \n \n http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/intelligent_design_is_empirica.html#more\n \n OK, I'll give you one. people can draw certain things from ID. But why doesn't he try to write it up as a scientific theory? Design an experiment to test his hypothesis and get it published. I'm sure if he can determine that there is Intelligent Design, there will be no shortage of scientific journals willing to publish his findings. As of now, they are ideas of what might be. That makes ID still a hypothesis, not on the same level as evolution. \n\n \n It can't happen if he has to overcome the obstacle of established \"theories\" to get anyone's attention. He has to get past emotional attention; \"you can't do that because it violates THIS established theory!\" before he can get to logical attention. Michael Behe has that problem all the time.\n \n One man, or a small group of men working with recent ideas can't make these things happen overnight. New young students with the latest scientific ideas need to be involved. They can't be if they're politically blocked from the ID thought process, like the things that were described in that link. Designed systems, casual powers of intelligent agents, and our growing knowledge of the cellular world and it's many mechanisms.\n \n Today, it can't be determined if there was intelligent design any more than science has determined that there were happenstance origins. Evolution, without ID, is an established scientific theory only because it's been politically established as one. Without the politics and presuppositions of today's humanist science, it's a hypothesis on exactly the same level as ID.\n \n \n \n \nok, thanks for clarifying. The problem is there is no scientific theory that has anything to do with the origin of life or the origin of the Earth. This is a hypothesis, just as ID is right now. In my high school bio class we were taught the hypothesis of ID, life being brought by aliens, and premordial soup I think was the last one, which was pretty much happenstance origins, no designer. Unfortunately we are debating whether ID should be taught as an alternative to evolution, a scientific theory. \n\n \n You're making a huge distinction between the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\", and assigning them with a biased presupposition. You've called ID a hypothesis; you've called everything associated with origins a hypothesis, yet you've elevated common ancestor evolution to the theory level. A theory can't have a hypothesis as it's base without a presupposition being involved. Common ancestor evolution fits generally only with atheism, since no major organized religion believes that a god created only simple life forms, then abandoned them. While there are some differences of opinion as to how the book of Genesis is interpretated, (a large time gap between the first few verses, for example), interpretations by established religions isn't all that complex. It's sometimes made complex by a small segment of atheism that mocks Genesis, or a small segment of atheists who masquerade as religious people. \n \n The bottom line is, ID fits many religions, but common ancestor evolution fits almost only atheism. You can claim that if origins aren't addressed it doesn't matter, but that's not the impression students are going to get if they're taught that common ancestor evolution is the ONLY established theory for the origin of humans.\n \n \n \n \nOf course we should teach students how to think rather than what to think. This is why science avoids answering religious questions altogether. Not one scientific theory gives the answer as to how life evolved on Earth, because it's impossible to prove. You should also realize that what is studied in schools is a reflection on what is being studied by scientists. If there was a valid scientific theory proving that there was an intelligent designer, it would end up in school, too bad there hasn't been yet.\n\n \n If we elevate common ancestor evolution to the theory level, beyond the hypothesis level of everything else, the religion of atheism is then elevated above everything else.\n \n \n \nWhat about the kids who believe that the school is run by the mafia and that there are gold mines in the basement? What about the flying spaghetti monster? Should we teach that global warming is the result of a pirate decline?\n \n The point is that science and school should operate apart from religion. But I'm for teaching the law of gravity even though some may think that God pulls things towards each other. I'm fine teaching the causes of death rather than some guys sitting in a room with a bunch of strings and if they cut yours you die.\n \n If the parents feel that strongly about it, and are unable to convince their kids otherwise (in my opinion parents should teach their kids to have an open mind, but it is the parent's choice how to raise the child) home-schooling is always an option. I don't think I could be exempt from history class though if I said I believed that God created us 5 minutes ago and all that history stuff is XXXX. All the evidence we have so far says otherwise. Now this really doesn't have that much to do with ID. It is taught in schools as what it is, a hypothesis. An educated guess. \n\n \n ID is about SO MUCH MORE than guesses, despite what the scientific community implies. \n \n \n \n \nAgreed, but I'm not for teaching it all as fact, or scientific theory, when it isn't.\n \n \n Again, ID is not restricted. It's taught as a hypothesis in science. It's probably covered in religious studies classes, along with philosophy. People are free to study it. Should I complain about my new writing system being suppressed because it isn't being taught in English class? It's another dialect written and spoken by me. Why should I have my ideas oppressed?\n \n It's not the same thing. My ideas aren't oppressed, I just don't get to make it mandatory for everyone else to learn how to speak and write like me. Same with ID. It is taught as a hypothesis and people are free to study it. But to claim that it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution is ridiculous.\n \n \n \n \n I'm not aware of this site being taught or mentioned in public schools, you sure? If it is then I agree with you, it shouldn't be, especially if it's calling the \"International Flat Earth Society\" a legitimate site. But I'm not talking about the website, I'm talking about the classroom. I don't know, maybe I was lucky, my teacher was pretty neutral about it. But then again I know we saw a tape and there was a Texas version that specifically ommitted every mention of the word evolution. I'm sure there are teachers and school districts on both sides of the fight but I believe in a science that is neutral towards religion, simply because of it's nature. Religion is possible, but it is not objectively provable. \n\n \n Yes we're talking about the classroom, but classroom's teaching establishments have to get their information from somewhere. If they don't get it from sources like talkorigins, then where do they get it? I see you didn't provide a more neutral example of a scientific source that I requested. Science has become too politicized for neutrality.\n \n \n \nThat's the point. In studying the genetics and the fossil record (we share about 98% of the genes with apes I think), we can realize also through the studies of genetics that there must have been a common ancestor. This doesn't dispute an intelligent designer. God could have created the first life and from there they evolved. I also question the fact that more than half the population of the US believe in the Genesis account LITERALLY. I'm sure many say they believe in the bible's account, but it is interpreted in many different ways and many people believe that God created life to evolve. This claim is like me complaining that my theory of Me creating everyone else 5 minutes ago and implanting memories in everyone is being disputed because history is being taught, which is all lies in my religion. \n\n \n Genetics (and all of biology) isn't the only source of truth when it comes to guessing about what happened in the past. The paths that ID can take us down (designed systems, mathemetics, etc.) could possibly trump a previous genetics guess, and all it's subsequent paths, and it could involve a lot of politics and money. The main reason \"science\" is afraid of ID. \n \n \n \nPlease open your eyes. ID is already in. It is currently taught as a hypothesis. It is taught as a possibility, but not as a theory, which is pretty much a fact. \n\n \n Mine eyes are opened;\n \n http://www.natcenscied.org/\n \nWe are a nationally-recognized clearinghouse for information and advice to keep evolution in the science classroom and \"scientific creationism\" out. \n\n \n http://www.au.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr006=ufrgzymwv2.app7b&abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=7795&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1241\n \nAmericans United, with assistance from the law firm Arnold & Porter LLP, filed suit against the El Tejon Unified School Districtlast week, seeking to end a course called \"Philosophy of Design\" that promoted creationist ideas, including \"intelligent design.\" \n\n \n Big bucks aren't being spent to thoughtfully keep ID in it's \"proper\" place, they're being spent to DESTROY it. If there are any hints by the ACLU and other similar organizations to partially leave it anywhere in schools, it's only for mocking purposes. \n \n \nYou act like science is a big bad organization. It's not. It's a pool of knowledge and a method of thinking. Science SHOULDN'T compete with religion. Science deals with the natural world and religion deals with the supernatural. \n\n \n They both deal with funding. It's a big part of them, and often what one of them does get is directly proportional to what the other doesn't get. It's reality and it can't be changed. Until only fairly recently, science was actually science driven, motivated by a genuine curiosity and a desire to discover. Politics has led to an increasing centralization of scientific research. Science is more and more associated with grant acceptances and refusals for universities. POLITICS. In the first part of the twentieth century, a grant refusal would not necessarily stop an idea from being presented and developed, because universities weren't nearly as dependent on government grant money like they are today. Today, a college grant can have an \"overhead\" charge that can amount to 50% of the grant. That charge goes directly to the university administration. Naturally the university is strongly motivated to associate with scientists who can obtain large grants. They couldn't very well get a grant to study ID if it has even a remote chance of clashing with a recent grant for evolutionary study, could they?\n \n There really is a financial interest that desires to silence the scientific paths that ID can take, and the debate and thought that it can lead to in schools from the grade school level to the college level, from today's generation to future generations.\n \n The most important thing that the teaching of ID can do, is hold secular science to a higher responsibility than it currently is to better prove it's theories, and discourage it from making atheist presuppositions, even if the importance of it's funding has to be secondary. The possiblities of benefits far outweigh the possibility of harm. Common sense has to trump politics. It's the reason ALL citizens, not just the educated, are entrusted by the Constitution to make many decisions. The US is in trouble when it puts biased politics in front of open ideas, and a desire for truth.\n \n I plan on using my one remaining post for recap purposes only.",

   "Wow, I sure like waiting until the last minute. But I got this in on time too, and this is my last post. I await your final post. Thanks for agreeing to this debate and thanks to the judges for judging this. I await your final post, and then the judges' final votes. Thanks, it's been fun and I have learned a lot. So no matter what the outcome I have benefited from this. Now here's my post, before I run out of time :)\n \n \n \n \n\n \n Sure you did;\n \n \n\n Yes I said it was similar. But the flying spaghetti monster \"theory\" is even more similar to it. It has some evidence, many followers (though not quite as many as ID), as well as being possible, and unable to be disproven.\n \n \n\n I AM showing you, you're just refusing to acknowledge it. By claiming to be serious about your monster, you're doing the same thing that talkorigins and much of secular science often does, ridiculing ID instead of addressing it's scientific aspects. Even if it's established that ID shouldn't be taught in science class, shouldn't we also establish that it can't be ridiculed in science class? If the ACLU is waiting to sue if it's taught, should ID proponents have the same legal recognition to sue if it's ridiculed? So another of many good reasons to allow ID to be taught in science class would be to avoid legal complications, something even many evolutionists agree the US already has too much of.\n \n\n Anyone can sue anyone for anything. The ACLU can sue if it's taught, and if you want to start suing school systems for ridiculing it, fine.\n \n Wow, the reason we should teach ID as a valid alternative to evolution (not just mentioning it) would be to avoid legal complications? School curriculum is not supposed to be made to avoid contreversy. It's supposed to teach so kids actually learn. Let's teach atheism while we're at it. As it is now Christians think we have too little God in school and atheists think there's too much. If we just straight out taught atheism we wouldn't have to worry about teachers qualified in religion (they wouldn't need to know the bible, etc.) and we would have half the lawsuits (from only the Christians). I don't agree with this because that's not what education is about. Education is not to stop contreversy, it's to get people thinking. I'm all for teaching ID as a current hypothesis, something that hasn't been proven but is a leading belief as to what may have happened. But to teach it as the same level as evolution (a scientific theory) is just plain stupid, because there is not even close to as much proof as there is for evolution.\n \n \n \n \n\n And the second best thing about a dictionary is how easy it is to show when someone attempts to leave out an important part of the definition.\n \n\n \n Yep, unfortunately I said in my original post why I left them out. #2 is the definition of the plural word and the 3rd has to do with the philosophy of Kant.\n \n \n\n As we now see, 2 and 3 are very much related, and they show how the definition of the word phenomena is vague, as I said. When the words \"perceptible\" and \"observable\" are included in the definition of the same word as \"unaccountable\", \"marvel\", and \"remarkable\", it's vague enough so that science applies it to happenstance origins, but not to scientific paths of ID. \n \n\n \n because they are different uses of the word. Are you trying to argue that science is the study of miracles? (or \"marvels\")\n \n Do you not understand the words unaccountable, marvel, or remarkable? You think they're too vague? Look them up too.\n \n And you keep trying to argue that ID is not considered science, but it is. There has just not been enough evidence set forth to consider it a theory. It is currently a hypothesis, a possibility along with happenstance origins. Evolution has to do with life as it is now, and can be observed. The origin of life, from ID to happenstance origins, simply wasn't observed.\n \n \n\n It can't happen if he has to overcome the obstacle of established \"theories\" to get anyone's attention. He has to get past emotional attention; \"you can't do that because it violates THIS established theory!\" before he can get to logical attention. Michael Behe has that problem all the time.\n \n\n sorry, but ID doesn't go against ANY established scientific theory. Please explain the scientific theory (as I said earlier, happenstance origins is NOT a scientific theory) that goes against ID.\n \n \n\n One man, or a small group of men working with recent ideas can't make these things happen overnight. New young students with the latest scientific ideas need to be involved. They can't be if they're politically blocked from the ID thought process, like the things that were described in that link. Designed systems, casual powers of intelligent agents, and our growing knowledge of the cellular world and it's many mechanisms.\n \n\n ohh, I see. So since right now we can't prove that something's true, the way to prove it is to teach it to our kids as true, and then hopefully they'll prove it's true? Again with the flying spaghetti monster. It could be true, no one knows for sure. Why not teach it as fact in school? Maybe someone would study Him and prove that He really exists.\n \n You explain why it is taught as a hypothesis. People are taught that a hypothesis is that there was an intelligent creator that created the Earth. If they want to find some way to test that hypothesis, either to prove or disprove it, I'm sure they could do that. You say that it has no chance of being proven true if we don't teach it as truth? That makes no sense, and could be used as logic to teach anything which currently can't be proven false, but is not established as true.\n \n \n\n Today, it can't be determined if there was intelligent design any more than science has determined that there were happenstance origins. Evolution, without ID, is an established scientific theory only because it's been politically established as one. Without the politics and presuppositions of today's humanist science, it's a hypothesis on exactly the same level as ID.\n \n\n You're saying that evolution is only a theory because of politics? Nice idea, but until you give me some proof I'll have to take it as that, an idea. Do you understand what evolution is? It has been observed and verified. It is as much a theory as gravity, or will you advocate teaching IF next (Intelligent Falling teaches that things gravitate towards bodies of mass because an intelligent creator makes them)?\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You're making a huge distinction between the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\", and assigning them with a biased presupposition. You've called ID a hypothesis; you've called everything associated with origins a hypothesis, yet you've elevated common ancestor evolution to the theory level. A theory can't have a hypothesis as it's base without a presupposition being involved. Common ancestor evolution fits generally only with atheism, since no major organized religion believes that a god created only simple life forms, then abandoned them. While there are some differences of opinion as to how the book of Genesis is interpretated, (a large time gap between the first few verses, for example), interpretations by established religions isn't all that complex. It's sometimes made complex by a small segment of atheism that mocks Genesis, or a small segment of atheists who masquerade as religious people. \n \n\n \n Because there is a big difference between hypothesis and theory. Here are the dictionary.com definitions, and I'll paste the whole definition since you didn't like when I only posted 2 last time.\n \n Hypothesis:\n 1. A tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation.\n 2. Something taken to be true for the purpose of argument or investigation; an assumption.\n 3. The antecedent of a conditional statement.\n \n I hope you will agree 3 is not what we are talking about\n \n Theory:\n 1. A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena.\n 2. The branch of a science or art consisting of its explanatory statements, accepted principles, and methods of analysis, as opposed to practice: a fine musician who had never studied theory.\n 3. A set of theorems that constitute a systematic view of a branch of mathematics.\n 4. Abstract reasoning; speculation: a decision based on experience rather than theory.\n 5. A belief or principle that guides action or assists comprehension or judgment: staked out the house on the theory that criminals usually return to the scene of the crime.\n 6. An assumption based on limited information or knowledge; a conjecture.\n \n \n now 4 and 6 are certainly not what is meant by a scientific theory, but the rest give pretty good definitions. Compare this to hypothesis, there is a big fundamental difference. ID is a hypothesis, an educated guess, while evolution is accepted as true because of the amount of evidence.\n \n \n\n The bottom line is, ID fits many religions, but common ancestor evolution fits almost only atheism. You can claim that if origins aren't addressed it doesn't matter, but that's not the impression students are going to get if they're taught that common ancestor evolution is the ONLY established theory for the origin of humans.\n \n\n sorry, but there are many religious people who believe in evolution (and even ID currently acknowledges that there was a common ancestor, just that God created it). And the reason they teach it is because it is true. We don?t teach things just because if we don?t people may be offended. It has been sufficiently proven, just as gravity has been proven. It is POSSIBLE that the theory of gravity is wrong. Maybe God decides when to attract two things together. Maybe the fairy does. We don?t know for sure, but we are almost positive that the theory of gravity (F = k*M1*M2 I think, but don?t hold me to it).\n \n \n \n \n\n If we elevate common ancestor evolution to the theory level, beyond the hypothesis level of everything else, the religion of atheism is then elevated above everything else.\n \n\n The problem is that we already have the common ancestor evolution at the theory level. It has caused many advances in scientific progress and Christianity is still the major religion in the United States. A common ancestor in no way relates to atheism. Atheism says there is no God. There is a perfect possibility of a God who created that common ancestor.\n \n \n \n\n ID is about SO MUCH MORE than guesses, despite what the scientific community implies. \n \n\n Well that is what you were supposed to prove through this debate. So far, you have not convinced me that there is enough evidence for Intelligent Design to be taught as a scientific theory. You have provided very good reasons to hold it as a hypothesis, and to encourage students as well as scientists to study ID, but not teach it as a scientific theory, because there is simply not enough proof.\n \n \n \n \n\n Yes we're talking about the classroom, but classroom's teaching establishments have to get their information from somewhere. If they don't get it from sources like talkorigins, then where do they get it? I see you didn't provide a more neutral example of a scientific source that I requested. Science has become too politicized for neutrality.\n \n\n Classrooms HAVE to get material from a website? How about a textbook? If I had my biology textbook from last year I would quote from it, but I assure you it holds open the fact that there is a God. What it does not hold open is that God created the Earth as it is today with no evolution. But I think that?s ok, they haven?t put in my theory about me creating everyone with their beliefs they are now. If you want to believe that God created the Earth as it is today, in fairies, Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, etc. no one is stopping you. Excuse me if I don?t agree with you that it should be taught as fact in school.\n \n \n \n\n Genetics (and all of biology) isn't the only source of truth when it comes to guessing about what happened in the past. The paths that ID can take us down (designed systems, mathemetics, etc.) could possibly trump a previous genetics guess, and all it's subsequent paths, and it could involve a lot of politics and money. The main reason \"science\" is afraid of ID. \n \n\n I am convinced that ID has the POSSIBILITY of producing evidence to consider it. I would welcome further study on this topic. Unfortunately, evolution has been established as fact and helped us a lot with a lot of accurate predictions. ID is open for study, but it should not be taught in the science classroom as fact.\n \n \n \n\n Mine eyes are opened;\n \n http://www.natcenscied.org/\n \n \n http://www.au.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr006=ufrgzymwv2.app7b&abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=7795&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1241\n \n \n Big bucks aren't being spent to thoughtfully keep ID in it's \"proper\" place, they're being spent to DESTROY it. If there are any hints by the ACLU and other similar organizations to partially leave it anywhere in schools, it's only for mocking purposes. \n \n\n \n certainly some people want it out of schools period. But that doesn?t mean that?s the way it is today. The first web site is simply an organization that has this belief. I?m sure there are many websites advocating teaching creationism too.\n \n The second website refers to a creation class. That is not ID, or even the science classroom. In my opinion it should be allowed to be offered, as long as it is optional to take it.\n \n And I?m glad you know why the ACLU does what it does, any proof for the fact that they are only ?mocking? it? I would think they?d either want it out, or they would defend it if someone wanted to take a case up.\n \n \n \n\n They both deal with funding. It's a big part of them, and often what one of them does get is directly proportional to what the other doesn't get. It's reality and it can't be changed. Until only fairly recently, science was actually science driven, motivated by a genuine curiosity and a desire to discover. Politics has led to an increasing centralization of scientific research.

They couldn't very well get a grant to study ID if it has even a remote chance of clashing with a recent grant for evolutionary study, could they?\n \n\n Universities are private organizations. I?m sure Christian colleges would welcome a student studying ID. So you are advocating changing the curriculum of PUBLIC schools, just so private organizations will think better of ID? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n There really is a financial interest that desires to silence the scientific paths that ID can take, and the debate and thought that it can lead to in schools from the grade school level to the college level, from today's generation to future generations.\n \n\n and that financial interest should stay outside of public schools. There are also financial interests that desire to silence evolution and teach creation (not ID, creationism). There are financial interests that want to start school-led prayer. should we start teaching atheism because of the groups trying to eliminate it from public schools? Of course not.\n \n \n \n\n The most important thing that the teaching of ID can do, is hold secular science to a higher responsibility than it currently is to better prove it's theories, and discourage it from making atheist presuppositions, even if the importance of it's funding has to be secondary.

It's the reason ALL citizens, not just the educated, are entrusted by the Constitution to make many decisions. The US is in trouble when it puts biased politics in front of open ideas, and a desire for truth.\n \n\n You act like evolution is changing constantly. The theory is written up for anyone to view. It?s not some hidden changing force.\n \n I believe the possibility of harm is much greater. Harm would be teaching our public school students that something is fact when it has simply not been proven as such. For you to call teaching ID as SCIENTIFIC THEORY, something it simply doesn?t have enough evidence to be, the quest for truth? It is taught as a valid hypothesis, open for investigation, yet you MUST have it be taught as an alternative to evolution (a scientific theory)? That is certainly not the quest for truth.\n \n \n\n I plan on using my one remaining post for recap purposes only.\n\n Actually, I did too, but I guess you presented too much here. In my responses I tried not to open any new arguments, just replying with what I have said before. I will conclude here.\n \n In this debate, it was your job to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. Evolution is a scientific theory. Lots of evidence for it, nothing has falsified it, and it has made many correct predictions that have helped advance scientific knowledge. ID is simply a hypothesis that the cause of life could have been an Intelligent Designer.\n \n You have certainly opened my eyes to the fact that Intelligent Design is actual science, and I?ll admit I went into this debate thinking that it should never be taught even as a hypothesis, and didn?t like that it was taught as such in our biology class. But you still have not convinced me or presented enough evidence to prove that it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. You have shown how there are possibilities of benefits from studying ID further, but that is different from teaching it in the science classroom as what is the closest to fact you get in science, a scientific theory.",

   "Thanks for agreeing to this debate and thanks to the judges for judging this. I await your final post, and then the judges' final votes. Thanks, it's been fun and I have learned a lot. So no matter what the outcome I have benefited from this. \n\n \n Likewise - I think this was a good, civilized one. You are mature beyond your years.\n \n The creation / evolution debate will rage on for a long time. There are even differences of opinion as to whether man will ever be able to get any closer to answers about the beginning of life, regardless of how much or how little evolution and ID are studied and/or compared. I think it's safe to say that common ground isn't going to be seen anytime soon. So how it is presented to students in schools is very important. \n \n The problem with the \"what should be taught in schools\" type of debate is that most everyone, including you and I, tend to somewhat quickly come to a conclusion based on our own personal belief system, rather than do some involved research on what is, and has been going on in our society, from the same (yet reversed) schools controversy 100 years ago that I referred to in my first post, to the ever changing political scene that's involved in today's \"science\". I've barely scratched the surface of these types of things in this debate, due to it's limited format, and the interest in keeping it brief and readable. The detailed information is out there and anyone can check it out. \n \n \n \nIn this debate, it was your job to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. Evolution is a scientific theory. Lots of evidence for it, nothing has falsified it, and it has made many correct predictions that have helped advance scientific knowledge. ID is simply a hypothesis that the cause of life could have been an Intelligent Designer. \n\n \n You've defined the very broad term of evolution that way throughout the debate. What parts of it actually have evidence and what parts do not is never clearly defined in detail, because if they are, questions about it are asked which Darwinist evolutionists have difficulty answering. I think this debate has shown that the pro-teaching-ID side has an in-depth argument that the anti-teaching-ID side can't match with much more than the surface emotion of appealing to existing worldviews. The proof of that is the obvious fear that today's scientific community has of ID being studied and debated by an infinite supply of new young minds. The rift between evolution and ID tends to fade if one can be open minded enough to recognize that they are both ways of seeking materialistic truth, each with it's own value. Evolution is one group of scientific paths, and ID can provide new scientific paths. If they clash, the truth will prevail. The inevitable, subsequent worldview clashes are far too important to leave only to naturalistic science to judge. \n \n \nYou have certainly opened my eyes to the fact that Intelligent Design is actual science, and I?ll admit I went into this debate thinking that it should never be taught even as a hypothesis, and didn?t like that it was taught as such in our biology class. \n\n \n I admire your honesty, but that's a big concession. Here's another, from your post #8;\n \n \nI will agree that atheism can be considered a religion, after all it is a set of beliefs about the supernatural (that they don't exist).\n\n \n If I convinced you of those in a 4/5 post format, I'll bet I could convine you of more in a longer, more detailed format. Another example of differences in depth of the two arguments, and why ID is feared by the scientific community. You won't see celebrity crusaders against ID, like Richard Dawkins, admitting those two things. He knows that one of the most basic, pure forms of accountability for his rants can come from students asking questions. The best way adults have to silence students is by intimidation, by a blanket delegitimation of the source of their questions, in this case, ID. \n \n \n \n \nBut you still have not convinced me or presented enough evidence to prove that it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. You have shown how there are possibilities of benefits from studying ID further, but that is different from teaching it in the science classroom as what is the closest to fact you get in science, a scientific theory.\n\n \n As I have stated, only science has established it as a theory, with little or no input from the general public, mathmetics studies, or history studies. The leaders of the scientific community have to exaggerate the status they have so far achieved, so as to limit theoretical options. Biological scientists simply don't like public scrutiny. Their objection to the public process is understandable because much of the public has moral principles that challange what science often wants to do with public funds, largely playing God. In what science has become, it occasionally needs some reversal in traditional morals, like the superiority of human life over animal life. Most of the many religions that are represented by ID contain human rights and values which can be roadblocks to much of what science seeks to do. It seeks utility - man and animal on exactly the same plane, routinely elevating one over the other as their current studies and experiments may dictate, from cloning to stem cell research to transplanting a baboon heart into a human. It's only logical that funding often comes from the same sources to keep ID out of schools as it does to eliminate 10 commandments displays from public places. Science sometimes needs things like \"thou shalt not kill\" to be replaced with more conditional human ideas that that allow humans to be killed under certain conditions, or that animals may at times be more worthy of life than humans. Experimentation, abortion, endangered species, environmentalism, etc. One word sums it up; POLITICS. It's part of science. We must deal with it, rather than wish it weren't true. Trying to hide it from students isn't the way to deal with it. \n \n Science has become corrupt. It has been organizing and crusading against religion long enough to be increasingly recognized as a religion itself. It's time for it to be held to the same first amendment standards that the rest of religion is. Often the best way to combat corruption is not by a government \"police\" action, but by simply allowing a more unrestricted access by new interests, interests that aren't hopelessly mired in government funding. To allow science classes to be slavishly bound to philosophical, naturalistic science without ID is an indication of indoctrination, not education. \n \n In this particular match up, I believe I've proved the resolution.

   "This is a pretty straightforward debate to judge. It took some twists and turns, but remained remarkably focused. \n \n I couldn't help but be impressed by zachvac's continued insistence of distinguishing between hypothesis and theory. This was the equivalent of a right hook in a boxing match and he never failed to score with it. I easily counted his use of two dozen references to ID being only a hypothesis--a belief--while evolution was an established theory. It is a superb example of hammering a point home, and keeping an eye on the gist of the resolution. \n \n Marc9000's main thrust was an interesting examination of how politics and the zeal for funding are the deciding factors on what gets taught in schools, but he was always met with that stubborn right hook. Realizing this one-note samba needed to be addressed, marc9000 attacked in his fourth reply (post 15). This is where the two fighters closed in toe to toe with a flurry of punches and in which the outcome of the debate hinged upon, IMO. Consider these exchanges found in post 16:\n \n \n\n Even if it's established that ID shouldn't be taught in science class, shouldn't we also establish that it can't be ridiculed in science class? If the ACLU is waiting to sue if it's taught, should ID proponents have the same legal recognition to sue if it's ridiculed? \n\n \n \n\n ...the reason we should teach ID as a valid alternative to evolution (not just mentioning it) would be to avoid legal complications? \n\n \n \n \n\n Today, it can't be determined if there was intelligent design any more than science has determined that there were happenstance origins. Evolution, without ID, is an established scientific theory only because it's been politically established as one. \n\n \n \n\n You're saying that evolution is only a theory because of politics? Nice idea, but until you give me some proof I'll have to take it as that, an idea. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n You're making a huge distinction between the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\", and assigning them with a biased presupposition. You've called ID a hypothesis; you've called everything associated with origins a hypothesis, yet you've elevated common ancestor evolution to the theory level. \n\n \n \n\n Because there is a big difference between hypothesis and theory. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n The bottom line is, ID fits many religions, but common ancestor evolution fits almost only atheism. You can claim that if origins aren't addressed it doesn't matter, but that's not the impression students are going to get if they're taught that common ancestor evolution is the ONLY established theory for the origin of humans. \n\n \n \n\n We don?t [sic] teach things just because if we don?t [sic] people may be offended. \n\n \n \n \n\n ID is about SO MUCH MORE than guesses, despite what the scientific community implies.\n\n \n \n\n Well that is what you were supposed to prove through this debate...\n \n ...it was your job to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. Evolution is a scientific theory. Lots of evidence for it, nothing has falsified it, and it has made many correct predictions that have helped advance scientific knowledge. ID is simply a hypothesis that the cause of life could have been an Intelligent Designer.\n \n\n \n Deftly deflected and finished off with--you guessed it-- the old right hook.\n \n My decision goes to zachvac.",

   "In Marc's first post, he states \"1) \"Intelligent design\" vs. \"theory of evolution\" are not very equal terms. Intelligent design concerns origins, and evolution concerns changes. Exactly, so in Marc's very first post, he acknowledges that Intelligent Design isn't the equivalent of evolution. The logical conclusion then is, it can't be taught as an alternative to evolution so the basic argument \"Resolved: Intelligent Design should be part of the public schools' science curriculum, taught as a valid alternative to the Theory of Evolution.\" is not balanced. If ID was the thesis, for example, evolution can't be the antithesis, so the debate is lost on the first post.\n Marc makes a further error in his attempt to redefin the term science and its implications. Evolution IS observable, testable and repeatable. Marc attempts to force the argument that evolution must also deal with origin as ID does, but he already conceded that the two weren't equivalents.\n Marc then goes on to introduce religion into the science debate. This, too, is a flawed argument and does nothing but muddy the waters.\n Zachvac does a nice job of staying focused on the main thesis that evolution is science and ID is religion because there is no hard evidence to either prove or disprove. Zachvac makes the point of stating that viewpoints have their place, but they aren't in science class.\n Marc attempts to appeal to authority and emotion in his statements \"If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.\"\n A reasonably critical observer would surmise that the number of people that believe something isn't necessarily proportional to the liklihood of it being true. \n \n Marc further muddies the debate with conspiracy theories about atheists, corrupt scientists and politicians.\n Zachvac stays the course and disputes Marc's claim that science has a nebulous definition, unknown even to scientists themselves. As a scientist myself, I find that to not be the case.\n Zachvac accurately points out the flaw in Marc's argument that by allowing some \"junk science\" into the curriculum, you must allow ID merely points out that the current curriculum is \"messed up\".\n Marc, again, goes into a conspiracy theory about governmental funding of science and concludes with \" In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion. In 2005 it's $28.8 billion. This is one of many government agencies that science \"serves\", and others have fat budgets as well. Leaf through Science magazine and you'll see that the maintanance of government spending on science is one of it's biggest preoccupations. To maintain it, science peddles hope and fear. Of course, some say that religion peddles the same thing. Science would rather not compete with it, and it certainly doesn't help when the new concept of ID, armed with the latest scientific discoveries, comes along questioning established scientific \"theories\" that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder.\n \n It used to be that religion and science didn't compete, and they shouldn't today. But they do, and there's only one difference from yesterday and today - government money.\"\n Marc comments about \"armed with the latest scientific discoveries\" when speaking of ID, but I don't recall him enunciating ANY of them.\n Overall, I found that Marc took an indefensible position and used the only tools available to defend it, emotional appeal. ID isn't the antithesis of evolution, so it shouldn't be taught as a counter to evolution. Even Marc conceded that natural selection was compatible with creationism AND ID. Zachvac was thrown a bone and he chewed on it sufficiently to get to the marrow. Good job and thanks to both Marc9000 and Zachvac for their time and efforts on an interesting topic.\n JP",

   "sorry for being late with my judgement\n \n this was a very interesting and civilized discussion. both of you kept on topic. it was established from early in the debate that marc was in the affirmative position and zach was challenging the assertion, and both roles were played well. \n \n marc held the view that intelligent design should be offered under the science curiculum in schools. he started off with a definition of science, but tried to point out that science itself was inadequately defined and suggested that what passes for school science isnt really science, since we dont really know what science is or should be. i think zach handled this well with the definition and emphasizing on the methodoly rather than results of science as the most importing aspect that should be taught. both debaters agreed here\n \n one point that marc raised that i felt wasnt properly addressed by zach was the proposal to further research for evidence that would support the id hypothesis. the scientific method starts off by observing a phenomenon. a possible explanation for the phenomenon is formed; this is the hypothesis. to determine if the hypothesis is true or not, controlled experimentation must be done. this is where id hits a wall. as far as we know now, there is absolutely no way to reproduce the conditions under which a creator designing a life form, or any physical phenomena for that matter. also, you dont test a hypothesis by actively seeking only information that will prove it true. you simply look for information. the hypothesis being true or not should be a natural process, not a guided one. the scientist shouldnt \"want\" the hypothesis to be true. id, however, starts off with a hypothesis (i.e., the unuversal was designed by an intelligent creator), and those that pursue the truth about that cannot \"want\" it to be true, but must let the facts decide the final verdict\n \n finally, one of the points that zach raised that had marc a little beaten was the statement that id was already being taught in schools as a hypothesis only, and so was abiogenesis, as a hypothesis only. i took it that marc was quite surprised by this, as it undermined a major part of his argument. but it is true that abiogenesis is only a hypothesis. however, there are universities currently actively working on trying to reproduce the hypothetical conditions under which abiogenesis could take place. the facts will determine, at the end of the experimentation, whether abiogenesis is at all possible, and then more theories will be offered to explain how it could be possible as the origin as life on earth. and of course there is a lot of funding, both federal and private, behind this.\n \n i would just like to point out, on the subject of funding, which marc raised, government grants for the purpose of furthering scientific knowledge are not by any means restricted based on religion or theism. well documented scientific proposals are considered for grants. so far, there has never been, in history, a scientific theory that demonstrated the intervention of a supernatural being. but we cannot assume that this means that funding is anti-creationist or atheistic. if a procedure could demonstrate a supernatural phenomenon in a replicable and consitant way, then by all means it would be in science textbooks right along with electricity and gravity\n \n \n in all, my verdict is that zach won the debate. he showed not only that id should not be studied in schools as science, but neither should abiogenesis, or any other untested or unproven hypothesis, no matter where the motivation comes from. well done to both of you",
