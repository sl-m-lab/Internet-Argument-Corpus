   "Yes, once you reproduce, natural selection is done with you.\n \n There is an ongoing study involving fruit flies, who have very short reproductive cycles, where they prevent fruit flies from mating until right before they are too old to reproduce. After many generations, the female flies begin to reach sexual maturity later and later, and as a side effect start living longer and longer. They are up to the equivalent of a human living 300 years or so, I think.\n \n I think this would be a nice multi-generational experiment in human longevity.\n If we can just keep a few genetic lines where the female waits until late in her life, and repeat it over generations, then we might end up with some 300 year old humans.\n \n A slightly better explanation about how natural selection kills you:\n http://www.dnafiles.org/about/pgm13/topic2d.html\n \n In sexually reproducing species, this process favors the traits that help an organism remain healthy until it grows old enough to reproduce successfully. So, genes that contribute to youthful vigor are likely to become more common in the population, and those that are harmful at a young age usually disappear.\n \n Genes that act late in life, on the other hand, aren't normally subject to the same selective pressure. By the time either beneficial or harmful effects kick in, it will be too late: the individual will already have borne any offspring. \n",

   "There are plenty of species where the female eats the male after mating, or kills him and lays eggs in his carcass. Such species are shortlived, and evolution has taken the road of short lives to quicken itself. The faster a species can evolve, the better the chances of surviving and expanding it's territory. It is also a way of population control.\n \n Most things that live beyond reproduction can reproduce many times. The idea here is to cross as many genes as possible to create a better mix. these creature evolve more slowly because they don't have to evolve quickly. They are much more generalized. They can eat a great many things, and can survive in a great many climates. The sex=death creatures are usually very specific in their niche, such as a creature that only eats one kind of food and is limited to one climate.\n \n they are simply two different stategies to the same goal: survival of the species.",
