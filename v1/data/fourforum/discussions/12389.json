I don't think the \"guns in common use at the time\" language from Miller tells us anything about the nature of the right.

The language does not address whether the right is fundamental or not. For example, the same limited scope is applied to the first amendment term \"speech,\" which has never been assumed to include false advertising, incitement to riot, perjury, etc. Such things are outside of the scope of the right, and are not protected.\n \n But both of these rights are by nature fundamental--they are both preservative of other rights. \n \n There is SCOTUS dicta which tells us that all the specifically enumerated rights in the BoR are fundamental. The challenge SCOTUS has had over the years is in justifying attempts to extend the \"fundamental right\" cloak to rights which are not listed in the BoR.\n \n On the issue of convictions taking away the right \"for life,\" let me say this: It requires due process-a right to be represented by counsel, a right to trial by jury, to call witnesses in your favor, the presumption of innocence and the requirement of guilt being proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

   "I am aware of that. I am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere.\n\n \n I agree with you to some extent. First, the Mr. Hayes was convicted of this crime before the Lautenberg Amendment was passed. Secondly, Virginian law (where the case originates from) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship (that which he was tried and convicted of) and between the agressor.\n \n Quote majority ruling:\n \n A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a \u00a7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. Pp. 4-13.\n \n Bulldung.\n \n If congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence. How the heck they came up with that is beyond me. They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, which is a big NO NO! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent.\n \n Quote Justice Roberts dissent:\n \n That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under \u00a7922(g)(9).\n \n ....\n \n The majority also points out that interpreting \"commit-ted by\" to modify the \"use\" of force would render the word\"committed\" superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading \"committed by\" to modify \"offense\" has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects \"less-than-meticulous drafting\" and \"syntactical awkwardness,\" and \"is not a model of the careful drafter's art.\" Ante, at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.\n \n Which is why this law needs to be rewritten.\n \n There is a lot more, but I find the majority decision hard to believe. It just doesn't make sense (well to me that is.)\n \n BTW, this by no means I support Domestic Violent offenders, etc. On the contrary, I believe they should lose their gun rights if convicted of domestic violence, BUT, this decision is wrong. The pieces do not fit together. That is Mr. Hayes was convicted of battery, not domestic violence. The government screwed up, so he should be walking free right now.",

We take away all kinds of fundamental rights (and sometimes even forfeit lives) so long as we follow due process.\n\n \n The problem I have with this is that it has always more or less been my understanding that the rational behind removing rights form felons was essentially that they had comitted a heinous enough crime that they had forfeited the rights of an American citizen...kind of a \"you crapped on America, you can be a second class citizen\" thing. \n \n Granted this is a slippery slope argument so not entirely logical, but when you start removing fundamental rights based on misdemeanor offenses it seems like it would logically allow you to remove virtually any right for any offense. If a conviction for domestic violence is enough to get your second amendment rights removed, why not your first amendment rights as well?\n \n Is there some kind of straight line correlation that exists between domestic battery and gun ownership that does not exist elsewhere? It just does not make sense to me that a guy can go down to the bar, beat the hell out of 6 strangers and be OK, then go home and slap his wife and for THAT he loses a fundamental right.",

In other words, it is a reason, but only one of the reasons. Let us say that the courts mention of a militia in Miller was sufficient to deal with the question which was before them. The Supreme Court usually rules narrowly. Just enough to deal with the question before them. \n \n Of equal interest, is the issue of standing. In Heller, which was first called Parker, the Supreme Court only found one of the 8 people, filing for relief in this case, had standing. Dick Heller.\n \n The Anti-gun groups had always made a big deal of Miller stating a variety of bad arguments to include one needs to be a member of the national guard, or that the 2nd Amendment only applies to states, and so forth.\n \n However, if this were actually how the S.C. Justices viewed the 2nd Amendment, in Miller, they would have never let this case come before them because Miller would have had absolutely no standing.

It's funny that I have heard some of the most anti-Second Amendment statements from people claiming to support the right. You should make up your mind if you want to follow the Second Amendment or not and that includes all of it including the preamble. A historian explains the importance and role of preambles in 18th Century law-\n \n \"So important was a preamble that many legislators were criticized for drafting them with patently untrue statements in order to direct the application of the statute. For this reason, Blackstone likened recourse to a preamble to consulting similar laws, because it was the role of the preamble to identify the purpose of the law. 'Of the same nature and use [as the preamble] is the comparison of a law with other laws, that are made by the same legislator, that have some affinity with the subject, or that expressly relate to the same point.' The preamble, then, was more than merely a 'justification' for a statute, but a positive guide for understanding the purpose of the text of the statute in relation to other enactments. In the words of Giles Jacob, whose law dictionary enjoyed wide usage in the eighteenth century, 'The Preamble of a Statute which is the Beginning thereof, going before, is as it were a Key to the Knowledge of it, and to open the Intent of the Makers of the Act; it shall be deemed true, and therefore good Arguments may be drawn from the same.'102 Blackstone's point about the preamble as a referent to other laws may contribute toward explaining why James Madison preferred placing the proposed amendments within the body of the Constitution rather than as a separate addition: placed within the body of the document, adjacent to the provision it was to affect, the purpose of each amendment would become clear. Set apart at the end and removed from the militia clauses of Article 1, Section 8, its purpose was less clear. With a preamble, however, its purpose was clarified by express reference to the militia.\"\n David Thomas Konig | The Second Amendment: A Missing Transatlantic Context for the Historical Meaning of \"the Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms\" | Law and History Review, 22.1 | The History Cooperative\n \n The Founders were extremely fearful that there would come a day when militia duty would not be required of large numbers of citizens- so much so that they were afraid to exempt even conscientous objectors from service in the militia. That day has already arrived. The individual rights interpretation which has been accepted by the Supreme Court does not require militia duty of anyone.

   "When they speak of the milita in the second they speak of the whole people. The second has never been about hunting. As a clarification this comes from my debate on another site a couple of years ago.\n \n This comes from the federalist papers #46 \n \n \n\"To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops . . . . Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\"\n \n I think you should read it again. I see no mention of state Militias. It talks of \"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation\", \n Americans arms not state arms. Being that the population of the US was approx. 800,000 back then, Madison meant by a militia half a million strong that militia would be every able bodied man. \n \n Lets not forget Hamilton #29 you should read the whole thing. Here&#8217;s some of it.\n \n &#8220;But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will really fit them for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.'' \n \n George Mason in the debate on the ratification of the Constitution before the Virginia assembly said: \"I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a few public officials.\" Mason was also the co-author of the second amendment. In his Fairfax County Militia plan wrote \" A well-regulated militia, comprised of Gentlemen, Free-holders, and other Freemen was necessary to protect our ancient laws and liberty from the standing army...And we do each of us, for ourselves respectively promise and engage to keep a good Fire-lock in proper order& to furnish ourselves as soon as possible with, & always keep with us one pound of gunpowder, four pounds of lead, one dozen gun flints, and a pair of bullet moulds, with a cartouche box or powder horn and a bag of balls.\"\n \n In Pennsylvania patriot and statesmen Noah Webster wrote, in advocating the ratification of the Constitution, \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.\" \n\n \n You see the people had just finished fighting a bloody war to throw off a tyrannical government. The armed public is what made that victory possible; do you really think they would give up that leverage that made their freedom possible and leave the door open for another to take it&#8217;s place? \n \n Even though the federalist papers have no standing in law they are the communication of the founders with the people who had to vote to ratify the constitution. The papers give the people the affirmation of their rights and responsibilities to the nation.",

So the fears that the Founders had when they drafted the Second Amendment have already been realized.\n\n Want a militia. YOU GOT IT! Welcome to the Militia Galileo. emoticon_wow\n   Who are the Militia today \n United States Code, Title 10 Chapter 13.\n \n (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. \n \n (b) The classes of the militia are - Organized and unorganized\n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard \n and the Naval Militia; and \n \n  (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.  \n\n   V. Drafting of the Federal Bill of Rights \nWhen James Madison found himself cast in the unlikely role of father of the national bill of rights,[234] he was not forced to write upon a clean slate. His first step was to obtain a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals, from the Pennsylvania minority onward.[235] The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals, many redundant and some questionable, a hard core of usable proposals had to be selected. The barriers to be surmounted required discarding all controversial proposals. As he informed Jefferson, \"every thing of a controvertible nature that might endanger the concurrence of two-thirds of each House and three quarters of the States was studiously avoided.\"[236] After excluding the controversial propositions, Madison still had to single out the most desirable proposal, and then (where several different proposals had been made to a single end) select the specific terms of the guarantee. Finally, he had to decide how to assemble and group the rights into a number of amendments. The last task was to a certain extent governed by Madison's plan (which had been retained in committee) to (p.54)interweave the amendments into the text of the constitution, in the manner of a modern \"pocket part.\"[237]\n \n His [Madison's] first step was to obtain a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals. The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals. Madison's decision to include a right to arms in his federal bill of rights is hardly surprising. Such a right had been demanded in virtually every call for a bill of rights; indeed, it had received twice the number of demands accorded freedom of speech. Language praising the militia had received much less support, essentially having been appended to the right to arms clause in Virginia and the two following conventions. But an adaptation of the Virginia/New York/North Carolina wording combining the two held unusual promise. One of Madison's major objectives was to \"bring in\" North Carolina. He hoped to convince it to ratify the Constitution by offering an acceptable bill of rights. North Carolina could hardly object to a nearly verbatim acceptance of its demand. \n And so the awkward wording of the 2nd was born along with a new nation. All of the above is the philosophy of our Framers, and part of the body of work known as the Standard Model.",

   "Let me go back over Miller for a moment. I believe it to be wrongly decided, I believe Miller stand for the position that I, a private citizen with no connection to a militia, can keep and bear military grade firearms. \n \n First, though, let me confess that the Miller Court decided to link the RKBA to the militia preamble: \n \n \"The Constitution as originally adopted granted to the Congress power- 'To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.' U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1, 8. With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\" U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 177 (1939).\n \n Therefore, the Miller Court does say that a purpose of the amendment is to help preserve an effective militia. Note, however, the second to last sentence says \"with obvious purpose\" and not \"with the sole purpose.\" \n \n Now let me look at the \"in common use\" language. Here is the quote:\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" Id. at 179 \n \n This does not express a SCOTUS rule on weapons and \"common use,\" however, no matter how much the Brady Campaign or others would like it to. It does not say or even imply, for example, \"you can't have (insert type of) gun today because it is not in 'common use' today.\" When viewed in context, this is nothing more than a SCOTUS history lesson which describes the general tenor of founding era state militia acts. \n \n Now let me turn to the language about the shotgun itself:\n \n \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\" Id. at 178.\n \n What the Court is saying, at least to me, is that if you can prove the firearm you have has some usefulness for militia service then the 2nd. A would protect your right to keep and bear it. The Court suggests one way to prove this is to show the weapon is part of the ordinary military equipment of the time. More on this in a moment....\n \n It is not surprising that the Court notes \"In the absence of any evidence\" because no one presented any evidence on this issue at the trial level. Neither Miller, his co-defendant Frank Layton, nor the Government could know to do so because SCOTUS created this as a new standard with its opinion. It is a violation of your due process rights for a Court to rule against you on appeal because you did not present evidence to meet a test it created after you had your evidentiary hearing. This is why the case was remanded back to the District Court so that Court could give Miller and Layton an opportunity to present evidence on whether the weapon would meet the new standard. It never went any further, however, because by this time Jack Miller was dead. He jumped bail while the case was on appeal. No one appeared to argue the case before SCOTUS on behalf of either Miller or Layton. Miller was actually murdered before SCOTUS ruled on his case-and on the remand Layton worked out a plea agreement which prevented any further appeal to SCOTUS. \n \n Still, the question remains: Does this language \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense\" justify my right to keep and bear current military infantry firearms? The answer must be yes. But, the thought of Miller justifying my right to go to the gun store and purchase a fully automatic M-4 rifle is too much for some to bear, and so some have attempted to invent a rule from this case which says \"fine then, but you can only have your military grade weapon as part of actual militia service.\" \n \n But there is absolutely no justification for claiming that Miller restricts my right to keep and bear a current military use firearm to only active militia service. The issue, which I have addressed before, revolves around Miller's standing to present a RKBA claim. \n \n Ask yourself this question: Why does SCOTUS talk about the weapon and not the man?\n \n Frank Miller was a bootlegger who got caught with a sawed-off shotgun. He was not associated with any state militia. Had the Miller Court wished to tie the RKBA to actual militia service, then it would have ruled that Jack Miller had no connection to any state-sponsored militia, was not keeping and/or bearing his shotgun for any militia related purpose, and it would have dismissed his appeal for lack of standing by stating, in effect, that as a private citizen Jack Miller could not make a Second Amendment claim. But there is no discussion at all about Miller and his lack of connection to any militia.\n \n SCOTUS's refusal to tie possession of his weapon to actual militia service was not a mere oversight either. When you look at this case, SCOTUS is telling us that it believes individual citizens have a right to keep and bear military grade firearms, and that such an armed populace historically formed the backbone for an effective militia. \n \n Look first at one of the authorities the Court cites for this principle:\n \n \"The American Colonies In The 17th Century,\" Osgood, Vol. 1, ch. XIII, affirms in reference to the early system of defense in New England --\n In all the colonies, as in England, the militia system was based on the principle of the assize of arms. This implied the general obligation of all adult male inhabitants to possess arms, and, with certain exceptions, to [p180] cooperate in the work of defence.\n The possession of arms also implied the possession of ammunition, and the authorities paid quite as much attention to the latter as to the former.\" Id. At 179-180.\n \n The body of the opinion also cites several other sources: Blackstone's Commentaries; Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations; a Massachusetts militia law of 1784; a New York militia law of 1786; and a Virginia militia act of 1785. Each of these sources-chosen deliberately by SCOTUS-affirms the principle that the militia was formed by calling forth a body of private citizens who already kept military useful firearms in their own homes. It is these sources which help provide evidence for SCOTUS' conclusion: \n \n \"And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" Id at 179.\n \n Now here is the rub. SCOTUS could have trod upon this \"let's form the militia from a universally military grade armed populace\" theory simply by telling us Miller had no standing to claim a RKBA. But SCOTUS did not do so. Instead, it turned the inquiry on the type of weapon this private citizen possessed-and whether his weapon could be used for the common defense if called for:\n \n \"Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\" Id. At 178.\n \n Now it is interesting enough that SCOTUS would cite an inferior state Court for something with approval. But, it is particularly interesting (and I believe telling) when you find the case which SCOTUS cites actually says the following:\n \n \"If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights. . . .\" Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n \n And this, finally, reveals why I believe SCOTUS did not look at the nature of the man but the nature of the weapon. SCOTUS holds that it did not matter who the man was. The man had a right, independent of militia service, to have a firearm which could contribute to the common defense. SCOTUS held that the right of the man was to possess a military grade firearm which could serve the purpose of preserving an effective militia-and which would also work to preserve his liberties. \n \n So, this is my Miller reading. Is there anyone who wishes to counter-argue that Miller does not stand for the position that I have a right to keep and bear an \"ordinary military equipment\" grade firearm?",

   "Bryan. That is an interesting review of Miller. Thanks for doing it.\n \n I, in no way, think Miller says we cannot have military weapons, but in fact, it recognizes that we do. But concealing in public can be regulated. \"A Militia being necessary for the security of a Free State,\" It is important to note that Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn. was a case about someone claiming that a concealed Bowie Knife was part of Militia equipment so he had the Right to (Bear) or carry it in public, and concealed.\n \n Aymette also listed types of Military equipment, and or weapons useful to a war fighter, to show what is part of T.O.&E., and that is the reason the Miller court cited it. The Bowie Knife could be restricted, because it was concealed, and he was not bearing it for the common defense. \n   Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) \n Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n \n Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment \n \n So, in fact, it may have been decided correctly, A Militia being necessary for the security of a free State, but because it was carried across state lines, and used in a crime, rather than being used for the Common Defense. However shotgun are very useful to the U.S. Army, and we have the Right to Keep such weapons. The sawed off part, and the used in a crime part, is the sticking point. No one has the Right to Keep and Bear arms for criminal use, and I think the court chose it's words carefully when it said, \"we cannot say.\"\n   Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n\n If Miller would have come in with clean hands, I think this case might have been decided differently. The courts are in some very stick situations, and try to make sure criminals do not go unpunished. \n \n I have often wondered, given this ruling, what if Miller would have come in with clean hands and sought relief from the court because he wanted to have a machine gun in his possession without being licensed. A machine gun IS useful of the common defense.\n \n Remembering again that short barreled shotguns and Machine guns are legal to own, but they are licensed and taxed, and the sticking point is that one cannot license a Constitutional Right.",

   " State Constitutions and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms \nForty-four states have constitutional guarantees on the right to keep and bear arms. \n \n \n Professor Eugene Volokh, of UCLA Law School, has assembled state constitutional right to keep and bear arms provisions, by date (from 1776). \n See:State Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Provisions, by Date \n \n 31 States file this brief in Heller. \n   BRIEF OF THE STATES OF TEXAS, ALABAMA, ALASKA, ARKANSAS , COLORADO , FLORID A, GEORG IA, IDAHO, INDIANA, KANSAS, KENTUCKY, LOUISIANA,MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI,MONTANA, NEBRASKA, W NE HAMPSHIRE, NEW MEXICO, NORT DAKOTA, OHIO, OKLAHOMA, PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, SOUTH DAKOTA, UTA H, VIRGINIA,WASHINGTON,W VIRGINIA,\n ND A WYOMING AS AMICI CURIAE\n Amici, the State of Texas and 30 other States, have an\n interest in this case because of its potential impact on\n their citizens' constitutional rights. The individual right\n to keep and bear arms is protected by the United States\n Constitution and the constitutions of forty-four States.1\n Given the significance of this fundamental right, the\n States have a substantial interest in ensuring that the\n Second Amendment is accorded its proper scope.\n \n The amici States believe that the court of appeals's\n decision-that the Second Amendment protects an\n individual right to keep and bear arms-is correct and\n fully consistent with the Framers' intent. ...\n \n Because the Second Amendment's text recognizes a\n \"right,\" not a \"power,\" and guarantees that right to \"the\n people\" and not \"the States,\" it necessarily secures an\n individual right to keep and bear arms. The First, Fourth,\n and Ninth Amendments likewise protect the \"rights\" of\n \"the people,\" and none dispute that those Amendments\n protect individual rights. The Tenth Amendment, in turn,\n expressly distinguishes between \"the States\" and \"the\n people,\" demonstrating that the Framers knew well the\n difference. And, this Court has made clear, \"the people\" is\n a term of art, with the same meaning throughout the Bill\n of Rights.\n ....\n That view is further buttressed by an unbroken line of\n commentary from the Framers to nineteenth-century\n scholars to the bulk of modern scholarship. Indeed, the\n unmistakable trend among constitutional scholars-even\n those who might otherwise disfavor private firearms\n possession-is toward recognition that the Second\n Amendment protects an individual right, as its plain text\n suggests.\n\n \n Sorry anti-gun people, anything else is just fantasy.

   "Let me first make a brief comment on Cornell's suggestion that the militia service issue was not addressed in Miller because the gun was dealt with first. Cornell misinterprets how SCOTUS deals with all cases, and in doing so he mistakenly puts the cart before the horse. If SCOTUS thinks standing is an issue, then it always addresses that issue first. The government raised this very standing issue before SCOTUS, and SCOTUS chose to ignore the argument.\n \n Now we come to a better question: Why talk about such an old case now after Heller?\n \n I want to talk about Miller because later interpretations of it provide an excellent example of anti-gun outcome based judicial and political thinking-where the desired outcome is formulated first, and then an attempt is made to force the case to fit the desired outcome regardless of what the case actually says.\n \n The Brady Campaign and other gun control organizations have for years told us that Miller ruled we only had a collective state's RKBA, and that no individual RKBA existed. In fact, there are any number of lower federal circuit court cases you can find which drank the \"Miller holds only for a collective state's right only and says no individual right exists\" Kool-aid. Here are two cases, for example, which the Brady campaign itself has cited in the past for its belief that Miller says we have only a collective states right:\n \n 1. Stevens v. United States, 440 F.2d 144 (6th Cir. 1971). Stevens cites to United States v. Miller for the following position: \"[s]ince the Second Amendment right `to keep and bear arms' applies only to the right of the State to maintain a militia and not to the individual's right to bear arms, there can be no serious claim to any express constitutional right of an individual to possess a firearm.\" Id. at 149. But Stevens does not quote from Miller, nor does it tell us where in Miller it finds this holding. Stevens only tell us that Miller must-somehow-support this conclusion. See also a line of cases citing Stevens for this baseless assertion: (United States v. Warin, 530 F.2d 103, 106, (6th Cir. 1976)(quoting Stevens); United States v. Kozerski, 518 F.Supp. 1082, 1090 (D.N.H. 1981)(quoting Warin on Stevens); and Krisko v. Oswald, 655 F. Supp 147, 149 (E.D.Pa. 1987)(quoting Stevens). All of these cases take the same position that Miller is an anti-individual right opinion, but they are unable to show us how it is so. They only tell us it must be so.\n \n 2. United States v. Johnson, 497 F.2d 548, 550 (4th Cir. 1974):\n \n \"See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206 (1939). The courts have consistently held that the Second Amendment only confers a collective right of keeping and bearing arms which must bear a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\" 307 U.S. at 178, 59 S. Ct. at 818.\" \n \n Again, Johnson does not tell us how it reaches this conclusion from reading Miller-only that it must be so.\n \n During this time the Brady Campaign argued these latter discussions of Miller stood for the gospel truth that Miller conclusively holds we have no individual RKBA, and the organization has filed countless Amici briefs arguing this interpretation of Miller.\n \n But, in the past 20 years the individual right's interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment enjoyed a resurgence of published writing, and some of those writers began publishing reviews of Miller suggesting it was in fact an individual right's supportive opinion. This very argument was taken to the Fifth Circuit in Emmerson, and from then on we began to see the gun control movement's conviction for the certainty of Miller wane. In fact, after Emmerson we began to see a steady drift into a somewhat defensive and alternative argument which can be characterized thus: \"Miller still clearly implies only a collective right, but if it does somehow support an individual right then Miller's holding is narrow, confusing, and can't be relied upon for much.\" \n \n The best example of this shift comes from another case often cited by the Brady Campaign: SILVEIRA v. LOCKYER 312 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2002). The organization still cites this case for the argument that Miller is a collective state's right only opinion, and this case provides the best example of outcome based judicial thinking:\n \n \"Our court, like every other federal court of appeals to reach the issue except for the Fifth Circuit, has interpreted Miller as rejecting the traditional individual rights view. In Hickman v. Block, we held that 'the Second Amendment guarantees a collective rather than an individual right.' 81 F.3d at 102 (citation and quotation marks omitted).\" Id at 1063\n \n Now the Silveira Court paused long enough to note that this \"Miller=only a collective right\" interpretation was challenged, and the retreat from that view is fully evident here:\n \n \"Appellants contend that we misread Miller in Hickman. They point out that, as we have already noted, Miller, like most other cases that address the Second Amendment, fails to provide much reasoning in support of its conclusion. We agree that our determination in Hickman that Miller endorsed the collective rights position is open to serious debate. We also agree that the entire subject of the meaning of the Second Amendment deserves more consideration than we, or the Supreme Court, have thus far been able (or willing) to give it.\" Id at 1064. (emphasis added by Bryan)\n \n But this was not the only time the Silveira court's retreat from the anti-gun gospel interpretation of Miller was revealed:\n \n \"The Supreme Court's most extensive treatment of the amendment is a somewhat cryptic discussion in United States v. Miller,307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed.1206 (1939).\" Id. At 1061 (emphasis added by Bryan)\n \n \"Like the other courts, we reached our conclusion regarding the Second Amendment's scope largely on the basis of the rather cursory discussion in Miller, and touched only briefly on the merits of the debate over the force of the amendment.\" Id 1061 (emphasis added by Bryan).\n \n \"As a result of its phrasing of its holding in the negative, however, the Miller Court's opinion stands only for the proposition that the possession of certain weapons is not protected, and offers little guidance as to what rights the Second Amendment does protect. Accordingly, it has been noted, with good reason, that ''[t]he Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the scope of [the Second] [A]mendment is quite limited, and not entirely illuminating.'' Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 710 (7th Cir.1999).\" Id. (emphasis added by Bryan)\n \n But, despite all this, here is how the antigun Silveira Court majority actually interprets Miller (without telling us where in the Miller opinion it finds this logic): \n \n \"What Miller does strongly imply, however, is that the Supreme Court rejects the traditional individual rights view.\" Id. (emphasis added by Bryan)\n \n Here, then, is the antigun Silveira Court's majority opinion on the very issue it agrees \"deserves more consideration than we, or the Supreme Court, have thus far been able (or willing) to give it.\" Rather than actually give the issue the consideration it deserves, the antigun Silveira court majority simply decides (in agreement with the Brady Campaign's argument, by the way) to blithely assume the desired \"strong implication\" from Miller against an individual right. \n \n Rather than give the issue the consideration it is due, the Court instead decided to hang it's opinion on a \"rather cursory discussion\" of a what it admitted was a \"somewhat cryptic discussion\" contained in Miller; which it admits \"fails to provide much reasoning in support of its conclusion;\" which it further describes as being \"quite limited, and not entirely illuminating\" and to which it finally agrees-in the end-\"offers little guidance.\" From this, the anti-gun Silveira court majority finds its desired \"strong implication.\"\n \n In short, an anti-gun judicial majority decided it wanted to reach a desired outcome of interpreting Miller-an outcome urged upon it by the Brady Campaign and other anti-individual right groups-and to reach that desired end it willingly acted like a blind man, in a dark room, trying to catch a black cat which was not there. \n \n This is simply not the stuff of which opinions denying me a fundamental right can be made. But courts have for years attempted to do this in the name of outcome based judicial reasoning--and the Brady Campaign has been a willing participant in many of these cases which have proselytized this fraudulent reading of Miller-including the argument it advanced in Heller. \n \n This is why I still talk about Miller. The Brady Campaign's arguments filed in these court cases have always urged the acceptance of this fraudulent view of Miller-and the same people who willingly misinterpret Miller in furtherance of their agenda ask me to trust them when dealing with other issues involving gun control.",

   "Another well done presentation Bryan. \n \n Scholars and historians have come to the rescue of the 2nd amendment in the past century to give it it's proper place in our Constitution, changing even the minds of Constitutional law professors who often disregard everything for Stare Decisis or settled law. Changing even the minds of Harvard's Liberal Lawrence Tribe and others.\n \n   Who Will Speak for the Second Amendment?  \n It reported that Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe had shocked many colleagues by stating that individual Americans did indeed have a right to keep and bear arms, he is \"probably the most influential living American constitutional scholar.\" Tribe's treatise American Constitutional Law is a standard text in many law schools and has been cited over fifty times in Supreme Court opinions. But Tribe corrected the oversight in a new edition published in 1999. \"As someone who takes the Constitution seriously, I thought I had a responsibility to see what the Second Amendment says, and how it fits,\" Tribe explained. \n\n I often marvel at this blind devotion to settled law even in the face of not only the 2nd Amendment, but also the 14th which is recognized to be a correction of this same abuse of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms by We The People themselves. \n \n Link   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says,  \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n \n Link   Testimony of Eugene Volokh on the Second Amendment, Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Sept. 23, 1998. \n 1.The Text of the Amendment Refers to an Individual Right\n \n The Second Amendment, like the First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments, refers to a \"right of the people,\" not a right of the states or a right of the National Guard. The First Amendment guarantees the people's right to assemble; the Fourth Amendment protects the people's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; the Ninth Amendment refers to the people's unenumerated rights. 1 These rights are clearly individual -- they protect \"the right of the people\" by protecting the right of each person. This strongly suggests that the similarly-worded Second Amendment likewise secures an individual right. \n",

   "What can we read into \"what was not said\" in Lewis v US, 445 U.S. 55 (1980)?\n \n This was a felon in possession case and he was challenging his GCA-68 Title VII \u00a71202 (a) (1) conviction and subsequent felony disablement of his 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. \n \n The Court discusses the remedies available to Lewis to relieve the disablement and restore his right to arms to essentially a pre-felony condition, before he illegally possessed a firearm. . .

Furthermore, footnote 8 recognizes that depriving a felon of a firearm is not equivalent to depriving him of a Constitutional right. \n \n \n\n Who knows why they mentioned Miller; the Court's reasoning did not consider the 2nd Amendment.\n \n \n The Court wouldn't say there was a militia membership requirement because there isn't one.\n \n And, as you say, it would be improbable for the Court to cite Miller as controlling since Lewis is a case of equal protection and due process. In Lewis the right to arms is just folded in without any specific 2nd Amendment argument. For good or bad this case was decided on the simple legitimacy of the statute's intent to address a legitimate government concern and due process / equal protection precedent.\n \n Your characterization of the Court citing Miller \"in favor of their argument\" is a big stretch . . . The substantive statement of footnote 8 could have stood without the Miller citation and quote.\n \n If this case were about the death penalty being imposed the Court could decide the case on the due process points and affirm the death sentence without addressing any 7th Amendment \"cruel and unusual\" issues . . . Likewise this case was decided without any meaningful 2nd Amendment inspection.\n\n This all seems like a diversionary tactic. Yes, I realize what the case was about, but I was trying to get you to address how citing Miller supported the Lewis court's thinking that prohibiting felons from possessing firearms does not \"trench upon any constitutionally protected liberties\" if Miller was only about the type of firearm that merited Second Amendment protection. You say \"Who knows?\" and then go on to repeat your claim that there isn't militia membership requirement as if saying it makes it so.",

   "Uh! Heller settled that! And how will you continue to disregard the 14th Amendment which was certainly widely regarded as brought up, and duly ratified to stop the abuse of the 2nd amendment rights among others. So the 2nd Amendment has been proposed, voted upon and duly ratified not only once, but twice. \n \n   Restoring the Privileges or Immunities Clause \nGiven that I.J. has unsuccessfully raised the issue before, why try to resurrect the clause now? The answer is District of Columbia v. Heller, the Court's landmark 2008 decision holding that the Second Amendment secures an individual right to keep and bear arms and that D.C.'s gun laws violated that right. One big question Heller did not answer is whether the Second Amendment applies only to the federal government (which oversees Washington, D.C.) or to state and local governments as well.\n \n At least one prominent leftist group agrees. Last December, the Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC), a think tank and law firm \"dedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of our Constitution's text and history,\" released a well-crafted, though dangerously incomplete study entitled, \"The Gem of the Constitution: The Text and History of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" This document argues that while the Privileges or Immunities Clause does safeguard gun rights from state abuse, it does not protect economic liberty.\n ...\n \n Such views are central to the historical backdrop that led the Radical Republicans to draft both the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment. In each case, they sought to protect African Americans and their white allies from the depredations of the former Confederate states, including the infamous Black Codes, which curtailed property rights, liberty of contract, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.\n \n Modern liberals might not like the sound of it, but the fact remains that the 14th Amendment was specifically designed and ratified to protect a sweepingly libertarian idea of self-ownership. That idea includes the right to acquire property, run a business, and buy and sell labor without unnecessary or improper interference by the government. A fully restored Privileges or Immunities Clause would help keep the Second Amendment secure and protect entrepreneurs like Erroll Tyler. Here's hoping the Court recognizes it sooner rather than later.\n",

   "VERDUGO in 1990 I believe. This was a 4th Amendment case but it said this interesting part. Chief Justice Sutor \n   U.S. Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. VERDUGO-URQUIDEZ,\n The Preamble declares that the Constitution is ordained and established by \"the people of the United States.\" The Second Amendment protects \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\" and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained by and reserved to \"the people.\" See also U.S. Const., Amdt. 1 (\"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble\")\n \n While this textual exegesis is by no means conclusive, it suggests that \"the people\" protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\n",
