   "HAVANA - Tearful relatives of Cubans killed in a 1976 airline bombing blamed on anti-communist militant Luis Posada Carriles denounced on Wednesday a U.S. court ruling allowing him to be released from jail on bond.\n \n Ailing Cuban leader\n Fidel Castro, in a signed statement, accusing American authorities of planning to free a \"monster\" after a U.S. judge upheld a decision to grant Posada bail.\n \n \"I'm outraged,\" said Iliana Alfonso, whose father was among those killed on the Cubana de Aviacion flight that exploded off Barbados. \"In the United States, they are talking about good terrorism and bad terrorism. To me, all terrorism is bad.\"\n \n Posada, a Cuban-born former\n CIA operative and naturalized citizen of Venezuela, is wanted in Cuba and Venezuela for masterminding the jetliner bombing, which killed 73 people - charges Posada denies. Cuba's government has repeatedly accused the U.S. government of protecting Posada by holding him on a far less serious charge.\n\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070411/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/cuban_militant\n \n So apparently the US doesn't want to hand over a airliner bomber...hmmmm",

To describe someone as a terrorist is to say something about his policy or tactics - i.e. the means he employs for achieving his ends. But to describe someone merely as a freedom fighter is to say nothing about how he wishes to achieve his ends (he might resort to peaceful means or he might not). It follows that one and the same individual can be both a terrorist and a freedom fighter. In other words, one and the same person can employ terror as his means while having freedom as his end. \n \n So terror is a means not an end, and there is an objective fact of the matter whether a so-called combatant is a terrorist or not.\n \n James.",
