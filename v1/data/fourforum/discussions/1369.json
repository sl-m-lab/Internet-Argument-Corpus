Parcum says that it's ok for the mother's body to reject the fetus as \"not viable\", yet he will also argue against the killing of extremely dependant disabled persons. What is the difference?\n\n \n I never said it was \"OK\" for the mother to have a miscarriage- I hope such a thing never happens. It just does. But if it happens, there's nothing we can do. It isn't anyone's fault usually. The main reason why the early zygote doesn't have the same medical care is because people in the medical profession usually don't know why the zygote is dying. Further, many women don't even know they're having a miscarriage in the first place. It's very difficult to understand the reason of the death of a zygote/embryo no bigger than an inch. \n \n \n If you don't think it's ok to let a born person die for being sick, why let a fetus die for being sick, if indeed you believe they should have equal rights to live? Why, if the mother is found to be unable to carry the child, is the child not immediately transplanted onto someone else's uterus? Should we not be following fertile and active women's cycle's to ensure that hey aren't unwittingly killing babies all the time- which they now are?\n\n \n We do save the fetus if it is sick. Doctors do it all the time. When women are pregnant with Down's Syndrome, there's a lot of doctors that make sure the fetus is ok. As a matter of fact, in Vanderbilt University, a doctor performing surgery to correct spinal bifida found that the 21-week-old fetus reached his hand out of the womb and grabbed the doctor's finger. Yes, we do offer health services for the fetus. But only when the mother wants to keep the fetus. Otherwise, she kills it. Basically, when the mother wants the fetus, it's human. When she doesn't want it, it's a blob of tissue. Pathetic. \n \n \n Don't these fetuses, if they are the same as live babies, deserve medical care to make sure they don't end up literally flushed down the toilet?\n\n \n Yes. They do. Unfortunately, science hasn't mastered that yet. Embryologists are discovering new things everyday.",

I have stated this several times, but you never address the issue or change the subject. \n \n It is alive. If you open up any biology book or medical dictionary, it'll say that the requirements for life are Metabolism, Reproduction, Stimuli, and Growth.. The fetus fulfills all of these requirements (it doesn't reproduce, but has the capability of reproducing, as do infants and children). Secondly, it is biologically human. It has human DNA, which makes it human. Third, it's it's own being, and not part of another being. If it was part of the mother would that mean the mother has a penis and vagina if the fetus was a boy? Two different blood types? Two brains? Two hearts? Two immune systems? Finally, biogenesis says the fetus can ONLY be a human, because sex with humans only makes other humans; not organs or potential humans, but humans. \n \n Sure, the fetus doesn't think, but neither do unconscious people. They have brain waves (sometimes more), yes, but that's not thinking. Thinking involves perceiving, being aware of your surroundings, having an opinion, feeling, et cetera. The fetus doesn't have a mind yet, but that doesn't mean we have a right to take it's life away. In the same way, we can't take away the life of unconscious individuals or those on a flat line.",

   " Nonsense. Anti-abortion laws are a recent phenomenon. What with the Civil Rights era and all, the value placed on human life is actually increasing. So is secularism, that's what you're really talking about when you say \"moral values\" are decreasing- there's no evidence of that, but religious values certainly are.\n\n \n You have stated that the fetus is a human being. Abortion is the killing of a human being, then. The killing of an innocent human being is murder. Therefore, abortion is murder. This is not a religious belief; this is the foundation of our moral beliefs; murder is wrong. Always. As Peter Kreeft says, there are two different pro-abortionists. There are the \"hard\" pro-choicers, and the \"soft\" pro-choicers. The soft pro-choicers believe that the fetus is not a human being, and simply need to be assured that it is a human being. Hard pro-choicers, on the other hand, believe the fetus is a human being, but say it's OK to kill them anyway. We must understand that if the fetus is a human being, it is ALWAYS wrong to murder it.",

   "This is not a religious belief; this is the foundation of our moral beliefs; murder is wrong. Always.\n\n Maybe yours. Not mine.\n \n Funny how you didn't respond at all to what I sadi, but are on another tirade again. Like as if someone just pulled a string in your back.\n \n Again, abortion being illegal is a very recent phenomenon. Much more recent than laws against murder. You were wrong when you said that \"pro-choice\" ia a sign of recent moral degradation- there was no need for \"pro-choice\" in the past because abortion was not illegal.\n \n \nWe must understand that if the fetus is a human being, it is ALWAYS wrong to murder it.\n\n A simplistic argument if I ever heard one. I also doubt yuo really believe it. Do you really think that it is always wrong to kill (I won't use murder because that's a legal term) a human being? Even capital punishment? Even in self-defense? You shouldn't use grandiose statements like this unless you are sure you actually understand and believe in what you're saying.\n \n \nDo you 'care' for the bacteria that make you sick?\n\n Not really. I can't communicate with it, so I can't really have a relationship with it. I don't \"hate\" bacteria either, I won't go out of my way to kill any and all bacteria I can.\n \n Bacteria is an interesting example I suppose of the kind of balance I believe in. I would not be able to survive without a certain level of bacteria in my body. My body is covered in microorganisms that co-exist symbiotically with me. I have e. coli in my intestines in all probablility, which does not make me sick as long as it stays there. Therefore, bacteria, despite what tv commercials tell you, are not \"bad\". In fact, I've read recent studies (source?) that show that anti-bacterial everything is very bad for the human system, and can lead to long term immune system problems. Bacteria are necessary, to a degree, and if they get to be too much or get in the wrong place I have to get rid of them. But I don't feel emotionally either way about them.\n \n At a higher level of complexity is a mouse. I have lived in houses with mice with no trouble, because we kept our food well sealed, our kitchen clean, and we had the deterrent of cats. I would not object to someone else having to get rid of them, however, even if it meant killing them. I do object to glue traps and certain poisons which are painful to the creatures. I find that cruel- and unnecessary.\n \n At a certain stage of fetal development a fetus of any given mammal is virtually indistinguishable from any other species of mammal. At that point I view the fetus as a creature similar in complexity/abilities/\n awareness as other mammal fetuses. Therefore I feel that if for some reason I (or someone else) must kill it, that is tremendously sad, but not the same as, say, murdering a born human.\n \n I am consistent in this belief, as I view the killing or torture of any very complex organism (for example bonobos, elephants) much more terrible than a much simpler organism (such as a fish or lobster). I don't think this has to do with the creature's worthiness. It's more complex than that, and has to do with-\n - my relative belief in the mental/emotional life of the creature\n - the ecological impact of the decision (I believe every part of a slaughtered animal should be used, for example)\n - the justification for it (I don't believe in killing creatures for decoration, etc., but feeding my family is another story) I also think people shouldn't hunt for sport.\n - the context of the decision (what are the options of the killer in this situation?) \n \n In terms of killing humans, I also believe that we must make rules to interact with each other in order to live intra-species, therefore we should avoid killing each other if possible for that reason.\n \n \nYou do think that the foetus is 'disposable' though.\n\n \n Absolutely not. I think it's tragic. I would also have my cat put down if she was in extreme pain (knock on wood), despite the fact that I care very much for her. I would mourn for her, as I would if I ever had to (knock on wood) have an abortion. \n \n Lucky for me, I have been sexually active for more than ten years and I have never been pregnant, contraceptives have always worked for me. I am a firm believer in prevention. I believe that abortion should be the last option when all other recourse is not possible. If I had ever gotten pregnant, I probably would have had the baby, because I have supportive parents who have enough money to help, and other things about my situation make it so for me the choice would be to have a child. That's just me.",

I don't.\n\n \n Again with the incredible feats of leaping deductive logic!\n \n Parcum said that the foundation of \"our\" (his) moral beliefs is that \"murder\" (killing a human) is wrong. Always.\n \n That is not the foundation of my moral beliefs.\n \n \nWhat do you mean recent? Where are you talking about?\n\n \n Parcum was trying to argue that fetuses had been considered human beings from time immemorial or something, that \"pro-choice\" was a recent phenomenon. I explained on another thread that abortion was only actually illegal in the US for c. 70 years at most, from the turn of the 20th century to Roe v.

Must I be angry at the bacteria to protect my health? Should I first decide whether the bacteria is \"evil\" or \"good\" before I bathe or take antibiotics (which I rarely take, BTW, as they are not good for my health)?\n \n There is no reason for me to feel anything towards the bacteria. That doesn't mean I should kill it. It doesn't mean I shouldn't either.\n \n \nAny geneticist worth his salt would be able to tell.\n\n \n Sure, they would be able to tell. But I said \"virtually indistinguishable\", which we are genetically as well- we have far more in common with other mammals genetically than we differ. So my point still stands.\n \n \nYou told me you had no hierarchy of animals.\n\n \n You are confused because you can't understand a worldview which differs from yours. I don't believe that being able to feel attached to a creature makes that creature \"superior\" or \"inferior\". I don't believe whether I should kill a creature has to do with it's \"inferiority\". No matter how different a creature is from myself, or how small, I don't think it makes sense to massacre other beings. Even bacteria. That is because I believe in balance, and I know that if I try to kill all bacteria I will make myself very unhealthy. \n \n If you won't/can't understand, so be it. However, I insist that this is different from a worldview which categorizes creatures according to whether or not they are human (\"worthy\"), and decrees it justifyable to destroy all other living beings.\n \n \nWhy should we? I know why I believe in killing being wrong, but what about you? What makes any human worthy -considering that you don't have any 'worthiness' test.\n\n \n You are really attached to this idea of \"worthiness\". As far as I'm concerned that isn't what it is about. For humans to be able to live functionally together we can't go about killing each other. That is how human cultures function best. Well functioning human cultures as a good thing, IMO. Nothing makes any human more or less \"worthy\" in my opinion. However, if I was face-to-face with someone systematically killing people (or destroying forests, etc.) for no good reason, I would try to stop them. If killing them was the only means I had, so be it. They are threatening the balance of things, which is threatening to me. I will protect myself and the earth, by any means necessary.\n \n \nNo you're not consistent.\n\n \n Yes, I am.\n \n \nAre you saying that people only undergo abortions because of sickness in the foetus? Otherwise, comparing a 'putting down' of a sick animal bears no analogy to killing a healthy human (foetus).\n\n \n I always think it's sad when a creature dies. That is the analogy.\n \n \nIf I had ever gotten pregnant, I probably would have had the baby, because I have supportive parents who have enough money to help, and other things about my situation make it so for me the choice would be to have a child.\n\n \n \nWhy would you have had the baby? Is it because your baby is worthy of living?\n \n\n \n Worthy, worthy, worthy... I already said why I would have the baby, and it has nothing to do with worthiness. \n \n \nsingle-mothers are entitled to financial help from the government, but still people have abortions here. I don't know the underlying cause, other than misinformation, because economics isn't really a factor.\n\n \n So you believe that because the government provides a pittance than economics musn't be a factor? Have you ever lived on government financial \"assistance\"?\n \n \nAs I had said, theists are taught that humans are above all other animals. That we're not animals at all either. If that were true than our DNA wouldn't be so simular to other animals. There wouldn't be any correlation at all.\n\n \n It's very strange. Can we caucus for a second on how wierd this non-aboriginal culture \"worthiness\" thing is?

Do you believe that the killing of innocent human beings is OK sometimes? \n\n \n Worthiness, punishment, innocence, guilt, blah, blah, blah...\n \n If you can't wrap your head around the fact that this is not how everyone views life and death, I guess I can't expect you to understand abortion.\n \n \nDoes that justify abortion? Of course not.\n\n \n Did I say it did? Of course not. Did I present it as a justification? No. Was I arguing the statement you made about the history of abortion?

   "What if my religious belief is that I can kill one person in my lifetime. Does that make it right?\n\n \n Depends which person I suppose. I wasn't arguing that you were wrong because others disagree with you. I was just saying that it is unrealistic to merely make such a statement as if it were a fact on a debate forum, and expect others to swallow that. The idea is you're supposed to argue why this is a good belief, not just state your belief and expect people to just take your word.\n \n \nMainly because Abortion was never considered. It's not that people had abortions, it's that people knew it was wrong.\n\n \n Your sentence is unclear. Are you saying people didn't have abortions because they knew it was wrong, or people did have abortions but knew it was wrong?\n \n Abortion was one of the common complaints that midwives and local healers would assist people with. That is how I know of so many herbal emmenagogues and abortifacients, because this knowledge has been passed down through the generations. Sorry, but herbal abortions were available and prescribed continuously so long as there were local \"unofficial\" healers, of which there were many.\n \n \nWhat if I don't view murder the same as you? (...)It's no wonder I can't grasp your concept- the concept is senseless!\n\n \n Not senseless, just complex. Bad things don't happen because people/creatures are \"bad\". Good things don't happen because people/creatures are \"good\". People make choices based on the options available to them. What might seem to an outside observer as a bad choice might be the best choice someone has in a given situation. That doesn't make the outcome any better, but it also means they are not entirely to blame for the outcome. \n \n You are judging whether someone should die based on your idea of \"goodness\" or \"worthiness\". That is not what matters when someone is making a choice like abortion, it is the circumstances that matter. If someone has a gun to my head, I really don't care if they're a good person or not. I will defend myself.\n \n Have you even paid attention to all the people in Death Row who are innocent? Do you know how many people with children, lives, experiences, etc., get killed so a politician can be elected? How many Iraqis with consciousness and emotional and intellectual depth died for Bush's \"victory\"? You have seperated the world into \"goodies\" and \"baddies\", and propose the strictest sentences on the \"baddies\" without considering the possibility that you might be completely wrong. You might be letting thousands of innocent people die every day.\n \n Yet you feel so morally righteous as to point fingers at women who terminate their pregnancies when it is just a fetus with a tail?",
