   "My girlfriend just told me to be nice. You can win people over with honey more easily than vinegar, she reminded me. \n \n I agreed, but knew that my instinct has never been to be nice. My instinct has always been to point out the error of \n peoples' thinking. God knows they've always pointed out the error of mine.\n \n Creation vs. Evolution? As much as scientific-minded people want to believe the debate is over, it most certainly is not. As long as creationism retains a voice, even a whisper, and as long as people in-the-know are willing to continue challenging archaic ideas, the debate is still around, even though we know it has been won time and time again from the laboratory to the excavation site.\n \n Lately I've been conducting my own informal interviews. I have asked friends and coworkers what they think about the debate. I am sad to report that the current score is 5 to 1 in favor of some kind of creationist-based explanation for the origin and diversity of species (I say \"some kind of\" because one gets the distinct impression that they don't quite know what they believe, provided their belief-system falls squarely out of the realm of hard science). My lone ally in this very unscientific survey literally gasped just this evening when I revealed some of the comments of the other five. Let me quote just three remarks from three different people:\n \n \"I don't believe that I came from a fish.\"\n \n \"Anyone who believes we came from apes is ignorant.\"\n \n \"Evolution has no evidence.\"\n \n Verbatim, by the way.\n \n These statements are hardly shocking or new to anyone accustomed to the platitudes of people who lack even a rudimentary knowledge of biology. We discount them as easily as creationists discount the overwhelming evidence in favor of evolution. We do, however, discount them at great risk. The debate is not over by any means. If anything, it has become more dire. If the ever-increasing evidence in favor of evolution is not directly proportionate to a general acceptance among the masses, we could have a serious problem.\n \n ABCnews.com reports:\n \n \n\"In views that diverge widely from those in other developed nations, about 45 percent of American adults take the Bible's story of creation literally. Only about one in 10 subscribe to a purely scientific explanation of evolution.\n \n \"In a November 1997 poll by the Gallup Organization that quizzed people about their views on the origin of humans, 44 percent agreed with the statement, 'God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.'\n \n \"Another 39 percent subscribed to a 'theistic evolution' view, that humans did develop over millions of years from lower life forms, but God guided the process. Only 10 percent said they believe in evolution with no participation from God. Seven percent had no opinion. \n \n \"The views have not changed much in recent years. A 1982 Gallup poll, asking the same question, found a virtually \n \n identical distribution of opinion.\"\n\n \n Source: http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/evolutionviews990816.html\n \n Another site I found which used these numbers for no other reason but to claim some hollow victory over evolution (as \n if the percentage of stupidity among American adults had any bearing whatsoever on the validity of evolution) indicated:\n \n \n\"An American poll on 'Creation vs. Evolution' just released in George magazine, published by John F. Kennedy, Jr., \n \n indicates that most Americans believe in the Genesis account of special creation and do not accept the theory of total \n \n organic evolution.\n \n On evolution:\n \n 51% do not believe that humans evolved from lower life forms \n 38% do believe in evolution\n 12% don't know, refused to answer\n \n On creation:\n \n 60% believe the world was created in seven days\n 27% do not\n 13% don't know, or refused to answer\n \n The poll noted the differences between those who describe themselves as liberal or conservative, with the majority of \n \n conservatives describing themselves as creationist.\n \n Of conservatives:\n \n 70% believe in a 7-day creation\n 30% believe in evolution\n \n Of liberals:\n \n 45% believe in a 7-day creation\n 58% believe in evolution\"\n\n \n To make these numbers even more bleak, one has to assume that the pro-evolution/anti-creationist percentages encompassed most of the votes from people with a scientific background and all of the votes from people with a biology background (perhaps with the few exceptions of all those \"prominent\" biologists that Christians keep telling us stand in direct opposition to evolution, but who never seem to get named or quoted --- the anonymous \"mystery\" biologists, we'll call them). \n \n (Continued)",

   "(Continued from above)\n \n So yes, in the opinion of this author, we have a serious problem. We also have a debate on our hands; one which is worth every ounce of energy we can put into it. What lies at stake is far beyond the scope of this post, but to nutshell it, it's only the future of the free exhchange of ideas and the very credibility of science in our public education systems. No big deal, right?\n \n It's no big news to anyone with a background in biology that the theory of evolution has withstood far stronger opposition than the meager assaults of mindless Bible-thumpers whose cumulative argument against consists of rehashed and outdated points that science itself has used to challenge the evidence, always followed by a lively chorus of \"Give Me That Old Time Religion (It's Good Enough For Me!)\". The opposition, of course, is not really opposition at all but scientific method at work. In short, science is its own best critic. If the theory can stand up to the harsh tests of scientific method, it can easily stand up to the firebrand skepticism spouted from the pulpits of the ringleaders of some 60% of Americans. The theory of evolution is not in jeopardy unless we start burning books and outlawing its teaching. Could that happen? I suppose anything is possible. I suppose even the Antichrist could be elected President one day. But I'm not terribly worried about it. I'm more worried about direct quotes from people I know at work. I'm more worried about polls I read in magazines and on websites. All of these things point to what we already see in action: the dumbing-down of America. It's not inherent to scientific-illiteracy either. Ask your typical American twelfth grader if he can tell you who Napoleon was or whether he can find Canada on a map. The situation is dire, folks, and the momentum seems to lie with the uneducated and apathetic among us.\n \n An interesting (but probably not very good) comparison can be made between the patience people have for evolutionary science and the recent Gulf War. Bare with me....\n \n Support for George Dubyah's crusade in the desert barely waivered even when the tanks rolled into Baghdad and a hundred thousand Arabs didn't throw up their hands and shout: \"Yes, here, they've hidden the chemical warheads in my \n attic!\" And yet, if evolutionary science requires so much as a single jawbone of a cretaceous fish and its not discovered in less time than you can say hallelujah, skeptics outside scientific circles declare in bold print that evolution is dead, creationism has prevailed once again, and praise God. A careful distinction should be drawn between what I wrote earlier about how the theory is not in danger from attacks outside science but yet the science itself is in great danger from prejudice, isolation and apathy spawned in large part by the unfair attacks and impatience of people eager to prove that grandaddy wasn't a chimp. I can see very clearly that evolutionary biologists are among the best and grittiest people in society. They willingly visit the garage sale and pick up that box with the jungle scene pictured on the front, plants and animals galore, and shake it. When they inquire about the puzzle inside, the seller freely admits that most of the pieces are damaged or missing. The evolutionary biologist buys the puzzle anyway and takes it home. He works on it day and night, carefully searches through hundreds of pieces to find that one link that will show an eye, an ear, a flower petal. Sometimes he is successful, sometimes he notes that a piece simply cannot be found. He knows he will never complete the puzzle, but his intention is to fit enough pieces together to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the picture forming on his kitchen table is in fact the same lovely image shown on the box. His wife, his children and his friends all traffic through the kitchen and tell him they can't make heads or tales of his image, and yet they are only glancing at it. They haven't seen it with the level of intimacy he has, hours on end, close up. He assures them it's a very big puzzle and yes, many pieces are missing, but there are still many pieces left in the box to be fitted together. He listens to their outrageous claims: \"No, it's not a jungle scene, it's a football field\" or \"It's a 747 coming in for a landing at LaGuardia.\" He says to his friend: \"Why would a puzzle of a 747 be contained in a box with a picture of a jungle scene? Look at this tiger's eye, right here in the corner of the puzzle. Do you see how it matches up perfectly with the tiger's eye on the box?\" The response from his friend: \"Yeah, but I don't think that looks like an eye. It looks more like a rudder to me.\" The biologist goes on: \"And what about this palm frond here? Same as the one on the box. Or the colorful plumage of this bird --- same as the picture on the box. I have hundreds of examples just like this if you'll just sit down for a moment and observe.\" His friend smirks, opens the refrigerator to grab a beer and remarks: \"You should just quit. You don't know what you're talking about. The guy sold you a puzzle of a commercial jet. I'm going to the family room. The game is starting in five minutes.\"\n \n And on and on he goes, plugging away, gathering evidence, supporting his jungle scene theory. Will his friends and family ever believe him? Does it matter if they do? Again, this is beyond the scope of this post but an interesting topic for future responses. To me, it matters very much that they believe him. Or \"accept his overwhelming evidence\" is more accurate.\n \n The above analogy fails on the level of consequences. What are the consequences of accepting the overwhelming evidence of something when doing so shakes the very foundation of your sense of self-awareness? For some people, apparently, the consequences are great. In this regard, evolutionary science gains the unlikliest of allies.\n \n Many of you are well aware of the comments of Pope John Paul II in 1996 when he stated that a belief in evolution does not conflict on a fundamental level with Catholics' religious beliefs. One thing in that article struck me as particularly interesting, and seemed to mesh well with Christ's words about giving to Caesar what is Caesar's, giving to God what is God's. It reads (Chicago Tribune, Friday, 10/25/96, \"POPE BOLSTERS CHURCH SUPPORT FOR EVOLUTION\"):\n \n \n\"The Pope's message went much further in accepting the theory of evolution as a valid explanation of the development \n of life on Earth, with one major exception: the human soul. 'If the human body has its origin in living material which preexists it, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God', the Pope said.\"\n\n \n Do I support belief in the soul? Absolutely not. I have no evidence one way or another. But I am completely unimportant in the equation. What is important is that the vast majority of evolution's opponents do believe in a soul, and the ultimate task at hand, if you believe such a task to be worth while, seems to be in teaching them to differentiate between the importance of concrete evidence and the importance of all things spiritual. On that particular battleground, perhaps the biologists are ill-equipped to fight. Perhaps, as has been the case so many times, it will be left to the poets to bridge the gap. I don't know. But if a starting point is needed, maybe the best starting point can be found in the following words:\n \n Give to God what belongs to God. Give to science what belongs to science.\n \n And my beloved girlfriend would be proud, I think. I did this with a minimum of nastiness, though it was against my nature to do so.\n \n MarkQuinn",

   "One of the more telling statistics to come out of polls about creationism/science is that fact that creationists tend to be less educated. The more educated a person becomes, the less likely he is to be a creationist. That statistic has been true across the board in every poll. Even Gallup himself (a fundamentalist Christian) has decried that fact.\n \n And when specific education in science is considered, those educated in science and are still creationists is almost non-existant, less than 5%. When you get to the biological sciences, the number of creationists falls to below 1%.",

As I recall, I think that about half of all people currently pursuing advanced degrees in the sciences (masters, Phds, etc) come from other countries. While I have absolutely nothing wrong with people coming from other countries coming here to get a good education, the fact that so few people in our own country are pursuing advanced degrees is a little mindboggling. \n \n As Lurch pointed out that creationists tend to be less educated, I am still surprised by the some people who I thought I knew well who still believe in it. A good friend of mine, who is very well educated told me the other day \"You honestly don't believe in any of that evolution stuff, do you?\" I thought he was joking at first, but apparently he wasnt.

If a person doesn't believe in evolution (or \"know it\", if I am to take the example from the article posted here entitled \"Do you Believe in Evolution?\"), that doesn't necessarily make him a creationist. There is a second alternative, which is pure apathy. I imagine that the vast majority of people, even if they poll in opposition of evolution on Gallup, don't really have an opinion or care enough to invest even a minescule amount of thought into it. Not until they are actually polled, when they provide their knee-jerk answers, then continue merrily along in blissful ignorance. Don't forget there are still SUVs to be washed, children to take to soccer practice, movies to attend and wives to cheat on.

   "Mark, it's good to see you haven't lost your intellectual edge. But you've chosen one whale of topic to chew on this time. And as you correctly guessed, I cannot resist the urge to bite.\n \n \nOriginally posted by MarkQuinn \n It's no big news to anyone with a background in biology that the theory of evolution has withstood far stronger opposition than the meager assaults of mindless Bible-thumpers...\n\n \n Mark, I must vigorously protest these statements. You have entered into this debate supposedly to demonstrate with logic, reasoning, and measureable evidence that the theory of evolution is the truth. But these statements do not support the theory of evolution. You are merely appealing to the authority of the scientific and academic community, and seeking to intimidate and bash the opposition into silence. This will not sponsor intellectual discussion and debate.\n \n I know it's very easy to attack the opposition. There are many who ignorantly follow the prescribed dogma without thought or question. Some even react voilently when their beliefs are challenged. But there are those among the opposition who are well educated, and yes, even educated in science, who dare to question the scientific community. In turn some in the scientific community have reacted just as voilently to those who would dare question them. \n \n So I must ask you, do you wish to be a champion of truth or a destroyer of the ignorant? Are you interested in discovering the truth or making personal attacks against the opposition? \n \n Just so everyone who reads this forum understands where I stand, I must confess to being in the opposition camp. I am a Christian and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and our Father God, the Creator of the Universe. However, I have a Masters degree and have studied science and math extensively. I do not follow my God ignorantly and blindly. Faith is as much an intellectual journey as it is spiritual growth. \n \n I have one motive: to discover the truth. If someone tells me that they believe in God, I ask them why. The question takes most people by surprise and they really don't know how to respond except for a few often repeated phrases. Why? Because they've never given their faith any thought. They believe the way they've always been taught. But faith is only geniune when it is your faith.\n \n The strange thing is, that these same statements can be made about the scientific community. The Theory of Evolution has been taught in the schools, colleges, and universities across this country for decades. It is generally accepted and taught as fact by scientists and academia. Anyone who questions this theory is scorned and laughed at. It's the educated elite vs. the ignorant masses. At least that is their proganda, their faith. \n \n I have sit through more classes under college professors and listened to them expound on the glories of science with as much enthusiasm and passion as any ignorant country preacher on the glories of God. I took an elective course in Logic, reasoning that it would help me in my scientific studies. I was shocked to discover that the professor didn't teach logic at all. I expected him to be a perfectively logical, intelligent man like Mr. Spock, but without the pointy ears. But this man was anything but logical or reasonable. He would introduce topics in every class for discussion and debate. During the first week of class, he described the wonders that science had worked in the world. He said that science was capable of accomplishing anything: finding a cure for cancer, lengthing life spans, creating a chemical that would clean up oil spills... \n \n On this last claim, I just had to speak up. \"Sir, you are right in that science can do amazing things. But they will not discover a chemical that will clean up oil spills. The oil spreads out over many miles, and the cost of a chemical that would do this would be prohibitive. Besides, there isn't a chemical known to man that will clean up an oil spill. They may discover a way to do this, but it won't be a chemical.\" The professor immediately jumped on me. \"What do you mean it won't be a chemical? Are you a chemist? How would you know?\" \n \n \"I've had a year of chemistry\", I replied. The professor smirks down at me from three feet away having strolled toward me and placing himself in a domineering position, \"Well, well, we have a young chemistry genius among us. I'm sure he must be an authority on the subject after a whole year of chemistry.\" He laughs out loud and many of the students join him in the mockery. Then he changes the subject without giving me a chance to respond. (Some years later, biologists discovered a little bacteria that consumed petrolem. Now they throw some bacteria in the oil spill, and the little devils eat and reproduce so fast that in no time, the spill is gone.)\n \n Now if you noticed, the professor was not teaching logic. He was teaching illogic: the power of fallacy, intimidation, and personal attacks. He was using illogic to win debates. The funny thing was, there were a number of pre-law students in the class. I wonder why they were there?\n \n Another topic that he presented was evolution. He talked about the theory proclaiming many of the basic tenets and concluded by saying that evolution had been proven beyond all reasonable dispute. A couple of students took offense at that statement, which was his plan of course. He proceeded to take them apart using the same sort of tactics he had used on me. I kept quiet, having already learned my lesson the hard way.\n \n And this was not the only professor like this, that I had the misfortune to encounter in school. The point is that many people within the scientific and academic communities do not care about truth, or logic. They work actively against it to further their own agendas. \n \n \nThe theory of evolution is not in jeopardy unless we start burning books and outlawing its teaching. \n\n \n I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics. These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology. They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone. They are the Laws of the Universe. For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth. \n \n The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact. \n \n If the Universe is running down, becoming more chaotic all the time, how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly, more organized, more complex. Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes. \n \n Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba. The goo is total chaos. The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature. The odds of random mixing by weather, earthquake, etc. that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion. It's not going to happen.\n \n Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature? \n \n Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study. What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness? \n \n \nGive to God what belongs to God. Give to science what belongs to science\n\n \n I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. \n \n Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, \"And the truth shall set you free\"!!! \n \n \nAnd my beloved girlfriend would be proud, I think. I did this with a minimum of nastiness, though it was against my nature to do so.\n\n \n I'm glad you reframed yourself. ; )",

   "frog,\n \n I guess I'll just have to respond.....\n \n  I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics.

For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth.  \n \n Your grasp of science isn't as great as you think....You claim evolution is only a \"theory\" but in science a theory is as good as it gets, there are no higher standards. There are no \"LAWS\" in science, laws are strictly a function of mathematics. There are no \"LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE\". That is why it is still the \"Theory\" of gravity, the atomic \"Theory\", the Heliocentric \"Theory\". None of these theories will EVER graduate to a law. They will never become \"LAWS\" just as the theory of evolution will never become a \"LAW\". You're foolishly confusing the common dictionary definition of theory with a scientific theory and they are vastly different. You also use the word \"proved\", any student of science will tell you that science does not deal in proofs, it deals in evidence. A scientific theory best explains the related evidence while making the fewest assumptions, it states the means by which it can possibly be falsified, it makes predictions on future evidence. Only when the theory can not be falsified and some of it's predictions are met is it considered a scientific theory. The theory of evolution is the best explaination for the diversity of life on this planet, in fact, it is the only valid theory for the diversity of life on this planet. It is one of the strongest theories in science. As for evolution itself, that is a fact. We have seen organisms evolve (both macro and micro) in the lab and in the wild, it can't be denied.\n \n  The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact.  \n \n You twist the 2LOT to fit your needs. The Second Law of Thermodynamics only applies to the transfer of heat energy. Your erroneous definition of the 2LOT would prevent plants from growing, animals from reproducing, snow flakes from forming, just to name a few. Evolution does not violate the 2LOT. Life reproduces, and it reproduces imperfectly, that and natural selection is all thats required for evolution to occur.\n \n Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. \n \n No it's not, chemical reactions happen all the time and they are not in direct violation of the 2LOT. You've seen snowflakes haven't you? Water freezes and becomes more ordered and forms an intricate pattern. \n \n It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes.  \n \n Creationists love to use this arguement but have no idea what they are talking about. First of all you're talking about the formation of the first life, Abiogenesis, which has nothing at all to do with the theory of evolution, they are two different theories. Secondly tell me how you calculated the odds for your assertion that it would violate the statistical probablity.....I'll bet even money on you not being able to do so.\n \n  Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba.  \n \n Once again you're talking about abiogenesis, not the theory of evolution, but I'll play along anyway. You really don't understand Abiogenesis or the theory of evolution if you think the first life was a single celled amoeba. The amoeba is just as evolved as humanity and no evolutionist believes amoebas were the first life. I don't know enough to give any in depth explainations about abiogenesis, but I do know that amino acids can arise from non living matter. And what makes you expert enough to casually dismiss the work of the thousands of biologists and biochemists who are working in the lab right now to demonstrate that life can come from non life? Science has not proven that life can't come from non life, despite what you are implying.\n \n  Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature?  \n \n Once again, it's not an accident, it's a product of imperfect reproduction beening acted upon by natural selection. Complexity can and does arise from nature, we see it all the time. New stars form from condensing gas clouds with no supernatural help.\n And DNA is evidence that all life on the planet is related and evolved from a common ancestor. Why would all life use DNA if they were not related? There are certain genes that all life posseses, why would discretely made, unrelated lifeforms have the same genes? \n \n  Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study. What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness?  \n \n The \"freak accident\" was no accident. Animals with larger, more complex brains were better able to survive and reproduce in their environment. So larger, more complex brains were selected for by non intelligent design. We see animals with varying degrees of cognitive ability, emotional state and self awareness. And once again, the larger and more complex the brain, the more advanced these traits are. It's obvious that our human conciousness evolved from our decendents animal conciousness. \n \n  Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, \"And the truth shall set you free\"!!!  \n \n Truth is not your ultimate goal, for unlike science which insists that the evidence defines the truth, you have already decided what is true and ignore any evidence that contradicts your dogmatic, dellusional worldview.",

   "Mark, I must vigorously protest these statements. You have entered into this debate supposedly to demonstrate with logic, reasoning, and measureable evidence that the theory of evolution is the truth. But these statements do not support the theory of evolution. You are merely appealing to the authority of the scientific and academic community, and seeking to intimidate and bash the opposition into silence. This will not sponsor intellectual discussion and debate.\n \n \n Just as you have a background in science Frog, I also have an extensive background in Christianity. A brief synopsis: starting at birth I was without consent given the supposed \"gift\" of Catholic faith. In highschool I met a kid and later on a girlfirend who were both Born Again Christians. I thought I'd dabble in it. The girlfirend and I went our seperate ways, but I remained a Christian and began studying the Bible. The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this (we can discuss it on a different forum), but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored. Don't ask me what they were because, again, this is not the religious forum and I'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were, but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse. Since that time I have tried my best to forget it. I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. So, in my mind I travelled east. I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history. After a year or two of this, when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions, and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton, meditating and burning incense, I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands (Think of the British sitcom \"Absolutely Fabulous\" --- greatest show of all time after Seinfeld), and that if you're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. It was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it.\n \n Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design). \n \n The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so. Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience, Frog. Up close and personal. They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith. But the basis by which we're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance. If enough people, enough books, enough teachers point to this single source and say \"it is truth,\" then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am going to buy it. I would prefer listening to people, books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth. If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible. If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh. If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible. If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside, take a walk in the woods, scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions: the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can. \n \n (continued on next message)",

   "(continued from last message)\n \n The Bible is a nice, neatly wrapped little piece of literature which asks us to believe in its validity based on no evidence whatsoever but instead on the Law of Parental Need-to-Know Insistence: \"Mommy why can't I jump up and down on the furniture?\" \"Because I SAID so!\" Fine for parents. Not fine for a lifetime commitment (unless you are prepared to take your pursuit of truth too far into the realm of faith, which I am not).\n \n So to me, yes, Frog, anyone who insists to others that their version of the truth is correct because they have a single book that tells them so (focus on the word insist here) is as mindless as it gets. I include very close friends and relatives in that and would (and have) told them quite candidly. I also have very close friends who claim to be Christians and extract nothing but the wisdom contained in the Bible. They believe that Jesus Christ generally did the things reported in the New Testament but make allowences for error, stipulating that if every New Testament account were wrong, they feel they have not wasted their time in thought or contemplation because they have been given an excellent blueprint for the way to live their lives. This, to me, is far from mindless Bible-thumping.\n \n I think I have made the distinction clear. That is as far as I will go toward an apology. Generally, I ignore the people who thump Bibles because they do what they do, I do what I do and we rarely cross paths or words. But when these same Bible Thumpers want to take their book and use it as the basis to discredit widely accepted secular science, they have crossed the lines and opened themselves up for every attack they have coming to them. I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution. I have been called ignorant. This damned well gives me the right to call someone mindless if I want to. The mudslinging occurs on both sides, and don't think I've never been on the receiving end of it.\n \n \nHowever, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God.\n\n \n Please don't insult me Frog by clarifying what Christ was talking about when he said give to Caesar what is Caesar's, give to God what is God's. As a matter of fact these words were in direct response to a question about paying taxes, [n]not[/i] a question about the religious pundits of his day. To me, my version of this statement holds water because in both cases --- Ceasar and science --- they are secular. My translation of Christ's words is every bit as valid as yours. I maintain that this was commentary about letting the secular world go about its business becase we (we in this case being followers of the soon-to-be New Covenent) have more heavenly matters to undertake. To me, Christ was saying mind your own business and be good little Italians of the Roman Empire --- you won't do much good for the cause sitting in prison or crucified on a tree. I would like to think Christ was wise enough that if he lived today he would have also told his followers to let science move forward and solve its problems, cure its diseases, launch its astronauts into space and yes, study the diversity of the beasts and the trees: \"ours is a higher cause.\" \n \n But that's the thing about the Bible, isn't it? We can pretty much translate it anyway we want. We can pretty much make our own conclusions based on our individual life experiences, our own mindsets, our own degree of objectivity AND whatever translation we happen to be reading at the time. Tell me, Frog, how many denominations of Christianity exist, all vying for a voice in the maelstrom of heavenly truth? How many arguments have been written over the centuries over interpretations of the same book? \n \n Science is different. In science it's a matter of who has the most convincing evidence. If we are to give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you HONESTLY tell me that creationsim is the best answer? If so (and I extend the challenge I made to Lappster) educate and enlighten us. I am eager (as always) to read the evidence for myself.\n \n I'm going to bet that all you'll be able to do (as you have done before and as every creationist faced with the challenge of providing evidence for ceationism has done) is try to find ways to invalidate evolutionary theory. Surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism. Disproving one theory does not prove another. All it does is disprove a theory. And based on Demon's excellent response to your post (one which I could never haven written, though I understood most of it and knew a good bit else), you have so far not even been able to disprove evolution.\n \n Again, please provide evidence that creationism is the best answer we have to the questions of the diversity and origins of species. If you tell us it's because God said so, this is not evidence. It's faith, which not all readers of this forum share. At least not your version of faith. And I know you would never suggest that anyone else should accept your version of faith --- after all, God gave us free will to chose.\n \n So again, I don't want to know the things you can disprove or philosophize about. I want to see the evidence. Given that, you will surely begin to change my mind.\n \n MQ",

The Earth is not a closed system, and therefore we can increase the local complexity here without violating that law. Your next argument will be of course that well, the universe is a closed system and that it can never decrease its entropy or increase complexity. Again false. Complexity can increase on local levels, at the expense of the increase in the entropy around it. This occurs when gravity overcomes the entropy caused by temperature. Hence, we get small clusters of increased complexity(stars) in an overwhemingly empty universe, in which disorder is increasing. I've only taken a year of physics, so dont quote me on this though.",

   "I find it amazing that you call yourself Demon38. That's not a criticisim or a put down. I only mean it seems to be a straightforward declaration of your complete opposition to all things religious. \n \n \nYour grasp of science isn't as great as you think....You claim evolution is only a \"theory\" but in science a theory is as good as it gets, there are no higher standards. There are no \"LAWS\" in science, laws are strictly a function of mathematics. There are no \"LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE\". That is why it is still the \"Theory\" of gravity, the atomic \"Theory\", the Heliocentric \"Theory\". None of these theories will EVER graduate to a law.\n\n \n You are right that I am not a scientist, and your grasp of evolution is much more complete than mine. And laws are a function of mathematics. That's because mathematics is precise. You can run the equations again and again and come up with the same answers every time. And guess what, the universe is based on mathematics! If you can determine the mathematics that describes a physical phenomena, you can model it. You can create a simulation that will approximate the behavior of the phenomena and predict its behavior under various conditions. The physical sciences are based on mathematics. Scientists are concerned with theories and these are constantly under scrutiny and ever changing. However, when scientists are able to prove their theories they are applied to the real world. That's where theories become laws. You are incorrect in this respect. There is a law of gravity, there are laws of thermodynamics, laws of motion, etc., etc. Pick up any Phsyics book and look them up. They are laws because they have been proven both mathematically and experimentally. \n \n Newton's Laws of Motion are a case in point. They are extremely powerful mathematical tools that can be used to design all manner of machines, airplanes, cars, weapons, spacecraft, etc. These tools were developed by Sir Isaac Newton and have stood the test of time and laid the foundation for modern technology. However, scientists who came after Newton discovered that Newton's theories and mathematics did not account for all the physical observations and experimentation. Albert Einstein, who had flunked mathematics in school, comes along and develops the Theory of Relativity that seems to fill in some of the gaps. His math proved to be sheer genius and has shed more light on the true nature of the universe with his energy to mass relationship and theory of relativity. From this, a whole new branch of science has been established continue to unravel the mysteries. However, there are still some missing components that prevent a final universal mass-energy-gravity law to be written. But it will come, because this is science and mathematics at their best. \n \n The study of biology, evolution, etc. is not as clear cut. There are no laws, because theories are as good as it gets. \n \n \n You also use the word \"proved\", any student of science will tell you that science does not deal in proofs, it deals in evidence. A scientific theory best explains the related evidence while making the fewest assumptions, it states the means by which it can possibly be falsified, it makes predictions on future evidence. Only when the theory can not be falsified and some of it's predictions are met is it considered a scientific theory. The theory of evolution is the best explaination for the diversity of life on this planet, in fact, it is the only valid theory for the diversity of life on this planet. It is one of the strongest theories in science. As for evolution itself, that is a fact. We have seen organisms evolve (both macro and micro) in the lab and in the wild, it can't be denied.\n \n \n When I said my motive was to discover the truth, I meant what I said. I know that scientists have discovered a number of things that support the theory of evolution. I do not discount evolution out of hand. I did not say that evolution was a lie. There is truth there. Evolution has taken place in the world down through the billions of years since our planet has come into being. What I disagree with is the assumption that such a complex universe is an accident.\n \n \nYou twist the 2LOT to fit your needs. The Second Law of Thermodynamics only applies to the transfer of heat energy. Your erroneous definition of the 2LOT would prevent plants from growing, animals from reproducing, snow flakes from forming, just to name a few.\n \n \n Only applies to heat energy? The transfer of heat energy powers the universe, from the smallest one celled creature to largest cluster of galaxies. Look up the word \"entropy\". It's increasing chaos and the tendency of the universe to run down. That is not an erroneous definition, that is the definition. It does not prevent any of the things you listed from taking place, including evolution. \n \n \n Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. \n \n No it's not, chemical reactions happen all the time and they are not in direct violation of the 2LOT. You've seen snowflakes haven't you? Water freezes and becomes more ordered and forms an intricate pattern. \n \n \n Yes chemical reactions and water freezing happen all the time, but they only create byproducts and new chemical combinations or snowflakes when water freezes. They do not produce complex living organisms. You claim that science is based on evidence, show me the evidence that supports the formation of life through random collisions of atoms and molecules. Scientists have been working on this for decades mixing their theoritical combinations of primal ooze in their laboratories and subjecting it too all manner of radiation, electricity, sunlight and every other stimulant they can imagine. For life to be so prevalent, how can it be so hard. So far there is no evidence to support this, however it is preached in our colleges and universities as truth. It seems that scientists require as much faith from their adherents that God does.\n \n \n It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes.  \n \n Creationists love to use this arguement but have no idea what they are talking about. First of all you're talking about the formation of the first life, Abiogenesis, which has nothing at all to do with the theory of evolution, they are two different theories. \n \n \n I am well aware of this. And as I've already stated, I do not dispute evolution. I do dispute the accepted theory that humans developed from apes. I guess it is possible, but that jumpstart to intelligent awareness is a mighty hurdle to jump. I await the evidence of the scientific community. And I also have a problem with the origins of life as presented by scientists as I've already indicated.\n \n \n Secondly tell me how you calculated the odds for your assertion that it would violate the statistical probablity.....I'll bet even money on you not being able to do so.\n \n \n Well, you have me there. I didn't do a statistical analysis, but I'm not a statistician either and couldn't perform an analysis even if there was enough data. However, if such an occurrence were probable, you'd think that scientists would have an easy time of producing the evidence. \n \n \n  Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba.  \n \n Once again you're talking about abiogenesis, not the theory of evolution, but I'll play along anyway. You really don't understand Abiogenesis or the theory of evolution if you think the first life was a single celled amoeba. The amoeba is just as evolved as humanity and no evolutionist believes amoebas were the first life. I don't know enough to give any in depth explainations about abiogenesis, but I do know that amino acids can arise from non living matter. And what makes you expert enough to casually dismiss the work of the thousands of biologists and biochemists who are working in the lab right now to demonstrate that life can come from non life?\n \n \n I dispute the work of thousands of scientists because they've proven nothing so far. \n \n \nScience has not proven that life can't come from non life, despite what you are implying.\n \n \n True. But are we to accept that life does come from nonlife without evidence? You will not believe in the existence of God without evidence, but you will believe suppositions proposed by your theories without any evidence at all. I find this a wonderous contradiction in your logic.\n \n (continued in next post)",

And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human.

Scientists have shown that there are changes introduced to living plants and animals due to reproduction, natural selection, climate changes, etc. But what we are talking about is the basis of life itself, DNA. This is the basic building blocks of every living thing. It huge! It's a complex information database that had to be formed and built into the very first organism formed! Where did that information come from? How did such complexity explode upon the scene fully integrated into a living thing in that first split second of formation? What random mechanism, what wild chance collision of atoms and molecules formed such a wondrous amazing blueprint? Where is your evidence of that? Where is your logic? Your thousands of scientists working in labs around the world seeking to create life from scratch are wasting time and money. \n \n \n Complexity can and does arise from nature, we see it all the time. New stars form from condensing gas clouds with no supernatural help.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but your example is flawed. New stars are formed by gravity. Every particle, atom, etc. in that gas cloud exerts a force of gravity and in the void of space, these particles are pulled together in a condensing cloud until critical mass is reached and its nuclear fires are lit by hydrogen atoms fusing to form helium and producing heat and light. Its gravity and fusion reactions that form stars. It is a very simple process, whole orders of magnitude less complex than a single living cell. \n \n \nAnd DNA is evidence that all life on the planet is related and evolved from a common ancestor. Why would all life use DNA if they were not related?\n\n \n I still want you to explain how that DNA was formed in your common ancestor. Why would all life use DNA and possess some of the same genes if they were not related? Oh they are related! Because DNA is the basic programming of life. I don't find it unusual that all living things share common genes. Just like all computers share common basic programs but each individual type of computer (business work station, graphics design computers, video editing computers, home gaming system, etc.) will have a variety of other programs which are needed for special functions. The one question you have to answer to support your theories is how you can have amazingly complex DNA programming without a programmer? You find the random, chance combination of substances and the proper stimulation to generate a program that takes literally years for our best minds to decipher, and you will prove your theories. But logic tells me, that this is highly improbable. (Please don't ask me to run a statistical analysis! :)\n \n \n Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness?  \n \n The \"freak accident\" was no accident. Animals with larger, more complex brains were better able to survive and reproduce in their environment.\n \n \n If this is true, why haven't all animals developed larger brains and reached intelligent awareness? Or even just one other species? \n \n \nTruth is not your ultimate goal, for unlike science which insists that the evidence defines the truth, you have already decided what is true and ignore any evidence that contradicts your dogmatic, dellusional worldview. \n\n \n Now see? This is what I was talking about in my previous post. You stoop to personal attack assuming you know my motives and beliefs based on what other Christians have said to you. I have not fostered my beliefs on you. I have not preached you a sermon or condemned you as a pagan heretic. I think I have demonstrated that I do stand for truth and have accepted the evidence that you have given here on evolution. You blast me for not accepting evidence when I pointed out one place in your last response where you were accepting a truth with no evidence whatsoever to support it. You yourself are guilty of what you accuse me of. You have given in to prejudice and hatred. Has logic failed you? Do you want to have a logical, reasonable discussion? Or has your faith in theories been shaken to the point where you must seek to win by any means possible? \n \n Present the evidence to support your theories and I will rethink my position. Or better yet, just answer my questions above on DNA and the rest on the topics of our present discussion and teach me the error of my ways. I await your logical, reasonable response.",

   "Frog,\n \n \nAnd guess what, the universe is based on mathematics!\n\n Guess what! It isn't. You don't seem to be able to separate reality for a representation of reality.\n \nScientists are concerned with theories and these are constantly under scrutiny and ever changing. However, when scientists are able to prove their theories they are applied to the real world. That's where theories become laws.\n\n It has been explained to you by several people and still you insist on displaying your ignorance. Theories are explanations that are never proven. They do not become laws. Laws are merely simple statements of observations that seem to have some universal application. Theories are more complex. Theories are explanations of observations, the mechanisms and causes.\n \nThey are laws because they have been proven both mathematically and experimentally.\n\n False. In science, if you understand how it works, you are aware that nothing is ever proven, not theories or laws. You even mentioned how Newton's Laws (were they proven mathematically and experimentally?) were found to be incorrect. It can't be both ways. Pick one horse and ride it, just don't be so wishy-washy as to claim that laws are proven and then give an example of a law that was ammended. In science, things are proven wrong, but they are never proven true.\n \nThe study of biology, evolution, etc. is not as clear cut. There are no laws, because theories are as good as it gets.\n\n Yet further evidence of your ignorance of the matter. There are laws in biology, just as in other sciences. And biology and evolution are quite clear cut, to the extent that it is accepted as true by about 95% of scientists and 99% of biologists. And even in physics, theories are as good as it gets. You fail to recognize that the \"law of gravity\" is merely a statement of a simple observation. The theories of gravitation are extremely complex and not well understood. We actually know more about evolution and its causes than we do about gravity. The gravitational theory has statements in standard physics, general relativity and quantum mechanics. Far from being proven, these theories are still inadequate.\n \nScientists have shown that there are changes introduced to living plants and animals due to reproduction, natural selection, climate changes, etc.\n\n One out of three isn't too good for someone who is attempting to instruct another. You really don't have any idea about what evolution is or how it works, do you? My bet is that you can't even give an adequate definition of natural selection without cheating and looking it up. Changes aren't introduced by climate changes. Never been shown to happen. I'll wait for you to give me a definition of natural selection, and reproduction doesn't introduce changes either. My bet is that you can't give me 4 mechanisms of evolution and a definition for each. There are more, by the way.\n \nI don't find it unusual that all living things share common genes. Just like all computers share common basic programs but each individual type of computer (business work station, graphics design computers, video editing computers, home gaming system, etc.) will have a variety of other programs which are needed for special functions.\n\n All computers don't share common basic programs. Where did you get that idea that such a simplistic idea was true? You see, there is no requirement that any program be used on any computer. In fact, programs that used to run on your 8086 PC won't run on your Pentium. Maybe you didn't know that. Not only are the programs different, the instruction set used by the chip is different, even for chips made by a single manufacturer - not to mention that chips by Zilog, Motorola, Intel, Cyrex, AMD and so on.\n \n All in all, I would recommend learning a bit more about the basics of what you claim to oppose. Essentially, all you have done is show that you don't \"believe in\" evolution because you haven't made the effort to learn anything about it. You certainly seem to be set in your opinions, based on little understanding of what science is and how it works. I find it peculiar that someone who is so ignorant of the topics of science and biology would actually attempt to instruct those who aren't. Not only that, when corrected for your misunderstandings, you insist that you are corrrect.",

Last night, after two or three evenings of this stuff back and forth (after I resoundingly bested her on every point, basically) she affirmed that she does believe in evolution and has \"kind of\" always believed in evolution, but that she has many reservations and questions about it.\n \n The pattern? \"Solid support of creationism turns into an admission that evolution is the truth, but with reservations.\" I find that pattern a little bit amusing.\n \n Last night, she had abandoned most of her philosophical objections because I made the concession that everyone has to make if they want to make any headway whatsoever with a budding evolutionist who can't let go of their religious objections: \"Okay, maybe it had God's stamp of approval.\" When you say that, you can move on to a real conversation. In this case, she bombarded me with a million questions that I couldn't answer. She seemed excited about it, not debating, but asking me about the wonders of biology with a long series of \"...but what about this\" and \"...what about that\" type of questions. One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem. I couldn't quite grasp what she was asking because I don't think she herself was very clear on the question, but to make a long story short, I got the distinct impression that she simply can't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she can't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it. I have told her time and time again: \"Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it wrong.\" I see this same pattern here in your words, Frog. You're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do, because they're wasting their money. You're making this subject so much bigger and more philosophical than it has to be, Frog. Is evolution by far the best answer we have to the question of the diversity of species? The answer is yes, overwhelmingly so. Everything else is moot. It belongs elsewhere. \n \n \nIf this is true, why haven't all animals developed larger brains and reached intelligent awareness? Or even just one other species?\n\n \n Last night, as my girlfriend played with my cat, she asked why the common housecat never evolved to be as big as a lion. The error here was in assuming that bigger is better. I explaiend to her that bigger is not always an advantage. Bigger bodies require more energy. Why would the tendency be to grow larger when the species ecosystem contains plenty of food which doesn't require size to catch? It has to do with dependency on the ecosystem and finding a niche. The housecat (before he became the companion of man) was doing just fine catching small rodents and birds (still does I guess). Early cats which evolved into lions and tigers and leopards were pursuing a different kind of prey: one which required more strength and raw power to overcome. Cheetah's relied on speed, pursuing those species which were not as big as they were fast. By the same token, smarter is not always better. Why invest in the resources required for a larger brain when you're doing just fine with the one you have? The crocodile has existed more or less unchanged since prehistoric times. He is doing fine with his small reptillian brain. If we were crocodiles having the same conversation about evolution, undoubtably our own arrogance would come into play and we would ask why all species don't develop thick armor-plating on their backs or have vice-grips for jaws or powerful tails to move quickly through the water. These, to us, would be our advantages and thus the basis by which we judged our superiority over all other species.\n \n MQ",

   "I find it amazing that you call yourself Demon38. That's not a criticisim or a put down. I only mean it seems to be a straightforward declaration of your complete opposition to all things religious.\n \n \n Although I know the origin of your handle, Frog, other people might think it's a straightforward declaration that you are a frog. Perhaps he is nothing more than a Speed Demon, which would tell me he loves fast cars. I would however like to better understand the relevance of a discussion on the opposition to religion here in a debate on the validity of evolution.\n \n (BTW, declaring yourself a demon does not stand in opposition to religion, as demons are a theology-based belief. Demons would however stand in direct opposition to God --- again, irrelevant in this dialogue.)\n \n \nWhen I said my motive was to discover the truth, I meant what I said. I know that scientists have discovered a number of things that support the theory of evolution. I do not discount evolution out of hand. I did not say that evolution was a lie. There is truth there. Evolution has taken place in the world down through the billions of years since our planet has come into being. What I disagree with is the assumption that such a complex universe is an accident.\n\n \n With all due respect, it appears as if you are conceding ground here. This particular debate is running the standard course of many debates on Evolution. One party, always intent on proving creationsim does little more than find perceived faults or flaws in evolutionary theory. When they discover that these flaws are not really flaws at all but their own misinterpretations, they retreat to safer ground and offer their objections on more philosophical levels. If you are agreeing that evolution has occured and that the evidence is there, at what point do you believe the evolutionary process broke down? Did it break down at the point where you specifically wanted it to break down? Does it break down when it interferes with your sense of self-awareness? In your first post you wrote:\n \n \nI must confess to being in the opposition camp.\n\n \n Do you wish to retract that statement at this time? This is a forum dedicated to Evolution vs. Creationism. I wrote my post in clear support of evolution. You confessed to being in the opposition camp. To me, that's a pretty straight-forward statement. Now it appears as if concessions are being made, and the tricky thing about these apparent concessions are that they stem from a more or less philosophical platform: I disagree with (the) assumption that such a complex universe is an accident. I'm sure there must be some kind of speculative psuedo-science which deals with the possibility that it was an accident (or conversely, by design), but none of that even remotely applies to our conversation here. Even if the mechanisms for the diversity of life on Earth were in some way guided by a higher power, it has no bearing whatsoever on the debate about whether or not these mechanisms exist and provide the means to such a vast diversity of life on Earth. You have just said that you know scientists have discovered a number of things that support the theory of evolution. You say evolution has taken place in the world down through the billions of years. Taken place. If you concur that it has taken place, does that mean we can wrap this subject up once and for all as far as you are concerned? Everything else that comes after that admission seems, to me, to be nothing more than pomp and circumstance, better suited for a philosophy message board. At its core the debate is about whether or not evolution took place and is continuing to take place. If you agree that it has taken place then you're not really in the opposition camp, are you? You would do a much greater service to this forum, then, by assisting those posters in favor of evolution by outlining the evidence whenever a creationist posts a message indicating that there is no evidence (something I have heard again and again from Creationists).\n \n I found something interesting in your last two posts, by the way:\n \n Your words from 06/07/03:\n \n \nFor evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth.\n\n \n Your words from 06/08/03:\n \n \nI did not say that evolution was a lie. There is truth there.\n \n \n Now that we have the definitions of hypothesis, theory and law pretty well squared away, and when we realize that some details of evolution can be debated (and are debated every day by scientists who never claimed to have the magic key to perfection), and when we realize that the debate on evolution is all about whether (a) God placed each plant and animal on the Earth individually or (b) whether species evolved through (as Demon states) imperfect reproduction and natural selection, and if (as you state) the truth must be the truth, and if (as you state) there is truth in evolution, is there anything more that needs to be said other than welcome aboard, my friend, glad to have you in the right camp? :)\n \n (Now our debate is going to get real philosophical, real fast, I can tell. But that's okay. It's safer for you there, I imagine. But beware: as Hemingway said, I have a fantastic bullsh*t detector. So mind what you write, my old friend. ;) )\n \n MQ",

   "Just as you have a background in science Frog, I also have an extensive background in Christianity. \n \n \n Excellent. That means you have enough information and experience in Christianity to discuss the topic intelligently. My experience with Christianity was similar to yours in that I reached a point where I began to question what I was being taught, in my own mind and in the form of questions to my teachers. I received standard responses that our minister had often proclaimed from the pulpit. I realized that my teachers were only repeating what they had been taught. It became clear that the traditional dogma of the church were followed by rote without any actual thought involved. And what was worse, I had friends who attended other churches in our denomination where the teaching was different in some respects, depending on the personal beliefs of the ministers. These supposed experts were contradicting each other. Where does that leave the people in their congregations who follow their teachings by rote and accept everything as truth? Well, some of them end up believing something that is totally incorrect and inconsistent with the truth.\n \n Christians as a whole believe only what others have taught them without really reading scriptures for themselves and searching for the truth. Why do they do this? Because reading and studying and thinking are hard. It's far easier to appeal to the supposed experts and let them tell you what is truth. Also, scriptures are confusing and extremely difficult to interpret. It's easier to depend on the clergy. Just do as you are told and your hands are clean. \n \n \n...but one important thing occurred when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored.\n \n \n Exactly! When you have been taught all your life that scriptures are the words of God and the basis and source of all truth, it is a shock to discover that there are errors in scripture. How is this possible if they are the words of God? This realization explodes into your consciousness in a full blown crisis of faith. If the Bible is presented as the literal words of God, there can be no error. If there is error, then how do you know that any of it is true? \n \n When I asked my teachers about the errors that I had found, they told me that they only seemed to be errors, and that they didn't know enough to enlighten me, but the minister could explain it all. Well, the minister told me that you can't interpret the Bible using an isolated verse. You have to read the Biblical record and then compare similar passages where there seems to be errors to arrive at the truth. As an example he took one of my newly discovered errors and showed me several scripture passages that dealt with the same subject. Then he proceeded to discuss these and finally arrived at an answer, which was contrary to the scripture error that I had found. I pointed this out to him, and he told me that I did not have enough education in scripture interpretation to determine what was truth and what was error. That was his job. He would tell me what to believe, and I wouldn't have to waste my time and effort trying to understand the complexities of interpretation. \n \n I couldn't accept this. Why should I have to depend on someone else's interpretation? Why isn't scripture consistent in the first place? Why doesn't God just make it plain? If these are his words, why isn't there a systematic theology presented in scripture that clearly details each and every truth we are to believe? Why doesn't God just tell us the truth straight out, without all these stories, poems, and incomplete theological ramblings that we find there? If he wants people to understand the truth and know that he exists, why does he have to make it so hard? More on this later.\n \n \nI realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. \n \n \n Unfortunately, you cannot avoid becoming an apologist if you are a Christian. Without a clear concise Biblical record of detailed truth, you really cannot point to scripture as a systematic theology, which it is not, or use it as solid evidence of God's existence. Yet, you must address the errors contained in scripture and try to determine what the truth is for your own peace of mind or blindly follow someone else. If you do not face the errors, then non-Christians will rip you apart as a mindless Bible thumper blindly following scripture interpretations falsely presented as Biblical truth. Or you throw your faith away.\n \n And this is the essence of the problem. But you have the answer to the dilemma, pulling back from a literal interpretation of scripture. The truth is that the Bible does not claim to be error free, and clearly it is not. All you have to do is read the first few chapters of Genesis to find two different accounts of the creation of mankind. The inerrant word of God is a theology formulated by well meaning men of God to form proof of the existence of God. But the Bible would never stand up in a court of law as authoritative proof of anything. \n \n So what do we do Mark? How can we find faith in the Biblical record when it's very authority as truth is inherently lacking? The fact is that we cannot. We cannot have faith in the Bible. But the good news is, that God called mankind to have faith in him. He never asked people to believe in the Bible. Why would he do so, when the masses have not had access to a Bible until modern times? Bibles were always copied by hand and with all that labor involved, only the very wealthy could afford to have a Bible. Most of the Christians down through history would find it strange that modern Christians preach faith in the Bible.\n \n What we need is a new theology of the Bible. If the Bible is not the literal words of God, then what is it? Look at the text of the Bible. You will find stories, poems, songs, sermons, etc. This is not a unified book written by God. It is a collection of many different types of literature with many different authors, human authors. I believe there have been 66 possible authors identified, but the number is probably much higher. And these authors lived in many different places with varied cultures and languages and in many different time periods spanning hundreds of years. Is there any wonder that there are contradictions in the Bible? Put 66 Christian ministers in a room and ask they to write down their interpretation of any aspect of their experience with God, and you will have 66 different interpretations turned in. The fact is, it is astonishing that there are not more contradictions and errors in the Bible than there are. \n \n What the scriptures do proclaim, again and again, is that scripture is inspired by God. These people were inspired to preach, teach, prophesy, and witness about their experiences with God. The Bible then is a collection of the many different accounts of those experiences. Each person wrote of the experiences they had and the things they witnessed and interpreted their meaning based on their own personal beliefs and value systems. The Biblical text is not the literal words of God, but personal interpretations of personal experiences of the people of God. Are there conflicts? Yes. Are there errors? Yes. Does that invalidate actual truth in scripture? No. There is truth and wisdom there that can change a person's life.\n \n \n ...and that if you're really going to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. \n \n \n Yes indeed. If you have no crisis of faith, you have no faith. If faith is not your own, then it belongs to someone else. Faith is hard personal labor seeking truth and applying what you have learned to your life. \n \n \nIt was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: atheism with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. \n\n \n Exactly. We don't have all the answers, and if anyone says they do, they lack understanding. The beginning of knowledge is the realization that you don't know all the answers and the continuing search for truth. \n \n \nDo you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it. \n\n \n When you stop being skeptical, when you stop questioning, you become intellectually dead. You cannot accept things at face value. You cannot accept Biblical teaching without critical evaluation of what is being taught. You cannot accept scientific teaching without critical evaluation either. You must insist on the evidence to support the theories that are being purported, and not tell yourself and others that the weight of evidence that supports the overall theory also means that all the individual suppositions which do not have supporting evidence must also be true. That is bad logic and inconsistent with the actual facts and findings of scientific investigations. Eventually the evidence may be forthcoming. Or a new hypothesis must be formed and tested to account for the holes in the original theory. \n \n (continued in next post)",

   "Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design). \n\n \n Correct. \n \n \nThe problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so.\n \n \n That is not altogether true. That is what fundamental Christians attempt to force on people, however there is a wide range of historical research and archaeological findings that provide evidence for the truth of the Bible. Not all of it of course, but enough to silence some of the atheistic critics who have scoffed at various aspects of the Biblical account, only to discover later that evidence had been found to prove the truth of that particular scripture passage. For example, critics laughed at the possibility of Jesus being buried in a tomb as is reported in the New Testament. Historical records of the period state that the bodies of crucified prisoners were left hanging on the cross as a warning to others or thrown into the huge garbage dump outside the city of Jerusalem where perpetual fires burned. Last year archaeologists discovered the remains of a man buried in a tomb who had been crucified. There is the evidence. The scriptures say that one of Jesus' disciples (not one of the twelve) went to the governor and begged for the body of Jesus that it might be placed in a tomb. The governor granted the request. The body of Jesus did not suffer the usual fate, because the governor granted a special request. For me that is more than enough evidence. The words of scripture substantiated by archaeological findings.\n \n \nExcerpts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. \n\n \n No it does not. God never attempted to provide proof anyway, aside from the testimony of a few witnesses. He leaves it to every person to decide for himself and believe in him or not. He requires that we believe in him without solid evidence based solely on the changed lives of those who do believe. Anyone who searches for indisputable evidence of God's existence will not find it. There will be no physical evidence, no wonders, no miracles, no voice from the sky. You will only see God working in the lives of people or within your own life. That is the basis of faith. To believe what you cannot see. \n \n \nI also have very close friends who claim to be Christians and extract nothing but the wisdom contained in the Bible. They believe that Jesus Christ generally did the things reported in the New Testament but make allowences for error, stipulating that if every New Testament account were wrong, they feel they have not wasted their time in thought or contemplation because they have been given an excellent blueprint for the way to live their lives. This, to me, is far from mindless Bible-thumping. \n\n Excellent. You have discovered the truth on your own by observing the changed lives of your friends. You have provided the example for my discourse above.\n \nI have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution. I have been called ignorant. This damned well gives me the right to call someone mindless if I want to. The mudslinging occurs on both sides, and don't think I've never been on the receiving end of it. \n\n So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness. \n \nPlease don't insult me Frog by clarifying what Christ was talking about when he said give to Caesar what is Caesar's, give to God what is God's. As a matter of fact these words were in direct response to a question about paying taxes, [n]not[/i] a question about the religious pundits of his day. \n\n \n I'm sorry, I guess I didn't make my meaning very clear. I only meant to point out that Jesus was teaching people that Caesar was the power in the world and they should obey him. I was not adding the other information to show that Jesus did have a message for the academics and wise men of his day, which is more relevant to our discussion of scientists who think they know all the answers. It has been proven time and again that they do not have all the answers as new discoveries are made and they have to change their former framework of knowledge to account for new information.\n \n \nTo me, my version of this statement holds water because in both cases --- Ceasar and science --- they are secular. My translation of Christ's words is every bit as valid as yours. I maintain that this was commentary about letting the secular world go about its business becase we (we in this case being followers of the soon-to-be New Covenent) have more heavenly matters to undertake.\n\n \n Ahhh. I see your point. And I agree. \n \n \nTo me, Christ was saying mind your own business and be good little Italians of the Roman Empire --- you won't do much good for the cause sitting in prison or crucified on a tree.\n\n \n Oh. You just lost me. The fact is, Jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake. Read Matthew 10:5-42, if you care for the full text. Basically he told them they would be beaten, thrown in prison, crucified, and put to death if they followed him. And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior. \n \n The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find, men, women, and children. Christians were crucified by the thousands, covered in pitch, and sit afire to provide light for the emporer's lavish garden parties. They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways. They were called martyrs, which now means one who dies for a cause. The word is Greek and means \"witness\". These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith. How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith? In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough. More were believing in Christ every day, and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned. \n \n \nI would like to think Christ was wise enough that if he lived today he would have also told his followers to let science move forward and solve its problems, cure its diseases, launch its astronauts into space and yes, study the diversity of the beasts and the trees: \"ours is a higher cause.\" \n\n \n I agree with this to the extent that scientists should not be attacked for doing their job. But the same goes for Christians. They should not be attacked either, but I know they will be. However, I do feel that Christians must still be a witness in the world, and if that means they will be attacked for their beliefs by scientists, then so be it.",

   "In my few posts on this forum I have sought to be a voice of reason and logic, and have not attacked anyone personally, even though I have been attacked. I have entered this debate to be a witness of Jesus Christ and God. Not as a Bible Thumper, but one who understands science and faith in God. They are not mutually exclusive. Truth always lies in the middle somewhere between two opposing factions, regardless of the issue. If truth is the ultimate goal of both sides, then that's were both sides will end up. However, winning the fight seems to the usual goal. But if truth is to be served, both sides have to win. \n \n \nBut that's the thing about the Bible, isn't it? We can pretty much translate it anyway we want. We can pretty much make our own conclusions based on our individual life experiences, our own mindsets, our own degree of objectivity AND whatever translation we happen to be reading at the time.\n\n \n You are exactly right and I believe that is God's intent. When it comes right down to it, each person must make his peace with God. It is our responsibility and our right as individuals. We have the freedom to choose. It is our God-given right to decide what we will do with God and Christ. \n \n \nTell me, Frog, how many denominations of Christianity exist, all vying for a voice in the maelstrom of heavenly truth? How many arguments have been written over the centuries over interpretations of the same book? \n \n \n I don't know how many denominations there are total, but there are 84 Baptist denominations alone. And there have been thousands of interpretations of scripture, thousands of books written. But as I've already stated God did not give us a book of structured theology. That's why there are so many opinions on what is true and what is right. I do not think that God could provide the answers to every question and every situation that arises during a lifetime in a single book. For a full blown system of theology would require many, many books. Instead, God offers the bare essentials for faith, the witness of those who follow him. It's up to us to work through all the issues and determine for ourselves what we believe. In the end, it really does not matter the full list of what you believe in, but who you believe in and what you have done with your life as result of the first decision. \n \n \nScience is different. In science it's a matter of who has the most convincing evidence. If we are to give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you HONESTLY tell me that creationsim is the best answer? If so (and I extend the challenge I made to Lappster) educate and enlighten us. I am eager (as always) to read the evidence for myself. \n\n \n I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light. \n \n \nI'm going to bet that all you'll be able to do (as you have done before and as every creationist faced with the challenge of providing evidence for ceationism has done) is try to find ways to invalidate evolutionary theory.\n\n \n I do not wish to disprove evolution. I only question certain hypothesis that scientists have made which so far have no supporting evidence, even though they search diligently, but teach them as being true. \n \n \nSurely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism. Disproving one theory does not prove another. All it does is disprove a theory.\n\n \n Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation. \n \n \n And based on Demon's excellent response to your post (one which I could never haven written, though I understood most of it and knew a good bit else), you have so far not even been able to disprove evolution. \n\n \n Read my response to Demon's response. \n \n \nSo again, I don't want to know the things you can disprove or philosophize about. I want to see the evidence. Given that, you will surely begin to change my mind. \n\n \n I hope I have already begun to change your mind.",

By the way Demon mentioned that this topic falls into line with abiogenesis, not evolution. I was not even aware of the science of abiogenesis until yesterday when I read his response to your words. Your arguments on behalf of creationism have nothing at all to do with evolution and everything to do with abiogenesis. It's amazing that I learned that much yesterday but you seem to prefer ignoring it. I am still waiting for someone on this forum to offer substantial scientific evidence which points to creationsim being a more valid explanation for the diversity of life than evolution, and so far I've heard nothing but a lot of wordplay basically amounting to \"science has been wrong on this or that point in the past\". What does that have to do with anything? We're talking about the best explanation here, and so far evolution wins that one hands down.\n \n \nI hope I have already begun to change your mind.\n\n \n Not on even the smallest note. I'm sorry. I wrote a couple paragraphs on religion in direct response to your scolding me about my term \"mindless Bible-thumpers\" and you in turn took those parapgraphs and expounded on them to create a small religious manifesto. That belongs on the religion forum, which YouDebate.com also has. The discussion here is about evolution and creationism. Which argument has more evidence to tip the scales in its direction. On that note, I retract what I said earlier re: the discussion about abiogensis having no baring on any of this. It clearly does if you are using it to support your creationist theory. I think we need someone who knows something about abiogenesis to further enlighten us before we go too far into that, however. I will endeavor to learn more myself. For now, I think that sticking to science and avoiding long dissertations about biblical translation would be wise. And so far, if the debate itself is to be tallied, I have the following:\n \n Your evidence in support of creationism is that you think instantaneous formation of a living organism from random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy.\n \n The evidence for evolution is a little more extensive, I'm afraid. \n \n MQ",

   "Originally posted by lurch \n [B]Frog,\n It has been explained to you by several people and still you insist on displaying your ignorance. Theories are explanations that are never proven. They do not become laws. Laws are merely simple statements of observations that seem to have some universal application. Theories are more complex. Theories are explanations of observations, the mechanisms and causes.\n\n \n I would like to put an end to this. I am not a biologist or one educated in evolution. I am not a scientist. I am an engineer. You can beat me up all you want for not understanding science, because that is clearly the case. What you are doing is establishing the fact that I am not an authority on the subject. I freely admit that. My question to you is does that mean that we can not have an intelligent discussion on the subject? Am I to be continuously and ruthlessly chastised because I get something wrong? Will you continue to call me names and attack me personally, or will you answer the questions I have asked. Think of me as the simple child who must be instructed in the ways of science. Present your evidence and reasoned arguments to show me the error of my ways. \n \n \nYou even mentioned how Newton's Laws (were they proven mathematically and experimentally?) were found to be incorrect.\n\n \n That's not what I said. I said that there were some situations that they could not be applied to. Einstein help fill in some of the gaps. \n \n \nAll computers don't share common basic programs. Where did you get that idea that such a simplistic idea was true? You see, there is no requirement that any program be used on any computer. In fact, programs that used to run on your 8086 PC won't run on your Pentium. Maybe you didn't know that. Not only are the programs different, the instruction set used by the chip is different, even for chips made by a single manufacturer - not to mention that chips by Zilog, Motorola, Intel, Cyrex, AMD and so on.\n\n \n You are really grasping for anything to bash me with now. I know that there are different instruction sets. But every computer has instruction sets. There is also a bios that you can use to set certain basic parameters. Every computer has one. Every computer has an operating system, even though there are different kinds. The differences come into play where different software is installed to perform different functions and that's why I specifically listed the different type of software setups for the intended use of the computer like business work stations etc. So the example I gave is sound. All living things share common DNA just like the basic programs that all computers have in common like instruction sets, bios, and operating systems, but have different DNA for special functions. \n \n \nI find it peculiar that someone who is so ignorant of the topics of science and biology would actually attempt to instruct those who aren't. Not only that, when corrected for your misunderstandings, you insist that you are corrrect. \n \n \n I will not attempt to instruct anyone here on the topics of science and biology. I will ask questions and attempt to carry on an intelligent conversation. If you insist that I must be an expert in the fields in question in order to discuss them, that doesn't leave me much to say. I believe that is your intent anyway. \n \n Now that we have all the BS out of the way. Prehaps you would care to enlight me on the subject of DNA. Please answer my question and present your evidence that supports the random formation of DNA the basic building blocks of life.",

   "What you are doing is establishing the fact that I am not an authority on the subject. \n \n \n Frog I must protest this, as he was doing no such thing. He was responding directly to the statement in your second post that said when scientists can prove their theories they are applied to the real world, and this is when theories become laws. This is simply wrong, and we cannot logically move forward to the nect step of the debate when an earlier step is still in question. \n \n I am probably much further from an expert on the subject than you Frog, but by the same token I try not to delve too deeply in areas that I don't understand. Instead, I read the posts by people who do understand, and if a sufficient answer cannot be found here I search the web. The biggest difference between us is that I am coming at this from the standpoint of acceptance whereas you were coming at it from the standpoint of finding flaws. Flaws are fine, as long as you know the right ones to find. Scientists find flaws in their theories all the time. My last post prior to this shows there has been more than one abiogenisis theory. A few were cited, one dating back to 1803. If science never found flaws in its theories than I, you and everyone on this forum would have some serious concerns about scientific method. If science never found flaws in its own theories it would not be science and we would not be sitting here, hundreds or even thousands of miles apart, having such a lively debate about evolution on these remarkable instruments called computers. But regarding the Evolutionary Theory, it is one of the strongest theories science has. I am not blindly reading the words of the posters on this forum in the same way someone at church believes Christ walked on water because Pastor Joe Bob Dupree says so. Do a websearch using the words \"evolution\" and \"evidence\" and you will find a plethora of information on both sides, but overwhelmingly the information will be in support of evolution. This will answer many of your questions.\n \n As for the Theory of Evolution being in jeaopardy, far from it.\n \n MQ",

   "Originally posted by MarkQuinn \n \n I'm sorry. I wrote a couple paragraphs on religion in direct response to your scolding me about my term \"mindless Bible-thumpers\" and you in turn took those parapgraphs and expounded on them to create a small religious manifesto. That belongs on the religion forum, which YouDebate.com also has. The discussion here is about evolution and creationism. \n\n \n I wrote the posts in response to your discussion on religion. But now you say this is not an appropriate place for a discussion of religion. How can you discuss creationism without talking about God? Is it irrelavent? No there is a direct bearing. I believe that God is the creator of the universe. If I am not allowed to talk about God you take away the whole point of creationism. I have not attempted to provide Biblical evidence for the existence of God. In fact I have stated that the Bible can provide no evidence to support the existence of God. I have not called anyone names or acted in an inappropriate way. I have not tried to force religion on you, but I did respond to your own struggles on faith in God. \n \n Is it offensive for me to speak about God? Does it insult the intelligence of the people on this forum? I'm afraid that I can not discuss creation without talking about the creator. If that is what you are saying, then you have taken away my ability to discuss creation. \n \n \nAnd so far, if the debate itself is to be tallied, I have the following:\n \n Your evidence in support of creationism is that you think instantaneous formation of a living organism from random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy.\n\n \n Scratch the word instanteous, and you have most of it.

Is it irrelavent? \n \n \n No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic.\n \n \nThis is an appeal to the authority of the entire body of scientific evidence on the subject. I'm sorry, that does not provide any evidence to support the random formation of DNA the basic building blocks of life.\n \n \n That's the second time you have said I am \"appealing\" to something. First it was to the scientific community and now it is to the entire body of scientific evidence. I posted a new article on this forum that I want you to read, Frog. In the meantime, I will post here the most relevant point on this matter:\n \n \nIf after all of this, you still think you want to debate a creationist, then let me give you some suggestions. First, don't bother defending evolution. Evolution is state of the art science, taught at every decent college and university in this country, including Brigham Young, Notre Dame, and Baylor. So why should you defend it? Tell your audience that there is plenty of information on evolution in the library, in university courses, and in scores of science journals. Creation \"science\" is the new kid on the block. Let's see if it fits the criteria of science, and secondly, if its claims and predictions stand up to scrutiny.\n \n \n I appeal to the body of scientific evidence because it is there, available for all of us to read. Whether you chose to read it or not is up to you. I posted an excellent link about abiogenisis earlier, but rather than reading it (which would have answered your questions) you wrote that you were retracting the word \"spontaneous\" but that the larger question still applied. And the larger questions are answered right there! In case you didn't catch my subtlety, the message where I said I was presently reading the answer for myself was a specific suggestion that you also read the answers. But did you do that? I don't know. If not, what are we to do? Do you know the difference between uneducated and ignorant? An uneducated person can become educated on any matter that he or she choses which he posesses the cognitive ability to understand. An ignorant person is uneducated, but more so, ignores the free availability of information at his or her disposal. As I know you are not and have never been the latter, I must assume you will take steps to answer your own questions with the link I have provided (or links of your own).\n \n You see, Frog, I will not permit you to turn this debate around using rhetoric. Asking someone to provide evidence of evolution is the height of laziness because the evidence can be found readily. Asking someone to provide evidence for the lesser known Theory of Abiogenisis may be more daunting, but I didn't seem to have any trouble finding resources. What cannot be found so readily is evidence for creationism. That much I cannot locate with a 3 second Google search. I would appreciate if you assisted me by pointing me in the right direction, or else I will have to be content to wait for the groundbreaking scientific evidence which Lappster will report to us one of these days.\n \n And just so I don't get hit in the face with another \"that still doesn't answer my question response, let me provide the link in case you missed it in the earlier post. Just click this link and you will have your answer. Not my answer, but your answer:\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html#Intro\n \n When you are finished reading that and come back to this forum filled with objections, please make sure they are actual objections and not just points which you need clarified. After that, can we get back to the business of disproving evolution, or has that debate now ended with your admission that you believe it has taken place over the course of billions of years and so on and so forth? I really want to get back to that part of the conversation (evolution, not abiogenisis) because I seem to recall one of your earlier posts mentioning that while you know evolution has taken place you seemed to have some kind of problem or another with the idea of our relation to apes. Your words:\n \n \nAnd as I've already stated, I do not dispute evolution. I do dispute the accepted theory that humans developed from apes.\n\n \n First of all humans didn't develop from apes. Instead, we share a common ancestor with modern primates. I assume you will debate that too. I would like to read more about your objections to that specific area of evolution because I personally can't seem to make the distinction that you have (nor do I see a reason for it). So when we have finished this discussion on the very earliest of origins, could we jump ahead a few billion years and talk about more recent ones? \n \n MQ",

And anyway, the alternative to appeling to authority is to try and figure it out for ourselves, what with our extensive research budget and staff? Okay. Then let's figure it out for ourselves. I think magic faeries did it.\n \n Come on Frog, you know better than that. On a later note in your post I distinctly recall you directing me on a websearch using keywords \"Intelligent Design\". Will there be any supposed authorities at those sites or will they all be amateurs like us? Wait a minute, I think I have a quote:\n \n \nYou may even come across some scientific evidence sited by the creationists.\n\n \n Okay, amateurs in other words. I'd rather read the hypotheses of scientific authorities, but since authority has suddenly become a dirty word around here I guess I'll have to settle for the people who don't know what they're talking about. \n \n \nI was talking about the evidence to support random DNA formation.\n\n \n I may be out of line and I invite others to correct me, but it appears at this point science can only make educated guesses about the jump from proteins to living cells which contain the genetic code. Those hypotheses are fairly complex, but the following website does a good job of making it semi-understandable for me:\n \n http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/biology/Handbooks/evolprebiotic.htm\n \n I would like to think science is on the right path. In my web explorations today I came across examples of biologists who speculated about possible characteristics of yet undiscovered transitional species. They were proven correct when fossil evidence, appearing in the geological record at just about the time it should have, revealed species exhibiting the characteristics predicted by science. My point? Give science time. Getting back to the origin of life, I am not prepared at this time to conclude that because evidence of events over 3.5 billion years ago is hard to come by, relevent theories must therefore be ignored. Reading the webpage I provided, it is clear that science is in the midst of an intense and exciting hunt for answers to the very questions you pose and others. Dismissing their efforts at this stage would be like the ladies of the manor watching their redcoat-clad husbands ride off on horseback with rifles in hand, the dogs barking widly, and declaring outright: \"There are no foxes to be found.\" And yet the hunt has just begun! Let science do what it does best and search for the answers. The alternative is to take the simplest approach and say it happened because of divine intervention. Aren't the same things being said right now by creationists about evolution? And of course we know you know better than that, and believe in evolution, don't you? Earlier, you were spouting an oft-used objection by creationists about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. You presented this as evidence that evolutionary theory was in jeaopardy. Later, after your misunderstanding was corrected, you said you believed in evolution. Apparently the theory was no longer in jeaopardy. Again, I see patterns. Because you don't grasp the incredibly difficult science behind DNA formation, it must not be true and an intelligent design must therefore be responsible. You can go on believing that, but I think if you start reading some of the resources I found, branching out to more, you'll know better. Merely appealing to authority? Well, if my internet searches are to be reduced to something that trite, I suppose you and I could gain more ground with our ongoing uneducated rhetoric. Or you could join me in this hunt, not seeing it as \"authority\" but as educational resources utilized. \n \n \nThis is a presentation of their hypothesis. Where is the evidence that supports it? Where is their experimental data?\n\n \n The question could be easily turned around. Where is the evidence that supports intelligent design? I will withold my statements about one being more credible than another until I have read up on the subject of ID. \n \n \nDo a search for \"intelligent design\". That should bring up some resources. You may even come across some scientific evidence sited by the creationists.\n\n \n Does this mean you are coming out in solid support of Intelligent Design Theory now? Oh boy ... this one is deserving of a whole new thread. Let me do some reasearch and come back when my brain is refreshed. (TBC)\n \n MQ\n \n P.S. - By the way Frog, just a note of etiquitte here. I have so far provided many links in my umpteen posts at this forum. I have now provided two links in response to your specific questions. Irregardless of whether the answers presented on those pages were to your satisfaction, I still searched per your request. You have now asked me to do websearches for the arguments that you propose to be true (or truer). Am I to research both sides now?

   "My apologies for being unclear, as I was a little hasty in posting that reply. What I was getting at here was frog's question of looking for random DNA assemblage as \"proof\" of abiogenesis is midguided. My intention was to point out the fact that synthesis of DNA requires RNA nucleotides and as this 2 prime hydroxy group is not cleaved spontaneously, something is needed to catalyze it. As a catalyst for this particular reaction probably doesnt exist outside of a living system, this cannot occur, therefore his proposal of proof for this is impossible, and the question cannot be answered. While this doesnt really answer anything, what I am trying to say is that he was merely asking for evidence of the wrong thing. As RNA seems to be the best candidate for the first genomic material, due to the fact that it stores information and has catalytic functions, a more appropriate question to ask concerning abiogenesis would be to ask whether or not assemblage of RNA has been observed ex vivo(outside a living system), which in fact I believe it has.",

   "a more appropriate question to ask concerning abiogenesis would be to ask whether or not assemblage of RNA has been observed ex vivo(outside a living system), which in fact I believe it has.\n \n \n Thank you Ufthak. I have searched the web and can find no observations of this, but this for me is rather like a man being asked to find a needle in a haystack but he's not been told which of the two dozen haystacks its in and because he's blind, he doesn't even know where the haystacks are located. Perhaps you could direct this blind man to the proper stack?\n \n I don't see much relevance in this discussion anyway, as a lack of evidence (for now) in abiogenisis hardly provides proof of divine intervention, but my old friend Frog was backed into a corner early yesterday and fought back admirably, turning the tables and backing me into a corner. If at this point in the debate I affirm too rigidly that the question does not need to be answered, I stand the risk of being accused of using what's concrete when it is convenient to me and disregarding what is not concrete as unimportant. I must therefore tread carefully during this stage. Frog affirms creationism, or the belief that life was created by an intelligent being, followed by the individual placement of fully formed species (until I get clarification on his objections with the specific man-ape issue, I will stand by this). So in his view, he can make his argument more valid by discrediting the two sciences that the creationist viewpoint directly opposes. It certainly doesn't prove anything from the creationist standpoint, but it makes it look better, then all you need is a touch of faith and voila!, God was responsible for all of it. But I believe he retreated somewhat from his four or five reasons for the Theory of Evolution being in jeaopardy (isn't that the same as saying you don't suppoprt it, if it's not also presented with the disclaimer: \"I don't actually believe this but it's food for thought?\"). Suddenly he believes evolutoin with the single caveat that \"man couldn't have come from apes\" (to me this sounds kind of like believing that gravity acts on all objects except golf balls, which fall to the Earth by some magical force specific to golf balls). Now he moves toward an area that science can't answer with the same authority that it can evolution. Not even close. The debate itself has moved from the standpoint of clear scientific superiority to one of perceived creationist superiority. By that, I mean when we were talking about evolution only, he was losing the debate hands down because all of his efforts to disprove it (or even redefine it as a mere \"theory\") failed. He moved briefly on toward religion (how can you debate faith?) then ended in solid opposition of biogenisis. If we were fencing, I would pause for a moment, take a short bow and compliment him on his technique. In order to save face I frantically searched the web in vein for some indication that science could provide reasonable answers to the very good questions posed about how DNA (not realizing at the time it was more precisely RNA) could stem from non-living material. My single victory came when I disolved his notion that it happened suddenly, but all this did was correct his terminology. Yes, as he correctly pointed out to me, the larger question still did stand.\n \n As I continued to read my websites, I slowly discovered that this level of science was way out of my league. I mean this is really advanced stuff here, and you can't understand X, Y and Z if you just learned the term \"abiogenisis\" one day ago and are squarely functioning at level A. But I also knew that Frog was probably functioning at level A (maybe B or C since he probably has more background in chemistry than I do). So now I was faced with my dilemma. Here I have a novice, asking me, another novice, to expound upon advanced scientific theory. But Frog wanted to take the debate into this particular realm and I foolishly followed him. All I could do --- all I can do, is suggest that perhaps Frog post his objections to abiogenisis when he has familiarized himself with the topic well enough to actually have the correct objections in the first place. To say \"show me evidence that life came from non-life\" is not the correct question, although it sounds very good when someone is trying to make an argument in favor of creationism. A better question, a more fair question posed by someone who is really on a search for truth would be \"Explain to me some of the more prevelant scientific theories on the origin of life from non-living matter, expounding in detail that I can comprehend what kind of problems science faces in supporting these theories, and also expounding on some of the things science is more or less certain of so that I can make an informed decision on my own about whether I think it holds more water than creationism.\" \n \n I do not know whether Frog has pursued in great detail the answers to these questions. If he has, and if he believes that creationism is still a better answer, he has then provided all the evidence that he currently needs to make his own decision on how life came from non-life (right or wrong). If he choses to pursue the issue further, great: he will undoubtably open up a whole new fascinating world of information for himself. If he choses to call the case closed and move on to the next issue at hand, this probably serves best the creationism-evolution debate, which is why we are here in the first place. He can make wild claims that science has received a major blow and cannot answer basic questions to satisfy his religious ponderings. And that would be true. But I don't think science will lose much sleep over it. Like religion, theirs is their own higher cause. Nothing has been lost, everything is simply a matter of further research. Science, unlike the layman trying to disprove science, does not require the smoking gun (though it has many). Science will go merrily along postulating ideas that are far removed from the common person's most remote understanding. The common person will go merrily along suggesting that science doesn't know what it's talking about. This country abounds with scientific armchair quarterbacks. Does Coach Cowher really care if fat Joe Jovoski with his beer on the sofa cursed up and down when he pulled Kordell Stewart in place of Tommy Maddox? Probably not one whit. But Joe Jovoski cares. And Joe Jovoski's wife cares when she has to listen to her husband ranting up and down until next Sunday because he knows better than the guy who works with these players every day at practice, who played for a time in Cleveland, who knows the plays and the films and the strenghs and the weaknesses of his own guys and even the guys across the field.\n \n Yes, Joe Jovoski knows better. So do you, Frog. God snapped His fingers to spark life because science at this time hasn't provided you with the Polaroid snapshot you require before you'll accept the possibility that simple self-replicating cells arose from primordial muck. Congratulations, this morning you were saying that you weren't a biologist or one educated in evolution and you invited others to beat you up because you clearly had no understanding of science (your words), and this evening you have graduated to the point where you can summarily dismiss a scientific theory based on nothing else but that it doesn't convince you personally (who cares how many scientists it satisfies, right?). I wish I had the cognitive ability to learn that quickly.\n \n I guess in the end, it all comes down to this:\n \n \n But you must admit that the (scratched) formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy\n\n \n For me, not at all. For you, yes. And you oversimplify it to the point of absurdity. \n \n Now, let's get back to this issue of grandaddy the chimp. Let's give him a name, shall we? Let's call him Peanuts. \n \n MQ",

   "I know we should be getting back to evolution, not abiogenesis, but here was an interesting review article I found from one group that was able to synthesize RNA polymers from mononucleotides using special forms of clay at catalysts. While not conclusive, it still does give good support for RNA as the first self replicating molecule. \n \n http://www.origins.rpi.edu/chem.html \n \n By the way, I too am very curious as to how frog admits to evolution, but wont accept the fact that man evolved from an ape like ancestor.",

   "Originally posted by MarkQuinn \n To ufthak:\n \n Yes but he doesn't get where is by practicing flimsy science. And anyway, the alternative to appeling to authority is to try and figure it out for ourselves, what with our extensive research budget and staff? Okay. Then let's figure it out for ourselves. I think magic faeries did it.\n\n \n Okay. I will try to explain this one more time. I am not disputing that scientists are authorities in their fields. What I am talking about is logic and one of the fallacies often used in debates.\n In an Appeal to Authority the opinion of someone famous, in a position of authority, or accomplished in another field is supposed to guarantee the truth of a statement. Even in areas where authorities have special knowledge or skill, they could be mistaken, have bad information, or intentionally lie. \n \n For example:\n \n - Harold is a successful and highly respected biologist.\n - Harold says that spiders are insects.\n - Therefore, spiders are insects.\n \n Just because an expert makes a statement, doesn't make it valid. He could be mistaken, etc. Therefore, you cannot use authority as evidence that a statement is valid. It is not logical. If Harold provided the evidence to support his statement, and if the scientific community put it through the normal meat grinder to test his evidence and found that it was valid, then it would be accepted.\n \n Your appeal to the authority of the scientific community (don't remember the exact words) was not a logical argument.\n \n If you recall my story about the logic professor I had in college, who used illogic to destroy everyone he debated. What amazes me about that experience is that the study of logic was regulated to the Philosophy department and only offered as an elective. Wouldn't you think that logic would be required for every student in college regardless of chosen field? Shouldn't politicians, lawyers, scientists, criminalists especially benefit from this type of education. And yet the professor is a hateful egotistic who teaches students to use logic to destroy people, hide the truth, and propetuate lies and half truths. I have seen people use these same tactics over and over again and get away with it, primarily because most people don't know what is happening. \n \n Think about it for a moment. What would happen if logic was taught as a required course by a professor who emphasized the positive aspects of logic. What if people were given the training to recognize fallacies when they were used? They could reply, \"Excuse me sir, but that argument was an Appeal to Ignorance and has no validity at all.\" The illogical people of the world would be openly recognized and no longer able to get away with their scams. Just imagine what this would do to politicians, lawyers, ruthless businessmen, advertisers, fanatic Christians, TV evangelists, hateful college professors, and arrogant scientists. \n \n I guess I have answered my own question. Logic is not taught because it would expose the widespread legalized corruption, deceptions, scams, fraud, etc. throughout every aspect of American life. \n \n Now, before everyone lambast me because logic is not a true science, etc. (fill in your own objections), there is one more point to make. Illogic has been proven to work all too well which proves the validity of the discipline. Logic works even better, because it works for good. That's why I have been insisting on a logical discussion. I'm beginning to doubt that we will have one.\n \n \nCome on Frog, you know better than that. On a later note in your post I distinctly recall you directing me on a websearch using keywords \"Intelligent Design\". Will there be any supposed authorities at those sites or will they all be amateurs like us?\n\n \n Someone posted the percentages of scientist who had accepted the theory of evolution, all in the high 90's. Many of those scientists who have not accepted evolution are Christians. You can well imagine the kind of professional lives they must have. To answer your question, yes there are professional scientists among the creationists. Some of them became Christians because of their research. Atheistic scientists will say they are not scientists at all.\n \n \nI would like to think science is on the right path... Reading the webpage I provided, it is clear that science is in the midst of an intense and exciting hunt for answers to the very questions you pose and others. Dismissing their efforts at this stage would be like the ladies of the manor watching their redcoat-clad husbands ride off on horseback with rifles in hand, the dogs barking widly, and declaring outright: \"There are no foxes to be found.\"\n\n \n I do not discount science. Once again, I find myself repeating the same information. Let them search for the answers, if they can find them. We have our wondrous modern age because of what they have discovered. \n \n \nAren't the same things being said right now by creationists about evolution? And of course we know you know better than that, and believe in evolution, don't you? Earlier, you were spouting an oft-used objection by creationists about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. You presented this as evidence that evolutionary theory was in jeaopardy. Later, after your misunderstanding was corrected, you said you believed in evolution. Apparently the theory was no longer in jeaopardy\n. \n \n You are correct in your statements, but wrong in your conclusion. If you recall, I sent you an email, when we first talked about this forum. In response to your question about my position on evolution, I said, \"I take a straddling-the-fence position, which usually draws fire from both sides.\" I believe in evolution to the extend that there is an abundance of evidence to support it. In those areas in which there is no evidence or little evidence, I will not accept their hypothesis as valid just because they are the authorities on the subject. That draws fire from both sides. In another one I stated that, \"I'm coming out in solid favor of creationism.\" Prehaps that was too strong a statement. I do believe in creation, but not creation in 7 days, and some of the other literal interpretations of the Biblical text. So my stand on this issue leaves me straddling the fence.\n \n \nThe question could be easily turned around. Where is the evidence that supports intelligent design? I will withold my statements about one being more credible than another until I have read up on the subject of ID.\n \n \n Creationists have assembled some scientific evidence. I've read some of it on occasion.\n \n \nDoes this mean you are coming out in solid support of Intelligent Design Theory now? Oh boy ... this one is deserving of a whole new thread.\n\n \n No.\n \n \nBy the way Frog, just a note of etiquitte here. I have so far provided many links in my umpteen posts at this forum. I have now provided two links in response to your specific questions. Irregardless of whether the answers presented on those pages were to your satisfaction, I still searched per your request. You have now asked me to do websearches for the arguments that you propose to be true (or truer). Am I to research both sides now? I thank you for having so much faith in my objectivity, but wouldn't it make more sense for you to point me in the direction of websites which you believe present a better argument? Just food for thought. It's easy to ask questions, but that's only half the debate. Much harder to research and provide a basis for your arguments. \n \n \n In point of fact, you said you were doing a web search for creationist scientific evidence and weren't having much luck. I answered and gave you the words \"Intelligent Design\" to aid you in your search. I did not request that you do so. Since you won't take any of it seriously anyway, why would I bother requesting that you look it up? The fact is, I had intended to look up some of the websites, and post links and information here in order to have an intelligent and logical discussion. I had already expressed to you my intention of doing so. With my limited time and schedule, and the present discussion still under way, I had not yet begun.",

   "Original post deleted.\n \n I've probably already done enough to ruin this friendship, so my last couple hours of writing have just gone poof!. Looking back at my last now unseen post, I realized that my intention was more to embarass than to conduct intelligent debate. I assure you old friend that each and every one of my responses to each and every one of your points would have been enough to keep you writing and debating for a good long while, but I know you have better things to do with your time. I myself should be spending these nights burning disks. In the end, none of this has anything to do with evidence, so why bother?\n \n I came across an interesting and very new theory which made me think. When time permits I will post a new thread so that all sides can discuss the issue and comment accordingly.\n \n MQ",
