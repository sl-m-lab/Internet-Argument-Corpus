   "I finally got to visit the Creation Museum in the Cincinnati area recently. \n In case you don't know, the Creation Museum is a 6-day ID museum that has generated a lot of controversy among scientists over the last 3 years or so. It's a $27 million facility that, frankly, is top-notch in terms of exhibit quality. It was built by a group known as Answers in Genesis, a pretty well-run and influential non-profit that promotes YEC intelligent design. \n \n There have been several very scathing reviews of the museum by people like PZ Myers and others who, IMO, have far too much of an un-objective chip on their shoulder toward creationism. So, being the evolutionist that I am, I visited the museum to see for myself. Based on these reviews, I was expecting some terrible offense on evolutionary scientists of unspeakable proportions. It really just wasn't like that at all. \n \n First, yes, it's unabashedly YEC creationist. To the point of overkill, IMO. But anyone going there will be well-aware of that beforehand and I think the best way to approach the place is to think of it as a museum dedicated to a certain viewpoint. Some evolutionists have portrayed the place in dramatic assertions like 'tragic' or even 'dangerous.' After visiting it, to that I say chill out. Frankly, I now think critics of this museum are being unfair. It's a creationism museum devoted to \"creation science\" and they fully SAY they are creationists. The museum didn't treat scientists offensively as some have claimed. In fact, it treated perspectives in a even-handed way in terms of respecting them, though it definitely takes a side.\n \n I'd have loved to have seen some of the museum devoted to OEC (old-earth creationism). It definitely promoted a literalist 6-day approach to Genesis. And it takes a definite Biblical-promotion and at times evangelistic approach. Regarding science, it does too much of starting with a premise rather than arriving at a premise based on observable evidence in nature.\n \n The planetarium show was spectacular. It's a top notch planetarium with up-to-date projection systems. Yes, there was science involved and if you can (as an evolutionist) manage to ignore about 2 or 3 statements about the Bible and a young universe, the show was very informative. IMO, this was the most scientifically strong thing the museum has going for it, mainly because there are numerous things in astronomy that are as-yet unexplained and don't fit the current scientific age-of-the-universe 'consensus.' (e.g. blue giant stars)\n \n Another positive is that the museum takes a very positive and embracing approach to nature in general--as much or more than any natural history museum I've ever been to. For anyone who assumes 'fundamentalist' Christians are anti-environment/anti-nature, this place will prove you wrong. These folks may not exactly be tree-huggers, but they promoted humanity caring for the earth and they treated their animals with respect and reverent care.\n \n The flood science got carried away IMO. I realize it's a staple of \"creation science\" but they really over-used it as a crutch to explain a number of things that are a problem for YEC, such as plate tectonics and fossil dating. In my opinion, a museum such as this can present OEC alongside YEC without compromising their religion, but I realize this is simply an area of disagreement I have with YECists.\n \n So all in all, it is what it is, but frankly it looks fantastic. It's worth a visit just to see the grounds, the planetarium, and to see all the exibits of what might be considered the pinnacle of YEC creationism even if you completely disagree with its viewpoints. All in all, I think a lot of the controversy over this museum in the last few years is indicative of a problem of vitriol on the part of evolutionists (and yes, it takes place on the part of creationists too, but I just didn't see that at this museum.) Maybe these scientists who have so castigated this place would like a natural history museum that is as well-presented as Ken Ham's Creation Museum and therefore are a little jealous. I don't know, but I do know that I enjoyed the museum even though I didn't agree with everything.",

   "A good post jyoshu, thanks very much. Since I live in the Northern Ky area, and no long distance traveling is involved in my going to see it, naturally it's something I continue to put off. But I'll get there someday! I've always thought I'd find it to be exactly as you described it - not nearly as offensive towards evolution as some atheists make it out to be. I've seen Ken Hamm in person a couple of times in a fairly large Baptist church in the Northern Ky area. He's not a jovial, slap-em-on-the-back, smiley kind of guy, but he's a true gentleman and has presentation and speaking abilities second to none. His sincerity to his beliefs is without question. \n \n As his website AIG concludes, the age of the earth is not the main issue concerning creationism - the earth can be young or old for creationism to be true. But the earth can't be young for Darwinism to be true - hence the chip-on-the-shoulder from much of the evolutionist camp. It's possible for the earth to be old, and the human population to be young. \"Evidence #5\" in the above link shows a common sense argument for a young human population.",

   "\"Evidence #5\" in the above link shows a common sense argument for a young human population.\n\n \n \nIt&#8217;s amazing what basic mathematics can show us about the age of the earth. We can calculate the years of human existence with the population doubling every 150 years (a very conservative figure) to get an estimate of what the world&#8217;s population should be after any given period of time.\n \n A biblical age of the earth (about 6,000 years) is consistent with the numbers yielded by such a calculation. In contrast, even a conservative evolutionary age of 50,000 years comes out to a staggering, impossibly high figure of 10 to the 99th power&#8212;greater than the number of atoms in the universe!\n \n Clearly, the claim that humans have inhabited the earth for tens of thousands of years is absurd!\n \n\n \n Wow, what a great argument! We can use the same \"logic\" for rabbits: take their current population and doubling rate and \"prove\" they didn't even exist 100 years ago!\n \n I love those \"common sense\" arguments.",
