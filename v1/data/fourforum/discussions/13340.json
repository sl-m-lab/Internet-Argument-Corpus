Politicians are run by machines and their dirty such as Harvey Milk said. If ANY change is going to come it is from OUR movement with openly gay elected officials. We have put our faith in the democratic party or any politician for that matter for far too long. I personally am disappointed on his lack of action on DADT especially.\n \n The progress we have made in the last 40 years since Stonewall is only because it has been upon the shoulders of a movement of grassroots activism and protest and a unity. Now we have so many splintered factions and cliches within the community that there really is NO community!\n \n Some gays especially A gays don't see the need for activism and are contempt with their own privileged form of second class citizenship. If ANY thing will change it has to be from the US's! No longer can we pander to those who's faith we put into to carry our banner. It has to be done from within.",
