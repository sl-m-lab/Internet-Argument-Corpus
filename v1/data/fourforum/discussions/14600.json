   "Most of the sections of the debate were alot of \"well you said\"s so I thought we could continue from here.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by fartingle \n This must be based on an idea like this- the very first living organism was nothing, a formless glob with no organs or various cell parts, yet it had all of its functions to be able to survive, eat, move, and reproduce- because otherwise it would need things. \n\n \n \nIs there a word for the fallacy which occurs when one pretends to respond to a statement by completly ignoring it and making another assertion?\n\n \n What I am trying to get accross here is that it either was a completely functioning glob or it (against ludicrous odds) had form, function, and structure all at once.",
