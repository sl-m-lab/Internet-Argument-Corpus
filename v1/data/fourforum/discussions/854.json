   "I have some problems with it:\n \n 1) The people creating it say that it will help with the tensions between heterosexuals and homosexuals. And it will...in school. However, the homosexual kids still have to live outside of school. They will live in the same communities as the heterosexuals. Separate schools will create separate groups, which will result in an \"us\" and \"them\" group. The two groups will likely not mix, and the end result is that the two groups will become more separated, which will not help in the movement for equal rights for homosexuals.\n \n 2) How do we determine who is homosexual? The basic premise of the school (as far as I can see anyway) is to separate the homosexual and heterosexual students so that the tensions that sometimes come between the students is eliminated. However, anyone could claim that they're homosexual, get into the school, and create the same problems that already exist.\n \n 3) Imagine that we did create this school, and it became known for its good education standards. Imagine that most of the schools in this city are failing. A heterosexual kid decides that he wants to go to the homosexual-only school. If the school accepts him, they violate the premise of the school. If the school turns him down, they violate Brown v. Board.",

Why spend high school deliberately making problems for a minority that vastly outnumbers you when you could spend it with people you could actually relate to? But I do think you have a point asking how they figure out who's gay to begin with. Is it just that once a kid is comfortable enough coming out (assuming he's even realized what his orientation is yet), he just transfers over there? I doubt they'd have very many freshmen or sophomores at all. Maybe a bunch more seniors. \n \n 3) Yeah... What's the point of even having an all-gay school if it's only nominally exclusive? I guess there wouldn't be too many straight kids who'd want to go to the school (really.. the gym showers would be a nightmare for them), but undoubtedly some would, eventually. Especially if it was a good school. And if no one did, it kinds reinforces the separatism...\n \n This might be a naive question, but what about gym showers, locker rooms, and all that?

   "I don't believe in making special considerations for anyone based on sex or color. But considerations are made these days for the express belief that because individuals cannot choose what color or sex they will be that they will have some inherent difficulties in making it through life as well as the white male (a load of bull, but that is the view). If this is the prevailing thought, and it is the law, then I accept it until I can change it (or I die, whichever comes first). I argue against it, I don't like it, but I have to accept it somewhat or I go crazy.\n \n What I will not accept is this notion that homosexuals should be lumped in this group. Homosexuality is choice, not genetics. There are many cases of people coming out of homosexuality who were in the lifestyle for many years. If this was genetic, people would not be able to change their orientation, just like they cannot change their skin color (except for Michael Jackson) or their sex (except for Michael Jackson) :). I know there are medical ways to do this, but you are still who you are, no matter how much you screw around with your body. \n \n Homosexuals say they want equal treatment. Fine, if you want to go into a church that will allow you to get married, you go right ahead. If I was not a Christian, I could even likely accept gay marriage socially, because in a strictly atheistic society, there would likely be nothing wrong with gays committing themselves to one another. \n \n But this school creates an atmosphere that gays are a group in and of themselves that deserve special treatment. They shouldn't have to be made to go through what the majority of kids go through in high school without even being gay. They shouldn't have to live life like we live it, accepting that life is not fair and we need to make the best of it we can.\n \n Even if you believe that homosexuality is not a choice, that it is just like skin color or sex, then why should we go back to the days before Brown vs Board? Why should we go back to a system that is proven unfair?\n \n This is about the most screwed up idea I have heard of in a long while. Our country is heading down the crapper real, real quick.",

I've compiled a brief list of articles on the origins of homosexuals, most of which are taken from a search on the National Library of Medicine's PubMed site. All but the first two are actually just detailed abstracts of the articles, and should be pretty easy to get through if you don't have a lot of time.\n \n 1\n Sexual differentiation of the human hypothalamus in relation to gender and sexual orientation \n \n This first one's a huge PDF file, but I included it because of the section entitled \"The hypothalamus\" on page one. It talks about size variances between the hypothalamuses (hypothalami?) of hetero- and homosexual males and their suspected role in sex and gender differences aside from orientation.\n \n Here's the abstract for a follow-up article written by the same guy seven years later, if you don't want to wait for the PDF to load:\n \n Abstract of the above article \n \n I wanted to point out this one quote in the abstract:\n \n \"There is no convincing evidence for postnatal social factors involved in the determination of sexual orientation.\"\n \n 2\n Bonobos sex and society \n \n \"Bonobos, primates which share 98% of human DNA, exhibit homosexual behavior.\" More indication that it's natural, since it's found in nature.\n \n \n 3 & 4\n Sexual orientation and the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio\n \n Are 2D:4D finger ratios related to sexual orientation? \n \n In a study of 240 people (60 each of exclusively hetero- and homosexual males and females), they found significant differences in finger length ratios of homosexual males and females, suggesting that they were \"exposed to non-disruptive, but elevated levels of androgens in utero.\" I'll let you read it. The second article says the theory only works with men, and not with women.\n \n \n 5\n Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women \n \n Homosexuals are 39% more likely to be \"non-right-handed,\" suggesting a neurological origin of homosexuality.\n \n \n 6, 7, & 8\n Number of older brothers and sexual orientation\n \n How many gay men owe their sexual orientation to fraternal birth order? \n \n Fraternal birth order and the maternal immune hypothesis of male homosexuality.\n \n These three discuss a theory that the more older brothers you have, the more likely you are to be homosexual (if you're male). Keep in mind the birth order theory isn't supposed to be the one biological explanation for homosexuality. The second author predicts it's only responsible for sexual orientation in about 1 in 7 men. But if so, that's still extremely significant.\n \n \n 9\n Large sexual-orientation-related differences in performance... \n \n Compared homosexuals to heterosexuals on some physical/mental performance tests. The differences could mean some variation in the parietal cortex between gay and straight people.\n \n \n Anyway, I would suggest doing a search on PubMed on your own; it's a fantastic resource. Compare the number of articles you find validating biological origins to the number of those claiming it to be choice.\n \n Cheers,",

It isn't the Christian religion that people practice that makes them act differently towards gays but rather the way that they were brought up on Christian ideals. That is why I think about as many Athiests will think of gays as evil as long as they were brought up with Christian ideals.\n \n However, I think that point needs to be taken further and I would have to debate that human psychology comes into play here as well. People just feel uncomfortable around anything that is strange or different to them assuming they don't understand it. This can cause fear and fear can feed the idea that the thing that is different is also evil. This would work hand in hand with social ideals and Christian ideals if they are instilled in us.",

   "I personally think this gay school stuff is getting way out of hand, so you're gay, why do you have to have your own school? Because you get picked on for being a homo? I got picked on for not being proactive, not playing any sports, got D's in school; I got picked on every second of every day in School. And because I got picked on do you think I have scares from it? Nope! I grew some nuts and finally decided to stand up for myself. People today want to take people away from there problems, instead of teaching people how to deal with the problems, For instance, you send a gay kid to a gay school, what will happen when he graduates and gets a job? He's guna go threw the same thing he went threw if he went to a normal school, get PICKED ON! Gay school's do nothing but turn the kids into bigger XXXXXXX!\n \n America needs to stop pampering kids and teach them right from wrong, and make them face there fears and there problems, and make them believe in who they are, instead of turning kids into a bunch of XXXXXXX! I remember being a kid in High school, I remember having balls, I was arrogant, all I see with the teenagers today is a bunch of spoiled snobs that get everything given to them and they don't have an ounce of respect for anything or anybody.",
