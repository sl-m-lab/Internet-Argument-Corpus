   "And, what's more, they cain't handle their likker!\n \n They don't know how to savor fine likker!\n \n As to their plaguey attitudes, from a letter in a local paper:\n \n \nAs I read Earl Matthews' March 22 letter, I was struck by the hatred I felt billowing from my paper. I am not originally from Alabama. I am one of those \"da- Yankees\" that y'all so lovingly refer to. It is for this reason that I have continually held my pen after reading or hearing such tirades in the past. Y'all seem to have a \"thing\" about folks like me sticking my nose in on this subject.\n \n But I figure I've been down here now for near about 30 years, so I have the right to speak for once.\n \n I have been to every Christian form of church there is, from Baptist to Mormon. I have had many friends who were Jewish, though I have never been to synagogue. I have also had some Muslim friends.\n \n The people I have heard the most hatred from are overwhelmingly Christian. I am not saying all Christians speak hatefully - quite the contrary - but I have, because of my own personal experience with people of the Christian persuasion, decided that it is not the religion or belief system for me.\n \n I cannot be anyone's judge but my own. I cannot hate someone else because they don't look like me or believe like me or pray to the same \"god\" as me. Christians even fight against and hate other sects of Christians, for crying out loud.\n \n Now, don't get me wrong; I have my beliefs. I believe I should do the best I can while I am on this planet. I should work hard and treat others the way I would like to be treated. I don't steal and I do my best not to lie, although I am human and I have told some.\n \n I don't believe in killing people - unless someone was to hurt my child. I would fight to the death for her. I don't deliberately try to hurt anyone. I try not to hate anyone. \n \n But I do all of this because it is what I should do, not because I want points to earn my way into heaven. I don't know what happens when we die and no one here on this planet today knows what happens when we die. You can believe what you want and tell yourselves you believe it, but you don't know. You will never convince me that you do and that I will go to hell if I don't believe you.\n \n No one has that right, and they certainly do not have the right to judge me as per their own religion.\n \n \"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\" I believe that's in the Bible.\nWaaaal, lemme tell yew this. I ain't got no problem standin' in judgment of those ignorant folk if they mistreat my kin. And they are gonna be a sorry bunch of buzards if they don't toe the line, my line!",

I wonder how Southern States will adapt to the two-tiered society without blacks for blame.\n\n \n \n That is not a problem. The wheels are already turning to shift blame to the mexicans and the chinese. Think back over recent public statements regarding the chinese. China is no longer simply refered to as \"china\" our politicians are making certain that they refer to it as \"red china\" or \"communist china\". If they sign drilling contracts, they are trying to \"tie up oil resources\". If they spend in a year what we spend in a month on their military, it is an \"alarming military buildup\". If they refuse to divulge sensitive tactical information at the demand of the US and Japan, they are not being \"transparent\" and are \"threatening the balance of power in the region\".\n \n The mexicans are both easier and more difficult. It does not take much to point the ifnger of blame at the illegal aliens. After all, they are all over the place and work cheaper than dirt.
