I think that the BEST thign to do would have been to go to war with the drug companies and handle the problem that way. The SECOND best thing would have been a comprehensive prescription drug program to help people get the drugs they need along with some kind of price controls on drugs. The way we did it, throwing money at a massive social program without any controls on price or the drug companies, sucked and is not even on my \"best ways\" list.\n \n It has been public knowledge for years that the way critical drugs are priced (drugs that keep you alive...that you will DIE without) is by calcualting average income of the target group, calcualting the maximum amount they can pay, and that is the price.\n \n THe problem with our great an glorious 2 billion $ prescription drug plan is that they just added \"subsidy from government\" to that calcualtion and raised the price on the drugs. Many people are now paying MORE for their drugs than they were without the government assistance because drug companies just raised prices.\n \n I am typically a capitalist, but there is a real problem with the structure of our medical system in the US. Something is WRONG when a hospital charges more to care for an uninsured person than an insured one. \n \n It seems to me that health care and prescrition drugs in general fall outside the root cpaitalist theory.

   "(Sorry if this is in the wrong board, I'm new)\n \n I think I'm leaning to... \"No\" on this issue... To me its theft. The government steals money from the more fortunate to give it to the less fortunate... The more fortunate have to work to compensate for the less fortunates lack of work. All social welfare should be removed. With the extra money coming in, taxpayers who want to help the less fortunate can donate the money into private charity.\n\n \n Social welfare programs are very necessary in our society, for 85-90 percent of the people. Any person who is in a household that earns less than 150,000 dollars a year needs financial compensation from government institutions and programs. a taxpayer that is given a tax break will use that money from better clothes and cosmetics, not to feed needy families. American adevertisements make consumers GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY. \n \n Today, consumers are forced to take out loans to pay for cars, houses, schooling, and most other things. This needs to end. a consumer should not have to resort to credit to pay for the things that they NEED like education, housing, and transportation. These things should be provided, at least in part, with a pool of tax money. The middle class in America needs to understand that the problem lies in the Ruling class, and that an overthrow of that class is the only solution to a fair distribution of wealth.\n \n Charity DOES NOT WORK!!!!
