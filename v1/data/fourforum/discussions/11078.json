   "First of all, I personally wasn't 'using it as a tool against Dems'. You all know I disagree with many of the Dem. policies/philosophies, but in that case I was disagreeing with Pub spending! Period!\n\n When you criticize the pubs for acting too much like dems, you have obviously drug the dems into something that they don't belong in.\n If you were just out to criticize the pubs, then why even mention the dems?\n \n \n \nAgain, Bush has been a big disappointment inasmuch as many of his spending policies. Conservatives want smaller govt.\n\n I get bored with these inaccurate stereo-types.\n \"Conservatives want smaller govt\"?\n Then why is it that they repeatedly campaign for the government to stick their nose into our SOCIAL lives?\n No to abortion. No to consensual adult sex acts. ONLY tell kids \"abstinence only\", sticking the government's nose firmly into an issue which should be a purely educational one.\n \n Conservatives want \"smaller govt\" when it comes to THEIR favored neck of the woods. Business.\n They want the government to be \"hands off\" when it comes to them making a buck, and how they do it. (Unless it comes to bailing their assest out of a mortgage \"crisis\"...)\n They DO want the government to be \"hands on\" when it comes to dictating people's private lives.\n \n \n \nThat is a conservative philosophy and that's what I consider my self first and foremost. The Pubs have not lived up to my conservative beliefs in the last few years.\n\n It looks like the \"party's\" beliefs have catered to a different crowd under George Bush.\n The evangelicals have been invited in the front door, and proven an embarrassment in some ways.\n \n And Bush's \"conservative\" efforts are often over-shadowed by his gaffs and mistakes.\n So it's popular to declare criticism of Bush...\n \n But like you pointed out (again trying to mire the Dems in deeper into the mess than is warranted), the PUBS were behind this Iraqi war.\n The PUBS are behind a lot of moves that directly contradict the will of the democratic masses.\n Like stem cell research. Or gay employment protection. Or sexual orientation hate crime legislation.\n \n It's easy to pick and choose a political mish-mash recipe, and declare it fits under one generic label that nobody agrees on. \"Pubs\" or \"Dems\"...\n \n \n \nAs far as the war is concerned, we went in because our intelligence (which Clinton decimated during his presidency) said he was trying to manufacture WMDs.\n\n \"our intelligence\"?\n Would that include the \"intelligence\" of some people who EXPLICITLY stated that there were no WMDs in Iraq?\n Or our \"intelligence\" from the U.N. guys who finally got in for an inspection, and found nothing?\n \n The status of \"our intelligence\" was driven on one hand by Bush and his crew, and the contradicting \"intelligence\" driven to the back-drop.\n \n \n \nMost people, both citizens and politicians, both Dem and Pub wanted to go in there.\n\n I've got some ocean front property I want to sell you.\n It's got a great view. Ocean breeze cools the house in the summer. Balmy temperatures during the winter.\n In a low population Arizona zip code...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n If you buy a lemon car, and then are dissatisfied with the ACTUAL car you get, it makes no sense for the person who sold you that car to say \"but you wanted the car\".\n Yes. I wanted the car YOU SOLD ME ON.\n \n I want the WAR whereby the Bush administration claimed it would pay for itself.\n I want the WAR whereby the Bush administration claimed we would be in and out on a time-scale of months.\n I want the WAR whereby the Bush administration claimed losses would be minimal.\n \n And now that I've got this car in the drive-way, it makes no sense to tell me what we previously \"wanted\" when we were sold a pack of misinformation to get here...\n \n \n \nNow that we are there, what would you have us do?\n\n I would have Bush apologize for his mistakes.\n I would have people RECOGNIZE the mistakes, and acknowledge them. Cause those that want to ignore the past are doomed to repeat its mistakes.\n I would have the administration STOP trying to come up with b.s. reasons for why we supposedly got in this war in the first place.\n \n THEN, and ONLY then can we have an honest discussion on what we SHOULD do when the Republican stance is less closely tied to preventing party embarrassment and more closely tied to what is good for the country instead.\n \n \n \nI understand why the Dems have shirked responsibility for their votes and made this 'Bush's war' but why haven't they cut off funding? \n\n Where have you been?\n They have tried.\n \n \n \nWhy haven't they (the dems) brought the boys home? \n\n Where have you been?\n They have tried.\n \n Furthermore, \"Commander in Chief\" is not just something pretty to tack onto the title.\n It's the PRESIDENT's call on directing the military.\n When you've got a Dem in the office, then that question will make sense.",

So how can anyone, anywhere blame the BUSH ADMINISTRATION as if it acted apart from the complete approval of the entire House and Senate which was acting with the express approval of their constituents, the American People; save for a few individuals on either side that disagreed with the actions taken at that time? \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu7_VGOBHhEsBP.tXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBybnZlZnRlBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=127s3etiq/EXP=1205955157/**http%3a//clinton.senate.gov/speeches/iraq_101002.html\n October 10, 2002\n \n Floor Speech of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\n on S.J. Res. 45, A Resolution to Authorize the Use of\n United States Armed Forces Against Iraq\n \n As Delivered\n \n Today we are asked whether to give the President of the United States authority to use force in Iraq should diplomatic efforts fail to dismantle Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear program.\n \n I am honored to represent nearly 19 million New Yorkers, a thoughtful democracy of voices and opinions who make themselves heard on the great issues of our day especially this one. Many have contacted my office about this resolution, both in support of and in opposition to it, and I am grateful to all who have expressed an opinion.\n \n I also greatly respect the differing opinions within this body. The debate they engender will aid our search for a wise, effective policy. Therefore, on no account should dissent be discouraged or disparaged. It is central to our freedom and to our progress, for on more than one occasion, history has proven our great dissenters to be right.\n \n Now, I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on power. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing over 20 thousand people. Unfortunately, during the 1980's, while he engaged in such horrific activity, he enjoyed the support of the American government, because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran.\n \n In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge.\n \n As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities.\n \n In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated \"sovereign sites\" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets.\n \n In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad.\n \n In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.\n \n It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\n \n Now this much is undisputed. The open questions are: what should we do about it? How, when, and with whom?\n \n Some people favor attacking Saddam Hussein now, with any allies we can muster, in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections would not produce the required disarmament, and that deposing Saddam would be a positive good for the Iraqi people and would create the possibility of a secular democratic state in the Middle East, one which could perhaps move the entire region toward democratic reform.\n \n This view has appeal to some, because it would assure disarmament; because it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the Shiites and Kurds in 1991, and our support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980's when he was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people; and because it would give the Iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom.\n \n However, this course is fraught with danger. We and our NATO allies did not depose Mr. Milosevic, who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s. Instead, by stopping his aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo, and keeping on the tough sanctions, we created the conditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being in the dock being tried for war crimes as we speak.\n \n If we were to attack Iraq now, alone or with few allies, it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us. In recent days, Russia has talked of an invasion of Georgia to attack Chechen rebels. India has mentioned the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Pakistan. And what if China were to perceive a threat from Taiwan?\n \n So Mr. President, for all its appeal, a unilateral attack, while it cannot be ruled out, on the present facts is not a good option.\n \n Others argue that we should work through the United Nations and should only resort to force if and when the United Nations Security Council approves it. This too has great appeal for different reasons. The UN deserves our support. Whenever possible we should work through it and strengthen it, for it enables the world to share the risks and burdens of global security and when it acts, it confers a legitimacy that increases the likelihood of long-term success. The UN can help lead the world into a new era of global cooperation and the United States should support that goal.\n \n But there are problems with this approach as well. The United Nations is an organization that is still growing and maturing. It often lacks the cohesion to enforce its own mandates. And when Security Council members use the veto, on occasion, for reasons of narrow-minded interests, it cannot act. In Kosovo, the Russians did not approve NATO military action because of political, ethnic, and religious ties to the Serbs. The United States therefore could not obtain a Security Council resolution in favor of the action necessary to stop the dislocation and ethnic cleansing of more than a million Kosovar Albanians. However, most of the world was with us because there was a genuine emergency with thousands dead and a million driven from their homes. As soon as the American-led conflict was over, Russia joined the peacekeeping effort that is still underway.\n \n In the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, nuclear weapons.\n \n So, Mr. President, the question is how do we do our best to both defuse the real threat that Saddam Hussein poses to his people, to the region, including Israel, to the United States, to the world, and at the same time, work to maximize our international support and strengthen the United Nations?\n \n While there is no perfect approach to this thorny dilemma, and while people of good faith and high intelligence can reach diametrically opposed conclusions, I believe the best course is to go to the UN for a strong resolution that scraps the 1998 restrictions on inspections and calls for complete, unlimited inspections with cooperation expected and demanded from Iraq. I know that the Administration wants more, including an explicit authorization to use force, but we may not be able to secure that now, perhaps even later. But if we get a clear requirement for unfettered inspections, I believe the authority to use force to enforce that mandate is inherent in the original 1991 UN resolution, as President Clinton recognized when he launched Operation Desert Fox in 1998.\n \n If we get the resolution that President Bush seeks, and if Saddam complies, disarmament can proceed and the threat can be eliminated. Regime change will, of course, take longer but we must still work for it, nurturing all reasonable forces of opposition.\n \n If we get the resolution and Saddam does not comply, then we can attack him with far more support and legitimacy than we would have otherwise.\n \n If we try and fail to get a resolution that simply, but forcefully, calls for Saddam's compliance with unlimited inspections, those who oppose even that will be in an indefensible position. And, we will still have more support and legitimacy than if we insist now on a resolution that includes authorizing military action and other requirements giving some nations superficially legitimate reasons to oppose any Security Council action. They will say we never wanted a resolution at all and that we only support the United Nations when it does exactly what we want.\n \n I believe international support and legitimacy are crucial. After shots are fired and bombs are dropped, not all consequences are predictable. While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put troops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein's biological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand his immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, however, with the outcome certain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can't use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this possibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. And according to recent reports, the CIA agrees with this analysis. A world united in sharing the risk at least would make this occurrence less likely and more bearable and would be far more likely to share with us the considerable burden of rebuilding a secure and peaceful post-Saddam Iraq.\n \n President Bush's speech in Cincinnati and the changes in policy that have come forth since the Administration began broaching this issue some weeks ago have made my vote easier. Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first and placing highest priority on a simple, clear requirement for unlimited inspections, I will take the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a UN resolution and will seek to avoid war, if at all possible.\n \n Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely, and therefore, war less likely, and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause, I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation. If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few Democrats, I am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go way with delay will oppose any UN resolution calling for unrestricted inspections.\n \n This is a very difficult vote. This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make -- any vote that may lead to war should be hard -- but I cast it with conviction.\n \n And perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations or in war. Secondly, I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President's efforts to wage America's war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. And thirdly, I want the men and women in our Armed Forces to know that if they should be called upon to act against Iraq, our country will stand resolutely behind them.\n \n My vote is not, however, a vote for any new doctrine of pre-emption, or for uni-lateralism, or for the arrogance of American power or purpose -- all of which carry grave dangers for our nation, for the rule of international law and for the peace and security of people throughout the world.\n \n Over eleven years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community. Time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions. This matter cannot be left hanging forever with consequences we would all live to regret. War can yet be avoided, but our responsibility to global security and to the integrity of United Nations resolutions protecting it cannot. I urge the President to spare no effort to secure a clear, unambiguous demand by the United Nations for unlimited inspections.\n \n And finally, on another personal note, I come to this decision from the perspective of a Senator from New York who has seen all too closely the consequences of last year's terrible attacks on our nation. In balancing the risks of action versus inaction, I think New Yorkers who have gone through the fires of hell may be more attuned to the risk of not acting. I know that I am.\n \n So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interests of our nation. A vote for it is not a vote to rush to war; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our President and we say to him - use these powers wisely and as a last resort. And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein - this is your last chance - disarm or be disarmed.\n \n Thank you, Mr. President.",

That is real and undeniable evidence which belies all of the current democratic posturing to the contrary. Unless of course we are going to now deny the tons of chemical, biological, nuclear labs and other weapons our inspectors documented, or the documented Iranian and Kurdish dead; all due to his chemical attacks, be it anthrax, mustard or ebola. Either way, we know it happened, yet somehow, Bush is now a liar. \n \n The rest of her speech is just as gripping and I suggest that you read it all because it is far from spam. It is solid evidence that Bush didn't have to lie to convince the dems of what they already knew about this tyrant.",

   "[QUOTE]\nWhen you criticize the pubs for acting too much like dems, you have obviously drug the dems into something that they don't belong in.\n If you were just out to criticize the pubs, then why even mention the dems?\n\n \n \n First of all, 'tax and spend' is the know fiscal philosophy of many liberal democrats. I said Bush has been 'don't tax and spend' which IS much like the Dem philosophy. I can critisize Pubs if I wish and I can and do critisize Dems too. All you do is spout off about Repbulicians without acknologizing anything about dems. \n \n \n \nI get bored with these inaccurate stereo-types.\n \"Conservatives want smaller govt\"?\n Then why is it that they repeatedly campaign for the government to stick their nose into our SOCIAL lives?\n No to abortion. No to consensual adult sex acts. ONLY tell kids \"abstinence only\", sticking the government's nose firmly into an issue which should be a purely educational one.\n\n \n \n How dare you mis-characterize my post like this! In fact, I think somewhere in the other thread I even said that evangelicals are bad for the Pub party. I'm more Libertarian than anything else and you KNOW I don't hold those social values. Is that why you didn't even let me know about this thread? So you could completely lie about my position? What a bunch of poop! I don't think the govt. should get involved in MOST of what its involved in so why would I want it to take on moral issues? Your post is complete BS and you shouldn't try to misrepresent people. Why not carry on an honest discussion?\n \n \n \nConservatives want \"smaller govt\" when it comes to THEIR favored neck of the woods. Business.\n They want the government to be \"hands off\" when it comes to them making a buck, and how they do it. (Unless it comes to bailing their assest out of a mortgage \"crisis\"...)\n They DO want the government to be \"hands on\" when it comes to dictating people's private lives.\n\n \n Again, true conservatives want smaller govt. We don't want the govt. legislating morality. That's not and shouldn't be the job of the govt.\n \n \n \n \nIt looks like the \"party's\" beliefs have catered to a different crowd under George Bush.\n The evangelicals have been invited in the front door, and proven an embarrassment in some ways.\n\n \n Here we agree.\n \n \nAnd Bush's \"conservative\" efforts are often over-shadowed by his gaffs and mistakes.\n So it's popular to declare criticism of Bush...\n \n But like you pointed out (again trying to mire the Dems in deeper into the mess than is warranted), the PUBS were behind this Iraqi war.\n The PUBS are behind a lot of moves that directly contradict the will of the democratic masses.\n Like stem cell research. Or gay employment protection. Or sexual orientation hate crime legislation.\n \n It's easy to pick and choose a political mish-mash recipe, and declare it fits under one generic label that nobody agrees on. \"Pubs\" or \"Dems\"...\n\n \n The support for the war in Iraq was overwhelming, on both sides of the aisle! To say that the Dems (as a whole, there were people on both sides that didn't want to go) were anything less then enthusiastic is intellectually inaccurate.\n \n But then you do what you are complaining about! You try to make it seem that every Pub. is evangelical and wants to oppress gays! How hypocritical!! Why are you are always such an intellectual fraud?\n \n \n\"our intelligence\"?\n Would that include the \"intelligence\" of some people who EXPLICITLY stated that there were no WMDs in Iraq?\n Or our \"intelligence\" from the U.N. guys who finally got in for an inspection, and found nothing?\n \n The status of \"our intelligence\" was driven on one hand by Bush and his crew, and the contradicting \"intelligence\" driven to the back-drop.\n\n \n There were WMDs in Iraq and Saddam was intent on developing more. He stated this plainly and he had to be removed. Not to mention what he did to his own people. \n \n \n \nI've got some ocean front property I want to sell you.\n It's got a great view. Ocean breeze cools the house in the summer. Balmy temperatures during the winter.\n In a low population Arizona zip code...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n If you buy a lemon car, and then are dissatisfied with the ACTUAL car you get, it makes no sense for the person who sold you that car to say \"but you wanted the car\".\n Yes. I wanted the car YOU SOLD ME ON.\n \n I want the WAR whereby the Bush administration claimed it would pay for itself.\n I want the WAR whereby the Bush administration claimed we would be in and out on a time-scale of months.\n I want the WAR whereby the Bush administration claimed losses would be minimal.\n \n And now that I've got this car in the drive-way, it makes no sense to tell me what we previously \"wanted\" when we were sold a pack of misinformation to get here...\n \n \n \n I would have Bush apologize for his mistakes.\n I would have people RECOGNIZE the mistakes, and acknowledge them. Cause those that want to ignore the past are doomed to repeat its mistakes.\n I would have the administration STOP trying to come up with b.s. reasons for why we supposedly got in this war in the first place.\n \n THEN, and ONLY then can we have an honest discussion on what we SHOULD do when the Republican stance is less closely tied to preventing party embarrassment and more closely tied to what is good for the country instead.\n\n \n \n Your analogy is not compatible with the facts. Again, you are being intellectually dishonest. Either you are brainwashed or you really believe the stuff you say, but either way, you are incorrect in your assumptions. And there you go with words again, as if that makes any difference. What Bush says...As if him apologizing would somehow change the situation on the ground and THEN you could give us YOUR PLAN, instead of constant carping with no solutions. Again, what would have us do? The war WAS over quickly and easily. The insurgency is mainly foreign terrorists trained and supplied by Iran (your buddy). \n \n \n \nWhere have you been?\n They have tried.\n\n \n What are you talking about. They've voted for funding everytime!\n \n \n \nWhere have you been?\n They have tried.\n\n \n Again, how is voting to fund the occupation 'bringing them home'? Are you always so intellectually dishonest? Are you that thick? \n \n \nFurthermore, \"Commander in Chief\" is not just something pretty to tack onto the title.\n It's the PRESIDENT's call on directing the military.\n When you've got a Dem in the office, then that question will make sense.\n\n \n You constantly diminish the office so I don't know why you'd suddenly act like you have any respect. Oh, I guess its more of that dishonesty, nevermind! Neither Dem candidate states they are going to leave Iraq. I can't remember if Obama did, but Hillary won't pledge to bring them home. Obama said he'll cut troop levels, but he's not going to 'get out' as you claim. Besides, a week ago, I'd have agreed that we'll get to see what a Dem. would do when they get in the White House. But now, I'm going to have to believe the polls. McCain will be your next President of the United States! Then you can stew for a while and start working on some lies and misdirections about him!",

The question is what now? What now? Can't you see that reality it not going to change no matter what words are spoken? So the question is what is the solution?\n \n \n \nLike I said, but you obviously ignored, we can't have a REAL discussion on what we SHOULD do as long as some people keep miring down the conversation with b.s. justifications for the initial existence of the war.\n It's like debating what to do with the lemon car, when some of the car owners REFUSE to acknowledge it's a lemon.\n\n \n How is this accurate? Why can't we discuss solutions? Why would someone, in your oppinion, have to say something the don't believe before you'll talk about changing a situation that you don't like anyway?\n \n \n \nSpeaking of intellectual dishonesty.\n Or maybe just plain a downright lie, bordering on stupidity.\n Can you justify your claim that Iran is my buddy?\n\n \n I just appears that way, in several of your comments where you curse the 'expansionist' govt. in Tel Aviv while making excuses and denials for Iran. I didn't say that you said Iran was your buddy, just that it appears that it is that way. Am I wrong? If so, my mistake, I must of mistaken your constant fawning.\n \n \nI think you're looking the wrong way for who is being \"dishonest\" here.\n When you honestly address my challenge on proving your Iran claim, I WILL honestly address your question of \"what would you have us do?\"\n\n \n See above, then you can tell me.\n \n \n \n \nI am amused at how you denigrate the idea of complete complete and abrupt withdrawing (which I agree with you on), but somehow \"voting for funding everytime\" is glossed over like that is all the story.\n They have repeatedly tried to limit the funding, necessitating less presence in Iraq.\n While they may be criticized for caving too early, you need to acknowledge the attempts.\n\n \n What we needed was a large presence in Iraq. And now its working. Also, the Iraqis are now fighting against the foreign terrorists which is why things are changing.\n \n \n \n< yawn <\n No response to the fact that it is the PRESIDENT who has that power, and not Congress.\n They have \"voted for funding\", but only after a funding \"chicken\" battle with the Republicans, which the Dems have repeatedly lost. \n\n \n Can't fight without soldiers. Can't have soldiers without cash.\n \n \n \nWrong.\n I criticize BUSH in his ACTIONS while in office.\n I have not \"diminished the office\".\n\n \n You talk more about selling lemon cars than actions. Saying the president is no better than a lying used car salesman somehow builds respect for the office? Maybe I'm just not getting it.\n \n \n \nWhere did I say Obama said anything about \"get out\"?\n\n \n \n Nowhere, but you talk and talk and talk about going in there, like it was done just to #### you off. You act like its an illegal and immoral war so how but you won't tell us what you'd do to fix it. I can only surmise that you'd want to end it.

You quote a portion of my comments on fiscal conservatism and then go into a fundi wish list...\n\n 1) You never specified \"fiscal conservatism\".\n 2) I am talking about the GENERAL CONSERVATIVE stance.\n \n 3) It is incredibly dishonest of you to proclaim that I am talking about YOUR position, and at the same try to refine what the \"conservative stance\" is and is not.\n You can't have it both ways.\n When you tell me that something is NOT \"conservative\", you have obviously just acknowledged I was talking about something OTHER THAN \"your position\".\n \n At this stage, I don't know if you're just playing a bad troll game, or if you're just not capable of reading.\n \n \n \nWait, wait, wait, not only is that what YOU are doing, you are falsely representing people's positions.\n\n You don't have a fricken' clue what a \"true scotsman\" fallacy is, do you.\n I have EXPLICITLY acknowledged that OTHER types of conservatives exist.\n YOU are the one trying to proclaim that my demonstration of some people's positions is NOT \"conservative\".\n \n If you can't comprehend how that means I am NOT committing a \"true scotsman fallacy\", and you are, then you really have no clue what you are talking about.\n \n \n \nAt least I haven't done that, in fact isn't the definition of LIBERAL more govt. more spending more govt. control? I mean that's where the term came from, the liberal use of government.\n\n I challenge you to show me any definition of \"liberal\", from a credible, non-partisan dictionary, that includes what you describe.\n \n \n \nAgain, you do exactly what you accuse me of. And you are substituting the evangelical christian platform for 'conservative' and substituting 'conservative' for 'Republican'. The hyprocracy is laughable.\n\n As much as you don't want to admit it, evangelical christians make up a MAJOR portion of \"conservatives\".\n For you to try to delineate \"conservative\" from evangelicals WHO ARE A PART OF conservatism is ridiculously dishonest.\n \n \n \nAgain, I think you are sterotyping conservatives and the importance most of us put on social issurs. Now, I'm not denying that these views are held by some people on the right, but not nearly as many as you sterotype and they aren't high on the list of those that do.\n\n Actually, when you tried to proclaim an issue as \"not conservative\", that is precisely what you did.\n \n \n \n(Except, as I said, for the fundies who have an overblown sense of their importance to the Pub party and conservatism in general. What you keep saying is that same as if I kept saying that ALL Dems were Communists!\n\n This is mindless.\n I can examine statistics on \"evangelicals\" and \"religious\" make-up of conservatives.\n I can SHOW YOU the Republican party platform which includes a variety of these \"moral\" issues.\n \n Can you show me ANY significant \"communism\" in the Democrat party?\n \n You might as well try to give me an analogy of vampiric Democrats to an analysis of \n \n \n \nDo you see the difference now? Just because a conservative opposes sodomy doesn't mean the rest of us give it must thought.\n\n Once again, refuting nothing that I said.\n I never claimed that SOME (don't try \"the rest of us\" garbage) do not oppose sodomy.\n The point is that there is a LARGE PERCENTAGE of \"conservatives\" who DO favor sodomy laws.\n Just take \"Sally Kerns\" who professes she has broad support for her prejudice which backs an ideal that *gays are worse than terrorists*.\n \n There are frequently anti-gay discrimination measures in the accepted Republican party platform.\n That's a fact.\n Just because you don't agree that is \"conservative\" doesn't mean anything because it's still there!\n \n \n \nEveryone in the Senate and the DOD and the President were looking at the SAME information. Being the President means you have to offer solutions to problems, Bush wanted to remove Saddam. Hillary, Kerry, and the list goes on, while looking at the SAME intelligence (they all see the same reports) all came to the same conclusions as Bush. You act as if Bush misread a memo and just repeated it and everyone had to agree. They all looked at the SAME info and came to the same conclusions, that Saddam had WMDs and wanted more.\n\n And during that time, you have the people who were saying \"nay\" being ignored.\n Or even worse, the Valerie Plame debacle.\n And that lays SQUARELY at the feet of the Republicans.\n \n \n \nWell there you go, the minority! As in the evangelical platform. Thank you.\n\n It's amusing how you try to accuse me of PRECISELY what you just did there.\n The \"evangelical platform\" is typically NOT in the minority.\n Anti-gay attempts ORIGINATE with the Republican party.\n \n Riddle me this.\n If the Democrats don't support anti-gay discrimination, and the Republicans ALSO supposedly don't support it, then WHY do we still have it?\n \n \n \nYou keep acting like Bush lied. The intelligence may have been flawed, but that's not the same as lying.\n\n Strawman argument. I never said lied.\n I don't use the term \"lie\" with regards to the WMDs issue.\n \n With regards to OTHER claims like \"war would pay for itself\" and *we'll be in and out in a few months*, THOSE issues are closer to lies.\n Or just plain stupidity.\n \n \n \nYour analogy was that Bush had a lemon that he KNEW was a lemon and was trying to rip off everyone. That is why its wrong.\n\n Show me WHERE in my analogy I said that Bush KNEW it was a lemon, pre-purchase.\n You keep trying to dishonestly claim I said things I did not.\n \n \n \nNo, you go on and on about how terrible the war is and I'm just curious how you would fix all of this. It is easy to complain, but hard to offer solutions...\n\n Like I said, you need to PROVE your lie that Iran is my \"buddy\", or acknowledge it was a lie, before I will go further on that subject.\n \n In your case, it's just easy to lie...\n \n \n \nStill the question remains, even if it was a mistake to go in there, the fact remains that we are there. The question is what now? What now? Can't you see that reality it not going to change no matter what words are spoken? So the question is what is the solution?\n\n I have already talked about this, but STILL you refuse to address what I am actually saying.\n The answer to \"what now\" is significantly different inbetween people who RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM and those that THINK IT'S STILL A GOOD THING.\n Can you wrap your head around that?\n \n For the \"lemon\" analogy, one group wants to get rid of the car, while the other insists on driving it everywhere like it's a show-case.\n We obviously can't agree on what to do with what we have if one side is insisting \"it's a good thing\" and the other thinks \"it's pure garbage\".\n Can you acknowledge that?\n Or should I just expect you to ignore that point again?\n \n \n \nHow is this accurate? Why can't we discuss solutions? Why would someone, in your oppinion, have to say something the don't believe before you'll talk about changing a situation that you don't like anyway?\n\n Are you for real?\n Can you LOOK at what's happening on Capital Hill?\n Can you acknowledge WHY we are still in excessive deadlock on the issue?\n \n Democrats TRY to make some headways with the ONLY tool at their disposal.

   "[QUOTE]\nStopping you right there to point out once again, I NEVER MENTIONED EVANGELICALS.\n So stop making blatantly inaccurate claims.\n\n \n I know you didn't you should have. You took my post, brought it here, and then went on about stuff that's evangelical, which has nothing to do with me. I don't see how you don't see that. Look at your 1st post which started this thread.\n \n \n \n\n I specified that I was talking about CONSERVATIVES.\n What is there about that that makes you think I am talking about you?\n Are you \"plural\"?\n Do YOU define the \"conservative\" stance?\n \n There is no right-minded analysis which can take what I said about the CONSERVATIVE stance and pretend that I had to have been talking about you, unless one assumes you ARE THE \"conservative stance\".\n And considering you profess libertarian, it makes it even more bizarre that you pretend to interpret things in such a way...\n\n \n \n Why then, did you use my post, with my name on it, and then try to say you weren't talking about me? \n \n \n\n 1) You never specified \"fiscal conservatism\".\n 2) I am talking about the GENERAL CONSERVATIVE stance.\n \n 3) It is incredibly dishonest of you to proclaim that I am talking about YOUR position, and at the same try to refine what the \"conservative stance\" is and is not.\n You can't have it both ways.\n When you tell me that something is NOT \"conservative\", you have obviously just acknowledged I was talking about something OTHER THAN \"your position\".\n \n At this stage, I don't know if you're just playing a bad troll game, or if you're just not capable of reading.\n\n \n You act as if I started this thread, using your name on your partial posts to misrepresent your positions. How can you accuse me of doing what you are obviously are doing, since you started the thread, with my post. How is it that I set out to misrepresent you? I didn't even know about this thread until I stumbled upon it when I already had like 15 posts. \n \n \n \n You don't have a fricken' clue what a \"true scotsman\" fallacy is, do you.\n I have EXPLICITLY acknowledged that OTHER types of conservatives exist.\n YOU are the one trying to proclaim that my demonstration of some people's positions is NOT \"conservative\".\n \n If you can't comprehend how that means I am NOT committing a \"true scotsman fallacy\", and you are, then you really have no clue what you are talking about.\n \n Anyone can call themselves anything they want. I didn't say that conservatives don't do the anti-gay and other stuff. I acknowledged that they do. And posited that it is mainly the fundi Evangelical wing, who I've said try to hijack the party and end up doing more damage than good. I would disagree with you that they make up the majority of the party. \n \n \n \nI challenge you to show me any definition of \"liberal\", from a credible, non-partisan dictionary, that includes what you describe.\n\n \n Liberal, in unpolitical terminology means 'a lot' or 'plenty' as in, I put a liberal amount of dressing on my salad. So in political terms someone who is liberal, in terms of govt. means they believe in 'a lot of govt.' Christ, that's just common sense.\n \n \nAs much as you don't want to admit it, evangelical christians make up a MAJOR portion of \"conservatives\".\n For you to try to delineate \"conservative\" from evangelicals WHO ARE A PART OF conservatism is ridiculously dishonest.\n\n \n I disagree. I don't even believe that the 'family values' crowd would agree with the evangelicals about a lot of their hate speech against gays and whatnot. I consider myself a family values voter. Maybe not a 'traditional' family values because I don't care if its a gay family or not. I just think the family structure is the optimum (on a large scale) domestic arrangement. The largest % of people in the Pub party or who consider themselves conservative aren't the ones marching in front of clinics or protesting gay adoptions or whatever else the smaller, but loud group of over the top fundamentalists. I've said before and I'll say again, I think the Pub party should toss the extremists out. They do more harm than good.\n \n \n \nActually, when you tried to proclaim an issue as \"not conservative\", that is precisely what you did.\n \n \n \n This is mindless.\n I can examine statistics on \"evangelicals\" and \"religious\" make-up of conservatives.\n I can SHOW YOU the Republican party platform which includes a variety of these \"moral\" issues.\n \n Can you show me ANY significant \"communism\" in the Democrat party?\n \n You might as well try to give me an analogy of vampiric Democrats to an analysis of \n \n \n \n Once again, refuting nothing that I said.\n I never claimed that SOME (don't try \"the rest of us\" garbage) do not oppose sodomy.\n The point is that there is a LARGE PERCENTAGE of \"conservatives\" who DO favor sodomy laws.\n Just take \"Sally Kerns\" who professes she has broad support for her prejudice which backs an ideal that *gays are worse than terrorists*.\n \n There are frequently anti-gay discrimination measures in the accepted Republican party platform.\n That's a fact.\n Just because you don't agree that is \"conservative\" doesn't mean anything because it's still there!\n\n \n Do you think Sally Kerns represents the average conservative?

I did state there were some, on both sides, that didn't want to go to Iraq. And anyway, what do we do now?\n That's the question.\n \n \n \nIt's amusing how you try to accuse me of PRECISELY what you just did there.\n The \"evangelical platform\" is typically NOT in the minority.\n Anti-gay attempts ORIGINATE with the Republican party.\n \n Riddle me this.\n If the Democrats don't support anti-gay discrimination, and the Republicans ALSO supposedly don't support it, then WHY do we still have it?\n\n \n As I said, I think it causes more harm to the party than the evangelicals' votes are worth.\n \n \nStrawman argument.

If he sold you a lemon but didn't know its a lemon, why are you so angry? If everyone bought a lemon but the guy who 'sold' it didn't know, isn't he just a businessman? So why the vitriol?\n \n \nShow me WHERE in my analogy I said that Bush KNEW it was a lemon, pre-purchase.\n You keep trying to dishonestly claim I said things I did not.\n\n \n Again, then why the anger? If someone sold you a car and everyone thought it worked, why so mad?\n \n \nLike I said, you need to PROVE your lie that Iran is my \"buddy\", or acknowledge it was a lie, before I will go further on that subject.\n \n In your case, it's just easy to lie...\n\n \n I never said you said it. I can only infer. By your constant support of the regime and you anti-Israel comments. You said you weren't anti-Semitic so I inferred that you must be extremely pro Iran.\n \n \n \n \nI have already talked about this, but STILL you refuse to address what I am actually saying.\n The answer to \"what now\" is significantly different inbetween people who RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM and those that THINK IT'S STILL A GOOD THING.\n Can you wrap your head around that?\n \n For the \"lemon\" analogy, one group wants to get rid of the car, while the other insists on driving it everywhere like it's a show-case.\n We obviously can't agree on what to do with what we have if one side is insisting \"it's a good thing\" and the other thinks \"it's pure garbage\".\n Can you acknowledge that?\n Or should I just expect you to ignore that point again?\n\n \n I'm not asking you what you'd do relative to Bush or anyone else. Only what you'd do if it were up to you. Is that clear enough? Foundit66 is in complete control, what would you do, say tomorrow, if you could do anything, viz. the US-Iraq situation?\n \n \n \n\n Are you for real?\n Can you LOOK at what's happening on Capital Hill?\n Can you acknowledge WHY we are still in excessive deadlock on the issue?\n \n Democrats TRY to make some headways with the ONLY tool at their disposal. Funding.\n Yet they lack the cajones and/or voting power to pull it off and effect change.\n That is why we are NOT getting any \"solutions\" discussed. BECAUSE the republicans keep blocking the issue.\n\n \n The Dems in the house could, at anytime, cut off the funding. However, they don't. Why? Is it because they too know that we need to finish the job in Iraq.\n \n \nAt this point, you're just making stupid lies.\n QUOTE ME.\n \n Here's what you said, quoted exactly: \"The insurgency is mainly foreign terrorists trained and supplied by Iran (your buddy).\"\n You said precisely what you claimed you did not.\n \n Again, QUOTE ME in what you claim I said that leads you to ANY inkling of the direction you claim.\n \n No. You can't.\n You're backing up one lie with more lies.\n QUOTE ME.\n\n \n Yes, that's what I said. Do you dispute that Iran is helping the insurgents, or that Iran's your buddy? As I said before, I only can infer that you are pro-Iran. If not, not. I can only form impressions from what I read on here...\n \n \n\n And yet, Petraes EXPLICITLY states something definitively different from your claim...Iraqi leaders have failed to take advantage of a reduction in violence to make adequate progress toward resolving their political differences, Gen.

The Iraqi govt. needs to do a lot of things, but that doesn't mean great progress isn't being made in Iraq. Why is there 'a lack of violence'? Because the US policy is working, in conjunction with the people of Iraq not putting up with the BS any longer.\n \n \n \nI think we would both agree that blindly pulling out all soldiers would be a mistake.\n But the Democrats attempt to bring Republicans to the table has failed.

Quit LYING already.\n 2) No. You're not getting it.\n Either cause you don't want to, or you are incapable.\n One bad used car salesman does not mean ALL used car salesman are bad.\n\n \n So using a used car salesman and describing a lemon car as the product you were sold has no negative connotations?\n \n \n \nSo you admit you lied about my opinion.\n And to try to justify you LYING about what I supposedly said about Obama's position, you give this feeble subsequent misrepresentation that \"like it was done just to #### you off\".\n I will again refute your false claim.\n \n It was NOT done just to #### me off.\n But the actions of our politicians in office DO #### me off.\n Our country's leaders should give us HONEST and REALISTIC answers regarding how much it will cost, how long it will take, etc, etc...\n Heck, if you look at Cheney's statements on the LAST Iraq war, you begin to realize exactly how much they \"stretched\" the truth, and how much they should have KNOWN they were \"stretching\" the truth...\n\n \n How could we know how long or how much when we didn't expect the Insurgency? You agreed that Bush didn't know the intelligence was 'wrong'. I didn't say you claimed Obama had a certain position. I simply said that both Dem candidates know we can't just leave Iraq. How is that claiming you said something?",

You took my post, brought it here, and then went on about stuff that's evangelical, which has nothing to do with me.\n\n Once again, we were talking about the CONSERVATIVE stance, and whether you like it or not it includes stuff you want to label as \"evangelical\".\n But labelling it as \"evangelical\" does not deny the fact that it is ALSO CONSERVATIVE.\n \n \n \nWhy then, did you use my post, with my name on it, and then try to say you weren't talking about me?\n\n I was replying to you, while we were talking about CONSERVATIVES.\n If we go on the \"gay\" threads, does that mean if we talk about gays that means I am calling you gay? emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n \nYou don't have a fricken' clue what a \"true scotsman\" fallacy is, do you.\n I have EXPLICITLY acknowledged that OTHER types of conservatives exist.\n YOU are the one trying to proclaim that my demonstration of some people's positions is NOT \"conservative\".\n\n \nAnyone can call themselves anything they want. I didn't say that conservatives don't do the anti-gay and other stuff. I acknowledged that they do. And posited that it is mainly the fundi Evangelical wing, who I've said try to hijack the party and end up doing more damage than good. I would disagree with you that they make up the majority of the party.\n\n Whether you like it or not, they HAVE MADE IT a part of the \"conservative\" platform.\n A fact you cannot dispute is that they HAVE INSERTED EXPLICITLY anti-gay platforms into the Republican party platform.\n \n Whether you want to admit it or not, they HAVE MADE it part of the conservative stance.\n \n \n \nLiberal, in unpolitical terminology means 'a lot' or 'plenty' as in, I put a liberal amount of dressing on my salad. So in political terms someone who is liberal, in terms of govt. means they believe in 'a lot of govt.' Christ, that's just common sense.\n\n No. It's an absence of common sense.\n It's like proclaiming the verb \"paddle\" must mean that you grow paddles on your hands and legs.\n \n You are attempting to use an adjective definition, for the NOUN usage.\n www.m-w.com\n LIBERAL: : a person who is liberal: as a: one who is open-minded or not strict in the observance of orthodox, traditional, or established forms or ways bcapitalized : a member or supporter of a liberal political party c: an advocate or adherent of liberalism especially in individual rights \n \n \n \nI disagree. I don't even believe that the 'family values' crowd would agree with the evangelicals about a lot of their hate speech against gays and whatnot.\n\n Then you would believe falsely.\n The \"family values\" crowd are typically extensions of the evangelical crowd.\n Focus on the Family (FOTF, or FotF) is an American evangelical group.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_on_the_Family\n The Family Research Council (FRC) is a Christian right non-profit think tank and lobbying organization.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council\n \n I would challenge you to name me ANY \"family values\" group which doesn't have direct ties to christianity.\n You can't do it.\n \n \n \nDo you think Sally Kerns represents the average conservative? She represents the typical Conservative as much as Chairman Mao repressents the average liberal.\n\n No. Not the \"average\" conservative.\n But riddle me this. Will the conservatives vote her out????\n \n Of course not. There are too many that are comfortable with her rhetoric (and too many others that accept it as true), even if they don't repeat it as rabidly as she does.\n \n \n \nI don't remember many people saying nay.\n\n That's part of my point.\n The \"YEAH! THERE ARE WMDs THERE\" was proclaimed loudly.\n The U.N. investigation? Ignored.\n Valerie Plame and that whole issue? Scandalized to obscurity.\n \n And what came out AFTERWARDS?\n We could start a whole new thread on the drum-beating that pushed that \"WMD\" party-line to the surface, while minimizing the \"there's no real evidence\" crowd.\n \n \n \nAnd anyway, what do we do now?\n That's the question.\n\n Show me where I said anything about Iran or tel aviv ...\n Then we can talk.\n \n \n \nAs I said, I think it causes more harm to the party than the evangelicals' votes are worth.\n\n Today? Yes.\n Yesterday? Bush catered to them, and they proclaimed THEY were the power that got him into office.\n He even supposedly \"promised\" them three SCOTUS judges to boot!\n \n If you have a cancerous cell in your body, does that suddenly mean it's not really a part of your body?\n While the evangelicals are doing damage, that doesn't mean they aren't conservative. It doesn't mean they haven't established their views as \"conservative\" values.\n \n \n \nWhat is the whole used car analogy then? If he sold you a lemon but didn't know its a lemon, why are you so angry? If everyone bought a lemon but the guy who 'sold' it didn't know, isn't he just a businessman? So why the vitriol?\n\n 1) You should stop trying to focus on my emotion.\n My emotion, whether your description is accurate or not, is NOT the point here.\n 2) I am a firm believer that people can make mistakes.\n But when they insist nothing is wrong in the face of proof to the contrary, THAT is a problem.\n It demonstrates an incapability to objectively evaluate things. It demonstrates a willingness to put the ego of the party above the good of the country.\n \n \n \nAgain, then why the anger? If someone sold you a car and everyone thought it worked, why so mad?\n\n Why the diversion?\n I pointed out that you were being dishonest, and you accuse me of \"anger\"?\n Pure obfuscation.\n \n And no. \"everyone\" did NOT think it works.\n I don't know how the heck you come to that conclusion, when MOST are saying that the war in Iraq is a bad thing.\n \n \n \nI never said you said it. I can only infer. By your constant support of the regime and you anti-Israel comments.\n\n Again, you lie.\n And it's getting boring and dumb.\n QUOTE ME.\n \n You keep trying to excuse one lie with another.\n QUOTE ME in where I showed \"support for the regime and you anti-Israel comments\".\n \n \n \nYou said you weren't anti-Semitic so I inferred that you must be extremely pro Iran.\n\n Again, QUOTE ME.\n \n \n \nI'm not asking you what you'd do relative to Bush or anyone else. Only what you'd do if it were up to you. Is that clear enough?\n\n And as I said earlier, I am not going to pretend to have an intellectual conversation with somebody so blatantly dishonest.\n You keep making claims about me and \"Iran\" and/or \"Israel\" and/or \"Tel Aviv\".\n QUOTE ME in what I said that justifies ANY of your claims regarding my position on those issues.\n \n \n \nThe Dems in the house could, at anytime, cut off the funding. However, they don't. Why? Is it because they too know that we need to finish the job in Iraq.\n\n No.\n Are you really this thick?\n Do you not see ALL of the implications of what would happen if they DID \"cut off the funding\"?\n \n Riddle me this.\n Does cutting off the funding mean Bush HAS TO bring them home?\n Or could he pull a Bush, and still keep them there.\n Ignore how stupid such a move would be, and tell me if he could STILL ORDER them to stay there.\n \n \n \nYes, that's what I said. Do you dispute that Iran is helping the insurgents, or that Iran's your buddy?\n\n This isn't about \"disputing\".\n This is about you QUOTING ME on your claims about what I said.\n \n But for the record, just cause I know you can't cope with it, I will refute your claim that Iran is my buddy.\n Can you prove my refutation wrong?\n Of course you can't.\n Nor do you have the honesty to address that fact.\n \n \n \nHow is a failure on part of the Iraqi Leadership anything to do with the Iraqi people rising up against the insurgents? The Iraqi govt. needs to do a lot of things, but that doesn't mean great progress isn't being made in Iraq. Why is there 'a lack of violence'? Because the US policy is working, in conjunction with the people of Iraq not putting up with the BS any longer.\n\n I am amazed and amused at how you claim THE OPPOSITE of what Patraeus explicitly said.\n Iraq IS NOT putting forth any adequate effort.\n \n \n \nSo using a used car salesman and describing a lemon car as the product you were sold has no negative connotations?\n\n You jump from one hyperbole to the next.\n I never said it had no negative connotations.\n But calling Bush a liar is NOT one of the negative connotations.\n \n \n \nHow could we know how long or how much when we didn't expect the Insurgency?\n\n Why the heck could people NOT see an \"insurgency\"?\n We wipe out the government.\n Did we think everybody would just say \"Oh. I guess we'll just have an election, even though we've never done that before, and all agree without any violence to follow a democratic standard\"\n \n EVEN CHENEY's previous Iraq war statements demonstrates HE understood there would be significant repercussions AFTER a governmental overthrow.\n \n \n \nYou agreed that Bush didn't know the intelligence was 'wrong'.\n\n On \"WMDs\"? No.\n On other issues? He's either a XXXXX or a liar to make the claims that were made.\n \n \n \nI didn't say you claimed Obama had a certain position.\n\n You lie so easily it's amazing!\n I repeat a quote of you: \"Obama said he'll cut troop levels, but he's not going to 'get out' as you claim.\"\n You explicitly said that I claimed Obama had a specific position.\n NOW you claim you didn't say what you EXPLICITLY did say.\n \n Are you mental?",

Generic conservative position, as substantiated by Republican party platform mandate.\n \n QUIT claiming that I am attributing things to you when I am NOT.\n \n \n \nI'm not trying to separate anything about conservatives and etc. in the general public, just in what WE were talking about and how you were using MY post with my name on it, that's all.\n\n Actually, when you insist that things are not the \"conservative\" view because they can be classified as an \"evangelical\" view, that is PRECISELY what you are doing.\n They are BOTH the \"evangelical\" and \"conservative\" view.\n \n \n \nAnd again, I think you are overestimating the fundi proportions in the Pub party (but that still doesn't affect what we've been talking about).\n\n Again, I take my points from not only the VERY ACTIONS of the Republican party members, but the Republican party PLATFORM as well.\n Due to \"fundi\" influence, and it doesn't matter what \"proportion\", these things ARE making it into the Republican / conservative approach. The ACTUAL ACTIONS.\n \n It doesn't matter if I \"estimate\" or not.\n This IS what the Republican / Conservative party IS DOING.",

   "Look, I don't have time to get into this again right now. But I was simply trying to explain to you where I was coming from (on the other thread we weren't talking about social values at all we were talking about Bush's spending). We weren't talking about gays or abortion or evangelicals or any of that. We were talking about how I disagreed with what the Pubs and Bush had done in the last few years concerning spending. That's what was up setting. I don't know if there is a link there now or not, but I certainly never saw one then which is obvious from the fact that I didn't even post my first comment on this thread until 15 or 16 others had already been here.",
