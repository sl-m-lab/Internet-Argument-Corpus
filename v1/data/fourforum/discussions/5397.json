The schools could organize field trips to visit the prisons and study the lifestyle. This would likely keep a lot of kids out of prison.",

   "Why not instead intern youth on a 6-hourly daily basis in a place that resembles a prison - barbed wire fencing, sniffer dogs, metal detectors, a regimented timetable, drugdealers, stabbings, drab environments, announcements over PA systems, poor quality food dispensed onto trays, eaten on metal benches, public servants ordering them around, telling them how to think and behave, a rudimentary barter economy.\n \n I think, if you took students to tour a prison, they would find it very similar to the environment they experience on a daily basis. Sure, they might be \"scared\" because the bullies are a little meaner, but only in the same way primary school students are \"scared\" of secondary school - once they are old enough they'll be ready to take that step.",

That was so long ago interior decoration wasn't high on the requirement list, starch for calories was the food criterion and visual occupation such as TV to reduce guard requirements was still way in the future. I immediately knew the wrong side of the bars wasn't some place I ever wanted to be located.\n \n Contemporary kids are exposed to so much TV violence from the formative years on that I don't think a modern jail or prison would have much shock or deterrent value. Little rooms painted in the latest psychobabble colors, people glued to watching TV and some screaming would probably make many of them feel right at home. They might even run into daddy. \n \n Our social ills are far too advanced and widespread for deterrents to have any effect on many kids choosing between crime and becoming contributing members of society. The best job going for a high school grad without the desire to continue education is now the military, where an automatic weapon and the chance to be killed in our humanitarian spread of democracy are a good probability.
