Merely what happened to life after life started. Abiogenesis is the theory of life from non-life. Personally, most of the arguments in that field aren't very convincing. \n \n \nHere it goes, as God decided to make the Earth he kept creating various living creatures, improving each new model until he culminated in man with intelligence.\n\n \n Improving in what aspect? I've thought about this issue before though, and assuming that God exists outside of time, it already knows what will occur, therefore it already knows prior to creating the universe that life will arise as it has via evolution.

That is a belief based on no evidence whatsoever because that is the way you want things to be. In the past, your argument was used to explain many things for which mankind lacked understanding. Turns out that the shape of the earth, orbits of the planets, origin of diseases and many more have been found to make perfect sense without any god. You theory is known as the \"god of the gaps\" belief.\n \nI'm not sure about any of the theories but I guess you can say that the origin of life theory I believe is \"evolution.\"\nThat's interesting since, as has already been pointed out, the theory of evolution does not consider the origin of life. It doesn't matter to evolutionary theory how life came about, whether by magic from nothing by some invisible being, or by natural means. Evolutionary theory is a body of knowledge that explains how life has changed through time.\n \nHere it goes, as God decided to make the Earth he kept creating various living creatures, improving each new model until he culminated in man with intelligence.\nI see. The your god is an imperfect god that learns from experience and makes decisions based on that learning. Your god needed many attempts to reach the culmination of creation. By the way, how do you know that god isn't still creating other forms of life? Why do you believe that imperfect mankind is the culmination. Maybe your god is just pausing while trying to figure out improvements.\n \nI think it is what the Bible says happened, not that the Bible is some sort of compilation of \"folktales\" meant to convey messages.\nNope. That's not what the Bible says happened. That is just your imagination and wild interpretation of what you would like the Bible to say. Much of the Bible is exactly folk tales and moral lessons. Some is history (which may not be very accurate).\n \nThe stories,I believe, are mostly fact and they are meant to convey a message based on facts, and not myth.\nThen you don't believe in Genesis, Jonah, or Job, since they are clearly folk tales meant to convey lessons. They are not mostly fact since one must suspend a belief in reality in order to believe them. By the way, the fact that Genesis is mythological is made clear by the two different versions of creation and at least two different versions (mixed together) of the flood of Noah (consider whether he took two of each \"kind\" or 7 of \"clean kinds\". This is even harder to understand since the concept of clean/unclean didn\\'t exist until the time of the wandering of the Hebrews in the desert.

   "\n \n I believe that Genesis is fact, but that some of the wording in it may mean to God something different than what they mean to us. I'm not sure if God actually made us in 6 days, as in 6 Earth days, it might have been 600 billion years, each \"day\" being 60 billion years (I don't think that's true, just saying it's remotely possible). I also understand that God might have created in a manner such as evolution, with him designing the nest little critter to come about.\n \n \n\n \n Which version of the creation story is a fact?\n Genesis chapter 1 or genesis chapter 2\n There are 2 creation myths",
