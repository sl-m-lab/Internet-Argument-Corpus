   "I thought i'd make a little list of what I regard as problematic portions of the NT for our fundamentalist posters. This should not be regarded as exhaustive, and i'll add more later.\n \n The Year of Jesus' Birth\n \n The Problem: According to Matthew, Jesus was born during the days of who he calls \"Herod the king\" (2.1). On the basis of 2.22, this Herod can be none other than Herod the Great, whose death is surely placed in 4 BCE. Since Matthew's Herod allows the death of children two years old and younger (2.16), we can suppose that the Evangelist placed Jesus' birth about 6 BCE. \n \n According to Luke, Jesus is born during the census of Quirinius (2.1-7) which occured in the year 6 CE (Josephus A.J. 18.1.1), a full decade later.\n \n This presents a huge problem for those who would like to harmonize the two infancy narratives. One would have to suppose two equally improbable things; first, that Quirinius served as governor of Syria twice, once after Herod's death and once before, and second, that the Romans had taken a census of Judaea during Herod's reign. As to the first:\n \n -Because Syria was a proconsular senatorial province, Quirinius could only have served as govenor after he had first served as consul in Rome. On the basis of a very secure consular chronology attested in a multitude of sources, we know that Quirinius served as consul in 12 BCE. Therefore, 12 BCE serves as the terminus a quo for any potential first governorship, the earliest possible date.\n \n -As above, we know that Herod died in 4 BCE. This is our terminus ad quem, the latest possible date.\n \n -On the basis of A.J. 17.5.2; 9.3; 10.1; 10.9, etc., we know that P. Quinctilius Varus, consul in 13 BCE, served as governor of Syria from 6 BCE to sometime after Herod's death. He immediately followed C. Sentius Saturninus, who served from 9 BCE to 6 (e.g. A.J. 16.9.1). Saturninus immediately followed M. Titus, who we know was governor in 10 BCE (e.g. 16.8.6). Although nothing definitive is known about when Titus began to serve, it is probable that he had been in place since 13 BCE, when Augustus' close friend and counsellor Marcus Agrippa returned to Rome after a decade of control over the Roman east.\n \n -Given the absense of definitive evidence for the reign of Titus, it might be supposed that Quirinius served a first governorship at some point between 12 BCE and 10 BCE. But this is simply gratuitious. Despite several sources detailing Quirinius' accomplishments, none makes reference to two governorships of a single consular province, a feat otherwise unattested in the entire history of Rome. In addition, this would also require that Jesus have been considerably older upon his death than is typically understood, running up against statements like Luke 3.23, which suggest he was about 30.\n \n As to the second:\n \n -Like the idea of two governorships of Syria, the notion that the Romans would have conducted a census of Judaea before it was made a province -- that is, the census of Herod's client kingdom -- is entirely unattested in the history of Rome, and for good reason. A census was used to assess persons and property for the purposes of taxation, an entirely unnecessary endeavor where client kings collected and paid their own tribute.\n \n In sum, the plain reading of Matt and Luke is that each placed the birth of Jesus in different years. Any attempt to harmonize the two accounts runs afoul of serious historical problems and ends up as nothing more than pointless, ad hoc speculation.\n \n Mark 7.6b-7\n \n The Problem: In Mark 7.6b-7, Jesus responds to the Pharisee's question about eating with unwashed hands by appeal to Isa 29.13. What is interesting for our purposes is the form the quotation takes; like the LXX (Greek) but unlike the MT (Hebrew), the introductory \"this people honors me...\" is not syntaxically dependent on verse 14. For the Marcan Jesus, in other words, v. 13 can stand by itself, something that isn't possible with the Hebrew's \"because this people honors me...\". 7.7b, essential to the point of \"god's commandments vs. Pharisaic tradition\" being made, is even more clearly dependent on the LXX. Here the Marcan Jesus chastizes his opponents for \"teaching [as divine] teachings the commandments of men,\" a startling departure from the Hebrew which instead denounces cultic liturgy (\"their fear of me\") observed mechnically (\"a commandment of men learned.\"\n \n Because the point of the citation is critically dependent on its Greek, but not Hebrew, form, it's difficult to imagine Jesus ever uttering these words. Aramaic was the ordinary, everyday language of Palestinian Jews, and even if we grant that Jesus might have picked up a few Greek words here and there, it strains credulity to imagine him being so well versed that he could cite Jewish scriptures from memory (to other Palestian Jews, no less!).\n \n On the other hand, it makes perfect sense as a creation of the early, Greek-speaking and LXX-using church.\n \n Mark 1.2-3\n \n The Problem: In his introduction, Mark introduces a citation with \"just as has been written in Isaiah the prophet\" (1.2). What follows, however, is a conflation of LXX Exod 23.20 (\"look, I am sending my messenger before your face\"), Mal 3.1 (\"who will prepare your way\") and Isa 40.3 (\"a voice crying out in the desert, prepare the way of the lord, make his paths straight\"). The problematic nature of the citation is evidenced by several textual witnesses (A W f13 m vgms syh Irlat) who replaced Mark's offending \"Isaiah the prophet\" with \"the prophets.\"\n \n That Mark, working from either memory or a so-called testimonium (a collection of similar-themed OT texts grouped together and applied to Jesus), would make this sort of error is understandable. But an error it is.",

   "Matt 23.35\n \n The Problem: At 23.35 the Matthean Jesus issues a woe to the Pharisees, saying that on them will \"come all the righteous blood being poured out on the land, from the blood of Abel the righteous to Zechariah son of Barachiah, who you murdered between the Sanctuary and the alter.\" Now who is this Zechariah son of Barachiah? The most obvious answer would be the minor prophet Zechariah, who is introduced in Zech 1.1 with the same name. But such an indentification would not be possible; not only is there no word of Zechariah's martyrdom, but (as first observed by Jerome) in his day the Temple still lay in ruins.\n \n The obvious solution is to look to Zechariah son of Jehoiada, the priest in 1 Chron 24.20-22 who is killed in the Temple after having called the people to repentance. Not only does his death match Jesus' description, but it offers some nice parallelism:\n \n -Ancient Jewish scriptural canons commonly began with Genesis and ended with Chronicles. This would make Abel the first murder and Zechariah the last.\n \n -Like Abel's blood cry (Gen 4.10), Zechariah calls out for vengeance. This is a nice fit for Matt 23 as a whole.\n \n So how does Zechariah son of Jehoiada become Zechariah son of Barachiah? There was considerable confusion of various Zechariah's in Jewish literature; the Zechariah of Isa 8 is taken to be the Zechariah of Zech 1.1 in b. Mak. 24b and most importantly, the targum on Lam 2.20 takes the Zechariah of 1 Chron 20 to be the Zechariah of Zech 1.1.\n \n It is, therefore, an understandable error, being \"in the air\" at the time. But as with Mark 1, it is still an error.",

But as with Mark 1, it is still an error.\n\n \n I think you've overreacted claiming that's an error. There's more to it than you laid out.\n \n Apologetics Press: Alleged Discrepancies \n \n Zechariah Who? \n by Eric Lyons, M.Min.\n \n The name Zechariah appears dozens of times in the Bible. There is Zechariah the minor prophet, Zechariah the son of Jehoiada, who was stoned to death at the command of King Joash (2 Chronicles 24:20), Zechariah the father of John the Baptizer, as well as some 25 others mentioned by that name in Scripture. Among Bible critics, one particular Zechariah stands out more than all others-the Zechariah recorded in Matthew 23:35, whom Jesus mentioned in His condemnation of the hypocritical Pharisees. Allegedly, Jesus (or Matthew) erred in referring to the Jews murdering \"Zechariah, the son of Berechiah...between the temple and the altar\" (emp. added). Skeptic Dennis McKinsey says this Zechariah \"is actually the son of Jehoiada as is shown by 2 Chron. 24:20.... The name Barachias or Barachiah is not in the Old Testament\" (2000, p. 30).\n \n Indeed, 2 Chronicles 24:20 does mention \"Zechariah the son of Jehoiada\" who was stoned \"in the court of the house of the Lord\" (24:21). But was Jesus referring to this particular Zechariah when He rebuked the hard-hearted Pharisees? It is possible that He was, and there still be no contradiction. In ancient times, people frequently had more than one name. Moses' father-in-law was known both as Reuel and Jethro (Exodus 2:18; 3:1). Gideon acquired the name Jerubbaal after destroying an altar of Baal (Judges 6:32; 7:1; 8:29,35). In 2 Kings 15, King Jotham's father is called both Azariah (vs. 7) and Uzziah (vs. 32). The names are different, but they refer to the same person (cf. 2 Chronicles 26:1-23; Isaiah 1:1). The apostle Peter is sometimes called Peter, Simon, Simon Peter, and Cephas (Matthew 14:28; 16:16; 17:25; John 1:42; 1 Corinthians 1:12).\n \n People have worn multiple names for centuries. In modern times, most people could think of several individuals who are called by various names. Although most of the time my oldest son answers to his middle name, \"Bo,\" sometimes we call him by his first name, \"Elijah.\" At other times, we may summon him by his full name \"Elijah Bo Lyons.\" Is it not possible that Jehoiada also was known as Berechiah? Certainly! One wonders why Bible critics are so certain that Jesus made a mistake when even they themselves are accustomed to calling others by a variety of names.\n \n It may also be that Jehoiada was Zechariah's grandfather and Berechiah was his father. The term \"son\" is used in several senses in Scripture. Aside from using it to signify a son by actual birth, Bible writers used it to mean (1) son-in-law (1 Samuel 24:16; cf. 18:27), (2) grandson (Genesis 29:5), (3) descendant (Matthew 1:1), (4) son by creation, as in the case of Adam (Luke 3:38), (5) son by education (i.e., disciple-1 Samuel 3:6), etc. After reading Genesis 29:5, one might think that Laban was the son of Nahor, but Genesis 24 explains that he actually was Nahor's grandson (24:24,29; cf. 22:20-24). Mephibosheth is called the \"son of Saul\" in 2 Samuel 19:24, when actually he was \"the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul\" (2 Samuel 9:6; 4:4). He literally was Saul's grandson, though Scripture refers to him once simply as the \"son of Saul.\" These are only two examples where the Bible conveys to the reader that the term \"son\" was used to mean grandson. One can only wonder how many times the terms \"son\" or \"daughter\" are used this way throughout Scripture, and yet unlike the two aforementioned examples, were not explained as such. Indeed, Zechariah, son of Jehoiada, may be just one such example. Concerning this possibility, commentator R.C.H. Lenski noted:\n \n This is possible when we remember the great age of Jehoiada, 130 years, and when we recall his great deeds, making it highly creditable to be called his son. So in Chronicles Zachariah would be named after his illustrious grandfather but in Matthew after his father, the name of the father having been preserved by Jewish tradition or in genealogical records. The Jews also frequently called a man a son of a mighty grandsire, especially while the latter was still living (1961, p. 920).\n \n Although it is possible that Zechariah was the son of Berechiah and the grandson of Jehoiada, and though it may also be that Berechiah and Jehoiada were the same person, the fact is, Jesus may not even have been referring to \"Zechariah the son of Jehoiada\" (2 Chronicles 24:20) in Matthew 23:35. Truly, no one can prove that \"Zechariah the son of Jehoiada\" was the same Zechariah that Jesus mentioned in his reprimand of the Pharisees. A reasonable case can be made that the prophet to whom Jesus referred was actually Zechariah the minor prophet, who preached during the days of Ezra (Ezra 5:1), some 400 years after Zechariah, son of Jehoiada. In fact, contrary to McKinsey's comment that \"the name Barachias or Barachiah is not in the Old Testament\" (2000, p. 30), Zechariah, the minor prophet, actually is called \"the son of Berechiah (spelled Barachias in the Septuagint-EL), the son of Iddo\" (Zechariah 1:1; cf. Ezra 5:1; 6:14). Although the Old Testament writers did not record his death, Jesus would have known how he died, and it also could have been known by Jewish tradition.\n \n One must keep in mind that the Old Testament is not the only source for New Testament data concerning what took place from Creation until the coming of Christ. The New Testament writers were inspired by God (cf. 2 Peter 3:16; 1 Corinthians 14:37; John 16:13). How did Paul know that \"Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses\" (2 Timothy 3:8, emp. added) when the names of Pharaoh's magicians are not given in the Old Testament? How did Jude know that Michael the archangel and the devil \"disputed about the body of Moses\" (Jude 9) when no Old Testament writer mentioned such an event? Paul and Jude either knew of these facts from tradition and recorded them by inspiration, or God miraculously revealed this information to them. Similarly, in Matthew 23:35 Jesus could have simply been referring to the death of one of the last Old Testament prophets, which was not recorded in the Old Testament, but known both by God and Jewish tradition.\n \n At the risk of belaboring the point that several reasonable explanations exist for Jesus' statement recorded in Matthew 23:35 (and that skeptics are being intellectually dishonest when they assert that this passage is errant), two more logically possible explanations need to be noted. First, many assume that Jesus was referring to a martyr named Zechariah from Old Testament times. However, a closer look at Jesus' comments may reveal otherwise. He rebuked the Pharisees, saying:\n \n Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say, \"If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.\" Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers' guilt. Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell? Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation (Matthew 23:29-36, emp. added).\n \n Notice that Jesus spoke to His first century enemies, saying, \"you murdered\" Zechariah, son of Berechiah (Matthew 23:35, emp. added). A straightforward reading of this passage, without assuming that Zechariah was one of the more than two dozen Zechariahs of the Old Testament, leads one to the conclusion that the Pharisees themselves had murdered a righteous man named Zechariah. It may be, as Burton Coffman concluded,\n \n ...that Christ here referred to some secret murder perpetrated, not by the ancestors of those men, but by them.... Christ tried with that one last lightning stroke of truth to get through to them, but even that failed. That no such murder was recorded in either the Old Testament or the New Testament, and that there was no general knowledge of it in the days of Christ, and that no traditions were developed with reference to it-these things present no difficulty at all, but point squarely at the Pharisees and show their effectiveness in covering up their evil deeds and hiding them from popular view.... It is further evidence of their depravity that none of them ever confessed it, even after he who knew their thoughts revealed it publicly! Their guilty secret went to the grave with them, except for this ray of light from the lips of Christ who made it known on the occasion of their being sentenced to hell for their wickedness\" (1974, p. 375, emp. in orig.).\n \n Finally, considering the fact that God's spokesman occasionally spoke of things yet to come as if they had already occurred (commonly known as \"prophetic perfect\"; cf. Isaiah 53; 21:1-10), it may be (however unlikely) that Jesus was speaking about the death of a future Zacharias. According to Josephus, about 35 years following Jesus' death, two zealots slew Zacharias the son of Baruch in the middle of the temple simply for being rich, hating wickedness, and loving liberty (1987, 4:5:4).\n \n Whatever the answer to the question, \"To which Zechariah was Jesus referring?,\" one thing is beyond any doubt: skeptics such as Dennis McKinsey do not have a shred of evidence that Matthew 23:35 is an uninspired, errant passage. Truly, the only proven contradiction regarding this matter lies, not in the Bible, but in McKinsey's own book titled Biblical Errancy. On page 30, he insisted that the Zechariah of Matthew 23:35 \"is actually the son of Jehoiada.\" However, later in the book, he wrote (immediately following a quotation of Matthew 23:35): \"The Zecharias mentioned was killed in Jerusalem in 69 C.E.; so that Matthew makes Jesus refer to an event that occurred forty years after his death. This is the same Zecharias Barouchus who, according to Josephus, was slain in the temple a short time before the destruction of Jerusalem\" (p. 195). What evidence does McKinsey have for this last accusation? None whatsoever. Indeed, McKinsey-not the Bible writers-gives contradictory answers to the same question. Simply because we may not know for certain the identity of the Zechariah Jesus mentioned, does not mean we have the right to label Him and the Bible writers as erroneous.\n \n Apologetics Press - Zechariah Who?",

Do you have an agenda or bias against Christ and / or the New Testament?\n\n \n Of course I have no \"bias against Christ and/or the New Testament.\" Once I finish grad school, its study will be my career (if I can find an institution that'll have me, of course). This thread was made for the purpose of getting you, and some others in this forum, to come to terms with mainstream evidence-based biblical scholarship.\n \n \nLet's be clear on a number of things: Christ was born, obviously - what year is not that important to me or a lot of people.\n\n \n As Jo said, the year of Jesus' birth is important as far as biblical errancy is concerned. Of course it doesn't affect the central tenants of the Christian faith (I would never claim that it did) or much anything else besides. But that wasn't the point.\n \n \nJohn the Baptist was his forerunner.\n\n \n That Jesus was baptized by and associated with John is almost undeniable historically.

That he actually performed miracles, i.e. that his healings and exorcisms were the result of supernatural powers as opposed to something else, is not something one can say historically.\n \n \nHe was crucified,\n\n \n Yes...\n \n \ndied,\n\n \n Yes...\n \n \nand resurrected, according to all four Gospels. Do you deny these basic teachings of the Gospels?\n\n \n I certainly don't believe Jesus rose from the dead, but am perfectly willing to admit that some of Jesus' followers had experiences that they understood as interaction with a risen Jesus and, more tentatively and against a lot of more \"liberal\" scholarship, that his tomb was empty.\n \n \nAlso, before you post your (apparent) \"contradictions\" or errors, most of which have been addressed or answered ad nauseum by various apologetics sites, why not lay out both sides of the arguments?\n\n \n I don't regard unevidenced speculation as \"addressing\" or \"answering\" the points I raised above. As such, there is no other side to \"lay out.\"\n \n In any case, were I list off every logically possible but entirely ad hoc apologetic found on the web, i'd be sitting here all day and night!\n \n Which is a good place to briefly address the \"answers\" to the problems above:\n \n \nSo say you. Here's an interesting article on that that adds to the discussion:\n \n Mark 1:2 and New Testament Textual Criticism\n \n Mark 1:2 and New Testament Textual Criticism | Bible.org\n\n \n This link adds nothing, really. The only \"solution\" was to propose that Isaiah headed the list of prophets, but even the author realizes there is no evidence for this. What is gratuitously asserted can be gratuitously denied.\n \n As for Matt 23...\n \n \nIt is possible that He was, and there still be no contradiction. In ancient times, people frequently had more than one name. [snip]\n\n \n Even ignoring the entirely inappropriate nature of his analogies (e.g. Moses and Reuel and Jethro, where he failed to notice that these names derive from J and E respectively...it's not that he had two names, it's that there are two different sources), this is nothing more than pure ad hoc speculation. That something is possible does not mean it is probable, particularly in light of other hypotheses (like the one I laid out).\n \n And what is gratuitously asserted can be gratuitously denied...\n \n \nIt may also be that Jehoiada was Zechariah's grandfather and Berechiah was his father [snip]\n\n \n This is exactly the same as above. Instead of offering any evidence that this or any other competing hypothesis is actually true, he simply tosses out the possibility. \n \n And what is gratuitously asserted can be gratuitously denied...\n \n \nTruly, no one can prove that \"Zechariah the son of Jehoiada\" was the same Zechariah that Jesus mentioned in his reprimand of the Pharisees.\n\n \n This is silly. Of course his identity cannot be \"proven\" in any absolute sense. Nothing in science can be. But not all explanations are equally plausible in light of the available evidence, and my explanation above fits the data best.\n \n \nIn fact, contrary to McKinsey's comment that \"the name Barachias or Barachiah is not in the Old Testament\" (2000, p. 30), Zechariah, the minor prophet, actually is called \"the son of Berechiah (spelled Barachias in the Septuagint-EL), the son of Iddo\" (Zechariah 1:1; cf. Ezra 5:1; 6:14). Although the Old Testament writers did not record his death, Jesus would have known how he died, and it also could have been known by Jewish tradition.\n\n \n It is not possible that the prophet died in the manner described by Jesus, as I explained before. The Temple had to wait until 515 or 516 BCE to be built and rededicated, some four or five years after the second year of Darius (i.e. 520 BCE).\n \n \nSimilarly, in Matthew 23:35 Jesus could have simply been referring to the death of one of the last Old Testament prophets, which was not recorded in the Old Testament, but known both by God and Jewish tradition.\n\n \n This is more ad hoc speculation. And what is gratuitously asserted can be gratuitously denied...\n \n \nAccording to Josephus, about 35 years following Jesus' death, two zealots slew Zacharias the son of Baruch in the middle of the temple simply for being rich, hating wickedness, and loving liberty (1987, 4:5:4).\n\n \n Finally we come to a alternative that isn't just plucked out of the aether. But is it any more probable? I don't think so. First, Josephus' Zechariah is identified, alternatively in the mss tradition, as &#950;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#957; &#965;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#914;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#962;, &#965;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#914;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#965;, or &#965;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#965;, but never as &#965;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#946;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#953;&#959;&#965; as in Matt and, importantly, the LXX of Zech 1.1. Second, Zechariah son of Baris was not a priest so far as we know, being identified by Josephus as simply a wealthy citizen. That he would end up between the alter and Sanctuary in the Court of the Priests is highly dubious.\n \n So let me briefly recap. The Matthean Jesus' Zechariah son of Barachiah conforms, on several different levels, to the Zechariah son of Jehoiada of 2 Chron 24. The name Zechariah son of Barachiah conforms perfectly to the prophet in Zech 1.1. These are all well established empirical facts. We also know that in some ancient Jewish traditions, the Zechariah of 2 Chron 24 and the Zechariah of Zech 1.1 were conflated. This is also an empirical fact. Taken together, the hypothesis that the Evangelist or his source (Q in this case) had accidently conflated the two Zechariahs very neatly explains the data without recourse to any unsupported speculation.\n \n On the other hand, your link would have us believe that either Zechariah son of Jehoiada's father had several names (which is pure speculation), that Zechariah son of Jehoiada's father or grandfather was named Barachiah (which is pure speculation) or that Jesus was refering to some other, completely unknown Zechariah son of Barachiah (which is pure speculation). It is rather like trebor's ad hoc rationalization of Josephus' A.J. 20.9.1 whereby he would have us suppose, without a shred of evidence, that Jesus son of Damneus was known as Christ, that he had a brother named James and that this James was martyred in the Temple despite the fact that there is considerable evidence of Jesus of Nazareth conforming to all three.\n \n Now I ask you, why are the latter options superior to the former? The simple answer is that they're not, and that the only reason you would think them so is that you're smuggling in an a priori assumption of NT inerrancy and \"interpreting\" the data around that. In other words, your biases are coloring the data.",

Couldn't the Herod in Matthew have been the one that came after Herod the great?\n\n \n As far as Matt's Herod goes, no, it can only be Herod the Great. After his Herod dies (2.19) and the angel comes to Joseph and tells him to return to Israel (v. 20), Joseph realizes that \"Archelaus was king of Judaea in place of his father Herod\" (v. 22). This can only be Archelaus, the son of Herod the Great, who was given Judaea, Samaria and Idumea after his father's death. If Archelaus is the son, then the Herod trying to get Jesus after he was born must be the father.\n \n Luke's Herod, on the other hand, can be read as either Herod the Great or Archelaus. I think here the latter is clearly preferable; to read it as Herod the Great would be to create unnecessary historical problems within Luke itself.\n \n ETA: Also, even if we were to assume Matt's Herod the King was Archelaus, it still really wouldn't solve either problem. Quirinius would still have had to have been govenor of Syria earlier than is supposed and the Romans would still have had to have conducted a census of a client kingdom (Judaea/Samaria/Idumea was converted to a province only after Archelaus was deposed by Augustus).",

   "\n \n Mark 7.6b-7\n \n The Problem: In Mark 7.6b-7, Jesus responds to the Pharisee's question about eating with unwashed hands by appeal to Isa 29.13. What is interesting for our purposes is the form the quotation takes; like the LXX (Greek) but unlike the MT (Hebrew), the introductory \"this people honors me...\" is not syntaxically dependent on verse 14. For the Marcan Jesus, in other words, v. 13 can stand by itself, something that isn't possible with the Hebrew's \"because this people honors me...\". 7.7b, essential to the point of \"god's commandments vs. Pharisaic tradition\" being made, is even more clearly dependent on the LXX. Here the Marcan Jesus chastizes his opponents for \"teaching [as divine] teachings the commandments of men,\" a startling departure from the Hebrew which instead denounces cultic liturgy (\"their fear of me\") observed mechnically (\"a commandment of men learned.\"\n \n Because the point of the citation is critically dependent on its Greek, but not Hebrew, form, it's difficult to imagine Jesus ever uttering these words. Aramaic was the ordinary, everyday language of Palestinian Jews, and even if we grant that Jesus might have picked up a few Greek words here and there, it strains credulity to imagine him being so well versed that he could cite Jewish scriptures from memory (to other Palestian Jews, no less!).\n \n On the other hand, it makes perfect sense as a creation of the early, Greek-speaking and LXX-using church. \n\n \n No need for the early church to create this issue, as the practice of hand washing goes way back in Judaism before Christianity originated.\n \n Hand Washing - General basis in Jewish law\n \n The rabbis of the Talmud derived the requirement of washing the hands as a consequence of the statement in Leviticus 15:11\n \n And whoever he that hath issue (a Zav, ejaculant with an unusual discharge) touches without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.[3] \n and from Psalms 26:6\n \n I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD.[4] \n The Talmud inferred the specific requirements of hand-washing from these passages.\n \n The general Hebrew term for ritual hand washing is netilat yadayim, meaning lifting up of the hands. The term \"the washing of hands\" after evacuation is sometimes referred to as \"to wash asher yatzar\" referring to the bracha (blessing) said which starts with these words.\n \n Halakha (Jewish law) requires that the water used for ritual washing be naturally pure, unused, not contain other substances, and not be discoloured. The water also must be poured from a vessel as a human act, on the basis of references in the Bible to this practice, e.g. Elisha pouring water upon the hands of Elijah. Water should be poured on each hand at least twice. A clean dry substance should be used instead if water is unavailable\n \n How performed\n \n Contemporary practice is to pour water on each hand three times for most purposes using a cup, and alternating the hands between each occurrence; this ritual is now known by the Yiddish term negel vasser, meaning nail water. This Yiddish term is also used for a special cup used for such washing.\n \n At meals\n \n The Babylonian Talmud[5] discusses two types of washing at meals: washing before a meal is described as first waters (the Hebrew term is mayim rishonim), and after a meal is known as last waters (the Hebrew term is mayim aharonim). The first term has generally fallen from contemporary usage; the second term has stuck.\n \n The Gemarrah of the Babylonian talmud contains homilectic descriptions of the importance of the practice, including an argument that washing before meals is so important that neglecting it is tantamount to unchastity, and risks divine punishment in the form of sudden destruction or poverty.[6][7] The discussion of mayim acharonim, washing after meals, contains a suggestion that washing after meals, as a health measure, is the more important of the two washings, on grounds that the salt used as a preservative in food could cause blindness if the eyes were rubbed without washing.[8]\n \n Washing before meals is normative in Orthodox Judaism. Although it was once not widely practiced (for example, until recently it did not appear in many Orthodox Passover Haggadahs) it has undergone something of a revival and has become more widely observed in recent years, particularly for special meals such as the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Conservative Judaism has supported discontinuing the practice of mayim acharonim on the grounds that the rabbis of the Talmud instituted it as a health measure, and since modern foods no longer contain preservatives so dangerous as to cause blindness upon contact with the eyes, washing the hands after meals is no longer required and can be discontinued by contemporary rabbinic decision.\n \n The standard Passover seder has an additional, third washing, prior to eating the green vegetable, which is considered an act of eating separate from the meal. In Orthodox Judaism, it also has the same types of washings as any other meal, one before the meal and one after. Only the one before the meal is generally done outside Orthodox Judaism\n \n More in the following link:\n \n Ritual washing in Judaism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

Hell, what is \"a spiritual perspective of what is being said\" in the first place?\n \n What does \"a spiritual perspective of what is being said in the scriptures by Jesus\" have to do with the identity of his Zechariah? With the infancy narratives about, but not spoken by, Jesus? Do you have any cogent response to these? No? Didn't think so.\n \n \nNotice he states that Jesus speaking Greek strains Arts credulity; but yet he offers no specific evidence whether it be biblical or extra biblical that Jesus didn't in fact speak perfect greek.\n\n \n I figured the absurdity of Greek speaking, LXX-using Galileans would be manifest. Alas, I always understimate your ignorance...\n \n All the available evidence indicates that Greek was rarely spoken among Jews in first century Palestine, least of all among the peasantry. When Titus, himself fluent in Greek (Suetonius Vit. Titus 3), tried to exhort the Galilean Zealot defenders of Jerusalem to surrender to his army, he sent Josephus to communicate with them in Aramaic (B.J. 5.9.2). When deserters came over to the Roman side, Josephus needed to be around to translate (C.A. 1.9). When Titus personally spoke to the rebel leaders in the Court of the Gentiles, he did so through a translator (B.J. 6.6.2). Josephus himself, a highly educated, wealthy aristocrat who by the time of Against Apion had spent decades in Rome, confesses that his Greek was still strained, requiring him to take on aid to translate Jewish War (C.A. 1.9). The clear impression one gets is that Greek was hardly spoken, even by elites. That Jesus, a poor peasant from a tiny, rural town in Galilee would have been the exception is frankly outlandish.\n \n And this impression is confirmed by the gospels, which are full of transliterated Aramaic words (e.g. Mark 5.41), translated Aramaic idioms (e.g. Matt 6.12, Luke 14.26), semitic grammatical constructs, and scriptural citations that are not dependent on the LXX where they are not obviously redactional. There is, simply, every reason to suppose Jesus spoke Aramaic, but no reason to think he spoke Greek.\n \n \nAnd this is assuming that Jesus was speaking greek at all which Art just assumes but doesn't prove in any way.\n\n \n I'm pretty sure I presented an argument for the dependence of the citation on the LXX. Perhaps you didn't understand it. Or, perhaps, this is just more of your waffle.\n \n Shall I explain it again in terms you might understand, or would you like to try an actually answer it?\n \n \nAnd who are these Palestian Jews Art speaks of? Better still, WHAT is a Palestian Jew according to first century life in Israel at that time?\n\n \n Golly Archangel, you're absolutely right -- how terribly confusing!

Better still, WHAT is a Palestian Jew according to first century life in Israel at that time?\n\n \n \nGolly Archangel, you're absolutely right -- how terribly confusing! What might a Palestinian Jew be? Perhaps a Jew that lived in Palestine (Judaea, Samaria, Galilee, Idumea and parts of Peraea and Phonecia)?\n\n \n What is confusing Art is your repeated assertions that 1st century Israel was referred to by anyone, anywhere, as Palestine, or that the Palestinian state existed in any way back then. That is the reason for my consternation at your repeated use of the word in a first century application. Here's how this link explains it:\n During the last few centuries, the world, Christians included, has fallen into a bad habit. We have bought into some early Roman propaganda. We have used the name Palestine, which Roman Emperor Hadrian placed on the country of Israel in 135 A.D., for so long that it has become common usage. This would be as incorrect as calling the Russia of today the \"Soviet Union\" or referring to Berlin as \"East Germany.\" Palestine vs. Israel as the Name of the Holy Land\n \n Now add to this historical reality that Israel wasn't officially destroyed until 70 AD, so until then that land was referred to by the whole known world as ISRAEL.

And that's what I recommend these folks get before they perish.\n \n \nIf anyone walks easy with the world, it is you.\n\n \n Show me your post where you've called these folks to repentance?\n \n \n The world is capitalist, diametrically opposed to both Christ's command and the practice of the early church, yet you accept and promote it.\n\n \n You screwed that up. Jesus said a man shall reap what he sows (capitalism); not what OTHER PEOPLE SOW (Obama socialism). Giving is to be voluntary, not forced or coerced. Plus, the Bible says if a man shall not work he shall not eat.\n \n If the people around here were waiting on you to lead them into repentance, warn them about hell and the consequences for ungodly living, and all that, I think they'd have a very long wait. \n \n Step out of the world, Jo, and either start preaching the Gospel the way John the Baptist and Jesus preached it - which includes a call for repentance - or stand aside.",

If they're on the net I'd like to see them, and the peer-reviewed responses or critiques from NT scholars as well.\n\n \n Here are just a few of the sources I have handy.\n \n E.P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus, pgs. 52-53; 54:\n \n \nThe references to times, people and events in the gospels are sometimes in conflict. As we saw, both Matthew and Luke place Jesus' birth late in Herod's reign (that is, c. 6-4 BCE). Luke, however, offers a conflicting date as well, the year of a census under Quirinius (6 CE). Quirinius was not legate of Syria while Herod was alive (despite Luke 1.5, 26; 2.2). When Herod died, Varus was legate....With regard to his birth, there is no information at all about the month and day, and there is conflict with regard to the approximate year (near the Time of Herod's death in 4 BCE and at the time of Quirinius' census in 6 CE).\n\n \n John Meier, A Marginal Jew Vol. 1, pg. 213:\n \n \nLuke's solution [for getting Joseph, Mary and Jesus to Bethlehem] is a world-wide census decreed by Caesar Augustus when Quirinius was governor of Syria (2.1) -- unfortunately, such a census (which would have had to occur ca. 5 B.C.) cannot be documented in any other ancient source. According to ancient records, Quirinius, who became governor of Syria in A.D. 6, conducted a census of Judea, but not Galilee, in A.D. 6-7. Attempts to reconcile Luke 2:1 with the facts of ancient history are hopelessly contrived.\n\n \n John Crossan, The Historical Jesus, pg. 372:\n \n \nFirst, there never was a worldwide census under Augustus. Second, the Palestinian census was undertaken by the Syrian legate, P. Sulpicius Quirinius, in 6 to 7 C.E., about a decade after the birth of Jesus. You will recall, from chapter 6 above, that its occasion was the annexation of Archelaus' territories under a direct Roman prefecture\n\n \n Mark Smith. 2000. \"Of Jesus and Quirinius\". Catholic Biblical Quarterly 62: 278-293:\n \n \nMost scholars maintain, rather, that the first \"Christmas\" occured between 4 and 6 BCE, during the waning years of the reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4 BCE. This traditional view is based primarily on the infancy narrative unique to Matthew. The problem arises, however, when one compares Matthew's account with that of Luke, for while the latter mentions Herod, he also claims that the census that drew Joseph and the expectant Mary to Bethlehem was precipitated by the Roman legate to Syria, Publius Sulpicius Quirinius. The problem is that Quirinius attained jurisdiction over Judaea (and not Galilee) only after Herod Archelaus, son of the Great Herod, was deposed in 6 CE. There have been two attempts to overcome this difficulty, both of which are possible, but neither of which is wholly satisfactory. Scholars using one approach argue that Quirinius must have served two terms as legate of Syria, the first during the reign of Herod the Great. Those using the other contend that Luke was mistaken in his chronology. [He then goes on to explain why two terms of Quirinius is not plausible, and why he thinks, as I do, that Luke is internally consistant. He finishes by arguing that Luke's chronology is more probable than Matthew's].\n\n \n Bart Ehrman, Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium, pg. 39:\n \n \nThere are other historical problems with the account. We know for instance -- from the Jewish historian Josephus, the Roman historian Tacitus, and several inscriptions -- that Quirinius was indeed governor of Syria. Unfortunately, it wasn't until ten years after King Herod had died -- even though Like makes their rules contemporaneous. But enough has been said to make my point. Not only do the two accounts of Jesus' birth stand at odds with one another, they are also not historically credible on their own terms.\n\n \n Raymond Brown, The Birth of the Messiah, pgs. 550-51:\n \n \nWas Quirinius governor (legate) of Syria during or shortly after the reign of Herod the Great, and thus around or before 4 BC? Drawing chiefly upon Josephus, we can put together the following chronology for the legates of Syria:\n \n 23-13 BC: M. Agrippa\n ca. 10 BC: M. Titius\n 9-6 BC: S. Sentius Saturninus\n 6-4 BC or later: Quintilius (or Quinctilius) Varus\n 1 BC to ca. AD 4: Gaius Caesar\n AD 4-5: L. Volusius Saturninus\n AD 6 to after 7: P. Sulpicius Quirinius\n \n If Quirinius served as governor of Syria twice, once in AD 6 and once earlier, the two possible time slots for the earlier governorship would be before M. Titius (and thus before 10 BC) or between Quintilius Varus and Gaius Caesar (and thus between 4 and 1 BC). Either possibility could be reconciled with the Lucan information. However, from what we know of the relatively well-documented career of Quirinius, it is unlikely that he had an earlier governorship at either of those periods. He served as consul in 12 BC (Tacitus Annals III 48). He was in Asia Minor sometime after 12 and before 6 BC leading the legions in the war against the Homonadenses. He was in the Near East, specifically in Syria, as an advisor to Gaius Caesar for several years before AD 4. But there is no mention of Quirinius having been legate in the nearly twenty years of his career from 12 BC to AD 6. Josephus, who describes several times the beginning of Quirinius' legateship in AD 6, gives no hint that Quirinius had served previously in that capacity....Indeed, even if without evidence one does posit this earlier governship of Quirinius, how does one explain a Roman census of Palestine during the reign of Herod the Great? A client king who paid tribute to Rome, Herod had his own taxes and tax collectors; and there is no evidence that the Romans collected taxes based on a census within his realm (see Josephus Ant. XVII ii 2;27). The known census of Quirinius in AD 6-7 was conducted precisely because Herod's son Archelaus had been deposed, and Judea was now coming under direct Roman government and taxation.\n\n \n John Nolland, Luke 1-9.20 (Word Biblical Commentary), pg. 100:\n \n \nQuirinius' post as legatus in Syria (i.e., governor of an imperial province answering directly to the emperor, and not to the Roman senate) is solidly attested (Josephus, Ant. 18.1; ILS 2683), as is his role in a census in Syria which embraced also the newly annexed territory of Archelaus (Josephus, Ant. 17.35; 18.1-2, 26; ILS 2683). An earlier posting as legatus in Syria lacks solid evidence. Josephus' words in Ant. 18.1 suggest that he was not aware of any such previous posting. Quirinius certainly had an earlier connection with the eastern part of the empire. From Tacitus, Ann. 3.48, we learn that Quirinius gained high honors for his part in putting down the Homonadensians in Cilicia (cf. also Strabo, Geography 12.6.5), and it is not impossible that governorship of Syria was the post from which Quirinius campaigned against the Homonadensians. Or, since we know little else about Quirinius' career between his becoming consul in Rome in 12 b.c. and his appointment as advisor to Gaius Caesar (Augustus' adopted son) in around a.d. 1, a governorship at another period could be suggested. But here the difficulty is finding a gap when the post was not filled by a known occupant. The possible gaps are too early or too late, unless we abandon either the connection with Herod's reign or the approximation of Luke 3:23 (cf. Sch\u00fcrer [ed. Vermes and Millar], Jewish People, 1:257-59). Ramsay's suggestion that a co-governorship might be involved (Recent Discovery, 4th ed., 293) is not supported by any concrete analogy from Roman administration of the period. The broken inscription titulus tiburtinus (ILS 918), which has been frequently claimed to support two periods of governorship in Syria for Quirinius, may only refer to two governorships, one of which is in Syria (the syntax for iterum, \"again,\" is disputed), and in any case, since the name is missing, the inscription has also been claimed for various other figures. While the extent of our knowledge is too limited for definite assertion (for the identity of, and the chronology for, the governors before Varus, Josephus is the sole source and his chronology can be disputed [cf. the articles of Corbishley and also W. E. Filmer, \"The Chronology of the Reign of Herod the Great,\" JTS 17 (1966) 283-98; T. D. Barnes, \"The Date of Herod's Death,\" JTS 19 (1968) 204-9; Martin, Birth of Christ, 106-31]), it seems unlikely that Quirinius served an earlier term as governor of Syria.\n\n \n Robert Stein, Luke (New American Commentary), pgs. 104-5:\n \n \nThe heart of the problem, as has already been stated, is the dating of the census within the rule of Quirinius. It is the date, not the existence of the census, that is problematic. Several attempts have been made to reconcile this biblical statement with the historical materials. Some of these involve the discrediting of Josephus, who stated that the census under Quirinius took place in a.d. 6-7. Another attempt is to argue that the appearance of the name \"Quirinius\" in 2:2 is a textual error and that the name C. Sentius Saturnius should be read instead. There is, however, no textual evidence that the name \"Quirinius\" is a scribal error. Another attempt is to divide the census into two parts. The first part, or ordering of a census, took place during the time of Caesar Augustus; and the second part, the census itself, was completed under Quirinius in a.d. 6-7 (cf. Acts 5:37). But why then would Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem during the ordering of the census in the time of Herod when the actual census did not take place until later? Another attempt is to understand Quirinius, who was placed in charge of putting down the Homodensian revolt in northwestern Syria, i.e., southeastern Turkey today (see Strabo, Geography 12.6.5), as being a kind of second governor at the time. He was the governor of external affairs, whereas Saturnius was governor of internal affairs. Still another explanation is that the term \"first,\" or \"first census,\" should be understood not as \"first\" but should be translated, \"This was the census 'before' Quirinius was governor.\" The genitive absolute \"while Quirinius was governor of Syria,\" however, makes this unlikely. It must be confessed that there is no easy explanation at the present time for this historical problem of the census date, but some new evidence might in the future vindicate the historical accuracy of Luke on this point.\n\n \n Joseph Fitzmyer, The Gospel According to Luke I-IX (Anchor Yale Bible Commentary), pg. 401:\n \n \nPublius Sulpicius Quirinius' career is fairly well known and defies all attempts either to attribute to him two censuses in Judea or to date the start of his legateship of Syria to any other period than AD 6-7; the only thing in this regard that is uncertain is how long his legateship continued. [In his note on 2.2, he lays out why such a view is hardly plausible in light of the data]\n\n \n And there are plenty more where that came from.",
