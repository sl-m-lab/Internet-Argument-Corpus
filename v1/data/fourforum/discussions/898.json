Perhaps that is the view in your neightborhood in California but I doubt it and as a whole the idea is simply idiotic. People here care about what is happening in France although it is not a top story. I've seen several news reports just about this every day for the last week so there is no doubt that it is being reported on and things don't get reported on this often if no one cares. Perhaps it is hard for us to relate to what is happening there to the same extent that French or other European people can. There is of course the little matter of Iraq and more of our own troubles that consume much of the news here. Don't mistake that for the majority of Americans not caring what is happening in France.",
