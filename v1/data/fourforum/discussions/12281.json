   "ON A MONDAY AFTERNOON LAST SUMMER in the town of Hastings, Minn., David Norman Wigen parked his white pickup truck near the intersection of Fourth and Vermillion Streets, walked into the Wells Fargo branch there, and attempted to stage a heist. The 49-year-old construction worker handed a bank teller a curt, crumpled note: \"Money now, do not make me hurt someone!\" The teller handed him $260. Wigen fled with the money and within the next five hours bought some methamphetamine, confessed his crime to his sister, and was arrested by an off-duty police officer. Other than its clumsiness, Wigen's failed robbery is remarkable for one detail: the medium he selected to convey his instructions to the teller. His note had been scrawled in pencil on a sheet from a yellow legal pad.",
