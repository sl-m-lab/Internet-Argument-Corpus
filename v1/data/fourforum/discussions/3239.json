   "DON'T KILL THE MESSENGER, JUST A HARMLESS CHUCKLE OR TEN.\n \n Kerry's \"Top 10 Bush Tax Proposals\" are:\n \n 10. No estate tax for families with at least two U.S. presidents.\n \n 9. W-2 Form is now Dubya-2 Form.\n \n 8. Under the simplified tax code, your refund check goes directly to Halliburton.\n \n 7. The reduced earned income tax credit is so unfair, it just makes me want to tear out my lustrous, finely groomed hair.\n \n 6. Attorney General (John) Ashcroft gets to write off the entire U.S. Constitution.\n \n 5. Texas Rangers can take a business loss for trading Sammy Sosa.\n \n 4. Eliminate all income taxes; just ask Teresa (Heinz Kerry) to cover the whole damn thing.\n \n 3. Cheney can claim Bush as a dependent.\n \n 2. Hundred-dollar penalty if you pronounce it \"nuclear\" instead of \"nucular.\"\n \n 1. George W. Bush gets a deduction for mortgaging our entire future.\n \n Waxy",

On one side we have a spoiled brat who is a legend in his own mind - on the other a delusional idiot who don't have a clue. \n \n BTW &#8211; did you see Blue Collar TV last night? Stu Pididiot?
