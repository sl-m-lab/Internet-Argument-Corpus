   "It's been my contention that if Barack Hussein Obama (or more correctly D'oh-bama) manages to slither his way into the Oval Office, we would see the same, if not worse conditions than the mid-to-late-1970s when another Democrat had occupied the White House with a Democrat Congress in tow (yes I refer to the Georgia Peanut farmer known as Jimmah Cahtah). But what exactly does this have to do with a Conservative backlash?? Simple. The reason Reagan was so successful was that he was able to convey the principles of Conservatism, despite having to butt heads with Tip O'Niell and Co. My prediciton is that, especially with a congressional approval rating at a paltry 8% and a very questionable Democrat candidate, the GOP will be refocusing itself on the principles and become much stronger to take on the Dems in 2010. But more than that, the American Electorate, contrary to what Liberals typically think, are much smarter and are more than capable to see right through the abject failures that Liberalism has wrought.",
