   "First, a comment about your second link. Gould had this to say about the quotes on that page:\n \nSince we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists--whether through design or stupidty, I do not know--as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups.\n --Gould, Stephen Jay. Hen's Teeth and Horses Toes. \"Evolution as Fact and Theory.\" W.W. Norton & Company. New York. 1983. p. 260\n\n It seems that creationists are still at it.\n \nEssentially, as I understand things, one of the main components of evolutionary thought is that changes to new species take place gradually over long periods of time.\n\n Yes. That is one component of evolutionary thought. But there is more to it than that. Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static (as far as the fossil record reveals) for long periods of time, sometimes millions of years. Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly, in a flash of geological time, maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years. Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population. Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them. They agreed with Darwin. Finally, in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin, Dobzhansky, and Mayr. I think their paper, in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events, was published in 1972.\n \nThe fossil record does not support this. So, in an attempt to deal with this problem, Gould and Eldredge came up with a theory called, punctuated equilibrium.\n\n Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.\n \nI think it highlights one of the main problems in evolutionary theory and that the fossil record simply does not support it.\n\n Nope. It does. Or maybe it supports the hypothesis of successive creation. The fossil record that we find certainly doesn't support the creation as told in the Bible. Even the creationists who went in search of evidence of the flood some 200 years ago realized that the geology didn't support what the Bible said. So they thought that the geology represented many floods, the last one from the Bible being on top.\n \nNamely, the lack of transitional species.\n\n This objection has already been answer by Gould in the quote above. But of course, what creationists demand is eyedropper precision from a fire hose. Nevertheless, we have some spectacular transitional forms. My favorite is Archaeopteryx. And there is a great progression from four legged land animal to two finned aquatic whales. Some whales in that progression had rear legs that would have been useless for walking.\n \nI am not saying that creation can be evidenced, simply that there is evidence against evolution which was never taught in my high school classes.\n\n Really?

For example, please explain to us why feathers are a disqualifying characteristic in a transitional form.\n \n When you have more time to make a detailed response, please address the following characteristics and discuss how their presence/absence in Archaeopteryx impacts its status as a transitional form:\n Opposable hallux, presence of furcula, elongate pubis directed backward, beak, fused trunk vertibrae, pneumatic bones, elongate cerebral hemispheres with cerebellum behind mid-brain, concave articular facets on cervical vertebrae, long tail composed of free vertebrae, teeth, ribs with unicinate processes articulated with sternum, carina, sacrum of 6 vetebrae, archosaurian pelvic femur joint, free metacarpals, free metatarsals, preorbital fenestra, deltoid ridge on humerus and radial and ulnar condyles forward facing, clasw on unfused digits of forelimbs, developed fibula, gastralia. Well, that should be enough for now. I would have to do a bit of reviewing of the anatomy of theropods, avians, and Archaeopteryx to list more. But I'm sure that your detailed analysis if the above few characteristics are enough to support your position.\n \n But please be sure to address the first question. Yes, Archaeopteryx had feathers. So what? \n \nWhere is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution.\n\n That presumes that \"evolution\" predicts the transition from scales to feathers? Please substantuate your claim with references to recent peer reviewed literature. You seem to imply that we should be able to find these transitions on Archaeopteryx. Why would that be so? If it had only some form of proto-feather then it wouldn't be a bird, would it?\n \n You don't seem to be very current about these matters. You can find such structures on animals such as Sinosauropteryx, Caudipteryx and other oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs, Microraptor, and the beautifully preserved Sinornithosaurus.\n \nNatural selection in particular but overall evolution.\n\n This sentence fragment doesn't make sense. Is it supposed to be an expansion on your claim that \"evolution\" predicts examples of scales becoming feathers? If so, how is that a prediction of natural selection.

   "I guess my point is that it is not just the absence of evidence but to look at the evidence objectively.\n\n Do you know what science is? Do you have any idea of how it works? Why is it that you object only to science that conflicts with your belief in the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen? Why do you repeat assertions that you haven't looked at objectively?\n \nFor instance there is a precambrian layer with nothing in it.\n\n Sorry. Wrong again. You certainly don't make much effort to keep yourself informed, do you?\n \nIt goes from nothing to something, all of a sudden.\n\n Depends on what you mean by \"sudden.\" The Vendian period lasted from about 650 to 543 million years ago. That is the period when lots of fossil forms (that for you don't exist) that are precursors to the Cambrian forms can be found. The \"Cambrian explosion\" lasted about 40 million years. When you compare that to the fact that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor about 7 million years ago, \"sudden\" becomes a relative term.\n \nAs I said, I don't know that much and am still researching. It make take me a week to formulate a really good argument. The stuff I have posted for now is mostly to stimulate discussion on the issue.\n\n You didn't have to tell us that you don't know much. It is quite apparent. And of course, you consider a week sufficient to formulate a \"really good argument\" about a topic of which you are ignorant. That's funny. It took me about 6 years to learn enough to formulate a good argument on the topic. But you \"creation scientists\" aren't hampered by the necessity to actually do science and to test your assertions, are you?\n \nThis all originated because I said that evolution is taught as fact (and I know some on this board that have argued it as fact, Lurch used to anyway, one or two others I can think of).\n\n Well, Lurch was probably right. You don't seem to be able to distinguish between definitions, observations, and explanations. Besides, the major tenets of evolutionary theory have been around for so long and tested so often that they are no longer questioned. To do science as creationists demand would bring any progress to a complete halt. If one had to demonstrate Newton's laws of gravity and motion and demonstrate that the earth is a sphere every time before an orbital calculation for a satellite was done, there wouldn't be any satellites. Those kinds of basic scientific theories are presented as factual in science class - they are presented as strongly supported scientific theories. So is the theory of evolution - except we know that evolution happens because we have seen it.\n \nI wouldn't mind if it is promoted as a theory, as long as other possible theories are also examined.\n\n They are where appropriate.\n \nWhy could one not look at the evidence that supports a creationist view point for instance. Lets look at evidence for and against (in schools) explanations.\n\n Because there is none. I ask frequently for a creationist to present it and all that is ever answered is arguments why evolution can't be true based on ignorance of science in general and biology in particular. Besides, in my country the Constitution forbids the teaching of some particular religion in the public schools. And there is no two ways about it, creationism is religion. There is no science to it.\n \nA teacher doesn't have to say that creation is true. They can say what they believe. They can say why. The kids should be allowed to explore it completely.\n\n No. A teacher can't. A teacher can't present religion as science. If kids want to explore religion, then they should do so in their homes and in their churches. We even get religious clap-trap on TV where there is no rational view of reality presented along side. Science in science class. Religion in classes of comparative religion along with Wicca, Islam, Buddhism, Shintoism where it can be compared to other religions. Apples to apples. Creationism shouldn't be presented in science classes where it is comparing the apples of science to the cow pies of creationism.\n \nMy point on the other thread is that kids are not allowed. They are taught exclusively evolution as fact. I was.\n\n Again, go home or go to your church to learn religion. Science classes in public schools are not the place to teach your religion.",

   "I am always amazed at how creationists so frequently use lack of time to justify content free responses. Wouldn't it have been easier to not even attempt an answer or to admit that you don't know enough to respond intelligently?\n \n Yes it is and yes it does. Did you have a point? For example, please explain to us why feathers are a disqualifying characteristic in a transitional form.\n \n When you have more time to make a detailed response, please address the following characteristics and discuss how their presence/absence in Archaeopteryx impacts its status as a transitional form:\n Opposable hallux, presence of furcula, elongate pubis directed backward, beak, fused trunk vertibrae, pneumatic bones, elongate cerebral hemispheres with cerebellum behind mid-brain, concave articular facets on cervical vertebrae, long tail composed of free vertebrae, teeth, ribs with unicinate processes articulated with sternum, carina, sacrum of 6 vetebrae, archosaurian pelvic femur joint, free metacarpals, free metatarsals, preorbital fenestra, deltoid ridge on humerus and radial and ulnar condyles forward facing, clasw on unfused digits of forelimbs, developed fibula, gastralia. Well, that should be enough for now. I would have to do a bit of reviewing of the anatomy of theropods, avians, and Archaeopteryx to list more. But I'm sure that your detailed analysis if the above few characteristics are enough to support your position.\n \n But please be sure to address the first question. Yes, Archaeopteryx had feathers. So what? \n \n That presumes that \"evolution\" predicts the transition from scales to feathers? Please substantuate your claim with references to recent peer reviewed literature. You seem to imply that we should be able to find these transitions on Archaeopteryx. Why would that be so? If it had only some form of proto-feather then it wouldn't be a bird, would it?\n \n You don't seem to be very current about these matters. You can find such structures on animals such as Sinosauropteryx, Caudipteryx and other oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs, Microraptor, and the beautifully preserved Sinornithosaurus.\n \n This sentence fragment doesn't make sense. Is it supposed to be an expansion on your claim that \"evolution\" predicts examples of scales becoming feathers? If so, how is that a prediction of natural selection. Do you even know what natural selection is? I suspect not. I suspect that you are just parroting what you have been told by some creationist who is as uninformed as you.\n\n \n I think you are being pedantic. I did not say I would not respond. I said I am researching as I don't know much. I have already admitted what you say would be easier if I just admitted it. It is responses such as that, that mean I will not respond to you further. Do as you please, but your posts will be ignored by me. I may have sentence fragments and other items, but I have not been dishonest. Your characterization of me is prejudiced \"creationists so frequently use lack of time to justify content free responses.\" I will not respond to prejudiced regardless of how well informed you may be. Everyone here will testify (and you could actually read my posts) that I do indeed respond when I say I am going to respond and provide evidence when I say I am going to provide evidence. This is a continuing conversation between bootfitter and I. I accept others responses and will try to argue to the best of my ability but it is well outside of my scope.\n \n You can list all the evidence you want. You still misquote me and equivocate my meanings and resort to ad hominem arguments. You also supply evidence.\n \n Fine. I care not a whit what you think. Your evidence is stipulated to. Do you wish to continue this idiocy. I never said that evolution wasn't true and that creation was true. I simply said that true science requires the look at the evidence objectively and that some individuals that support evolution do not do that. When I present an argument, I am willing to look at both sides. You apparrently are not based on your prejudicial comment.\n EF",

   "So, epaphras faith\n \n Perhaps I overreacted to your parroting of rote creationist responses. If that is the case then I apologize. I will withdraw my opinions as to your integrity and wait for further developments and comments.\n \n But to be truthful, I have reviewed my remarks and don't see that your reaction was justified either. You posted misinformation and you were corrected, and for that you took offense. Of course I'm being pedantic - it's like explaining to a 2 year old that 5 does not follow 3. You see, the geological strata below the Cambrian is not empty of fossils. How many times does that have to be said and how many fossils have to be found over how many years before creationists stop claiming that there are no pre-Cambrian fossils?\n \n Maybe I reacted too strongly to your snide remarks. For example, in post #6 you made the comment, \"If you read Gould's original work...\" Well, from where I sit right now I can see 12 of his books and I have read them all but the last, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. But it is over 1300 pages of dense prose that discusses some complex ideas. While I have not read the whole thing, I have done considerable index mining in the course of various discussions in order to read what Gould thought about a topic. The index entries on punctuated equilibrium theory take a whole page. Now by \"Gould's original work\" do you mean the 1972 paper that he wrote with Eldgedge? Well, I haven't read that but I have read further discussions of the topic by both men. Your comment implies that you have read and understood what Gould has had to say on the topic. Perhaps you lacked the background to understand what he meant. Which books have you read and where did you get the idea that Gould believed that there are no transitional fossils? If you tell me where I can grab the book off of my shelf and read the relevant portions so that I might be able to explain to you why you misunderstand. I certainly hope that your experience with Gould has been more than some out of context quotes. You imply more, and to have not read at least one book that discusses punk eek directly would be hypocritical. Please be as specific as you can - it will be easier for me to find the parts that have confused you.\n \n So, if you are a \"stand up guy\" as Waxy says, your intent was to research in order to comment on my questions. In fact, I'll even suggest a couple of sources for you to do some Archaeopteryx research at the end.\n \n So here are my questions for your consideration:\n \n You stated, \"Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form. It has well defined feathers.\"\n \n Please define \"transitional form.\" I know what I mean by it, and I know what most other biologists mean by it, and I know what Gould meant by it. You have read Gould's original work, so the question should be easy.\n \n Please explain why well defined feathers exclude an animal from being a transitional form. Are you limiting the definition to a single characteristic? Possibly you are confusing Linnean taxonomy with cladistics and/or morphology. Here's why I don't understand your exclusion of Archaeopteryx based on the extent of feather development. Both Ambulocetus and Rodhocetus have been used as examples of transitional species. Neither has any feathers at all. Does it follow that you agree that they are indeed transitional species? Do you see why I am puzzled now? Neither Ambulocetus nor Rodhocetus has been claimed to be transitional between dinosaurs and birds, so we wouldn't reasonably expect either to have feathers. However, Archaeopteryx is exactly a transitional species between theropods and birds - and we could reasonably expect an early bird to have feathers. The problem is worse when you consider that several dinosaurs have been identified that also have feathers. I named some.\n \n Please discuss the following characteristics and explain why their pressence/absence either supports is contraty to the status of Archaeopteryx as a transitional. Opposable hallux, presence of furcula, elongate pubis directed backward, beak, fused trunk vertibrae, pneumatic bones, elongate cerebral hemispheres with cerebellum behind mid-brain, concave articular facets on cervical vertebrae, long tail composed of free vertebrae, teeth, ribs with unicinate processes articulated with sternum, carina, sacrum of 6 vetebrae, archosaurian pelvic femur joint, free metacarpals, free metatarsals, preorbital fenestra, deltoid ridge on humerus and radial and ulnar condyles forward facing, claws on unfused digits of forelimbs, developed fibula, gastralia. I can understand why you may not wish to discuss such topics since even slight knowledge turns your assertion that Archaeopteryx is not a transitional to nonsense. But I don't understand why you would begin such a discussion with a single gratuitous remark if you had no intention in discussing the topic. That was my previous point - why begin the discussion if you had no intention to follow up? Why would you then claim that it was your intention? One way or the other - not both.\n \n And while we are at it, you claim that the statement of Gould's that I gave you is backpeddling, that he actually admits that there are no transitionals. You base this on your claim to have read Gould's original work. I am stunned that anyone could make a claim to have read Gould's original work and not be aware that both he and Eldredge observed just such transitions between species. They had occasion to discuss these observations and from those discussions came their 1972 paper on Punk Eek. Why would Gould declare that there are no transitional species when he was intimately aware of at least two, and became so well known for his published work on the issue? You were aware, weren't you, Eldredge found a small area, periferal to the larger populations, that demonstrated a gradual transition between two easily distinguished species of trilobite and that the larger area showed the rapid replacement of one with the other with no intermediates? You were aware, weren't you, that Gould found a record of similar isolated speciation in land snails where over the broad range there was a rapid replacement of one species by another?\n \n As to your next bit of comment on a topic about which you admit no knowledge:\n \nNote the sentence that follows questions where the transition from scales to feather is in the fossil record.\n\n That doesn't answer the question. Why do the presence of feathers disqualify Archaeopteryx from being transitional? Please discuss the other characteristics I mention above and have mentioned before.\n \nIt is possible that Pandion responded to this. I don't really care as I am not arguing his point.\n\n Of course you aren't. I responded to your question in the following paragraphs. Of course, you are assuming that feathers evolved from scales. What is the basis of that assumption? Are you quite sure that theropods had scales?\n \nI note this as he conveniently took what I posted out of context. Not too smart given that anyone can go back and look at the actual post.\n\n Exactly. So stand up like a man and go back and look. To claim that you aren't reading what I am posting and then try to respond to something that you didn't read isn't too bright. As I just said, I asked a specific question (why do feathers mean that Archy isn't transitional?) and followed it with examples of transitional feathers.\n \nI leave it up to you all to decide who is presenting information honestly. I note he conveniently left it out of context\n\n I notice that you have done so to an even greater extent. I removed status as a transitional from discussion of feathers because your connection is ignorant. You argue that because Archy had feathers and not various stages of feathers developing from scales that Archy can not be a transitional. In fact, the feathers are quite convincing evidence of the transitional nature of Archaeopteryx. Archy looks like a dinosaur. Two specimens were classified as a dinosaur (Compsognathus) and a third was classified as a pterosaur. And it has been claimed (based on a single fossil) that Archy is a forgery, casts of feathers stuck on a dinosaur fossil. But there are other characteristics, besides the feathers, that are more like those of birds than dinosaurs. Of course, you would have to be aware of both avian and dinosaurian anatomy, at least a little, to recognize them. On a superficial level Archy looks like a dinosaur with feathers. The origin of those feathers is irrelevant.\n \n So stand up and be a man, epaphras faith. Either you want to discuss the evidence or you want to whine about how I was mean to you. If you aren't going to respond to me any more, then don't do it. Don't claim that you won't and then procede to do so by misrepresenting what I said. Either do it, or shut up.\n \n Oh yeah - the books. For a really good discussion of Archaeopteryx read the following:\n \n Shipman, Pat. Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight. Simon & Schuster. New York. 1998\n \n A good discussion that covers the actual evidence rather than pretending that feathers mean it isn't transitional.\n \n Paul, Gregory S. Dinosaurs of The Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore. 2002\n \n More detailed discussion of the minutia of skulls, skeletons, bones, feathers, comparative morphology, and cladistics than you are likely to ever need. Some detailed knowledge of avian anatomy is almost necessary.",

   "First off, I agree with you, but if I may, allow me to clarify what I believe is the point EF was trying to make -\n\n But that will be your opinion. I think it is a misreading of what EF actually said and meant. It seems that since he is unable to explain without blatent misrepresentation, you have to do the job for him. But he's a \"stand up guy,\" right\" Go and read his last post.\n \n\n The question was where is the evidence of transition from scales, skin, etc.. to feathers - Archeopteryx is not transitional in that sense, as feathers are already developed.\n\n But that's not what it says. And of course, no one except a creationist intent on deception, has ever made the claim that Archaeopteryx shows evidence of the transition from scales to feathers and that is why it is a transitional. I think that my interpretation of EF's two statements is more realistic. I answered both statements separately (even if EF wants to pretend that he is unaware that I did - such a stand up guy). That is not taking them out of context, as I said to jim, because the two statements cannot be considered in the same context. But EF himself has made it clear that he actually intended the two statements in the same context.\n \n Oh, EF might head down to the library at a major research university and start a search of the literature on the evolution of feathers. I'm sure he will find ample recent work on the topic. But to look for evidence on Archaeopteryx is to misrepresent the claims that evolutionary biologists have made and it demonstrates either ignorance or duplicity.\n \nI am not able to do so, but simply pointing to the evidence or providing a simple explanation is all that's required to address this point. Much as you've done above.\n\n And as I did? I specifically mentioned some specimens that show pretty much the reality of what he asked for. But it doesn't show that feathers evolved from scales, since that doesn't appear to be the case. By genetic alteration feathers developed on embryo chickens instead of scutes.\n \n Above I suggested that EF could head down to the library at a major university. He would try Yale and check with Dr. Richard Prum. The evolution and development of feathers is his research field. As I understand it feathers of all types develop from a placode which is not an altered scale. Rather it is a thickening of epidermal cells that deposit keratin. Feathers are made of beta-keratins, which are unique to reptiles and birds. Could one consider that to be one more bit of evidence of the ancestry of birds?\n \n You might check out the March 2003 issue of Scientific American. Dr. Prum co-authored an article with Alan Brush on the evo-devo of feathers.\n \n At any rate, I don't see a question asking for evidence of the development of feathers from scales to be meaningful in any context, especially not in the context of Archaeopteryx as a transitional. The best theory, supported by fossil evidence as well as evo-devo studies indicate that feathers are not modified scales.",

   "Well then, I apologize to epaphras faith if I have misread him. It was my intent to inform him of his gross errors of fact. I did not mean to attack him and I feel that careful reading of what I said should make that clear. Perhaps I was too stern. All I can say is that it was one of those \"He can't be serious!\" moments. How can someone reject theories of science with single sentences in one breath and then admit that he doesn't know what he is talking about in the following sentence. How can such a person be taken seriously.\n \n Here's an example. It will be for everyone else since EF isn't reading my posts anymore. He seems to be limiting himself to retaliation by insulting and misrepresenting me.\n \n At any rate, EF simply stated that there was a lack of transitional forms. I gave him an example. Now this occurred in his message where he was linking to a page that was quoting Gould out of context. Perhaps he took offense to the quote by Gould wherein Gould called people who used his quotes in that manner were either stupid or dishonest. I don't know. I didn't say that, Gould did. Perhaps EF took it to heart and blamed me.\n \n Anyway, this was when EF began to get smug and insulting. Just a quick assertion about Archy, linking it to irrelevant assertions about feathers. Rather than ask or even offer reasonable disagreement he gave us snippits from creationists. Even though there is an implication that I don't know what I'm talking about, I would be willing to let that stand if EF had been willing to follow through as he had promised.\n \n What is worse is EFs statement \"If you read Gould's original work...,\" implying that I had not read Gould. That's insulting. Why would an honest person reference Gould after having NOT read him?\n \n Waxy even warned EF that he was about to get into deep water with his assertions in the following post. Didn't stop him, though.\n \n So it seems that my remark about \"content free\" posts started it all. But I still don't see any content in his \"Archy isn't transitional. It had feathers\" post. Perhaps the problem originated when EF, in his very first words, admited to be uninformed on the topic and then proceded to discuss it anyway with assertions. Wouldn't it have been better if he had been a bit more respectful and tried to learn. Instead he implies that I quote Gould without having read him. He implies that I would claim that Archaeopteryx is a transitional without understanding why it is so. I consider both of those to be implications that I am dishonest.\n \n So go back and read the exchanges again. Instead of placing the blame on me, perhaps you will see that EF is as much at fault as I am. Perhaps you will see that he began the acceleration and he was answered in kind. And now he has come down to direct accusations as to my integrity (escaping by pretending that he doesn't know if I addressed his feather evolution question.) I think he knows and that makes his post insulting. He is, in effect, calling me a liar again.\n \n For my part I am sorry that I do not take a softer approach. After all, EF did admit that he didn't know enough to discuss the topic. I should have taken that into account. But that is puzzling. Why admit ignorance and then make pronouncements anyway? I should have just laughed.\n \n So again, I am sorry. I will continue to point out EFs errors of fact and try to explain why they are errors, but I will do it in a manner that is less forceful. I would welcome discussion from EF as to why the presence of feathers mean that Archaeopteryx isn't transitional. I would welcome discussion of the other characteristics and how they support or oppose his position.\n \n I would also like to see him respond to my questions about Gould. He has taken a position and indicated that he has read Gould's works, at least some. What works? Where did Gould agree that there are no transitionals?",

If that is the case then what it is saying is that because organisms share similarities they must necessarily be related? Am I correct?\n\n \n No, it means that logically, given the vast amounts of evidence about biology (organic chemistry, physics, all of science really), unless a we're talking about first organisms (there could be more than one), any subsquent organism that isn't a first organism will have an \"ancestor\", and it will logically have similarities to this ancestor. As would another offshoot of that ancestor, but not necessarily the same similarities (whatever changed would be \"not a similarity).\n \n Having a \"similarity\" is not evidence of ancestry. Scientists have found countless functions and peculiarities about different organisms that are very similar to other organisms, but can show how it evolved through a different \"track\". Wings are a good example, not all animals with wings evolved from some common \"winged\" ancestor. Go far enough back though, and it's assumed there are a finite number of \"first organisms\". Any other hypothesis is simply not probable, nor supported with justification.\n \n Although I do like your approach in poking for holes and wanting to see evidence and explanations, learning about evolution is a wonderful thing, it answers so many questions I can't imagine living without understanding (some) of it. \n \n -Mach",

   "I think that everyone has correctly norrowed the discussion from what is stated at the web site. The theory being discussed it to the theory of evolution, but one of many theories of evolution, namely common descent.\n \n If you look at yourself and your parents, you are likely to look like your parents. Your parents have two arms with five fingered hands at the ends? I'll bet that you do too. Further, I would bet that your siblings do too. So, as kind of a reductio ad absurdum statement of the theory, I might state that my brothers' hands and mine are homologous structures.\n \n But of course, evolutionary theory doesn't apply the principles at such a basic level. Again, the discussion has correctly zeroed in on the application of homologies, cladistics. Even Linneaus build his binomial clasification system on similarities between organisms. Thus the stoat, the N. American and the Eurasian mink are all members of the weasel genus, the Mustela. But the Linnean system demands that every organism be placed in a specific species of some genus, family, order, class, and phylum. And these phyla, classes, orders, families and genera were determined by similarities. It worked pretty well until the system became overwhelmed by so many organisms, both living and extinct. The simple system of classification became fractured, so we have sub-classes, super-orders, sub-orders, infra-orders, and a plethora of other names the make one unsure exactly where an organism fits.\n \n Then along came computers. While the idea behind cladistics is fairly simple, in practice any cladistic analysis very quickly becomes overwhelming. The more homologies that are taken into account, the better the cladogram - and the more impossible it is to arrive at the cladogram without computer assistance.\n \n The Compleat Cladist: A Primer of Phylogenetic Procedures, special publication No. 19 of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History is available on the web. It used to be on the UK web site but I couldn't find it there anymore. The book is from 1991 and is out of print. It was used at the UK and other universities to teach cladistics. The intent of the University was to publish a 2nd updated edition but I don't know if they did. When it went out of print it was still in demand so the University made it available on the web. It was picked up (with permission I assume) by the department of Taxonomy, Systematics, and Bioinformatics at the University of Glassgow (the link above). There are probably better books available but they aren't free.\n \n So what the site is saying is that organisms will inherit structures from their ancestors. Therefore, two different organisms that have a common ancestor will share some characteristics that have been inherited from that ancestors. They are known as derived characters in cladistics. Further, the more derived characters two organisms share, and the more similar those derived characters are, the more closely related (more recently diverged) are the two organisms.\n \n Thus, if we select derived characters at a broad enough level, we find that the wings of bats and the wings of birds are indeed homologous structures. They are both derived from the front limb of a tetrapod. But cladistic analysis also shows that bats, like all mammals, descended from a therapsid reptile. Birds did not.\n \n So I think that what the site is saying is that the evolutionary theory of common descent predicts that organisms that are descended from a common ancestor will share similar derived characters (homologous structures) and that analysis of these derived characters can be used to determine how and how closely two or more organisms are related. Of course, determining homologous as opposed to analogous (convergent evolution) evolution may be a problem in some cases.\n \n Maybe if clicking on the tree of topics below \"Homologies\" and reading those pages would help.

   "I read one article by a geologist that used K-Ar dating to date the most recent dome in Mt. St. Helens. It came up as about .35 million years old. Ridiculous given that it is about a couple of decades old at the time.\n\n Right. That was probably Steve Austin (Nevins) of the ICR. The principle is similar to that demonstrated in a real scientific paper that yielded two different dates in the millions of years from lava of known age - about 800 years. It seems to be where the creationists got the idea of how to misdate volcanic flows, a technique that they have used on more than one occasion to support their claims and dupe followers. They are (or at least should be) aware of why their techniques are bogus.\n \n The paper is frequently cited by creationists as evidence of the unreliability of radiometric dating - therefore the earth is young and the Bible is correct. What creationists don't tell you is the point of the paper was that careless and uneducated selection of samples can lead to ages much older than the real age of the lava flow. What the paper did was to intentionally select mafic inclusions (i.e., rocks that had been carried in the lava flow but that were not liquified themselves) and date them. Obviously these inclusions were picked up from the older rock through which the lava was flowing so the dates obtained were much older than the actual flow. As I said, creationists often cite this paper, repeating the incongruent dates as evidence of a young earth. What they never mention is the stated purpose of the paper. \n \n You can find a discussion of this little stunt by Austin in Dr. Henke's paper, Young-Earth Creationist 'Dating' of a Mt. St. Helens Dacite: The Failure of Austin and Swenson to Recognize Obviously Ancient Minerals. Be sure and check the links to further information in the second paragraph. They may give you some more solid foundation in understanding what is going on. Tim Thompson's A Radiometric Dating Resource List is an extremely valuable shortcut to information on the topic. Thompson is a planetary physicist at JPL. Also mentioned is Joe Meert, a professor of Geology at U. of Florida and a web friend of mine that I have known for probably more than a decade. I have also met Dr. Henke on the web. All three of these men contribute to a site that I have contributed to in the past.\n \n But back to the topic. Notice that Austin dated the lava in the dome at Mount St. Helens. I believe that (and geologists please correct me if I am wrong) domes are formed by incompletely liquified lava. They grow slowly from lava that is more like toothpaste (harder in fact) than the rapid flows of glowing lava typical of some volcanos in Hawaii. Older and incompletely melted rocks are quite common in the domes of dormant volcanos. It is the complete melting of the lava that allows the Argon to escape, thereby resetting the radiometric clock.\n \n \"There are 339 isotopes of 84 elements found in nature. Of these, 269 are stable the remaining 70 are radioactive. Eighteen of the radioactive isotopes have long half-lives and have survived since the elements of the Solar System were manufactured. These long lived radioactive nuclides are the basis for radiometric dating. The remaining 52 radioactive isotopes have short half-lives but are continuously created by nuclear reactions in nature or by decay of the long-lived radioactive isotopes.\"\n \n The above is from The Age of the Earth by G. Brent Dalrymple. Dr. Dalrymple is a research geologist with the United States Geological Survey. I recommend the book to anyone interested in the geological evidence used to determine the age of the earth and that is extensively used in paleontology. K-Ar dating is explained on pp. 90-94.\n \n Especially interesting to me was isochron dating. By this method several radioactive isotope dating methods using isotopes with different half-lives are used to date a single sample. After some concentration I understood how the method works, but I couldn't explain it to you. When done correctly, the method yields a plot of a straight line. The point at which the line crosses the y-axis of the graph is an indication of the age of the sample. If the plot is not a straight line, then it has been contaminated or subjected to heat that has reset one or more of the isotopes used and the dates are unreliable and are rejected.\n \n Anyone interested in learning about the dating methods used by geologists should read the book. I must warn you - it isn't an easy read being quite technical.\n \n By the way, an indication that the web site that you link is either deceptive or ignorant or can be found in the first paragraph. \"...objective is to make the general public aware that the theory of evolution is not consistent with physical evidence and is no longer a respectable theory describing the origin of life.\" As has been pointed out to you, no doubt, evolution is not a theory of the origin of life.

And of course, evolutionary theories are perfectly consistent with physical evidence and still the best explanation we have for that observed evidence. In fact, about 95% of scientists accept the theory of evolution as being substantially correct - of that more than 99% of biologists and geologists are also evolutionists.\n \n Good luck in your studies, but I would suggest that you are going about it the wrong way.

   "By the way, there is an interesting story about Austin of the ICR. Once he presented a lecture and a video at the \"Museum of Creation and Earth History\" at ICR for a group of skeptics. There is some question as to whether Austin was aware that he was addressing a group of scientifically literate skeptics rather than a group of fundamentalist creationists. Anyway, in the video presentation Mount St. Helens was discussed. Austin stated that he had been an evolutionist until he had visited Mount St. Helens and what he saw there convinced him of the truth of the catastrophism and creationism. At the end of the presentation, during the question session, one of the skeptics asked, \"\"Whatever happened to Stuart Nevins? Does he publish anymore?\" Nevins wrote several articles in support of a young earth and catastrophism and creationism during the 1970s, well before the eruption of Mount St. Helens. At least Austin was honest enough to admit that he had written under the pseudonym \"Stuart Nevins.\" So much for recent conversion.",

Moore, Lalicker and Fischer (1952 p. 30), in listing the fossil record among 'evidence of evolution' have only this to say about it: 'Although lack of knowledge is immeasurably greater than knowledge, many linneages among fossils of various groups have been firmly established. These demonstrate the transformation of one species or genus into another and thus constiture documentary evidence of gradual evolution.' And Easton (1960 p. 34) citing the apotheosis of our acheivements, writes: 'An evolutionary series represents the peak of scientific accomplishment in morphological changes among related creatures during successive intervals of time. \n \n That these older texts hold so strongly to phyletic gradualism should surprise no one; harder to understand is the fact that virtually all modern texts repeat the same arguments even thought their warrant had disappeared as we shall now show, with the advent of the allopatric theory of speciation.\" \n \n They then go on to discuss that very theory.\n \n On page 83 of this document they state :\n \n \"In this paper we shall argue:\n (1) The expectations of theory color perception to such a degree that new notions seldom arise from facts collected under their influence before facts can be seen in different perspective.\"\n \n As I understand this, they are stating merely what I have been stating which is, evolution is an assumption which colors the way the data is perceived. Instead it is important to look at the data and draw conclusions.\n \n Bootfitter and I began a discussion in another thread that moved here as it more properly belonged here. \n \n \"(3) The theory of allopatric (or geographic) speciation suggests a different interpretation of the paleontological data. If new species arise very rapidly in small peripherally isolated local populations, then the great expectation of insensibly graded fossil sequesnces is a chimera. A new species does not evolve in the area of its ancestors; it does not arise from the slow transformation of all its forbears. Many breaks in the fossil record are real.\"\n \n If a new species does not evolve in the geographic region of its ancestor where then does it come from. It would seem like it would have to at least to some extent otherwise there would be nothing to evolve from. This one is one I am unclear on. I would actually appreciate some enlightenment on this one.\n \n Now, Pandion, can you please respond to me without putting me down for not having a PhD in biology, paleontology or etc? I certainly did not intend to insult you with stating that you may not have considered the context. Gould even explains that most evolutionists (at that time) stuck to one vein of thinking and it colored their interpretation of the data.",

   "I'm at somewhat of a loss to understand what EF is arguing about. I apologize for coming in late, but EF seems to be saying evolution is an either or proposition.\n It's either punctuated equillibrium or phyletic gradualism.\n This is a false premise, evolutionary rates can vary depending on the circumstances. There are certainly examples of relatively rapid speciation, like the Cambrian explosion but there are also examples of phyletic gradualism, the slow evolution of sharks, horseshoe crabs and crocodilians for example. \n As to allopatric speciation, you said:\n \nIf a new species does not evolve in the geographic region of its ancestor where then does it come from.

   "Thank you for the full reference.\n\n You're welcome.\n \nIt was difficult to get what they were going on about.\n\n Yeah verily. But they declare at the beginning that they are going to argue some diverse points.\n \n 1) Expectations of theory color perception.\n 2) Paleontology's view of speciation has been dominated by gradualism.\n 3) The theory of allopatric speciation suggests a different interpretation.\n 4) The history of life is more adequately represented by \"punctuated equilibria\" than phyletic gradualism.\n \n Certainly gradualism seems reasonable at first blush. An entire population gradualy changes to changes in response to gradual changes to the environment. I suppose that's possible. I don't see any overwhelming reason why it can't happen. In fact, I think that it has happened. But as the dominant theory of paleontolgy, I suspect that it is too narrow. And that is point 1. Current theory colors observation. Gaps in the fossil record are often attributed to the wrong causes. Demon38 has already made this point, correctly in my opinion. In 1972 Eldredge & Gould had a point. I think that they have made it by today. Not all evolution progresses at the same steady pace. Sometimes smaller segments of a population may become isolated and the conditions cause evolutionary changes. The chances that these small populations produced many fossils and that we will discover them are almost nil. In the mean time, the environment for the parent population remains unchanged, and so the parent population remains unchanged as far as paleontology can discern. The parent population, because it is already well adapted to its environment, changes very little. This is known as stasis and ther are examples in the fossil record that indicate that some species remained in stasis for millions of years. But sudenly there is a break in the fossil record. It appears as if one species quickly changed into another similar species in a flash. Well, first you must remember that a \"flash\" in geologic time may be tens of thousand years. Secondly, and quite importantly, what the fossil record reveals is probably not a sudden speciation event. That event took place gradually in a small, isolated sub-population. Subsequently it was reunited with the main population because of some environmental change, and out competed and eventually replaced the parent population. But even this replacement probably didn't happen in observable time. It may have taken thousands of years or more. As I have mentioned before, the geological record is somewhat like timing a 100 yd dash with a sundial. It just isn't that fine grained.\n \n Gould has said in another place that the breaks we observe aren't speciation events. Those events took place somewhere else over long periods of time (gradually). The breaks in the fossil record are migration events, where the daughter species migrates into the range of the parent species and out competes it for resources.\n \n That's Punk eek. Relatively rapid, but still gradual, speciation in small isolated populations, followed replacement of the parent population by the daughter.\n \n It's actually accepted theory. In fact, gradualism, sympatric speciation, and allopatric speciation are all reasonable theories. The point of the paper is that evolution does not always proceed at the slow and steady pace that gradualism proposes.",

I am not certain that evolution adequately explains it. \n \n As I see things, there are three camps, 1) creation completely and uniquely for all animals and man and the earth, stars planets etc.\n 2)Evolution, life created by accident with idividual species arising over time.\n 3)Creation then evolution as many would say. God began it all and then set things in motion.\n \n I see another alternative. I see the data poining towards natural selection, although I don't know much about population statistics to discover what would be required for the vast number of species to arise that currently populate the planet (ants and roaches come to mind). I also see that God created the heavens and the earth and that man is unique and distinct from the animals on this planet, but that natural selection, and evolution are not adequately explained in the bible nor were they ever intended to be.\n \n I have been reading some more on evolution, unfortunately most of information is old. Are there good paleontological modern references I might peruse?\n \n {edited for some spelling}\n\n \n \n Actually, from what I see, Genesis in particular is an allegory. You do know the hebrew puns about adam, adamah and edom, as well as the name for\n eve (HAVVAH in hebrew) meaning life, and it being a pun because the hebrew for love is ahavvah??)\n \n If you look at genesis in the hebrew, it says that god created '(formed, as a potter forms clay), man out of red dust) (clay).. which is a pun on edom (Blood), so, if you follow the puns, it says that God formed man out of flesh and blood, and give him life and love as a compagion. It doesn't say HOW he did it, it just says that was done.\n \n If god formed man out of flesh and blood (which the puns indicate), evolution is not contridicting that.",

However, I am not certain of the interpretation within the context of scripture and the book of genesis as a whole. I will need to look more closely at it. As I said, I think I am still on the fence for the time being.",
