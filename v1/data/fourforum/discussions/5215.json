   "http://www.geocities.com/athens/troy/4399/\n \n Read this.\n 'The Prohibition amendment of the 1920s was ineffective because it was unenforceable, it caused the explosive growth of crime, and it increased the amount of alcohol consumption.'\n \n Also:\n \n 'As a result of the lack of enforcement of the Prohibition Act and the creation of an illegal industry an increase in crime transpired. The Prohibitionists hoped that the Volstead Act would decrease drunkenness in America and thereby decrease the crime rate, especially in large cities. Although towards the beginning of Prohibition this purpose seemed to be fulfilled, the crime rate soon skyrocketed to nearly twice that of the pre-prohibition period. In large cities the homicide went from 5.6 (per 100,000 population) in the pre-prohibition period, to nearly 10 (per 100,000 population) during prohibition, nearly a 78 percent increase. Serious crimes, such as homicides, assault, and battery, increased nearly 13 percent, while other crimes involving victims increased 9 percent. Many supporters of prohibition argued that the crime rate decreased. This is true if one is examining only minor crimes, such as swearing, mischief, and vagrancy, which did in fact decrease due to prohibition. The major crimes, however, such as homicides, and burglaries, increased 24 percent between 1920 and 1921. In addition, the number of federal convicts over the course of the prohibition period increased 561 percent. The crime rate increased because \"prohibition destroyed legal jobs, created black-market violence, diverted resources from enforcement of other laws, and increased prices people had to pay for prohibited goods\" (Thorton, 10).\n \n The contributing factor to the sudden increase of felonies was the organization of crime, especially in large cities. Because liquor was no longer legally available, the public turned to gangsters who readily took on the bootlegging industry and supplied them with liquor. On account of the industry being so profitable, more gangsters became involved in the money-making business. Crime became so organized because \"criminal groups organize around the steady source of income provided by laws against victimless crimes such as consuming alcohol\" (Thorton, 13). As a result of the money involved in the bootlegging industry, there was much rival between gangs. The profit motive caused over four hundred gang related murders a year in Chicago alone (Bowen, 175).'\n \n This is textbook drug control, particularly '\"prohibition destroyed legal jobs, created black-market violence, diverted resources from enforcement of other laws, and increased prices people had to pay for prohibited goods\" . Every single one of these now applies to other drugs.",

I guess they've just been misled by the insidious propaganda efforts of the Hardcore Marijuana Users.\n \n The entire Psychology faculty, including people whose entire jobs are dedicated to drug research, at the three largest universities in Sydney would also disagree with this assessment - the pot promoters must have got to them too!\n \n \nUsually the \"pot promoter\" has at least one other addiction, hence the term \"gateway drug\".\n\n \n The term gateway drug is used to put forward the idea Pot will lead to hard drugs. This is not an established fact from which the term is derived, there is very little evidence that would show that is the case. It is an accusation and a suspicion. Certainly many users of harder drugs also use marijuana, but correlation does not equal causation. It doesn't make sense for you in particular to call it a gateway drug, since you believe it itself is a hard drug. Perhaps we can call heroin a gateway drug instead, since it might lead to the horrors of pot usage.\n \n And please, provide some evidence for \"pot promoters\" (whatever they are) being addicts to other drugs.",

Not sure if that qualifies me as a stoner, though.\n \n I am, however, a home-owner in an inner-city neighborhood. I live there because it's affordable and because I like the city. Most of the people in my neighborhood rock - a very cool, diverse group of working class people. However, like every other big city, we do have a gang problem. Most of the gangs survive on the sale of drugs. They loiter on corners, shoot each other and make a complete nuisence of themselves selling their drugs to all the little yuppie punks who come through to buy their poison and take it back to the burbs. Personally - I am sick and tired of my neighborhood being the the war grounds that supplies dope to junkies and spoiled rich snots. Legalize the XXXX and take their business away.

When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to organs throughout the body, including the brain.\n \n In the brain, THC connects to specific sites called cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells and influences the activity of those cells. Some brain areas have many cannabinoid receptors; others have few or none. Many cannabinoid receptors are found in the parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thought, concentration, sensory and time perception, and coordinated movement(5).\n \n The short-term effects of marijuana can include problems with memory and learning; distorted perception; difficulty in thinking and problem solving; loss of coordination; and increased heart rate. Research findings for long-term marijuana use indicate some changes in the brain similar to those seen after long-term use of other major drugs of abuse. For example, cannabinoid (THC or synthetic forms of THC) withdrawal in chronically exposed animals leads to an increase in the activation of the stress-response system(6) and changes in the activity of nerve cells containing dopamine(7). Dopamine neurons are involved in the regulation of motivation and reward, and are directly or indirectly affected by all drugs of abuse.\n \n http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/marijuana.html\n \n \n \n \n Marijuana accumulates in the microscopic spaces between nerve cells in the brain called \"synapses.\" This clogging interferes by slowing and impairing transfer critical information.\n \n http://www.marijuanaaddiction.info/harmful-effects-of-marijuana.htm",

   "Well for anyone to say that beer is as addictive as Cocaine or heroin is ridiculous..That is the point I was trying to make.....\nHarder to become addicted to than heroin. Cocaine, as opposed to crack is not all that addictive. But alchoholics have a rate of under 20% for kicking the habit even with help from AA etc. So don't underestimate the dangers. Addiction is not a single scale of very to not, it has many parts\n \n # Withdrawal: Presence and severity of characteristic withdrawal symptoms.\n # Reinforcement: A measure of the substance's ability, in human and animal tests, to get users to take it again and again, and in preference to other substances.\n # Tolerance: How much of the substance is needed to satisfy increasing cravings for it, and the level of stable need that is eventually reached.\n # Dependence: How difficult it is for the user to quit, the relapse rate, the percentage of people who eventually become dependent, the rating users give their own need for the substance and the degree to which the substance will be used in the face of evidence that it causes harm.\n # Intoxication: Though not usually counted as a measure of addiction in itself, the level of intoxication is associated with addiction and increases the personal and socIal damage a substance may do.\n \n HENNINGFIELD RATINGS\n \n Substance Withdrawal Reinforce Tolerance Dependence Intoxic\n ----------- ---------- ----------- --------- --------- ---------\n Nicotine 3 4 2 1 5\n Heroin 2 2 1 2 2\n Cocaine 4 1 4 3 3 \n Alcohol 1 3 3 4 1\n Caffeine 5 6 5 5 6\n Marijuana 6 5 6 6 4\n \n \n BENOWITZ RATINGS\n \n Substance W R T D In\n ---\n Nicotine 3* 4 4 1 6\n Heroin 2 2 2 2 2\n Cocaine 3* 1 1 3 3\n Alcohol 1 3 4 4 1\n Caffeine 4 5 3 5 5\n Marijuana 5 6 5 6 4\n \n As you can see, Cocaine for example is very good at getting you to take it without having very bad withdrawal or actual dependence. Alcohol has the worst withdrawal, but low levels of addicts (reflected in the low dependence rate)\n \n OK the tables translate badly. Go to http://www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htm",

   "Obviously the problem is the government as usual, they can't make money if they leagalize pot cause everyone would grow their own that wanted it so they make money from locking people up and sending them to rehabs which are usually government owned or affiliated and make money that way. Everyone in this country is supposed to have have the right to pursue happiness what ever it is that makes them happy even if it puts them in an early grave but isn't that their bussiness. Maybe if cops weren't so worried about seat belts and pot smokers they could get some of these child molesters and murderers off of the street and them darn cop punching congress women. emoticon_xkill",
