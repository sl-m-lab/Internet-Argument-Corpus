It's possible that the original hebrew said satyrs, unicorns etc, but it seems unlikely to me given that they are generally features of Greek mythology and the israelites were more than a little... xenophobic shall we say.

   "Most disputes over translation concern relatively trivial points of doctrine, not the core Christian principles (though have a chat with the JWs to see why this is not totally the case). Given the range of translations of this group of passages, it surely makes the passages where there is broad agreement more likely to be accurate renderings. The disagreements are the signs of an active, questionning faith. I don't believe that God condemns those who find themselves in all conscience unable to believe, any more than he condemned \"doubting\" Thomas.\n \n The best suggestion I can offer is to pray about it, assuming you believe God exists, and trust the \"still small voice of calm\" on what the truth is.",
