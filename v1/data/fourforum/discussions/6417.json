   "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n .....\n \n We The People of the United States\n \n The following has been attributed to State Representative Mitchell Aye from GA. This guy should run for President one day...\n \n \"We the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and secure the blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt ridden, delusional, and other liberal bed-wetters. We hold these truths to be self evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim they require a Bill of NON-Rights.\"\n \n ARTICLE I: You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV, or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.\n \n ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc.; but the world is full of XXXXXX, and probably always will be.\n \n ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.\n \n ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes.\n \n ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public health care.\n \n ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair\n \n ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big screen color TV or a life of leisure.\n \n ARTICLE VIII: You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful.\n \n ARTICLE IX: You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness which, by the way, is alot easier if you are unencumbered by an over abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.\n \n ARTICLE X: This is an English speaking country. We don't care where you are from, English is our language. Learn it or go back to wherever you came from!\n \n (lastly....)\n \n ARTICLE XI: You do not have the right to change our country's history or heritage. This country was founded on the belief in one true God. And yet, you are given the freedom to believe in any religion, any faith, or no faith at all; with no fear of persecution. The phrase IN GOD WE TRUST is part of our heritage and history and if you are uncomfortable with it, TOUGH!!!!\n \n If you agree, share this with a friend. No, you don't have to, and nothing tragic will befall you if you don't. I just think it's about time common sense is allowed to flourish.\n \n Sensible people of the United States speak out because if you don't, insensible people will!",

There are a lot of Americans who think we can learn from other countries and cultures just like our Founding Fathers did. In the America I grew up in you were free to speak whatever language you wanted.

They used the same rhetoric against Bill Clinton's tax increase in 1993 which created the greatest economic boom in US history.\n \n \nThird, Kyoto is neither effective nor necessary. \n If cleaning up fossil fuel emissions is neither necessary nor effective, why has the US been doing it for over 30 years, and why has the air in our country improved as a result?\n \n \nAnd yes, the UN is nothing but a bunch of corrupt, useless thugs.\nI won't even comment on that.

The implication of that UN resolution was that Iraq could face force by the UN. If force was used it should have been lead by the UN or at least under their auspices.\n \n \n (and BTW, do you really think that Iraq was better off with Saddam Hussein in charge, or Afghanistan with the Taliban?

Can you say,\"food for oil?\" \n There is truth in that statement, but it has to be noted that the majority of the member nations of the UN were simply asking the US to let the inspectors finish their job (they were asking for 30 days).\n \n \nFourth, US forces found caches of WMD components hidden throughout Iraq. \n That is a sneaky statement.

I supported invading Afghanistan I think we should have gone in stronger and gotten Bin Laden. After 9/11, Bush had the entire country united behind him, including me. When he went into his dance of deception about Iraq, taking advantage of the fear everyone was feeling, he outraged my patriotic sensibilities. Saddam Hussein was no threat and everyone who bothers to look honestly at the subject knows it and many knew it before we invaded. I put to you one simple thought. Everyone asks why there is no exit policy. The reason is that we never planned to leave in the first place. We now control the second largest oil reserve in the world (Iraq) and the largest natural gas reserve in the world (Turkmenistan) which requires an 875 mile pipeline through Afghanistan for it to be accessible.

Has that ever sunk in yet?\n \n\n \n What are \"these taxes\"? Taxes on different types of activities have very different effects. Some are passed on to consumers, others are passed on to the workers and others are passed on to the owners. The competativity of the market as well as the union representation/negotiating power is also very important when trying to discern who eventually will pay for a certain tax... To claim that taxes will be payed by consumers, or the \"little guy\" is just speculation. And if the tax will be re-distributed to the little guy, it`s highly unlikely that the little guy will be a net-looser. \n \n \nLet me give you another example. Years ago the liberals decided to \"get the wealthy\" and place a 10% surcharge tax on yachts, so they could redistribute the money to the poor. So what happened? People cut way down on buying yachts. The yacht companies struggled and then had to lay off the little guy. So instead of your \"little guy\" getting the money, he got laid off. Marvelous. \n\n \n A consumer tax on a particular good will naturally decrease consumption of that good (as well as pass the cost to the consumer). Two effects come into play; the income effect and the substitution effect. The income effect is the effect of the actual distribution effort, taking resources from the yacht consumers and re-distibuting it to whatever end. The substitution effect is the effect of yachts becoming relativly more expensive to other goods. The would-have been yacht consumer uses his money for something else than buying a yacht, taking away resources from the yacht industry and funneling it to another industry (for example travel or construction industries).\n \n By just looking at the yacht industry, the tax seems like an awfull waste of resources. But if you look at the economy in large, it might not have been so bad (even though it is very plausible that it had overall-negative effects).\n \n \nRedistribution of wealth is socialism, and is a concept centered in greed for other people's money instead of working like you should for it.

   "The USA may be the richest but the best place to live is Norway, the place with the highest life expectancy is Japan. Both are places where capitalism has been influenced by the state. East Germany may have been vaguely socialist, but what it was mostly was a totalitarian dictatorship. Freedom is the issue, and that is distinct from socialism vs capitalism. Freedom is about having the resources and the opportunities to make choices. In a democratic socialist system people are more free. We saw the clear example of this in New Orleans. In New Orleans people died because of capitalism, because they did not have the freedom to leave the city, because they could not afford to leave work in order to leave the city, they could not afford any form of transport out of the city. In a democratic socialist system if you work then you earn enough to live on, and it works. You keep trying to avoid the examples that do work.\n \n In any case, the reason why the US has the most wealth is because it protects its markets and uses it power to force others to open theirs. It also does not pay the full economic costs of the natural resources it uses, and it gains a massive subsidy from the global dominance of the dollar, which is nothing to do with the market and everything to do with the way global financial systems were set up in the 1940s.

Otherwise a whole lot of businesses would fail.\n\n \n Naturally. It is also standard business practice to pass along as many costs to the workers as well. Yet, companies are not able to pay their workers peanuts and charge how much they want for the goods or services they are offering. Keyword in your description is \"competative\". Competition makes sure that companies cannot charge whatever they want. To be more technical, the price-elasticity determines how a company will maximize profits when faced with an increase in costs (like a tax).\n \n Needless to say, it is not always profitable to pass along every cost to the consumer or worker. Sometimes firms will have to decrease profit margins...\n \n \nAs for socialism working, America has long been the richest country in the world.

I would hazzard there are much better examples why market economy is more efficient than planned economy. West Germany was pumped with monetary support from the marshall pact. Together with a high savings quota this meant that West Germany was able to amass a huge capital stock, leading to very high economic growth (just like Japan). East Germany was however stripped of the meager industrial capacity it had left after WWII. Moscow demanded reperations for the war from the East German nation and people and bled the country dry. Nonetheless, the german industriousity prevailed and when the iron curtain finally fell, East Germany was still one of the most competative and materially affluent of former warsaw-pact nations.\n \n \n\n Capitalism means the complete separation of economy and state.

Sweden is a good example of socialism.

Governmental control of industry and labor to the point in which foreigners are forbidden from coming into Sweden and competing for things such as large construction jobs because that would displace local workers. \n\n \n Actually, no this does not take place. I think you are refering to the conflict between our contruction workers union (Byggnadsarbetar F\u00f6rbundet) and various latvian contruction companies (for example Laval). I could probably write a whole thread on just this subject, but the gist of the conflict is that our unions are constrained by law from going on strikes, enact blocades, etc.. as long as the collective bargain treaty is active. They are only allowed to take action when 1) The contract has expired (they are often issued for a few years) or 2) there has been a breach of contract from the employers side or 3) there is no collective bargaining treaty. Furthermore, Swedish unions are not allowed to compete by taking action as long as another Swedish union has signed a collective bargaining contract with the employer (called lex-Britanica).\n \n Laval and other latvian companies had collective bargaining treaties with a latvian union, making it a legal target for a blocade. And since the latvian companies payed much lower than the minimum wage outlined in the Swedish collective bargaining treaty regarding construction work, the labour union took action. The big question is wether EU-law permits such a legislation that protects other swedish unions from competition while not having the same protection for foreign labour unions, but that is another issue (and will probably be changed to allow competition between domestic labour unions as well).\n \n So, in fact, this is a case for economic freedom. Freedom to organise in unions and freedom to take action. If anything, the Swedish laws prohibits the labour unions from fullfilling their potential.\n \n \nSwedish consumers subsidize domestic manufacturing through higher costs of goods and services and an astonishing 31% of GDP is tax-financed consumption and capital spending. Another 24% of GDP is government transfer payments such as pensions, child care allocations, and other subsistances. Also an incredible 1/3 of the workforce is in the public sector.\n\n \n While I agree that there is some truth about subisidizing services due to substantial union control, goods are only subsidized when it comes to agricultural products due our EU-membership (prior to entering EU, Sweden had just gotten rid of tarrifs and subsidies on agricultural products). \n \n But yes, those figures are correct. If that makes us socialist by your definition, then fine, I guess I live in a socialist nation. I have no problems with this, even though I think we have liberalised our economy a bit to much the past ten years and our social democratic party has lost to much of it`s socialistic roots.\n \n \n\n Since joining the EU, Sweden has begun to see the effects of their high tax rates. Industry is beginning to relocate to greener pastures. I predict that within the next decade, Sweden won't be able to maintain its current level of public services and will have to cut tax rates to survive in the global economy.\n\n \n I think you`ll find that since joining the EU, the Swedish economy has been doing quite fine. \n \n Economic growth (measured in GDP) has far surpassed the EU average since the mid nineties. With an average growth of 2,6% compared to EU-15: 1,9%. US GDP growth in the same period was 2,8%.\n \n Aslo productivity growth has far surpassed the EU average. Even surpassed US average growth. Between 1995-2002: \n Swedish productivity grew by 2,1 anually \n EU average growth was 1,5 \n And US growth was 1,8.\n \n International competitiveness is among the best in the world according to the \n Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum. Sweden ranks in at number three, right behind the the US. The number one spot was claimed by the Finns. Another socialist country by your definition. In fact, all nordic countries, that per your definition certainly would be socialistic, ranked in the top ten.\n \n Unemployment is currently the most pressing issue in Sweden. With an unemployment of 6,5%, swedes are in uproar. But it is still far below the EU and OECD average. The labour force participation rate, 73% is very good (compared to US around 66% and EU around 63%), allthough it has dropped significantly since the 1980-ies when it was above 80% due to our financial crash and the tanking of the Krona.\n \n Swedish inflation is low, just like the rest of the OECD with some potential housing bubbles threatening the peace.\n \n Our governmental debt is under control (and has been shrinking the past 10 years) and our trade ballance is postive (we export more than we import).\n \n Rather interesting is also the Heritage Foundation (conservative think-tank) Economic Freedom Index, where the economic freedom (whatever that is supposed to mean...) of various countries are examined and compared. In the latest report (2005) Sweden ranks in at place 14. The USA has a tied 12-13 place with Switzerland... Denmark, another nordic socialistic country ranks in at place 8.

   "Actually, no this does not take place. I think you are refering to the conflict between our contruction workers union (Byggnadsarbetar F\u00f6rbundet) and various latvian contruction companies (for example Laval). I could probably write a whole thread on just this subject, but the gist of the conflict is that our unions are constrained by law from going on strikes, enact blocades, etc.. as long as the collective bargain treaty is active. They are only allowed to take action when 1) The contract has expired (they are often issued for a few years) or 2) there has been a breach of contract from the employers side or 3) there is no collective bargaining treaty. Furthermore, Swedish unions are not allowed to compete by taking action as long as another Swedish union has signed a collective bargaining contract with the employer (called lex-Britanica).\n \n Laval and other latvian companies had collective bargaining treaties with a latvian union, making it a legal target for a blocade. And since the latvian companies payed much lower than the minimum wage outlined in the Swedish collective bargaining treaty regarding construction work, the labour union took action. The big question is wether EU-law permits such a legislation that protects other swedish unions from competition while not having the same protection for foreign labour unions, but that is another issue (and will probably be changed to allow competition between domestic labour unions as well).\n\n You proved my point. By artificially fixing labor rates, you have passed the costs onto the consumer in the form of higher building costs. There is NO competition allowed, so wages are fixed at an artificially-regulated high level. Any external construction company wanting to export labor to Sweden has to artificially inflate its labor rates or be excluded from the market. That is the essence of socialism. Your government is artificiall protecting local labor at the expense of the consumer. \n \n\n So, in fact, this is a case for economic freedom. Freedom to organise in unions and freedom to take action. If anything, the Swedish laws prohibits the labour unions from fullfilling their potential.\n\n \n Whose economic freedom? This is purely a protectionist practice designed to eliminate real competition. This is the most controlled labor environment that there could possibly be. There is ZERO freedom in that. Again, the beneficiary of the control is Sweden's labor unions, NOT its citizens. You aren't FREE to pick who builds your facility. You're forced into accepting a Swedish union that pays maximum wages. Any chance to \"shop for a better deal\" is non-existent in Sweden. \n \n\n While I agree that there is some truth about subisidizing services due to substantial union control, goods are only subsidized when it comes to agricultural products due our EU-membership (prior to entering EU, Sweden had just gotten rid of tarrifs and subsidies on agricultural products). \n \n\n That's a start, I guess. \n \n\n But yes, those figures are correct. If that makes us socialist by your definition, then fine, I guess I live in a socialist nation. I have no problems with this, even though I think we have liberalised our economy a bit to much the past ten years and our social democratic party has lost to much of it`s socialistic roots.\n\n If you're comfortable with living in a socialist state, so be it. I'm not trying to argue that you shouldn't have the form of government that your country wants, I'm only arguing that it is, indeed, a socialist state.\n \n\n I think you`ll find that since joining the EU, the Swedish economy has been doing quite fine. \n \n Economic growth (measured in GDP) has far surpassed the EU average since the mid nineties. With an average growth of 2,6% compared to EU-15: 1,9%. US GDP growth in the same period was 2,8%.\n\n There are many reasons that Sweden's economy isn't doing badly. For one, it wasn't devastated by wars like the rest of Europe was. That was a huge cost for them that extended generations. You also have a low birthrate,a small population and very small military expenditures. All contribute greatly to economic health.\n \n\n Aslo productivity growth has far surpassed the EU average. Even surpassed US average growth. Between 1995-2002: \n Swedish productivity grew by 2,1 anually \n EU average growth was 1,5 \n And US growth was 1,8.\n \n\n When one uses % in their statistics, they have little meaning. Convert them into total $ or Euros and they begin to tell the story. For example, a country with a GDP of $1Trillion needs only to grow by $10 Billion in order to experience a 1% growth, nut a $16Trillion GDP has to increase by $160Billion in order to see that same 1% growth rate.\n BTW, the latest growth rates are Sweden 1.6%; US 2.9%\n \n\n International competitiveness is among the best in the world according to the \n Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum. Sweden ranks in at number three, right behind the the US. The number one spot was claimed by the Finns. Another socialist country by your definition. In fact, all nordic countries, that per your definition certainly would be socialistic, ranked in the top ten.\n\n I'm not surprised. Since your governments subsidize unemployment, health care, child care, etc., you should have an economic advantage over companies that pay their employees healthcare, etc., legacy costs, for example, add $1500 - 2000 to the cost of EVERY vehicle made in the US by GM. Also, the US corporate tax rate is one of the main reasons that it's ranking is as low as it is. You see, American politicians have found that its easier for them to tax the Hell out of faceless corporations than to take the heat by increasing personal income tax rates to levels such as Sweden's. If the government paid pensions, healthcare, etc., and had a tax rate structure like Sweden's, the US' rank would probably be #1 by a long shot.\n \n\n Unemployment is currently the most pressing issue in Sweden. With an unemployment of 6,5%, swedes are in uproar. But it is still far below the EU and OECD average. The labour force participation rate, 73% is very good (compared to US around 66% and EU around 63%), allthough it has dropped significantly since the 1980-ies when it was above 80% due to our financial crash and the tanking of the Krona.\n\n With a decreased birthrate and increased life expectancy, Sweden will be facing some very difficult times in the next 20 years. Currently, the immigration rate isn't the answer, from what I've read, because of the high unemployment of those immigrants. \n \n\n Swedish inflation is low, just like the rest of the OECD with some potential housing bubbles threatening the peace.\n \n Our governmental debt is under control (and has been shrinking the past 10 years) and our trade ballance is postive (we export more than we import).\n \n Rather interesting is also the Heritage Foundation (conservative think-tank) Economic Freedom Index, where the economic freedom (whatever that is supposed to mean...) of various countries are examined and compared. In the latest report (2005) Sweden ranks in at place 14. The USA has a tied 12-13 place with Switzerland... Denmark, another nordic socialistic country ranks in at place 8. Can a socialist country be more economicly free than a capitalistic country? And what does that tell you? ;)\n\n See above. Shifting the cost of the government from industry to workers gives companies in Sweden a big advantage. \n \n\n Here`s the links to the reports I refered to:\n \n World Economic Forum \n \n\n The US ranks #1 in Global Competitive Index and #2 behind Finland in most of the other indices. Sweden is #3-4. \n \n\n Heritage Foundation \n \n Click on the name of the country to get a country-report of that particular nation.\n\n \n Thanks for the links. I've seen some of the data before, but now I have the links saved in one place. emoticon_xgood",

Just like people are \"allowed\" to form companies, political parties or families... \n\n \n Protected as identified in the following:\n \n\n In its April 2003 World Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF devoted a chapter to arguing that high unemployment rates in some European countries are attributable to labor-market protections, such as generous unemployment benefits, powerful unions, and employment protection legislation.[2] According to the findings reported in this chapter, the euro-zone nations could reduce their unemployment rate by more than 3.0 percentage points, if European labor markets more closely resembled that of the United States.\n http://www.cepr.net/publications/IMF_unemployment.htm\n \n\n \n Here's what foreign investors say:\n \n\n Surveys conducted by investors in recent years ranking the investment climate in Sweden show rather uniform results: positives mentioned are competent employees, low corporate tax rates, excellent infrastructure and good access to capital. On the minus side are high cost of labor, rigid labor legislation and the overall high costs in Sweden.  http://www.state.gov/e/eb/ifd/2005/42128.htm\n \n\n Your high labor costs are due to the protectionist labor practices which drive the cost of goods and services up throughout your country.\n \n\n No-one is forcing anyone. It`s just more profitable to sign collective bargaining treaties since this will guarantee that the labour unions cannot go on strike until the treaty has expired. If you don`t, you are very welcome to go head to head with the unions. Just like an individual worker can demand whatever pay they want, they just need to be prepared to face the consequences (ie; finding no job).\n\n I found the following site contained a lot of good info on Sweden's labor laws and practices.\n http://www.sweden.se/templates/cs/FactSheet____11012.aspx?PageNr=8\n \n\n As for natural market forces determining the value of labour (labour costs) and higher prices for consumers, I think this is an interesting subject. But I fear that we would be getting to far off tangent if we where to dive into this. If you want to, we could start a new thread about labour unions, but as it is, I just want to point out that it is far from certain that centralised bargaining systems will lead to highe wages and prices (in fact, both economic theories and empirical evidence points towards the exact opposite relationship).\n\n If you decide to create the thread, let me know. I'm noover of unions, for sure. :xcensored :xcensored \n \n\n Yeah, I`ve come to understand that the term carries a certain stigmata in america. \n\n Mainly due to the fact that USSR was our biggest threat for 50 years.\n \n\n Yes, I agree. That is why I stated figures based on 10 year periods instead of yearly figures (apart from the unemployment figure, but that was to show that it was the most pressing challenge in Sweden today). \n \n Certainly. Anamolies and insignificant changes should be recognized when comparing countries. But I don`t think the Swedish economy is too small to draw assumptions and conclussions from its statistical indicators.\n\n When one looks at the size of a country's GDP, it has an inertia due to its size. The larger the GDP, the greater the inertia.\n \n\n Ah, my bad ;). But if they are regarding 2005, they are just guesses since 2005 have not passed yet. I would rather stick to OECD figures. They are at least estimates.\n \n Download the Quarterly Growth Rates of GDP at Constant Prices for OECD Countries \n \n\n Either way, the US economy is growing quite well by comparison.\n \n\n So what you are saying is that socialism makes the country more attractive for foreign investment and company operations? \n\n It is one of many factors.\n \n\n And how exactly are the workers and consumers paying for socialism? Through an income tax that is used for costless healthcare, childcare and education? An income tax that is used for re-distribution through housing grants, social security and unemployment insurance?\n\n Workers pay in terms of higher income tax rates than countries without such policies and consumers pay because the higher labor costs are included as higher prices for consumer goods. \n Here's a concrete example that I found written by a Swedish writer. \n \n\n To cite an example, the caddish CAP and subsidies for domestic production make it profitable for Swedish companies to make sugar from sugar beets. The lump in the Swedish coffee cup then costs more than twice as much as the sweetener squeezed out of sugar cane. But we dump it abroad for only a quarter of the real cost.\n http://www.cato.org/dailys/09-04-03-2.html\n \n\n So, you see, you are subsidizing inefficient agriculture that is sold domestically for a high price, but dumped abroad. emoticon_wow \n \n \n\n Err.. no. It sounds like you`ve been reading to much of Missouri Mules crased ramblings ;)\n\n Not at all.\n \n\n So in essance, socialistic countries are more effective in attracting foreign investment and encouraging capital accumulation used for production? That sounds like the basis of a healthy and vibrant economy to me.\n\n ctually, the US attracts far more capital than Sweden by any measure that you chose, %, total $, etc.\n \n\n Sweden was even richer compared to other nations before we started this whole economic liberalisation thing. Nationalisation (as in governmental interference with the market) waxes and vanes depending on the political climate. Still, the nordic modell endures and shows that socialism is indeed viable in the 21:th century.\n\n \n State ownership is waning from what I've read, so you're becoming more capitalistic. Congratulations. :)",

It also stated that \n \n \n\n Given the ambiguous results of the research in this area, it should not be surprising that many countries in the OECD have achieved low unemployment rates while maintaining strong labor-market protections, at least relative to the US standard. These alternative success stories include Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. All of these countries have high rates of unionization, and relatively generous unemployment benefits, yet enjoy unemployment rates well below the OECD average. The example of these countries should caution those who argue that weakening labor market protections is the only way to reduce unemployment.\n \n Finally, it is worth noting that the most consistent and robust result of the full body of research on labor-market institutions and unemployment -one confirmed again by the IMF's WEO findings- is that bargaining coordination is associated with lower unemployment. The IMF (along with others active in this debate, most notably, the OECD) has consistently chosen to downplay this finding. This is decision is striking since increasing bargaining coordination poses no obvious trade-off on distributional or efficiency grounds. A government that was attempting to act based on the evidence presented in the WEO chapter may find the promotion of greater bargaining coordination a compelling route to explore. \n\n \n [QUOTE=JPSartre12Here's what foreign investors say:\n \n Surveys conducted by investors in recent years ranking the investment climate in Sweden show rather uniform results: positives mentioned are competent employees, low corporate tax rates, excellent infrastructure and good access to capital. On the minus side are high cost of labor, rigid labor legislation and the overall high costs in Sweden.

The text said that labour is costly in Sweden (compared to what?) and that overall costs where high. Nothing more. \n \n Not that it was caused by of protektionist practices. Protectionism would have kept foreign goods out of Sweden. Protectionism would have discriminated against foreign labour by imposing different rules and regulations on foreign workers. This is not the reason for high labour costs in Sweden and nowhere in the text did the author make that kind of claim.\n \n \n \n [QUOTE= I found the following site contained a lot of good info on Sweden's labor laws and practices.\nhttp://www.sweden.se/templates/cs/FactSheet____11012.aspx?PageNr=8\n [/QUOTE]\n \n Yeah, that was rather interesting. And it shows that our labour laws are stringent. This might very well be one of the major reasons for high labour costs in Sweden (coupled with high taxes). \n \n \n If you decide to create the thread, let me know. I'm noover of unions, for sure. :xcensored :xcensored \n \n\n \n I will J\n \n \n When one looks at the size of a country's GDP, it has an inertia due to its size. The larger the GDP, the greater the inertia.\n \n\n \n I`ve never heard that GDP would be suffering from inertia (but rather the opposite due to economies of scale and political and economic clout/impact)... I know there is a catching up effect. But this has to do with GDP/capita rather than GDP and it is not certain that there is such an effect when it comes to comparing matured economies like Sweden and the US.\n \n \n Either way, the US economy is growing quite well by comparison.\n \n\n \n Sure is. I wouldn`t claim otherwise. My point is just that socialism, as in the nordic wellfare model has far from failed. It is in fact a very serious rival of both the (continental-) european wellfare state modell and the US laise-faire modell.\n \n \n Workers pay in terms of higher income tax rates than countries without such policies and consumers pay because the higher labor costs are included as higher prices for consumer goods. \n\n \n But surely these effects ballance eachother. Workers also receive higher wages (hence the higher labour costs). Consumers also receive higher transfer and more services (hence the higher tax rate). It`s really a zero-sum game (granted there are inefficiencies, but there are also external benefits).\n \n \n \n Here's a concrete example that I found written by a Swedish writer. \n \n So, you see, you are subsidizing inefficient agriculture that is sold domestically for a high price, but dumped abroad. emoticon_wow \n \n\n \n Yeah, that`s CAP for you. As I said prior, this stupidity was enacted due to our EU membership. But the CAP is not really typical for the Swedish economy (it`s an anamoly). Nor is it politicly a socialistic idea, but rather a conservative and nationalistic ploy. Sort of like US retaining control of the oil industries (that you previously stated your aproval off). Europe is supposed to be self-sufficient when it comes to feeding our population in a time of crisis or war. Too bad we are not self-sufficient on anything else... \n \n \n ctually, the US attracts far more capital than Sweden by any measure that you chose, %, total $, etc.\n \n\n \n Yeah, but it would perhaps attract even more if it became nmore socialistic? This is what I`m reading from your previous statements (I don`t think that it would...)\n \n \nState ownership is waning from what I've read, so you're becoming more capitalistic. Congratulations. :)\n\n \n Too bad we are relativly worse off than before we started this madness off selling out ;)",
