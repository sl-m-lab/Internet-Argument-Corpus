   "Is revolution a high probability in Azerbaijan and what would it have to do with Europe? The latest experience shows that all the so called colored revolutions were happening at the background of elections. The elections to Azeri parliament are to take place in November. The rest part of work is matter of smooth and well tested technique for American spin-doctors and their local aids. Then keep it in mind that Azerbaijan is GUUAM member-state. GUUAM in its turn was meant as vital route for Caspian crude destined for Europe. Well can USA leave this route functioning freely out of their control? In no case they can. So for some time the country may stay destabilized to teach Europe the lesson. Europe is dependent on USA in what relates to energy supplies and she must be well on the message (revolution will threaten the BTC project to entail rise in oil prices, which is no good for European economy). Are our politicians loosing energy fighting to America in the Caspian sea?",
