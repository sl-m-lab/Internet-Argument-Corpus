It's know as a \"solemnization' ceremony (or civil ceremony), and can be done instead of using a clergyperson. \n \n Here is the process, pasted from a law website about the state of Minnesota (note, this is the process by which the license is solemnized, which has to be done before the state considers it valid):\n \n - After obtaining the License to marry the person may go to the persons authorized to solemnize the marriage ceremony. \n - They may examine the parties on oath, before solemnizing a marriage. \n - Marriage is solemnized in presence of a person authorized to solemnize marriages and two attending witnesses who shall be at least 16 years of age. \n - The marriage is considered as solemnized when the parties declare that they take each other as husband and wife in presence of two witnesses and authorized person for solemnizing the marriage. \n -The person solemnizing a marriage shall prepare and sign three certificates thereof. \n - Each certificate shall contain the full names before and after marriage and county and state of residences of the parties and the date and place of the marriage. \n - Each certificate shall also contain the signatures of at least two of the witnesses present at the marriage. \n - The person solemnizing the marriage shall give each of the parties one such certificate, and shall immediately make a record of such marriage. \n - The person solemnizing marriage shall file one such certificate with the court administrator of the district court of the county in which the license was issued within five days after the ceremony.\n \n (http://www.helplinelaw.com/law/usa-minnesota/marriage/marriage.php)\n \n - Solemnization Authority: Marriages may be solemnized by any of the following: The officials authorized to solemnize marriages include judges, clerks of court, and licensed ministers, priests or rabbis. In some counties there is a court commissioner who is authorized to officiate at marriage ceremonies. There are also special provisions for marriage between members of the Bahai, Hindu, Quaker and American Indian religious groups. \n \n (http://usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_states/minnesota/index.shtml)\n \n (Emphasis is mine)\n \n In some states there are even waiting periods. But it IS true that the process varies among states. Nevetheless, the idea is that the state grants benefits because the couple has married (\"declare that they take each other as husband and wife in presence of two witnesses and authorized person\", OR get married before a clergyperson instead), rather than the benefits THEMSELVES are the marriage, as you seem to be implying. There is no such thing as \"civil marriage versus religious marriage\"--there is just marriage, the govt. recognizes it, and gives benefits for it.\n \n There's no way around it: if we applied the 14th Amendment to argue marriage benefits for everyone, the everyone would have to get them, married or not. If someone wanted to stay single, they would either have to lie or not get the benefits.\n \n \nLike I said, if changing the term \"marriage\" to something else is a good idea, then let's do it, but single people have the same access to these benefits.\n\n \n Only if they get married.

He is a lying hypocrite. Would you get me banned if I proved you had lied? \n \n \n \n I find it hard to believe that a moderator would ban me for proving my argument with factual evidence. If I can prove that his arguments have been refuted, that he saw such evidence yet continues to say the same arguments, he is lying and my claim is very much true. \n \n Simply because it's not nice to say someone is a liar does not clear them of such behavior.\n\n \n A LIAR implies knowledge of saying something that the person knows is false...for all you know VOR still believes in things he said.

But it still sounds there like the exact scenario I described is a completely valid way of getting married in Minnesota, except that you need two witnesses.\n \n I'm not quite certain if I have your argument right here, but are you saying that clergy would be forced to marry same-sex couples if they want to continue having the right to marry people under the law? Certainly they wouldn't be...\n \n \nThere's no way around it: if we applied the 14th Amendment to argue marriage benefits for everyone, the everyone would have to get them, married or not. If someone wanted to stay single, they would either have to lie or not get the benefits.\n\n \n Remember that the 14th Amendment mandates equal treatment, not equal benefits. By allowing people of all sexual orientations the opportunity to recieve the benefits of marriage, we are granting equal treatment to people of all sexual orientations. I would certainly argue that, if possible, we should give the benefits of marriage to single people, except for the following: marriage is designed to handle additional needs created by being a member of a family. Because a family has additional needs, they are considered treated equally if their needs are better compensated. I would never say that a family simply deserves more than a single person, I'd say that a family has greater need and therefore needs greater benefits. Furthermore, the benefits of marriage, when one thinks about it, actually do apply to a single person. A single person can claim himself and his children on his taxes. A single person can extend his medical insurance to his children. A single person can get food stamps depending on the size of his family, and a single person has access to his own intellectual property rights. In a marriage, two people agree to become part of the same family, to share those benefits with one another. There simply is no logical way to apply those benefits to a single person.\n \n \nOnly if they get married. The 14th Amendment doesn't require that for criteria when it comes to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Or maybe govt. benefits (whether they be marriage, disability, social security, etc) over and above a life of freedom aren't what the 14th Amendment is about. That's my opinion, anyway.\n\n \n Well, the 14th Amendment states \"equal treatment under the law\", and it may indeed be referring to equal freedom and equal life. And that is precisely why it applies to same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is very much an issue of freedom, it involves an individual's ability create his own family and have the benefits associated with that family. It is about an individual being allowed to live his own life without having to fear punishment from the government. It is about freedom in the most fundamental sense: it is about freedom from the tyranny of the majority, the freedom to live your life without your neighbors running you out of town, or in this case, without facing less benefits from the government.\n \n I just wish more people would treat others as they would treat themselves, is all, and I think that was the intent behind the 14th Amendment. Too many people insist that others have to be treated differently, that somehow, they just don't qualify for the same treatment. Well I don't buy it.",
