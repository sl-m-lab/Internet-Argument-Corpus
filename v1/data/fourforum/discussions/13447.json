   "Seems to be a lot of controversy over Rush Limbaugh and others coming together to purpose the St Louis Rams. The NFL has to approve all owners and Rush would be a minority owner. He has always been an NFL fan.\n \n Frankly I think it is a little ridiculous and yet another example of a \"smear\" job like we've discussed in other threads. In the end the NFL can do whatever they want and I could care less. Then again I'm biased because I'm a college football fan :)",

And that very reality underscores some of the problem.\n \n Rush's Response: Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) Grills Goodell on Rush\n\n \n \n Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, had this to say when questioning Goodell:\n \n However, as I listened to the members of this committee discuss this and we've covered a lot of the territory, I note that Sheila Jackson Lee said that she is concerned that owners need the right image, and her opposition to who might be buying the St. Louis Rams, her reason for that is owners that might not have the right image. Now, she wasn't any more specific than that, but we know who she's talking about, and that's Rush Limbaugh. But I would ask Commissioner Goodell this question. Your position on owners have the right image, and I would direct it to your statement on the 13th of October where you said, 'I think it's divisive comments, or they are not what the NFL is all about. I would not want to see those kinds of comments from people who are in responsible positions within the NFL, no, absolutely not.' Now, I take you as a man of your word. But I would point out that you have a couple of owners that have performed lyrics in songs that are far more offensive. In fact, I don't think anything that Rush Limbaugh said was offensive, but with Fergie and with J. Lo, they have, between the two of them, alleged that the CIA are terrorists and liars, they've promoted sexual abuse of women, they've used the N-word, verbal pornography, recreational drug use, et cetera, and they are owners of the Dolphins.....And it is also ironic that Fergie was approved as an owner on the very day that you made your statement against Rush Limbaugh....And so if you're concerned about this, Mr. Goodell, then I'd ask you, you know, are you prepared to level the same charges against Fergie and J. Lo, or are you prepared to apologize to Rush Limbaugh today?\"\n \n \n Goodell avoided directly responding to this and could not explain why J-Lo and Fergie got \"special treatment.\"\n \n Which is why Rush called Goodell a weasel, saying, \"He didn't answer the question.\"",
