   "There Is One Gospel/Four Gospels In The New Testament\n \n \"Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.\" Matt. 4:23.\n \n \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\" Matt. 24:14.\n \n \"But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.\" Acts 20:24.\n \n \"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26a.\n \n \"I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is {really} not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.\" Gal. 1:6+7.\n \n \"And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.\" Rev. 14:6.\n \n Scripture mentions four distinct and separate good news messages in your New Testament. They are divided like this:\n \n 1. Gospel of the Kingdom (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12). Precepts include repentance, John's water baptism (Mark 1:4, Acts 13:24, 19:3), baptism of the Son (Matt. 28:19, Acts 8:12, 16, 19:5) and baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17, 19:6). These Kingdom Disciples were to keep all that Christ had commanded (Matt. 28:19+20) which included all of Mosaic Law (Matt. 5:17+18, James 2:10). These members of the Kingdom received the 'gift of the Holy Spirit' (Acts 2:38) and the sign gifts (Acts 2:3+4, 19:6). This good news message is according to Prophecy (Isaiah 40:3, Malachi 3:1, Matt. 3:3).\n \n 2. Gospel of the Grace of God (Acts 20:24), also known through Paul as \"my gospel\" (Rom. 2:16, 16:25, 2Tim. 2:8). Precepts include hearing (Rom. 10:17) and believing the message concerning Christ's death, burial and resurrection from the dead (1Cor. 15:1-5), the blood of Christ for our redemption (Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20), our baptism into His body by the Holy Spirit (Eph. 1:13+14, Romans 6:3+4, Gal. 3:26-28). Instead of receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit and sign gifts, we receive only an 'earnest of our inheritance.' Eph. 1:13+14. This good news message is according to the 'revelation of the mystery' (Rom. 16:25) given to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12), and the 'wisdom given him.' 2Pet. 3:14-16 (15). Our gospel is veiled to those who are perishing. 2Cor. 4:3+4 (See 2Thes. 2:7-12).\n \n 3. A different/another gospel. \"For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear {this} beautifully.\" 2Cor. 11:4. The precepts of the different gospel contain false precepts of every sort. Any false good news message is a different gospel from the one that Paul describes throughout his thirteen Gentile Epistles. The most common counterfeit to Paul's gospel is the message of Christ with the addition of repentance and water baptism. Satan has taken the precepts of #1 and #2 above and combined them into a heavenly way to send men straight to hell. Obedience to a false gospel message spells doom for those deceived by this form of wickedness. Read the words of 2Thes. 2:7-12 very carefully and note the effects of the 'deluding influence' of verse 10.\n \n 4. Everlasting Gospel. \"And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.\" Rev. 14:6. In the future of this planet and beyond, there shall be an eternal good news message for the obedience of all. The precepts of this eternal way of redemption are not made known through Scripture.\n \n The only two good news messages to see sins forgiven in the entire Bible to date are the Gospel of the Kingdom (#1) and the Gospel of the Grace of God (#2). The 'another gospel' (#3) represents all false good news messages. The Eternal Gospel (#4) of Revelation 14 is still future. \n \n Those among you who have received John's Water Baptism for the forgiveness of sins, in an attempt to be reconciled back to God, have added a work to Paul's Gospel. Scripture says, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\" Eph. 2:8-10. The 'one baptism' of Eph. 4:5 is the one performed by the Holy Spirit (1Cor. 12:12-14) the moment you believe the gospel. Eph. 1:13+14 (Rom. 6:3+4, Gal. 3:27). \n \n Many among the denominations teach a 'believer's baptism' that is performed by human hands after one believes the gospel. Scripture teaches NO SUCH THING. If the 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) is performed by the Holy Spirit (1Cor. 12:13) then any water ritual becomes a second baptism by men. Again, Paul clearly teaches the 'one baptism' as being by the SPIRIT. The addition of this 'washing with water' work precept to 'our gospel' defiles the simplicity of the cross. As it is written, \"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.\" 1Cor. 1:17. \n \n The Apostle Paul is seen baptizing people in the New Testament, because he preached both the Gospel of the Kingdom (#1) and Paul's Gospel (#2). This one aspect of the truth is responsible for much of the false teaching among the denominations today. And for that reason many 'professing' Christians are living day to day with the delusion that they are indeed saved. There are well over two thousand denominations of professing Christians on this planet, because they have accepted different versions of the same lie (#3). Scripture speaks of 'the' truth, because there is only one of them. If those from among the denominations believed 'the' truth \"so as to be saved\", then there would be just one denomination. \n \n The only gospel message in your Bible that has power today is Paul's Gospel (#2). The Gospel of the Kingdom was rejected by Israel three times (John's death, death of Christ, death of James/Steven). This marked Israel's rejection of the Gospel of the Kingdom from the Father (through John), the Son (through Christ), and the Holy Spirit (death of disciples). Paul totally turned his back on Israel and their good news of the kingdom in Acts 28:28 (61 Ad.). At the death of the last remaining Kingdom Disciple, the dispensation of the kingdom became dormant. God placed that aspect of His plan on the back burner, so that the members of the Body of Christ could be gathered through Paul's Gospel.\n \n To apply this information to our seeming contradiction: There are four distinct gospel messages described in our New Testament. However, only the 'gospel of the grace of God' (#2) has power today. When we are taken out of the way at the rapture (1Thes. 4:13-17), then Elijah shall return to Israel to set up the Messianic Kingdom (restore all things; Matt. 17:11, Acts 15:16). At that time Paul's gospel will have no power at all, and the Gospel of the Kingdom (#1) shall become the good news for that Kingdom Administration. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Greetings Maximus and All:\n \n Since Maximus failed to place a single word of my post in his reply, then every word I posted continues to stand. Simply cutting and pasting Scripture as a reply is not an answer to anything. After all, everyone interprets Scripture differently. It is your commentary on Scripture that either stands or falls, and that depends on how well your argument is constructed, presented and supported by God's Word. \n \n I must assume that you are trying to make a point about water baptism, since Noah , the ark and spirits in prison are not mentioned in my post. \n \n Maximus quotes << 1 Peter 3:18-21 \"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit; in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison, who formerly did not obey . . . \n \n Terral's reply << Yes, Christ died for sins once for all. Of course, that is no sign at all that everyone is redeemed to God. That simply means that everyone shall be raised unto judgment. Then, those who enter the flames shall wish they did not have their eternal bodies. How long do the condemned reside in the lake of fire? \"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\" Rev. 20:10. The only reason that anyone can remain in the lake of fire for ever and ever is because Christ \"died for sins once for all, the righteous and unrighteous . . .\" Therefore, the same operation of God that gives us eternal life also gives the enemies of God eternal damnation. \n \n Maximus continues to quote Peter << when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that i, eight persons, were saved through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you...\"\n \n Terral's reply << This aspect of your reply is answered in the original post. I suggest you cut and paste those points into your next reply, as that is the only way you shall defeat them. I agree with you that water baptism saved someone in the New Testament. That is how John the Baptist started offering the 'gospel of the kingdom' to Israel. \"John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.\" Mark 1:4. Christ commanded that the Disciples preach the gospel and water baptize everyone! \n \n \"And He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.'\" Mark 16:15 +16.\n \n This good news message is described throughout the NT as the 'gospel of the kingdom.' As it is written, \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\" Matt. 24:14. That is the good news message that Peter would continue to preach his entire life. However, that is NOT the gospel that was revealed to Paul by our Risen Lord. See Gal. 1:11+12 (1Cor. 15:1-5). Simply compare this gospel 'to the circumcised' (Gal. 2:7) to the 'gospel to the uncircumcised (Gal. 2:7). Peter's gospel (presented in Acts 2:36-38) is based upon water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Compare the words of Mark 1:4 and Acts 2:38. That's right; John the Baptist and Peter preach the very same precepts of repentance and water baptism. \n \n Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25) is based upon Christ's death, burial, resurrection and our active participation in His work of redemption at Calvary. Our redemption is NOT about repentance and water baptism. We are sealed in Him by the Holy Spirit the moment we believe Paul's Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. We ARE NOT baptized into any body of water, but into the body of Christ (Rom. 6:3+4) on the cross at Calvary. Our redemption is in His blood. Eph. 1:7. \n \n Peter's water baptism did save the Kingdom Disciples from their sins. Note that Christ sent Peter and the others out to preach the gospel of the kingdom in Matthew 10:5-7. Did He send out unsaved to gather the unsaved? Of course not. Peter and the other disciples had their sins forgiven. However, this had nothing at all to do with Calvary, as Christ had yet to die for anyone! \n \n The words you quote from Peter above are directed to Kingdom Disciples in the coming Kingdom Dispensation, and NOT to Gentiles. You will note that Paul says specifically, \"But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry.\" Rom. 11:13. Peter and the other Kingdom writers never address the Gentiles in the first person, even once. \n \n You have taken the Scriptural reference above out of context in an attempt at justifying a second baptism for people today. Paul clearly states that there is \"one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) for us today. That one baptism is performed by the Holy Spirit the moment we hear (Rom. 10:17) and believe (Eph. 1:13+14) the message of truth. 1Cor. 12:13. \n \n If you really and truly believe that Paul's 'one baptism' is described in 1Peter 3:18-21, then take this opportunity to prove it. Because Paul's one baptism is definitely SPIRITUAL, and not performed with human hands. You cannot tie the work of water baptism to Paul's gospel at all, because we are saved by God's grace through faith 'NOT BY WORKS' (Eph. 2:8+9). \n \n I provided you with two examples that clearly demonstrate that people walked around for decades with only the Baptism of John (Acts 19:1-6). They did not even know there was a Holy Spirit. How do you reconcile that with Paul's words in Eph. 1:13+14? We receive the Holy Spirit of Promise the moment we believe, and we are sealed 'in Him.' Peter is describing a totally different operation to Kingdom Disciples, than Paul is describing to members of the body of Christ today. The Kingdom Epistles are directions to Kingdom disciples, while the Pauline Epistles contain instructions to the members of the body of Christ. Paul is addressing the body of Christ, while Peter is addressing members of the Kingdom Dispensation. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Terral,\n \nSince Maximus failed to place a single word of my post in his reply, then every word I posted continues to stand. Simply cutting and pasting Scripture as a reply is not an answer to anything. After all, everyone interprets Scripture differently. It is your commentary on Scripture that either stands or falls, and that depends on how well your argument is constructed, presented and supported by God's Word. \n \n I thought my intention was obvious when reading the scripture I supplied. Water baptism was commanded and exemplified by Jesus and carried on by the Apostles. Water baptism is a spiritual benefit (actually a necessity with a few exceptions) and a sacrament which conveys grace. I am also not sure what excludes the Holy Spirit from being present in a baptism by water.\n \n Furthermore, the \"gospel of Paul\" is the Gospel of Jesus and the same gospel of all the Apostles. The Gospel of Jesus is comprehensive and complementary. I agree with you that there are many rich and deep layers of the gospels...many meanings. But when one accepts \"Paul's gospel\" he does not delete \"Peter's gospel.\" \n \n So when you say that our redemption is not about water baptism and repentance you are wrong. When you say that our redemption is about receiving the grace and sacrifice of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit you are right. One does not contradict the other. Both are important. \n \n \nPeter's gospel (presented in Acts 2:36-38) is based upon water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Compare the words of Mark 1:4 and Acts 2:38. That's right; John the Baptist and Peter preach the very same precepts of repentance and water baptism. \n \n \n \nPeter's water baptism did save the Kingdom Disciples from their sins.

However, this had nothing at all to do with Calvary, as Christ had yet to die for anyone! \n \n The water baptisms that are spoken of in Acts did occur after Jesus' death (Acts 2:41, Acts 8:38, Acts 9:18). What do you think the value of those baptisms were?\n \n \nThe words you quote from Peter above are directed to Kingdom Disciples in the coming Kingdom Dispensation, and NOT to Gentiles. You will note that Paul says specifically, \"But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry.\" Rom. 11:13. Peter and the other Kingdom writers never address the Gentiles in the first person, even once. \n \n I don't really know what \"Kingdom Disciples\" are. I'm not sure what the \"Kingdom Dispensation\" is. But I do know that the Eunuch baptized with water in Acts 8:38  was an ethiopan, a \"gentile.\" And in Acts 10  Peter water baptizes Gentiles after they have received the Holy Spirit.\n \n I think also that both Peter and Paul and other apostles preached the gospel to the Gentiles. I think that's what Peter means in Acts 15: 7 when he says that he has been chosen as the conveyor of the gospel to the Gentiles. \n \n \nPaul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25) is based upon Christ's death, burial, resurrection and our active participation in His work of redemption at Calvary. Our redemption is NOT about repentance and water baptism. We are sealed in Him by the Holy Spirit the moment we believe Paul's Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. We ARE NOT baptized into any body of water, but into the body of Christ (Rom. 6:3+4) on the cross at Calvary. Our redemption is in His blood. Eph. 1:7. \n \n I think that \"all gospels\" in scripture are based upon Christ's death, burial, resurrection and our active participation in his work of redemption at Calvary. This includes repentance. I do agree that we are not baptized into any body of water, we are baptized into the Body of Christ through water, as Christ, himself, commanded. Paul knew repentance was necessary: 2 Corinthians 7:10, 2 Corinthians 12:21, 2 Timothy 2:25 \n \n \nIf you really and truly believe that Paul's 'one baptism' is described in 1Peter 3:18-21, then take this opportunity to prove it. Because Paul's one baptism is definitely SPIRITUAL, and not performed with human hands. You cannot tie the work of water baptism to Paul's gospel at all, because we are saved by God's grace through faith 'NOT BY WORKS' (Eph. 2:8+9). \n \n \n \nYou have taken the Scriptural reference above out of context in an attempt at justifying a second baptism for people today.

Had he heard and believed?\n \n Furthermore, Paul's epistles do not exclude works (many times the works Paul speaks of are the works of the Old Mosaic Law--not Christian works). We are saved by faith and works. Grace is a free gift from God that comes first but then we must work. \n \n Peace.",

   "Terral,\n \nChrist also told Israel to keep the whole Law. Matt. 5:17-19. Do you also believe that applied to us today?

James also says, \"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all.\" James 2:10. Do you really believe that Christ and James are speaking to members of the body of Christ today?\n\n Christ said that he came to fulfill the Law, not to abolish it. He fulfilled it and made us not simply worship by empty works but to worship by true works in purity of heart. Nothing of the Law went away. It was simply transformed in the light of Christ to take on its true, full meaning. So all that is said in scripture is therefore consistent.\n \n \nPaul writes 'to' us, \"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.\" Romans 6:14. And also, \"For when Gentiles WHO DO NOT HAVE THE LAW do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves.\" Romans 2:14.\n\n Amen. One is not under the old Mosaic Law but the Law of Christ--founded on grace.\n \n \nWater Baptism is a spiritual benefit? Where did that come from? Please describe these exceptions. John's Baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. Mark 1:4. Peter's water baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. Acts 2:38. Today, our redemption is through Christ's blood. Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20. Please find us one example to support your spiritual benefit language above, and the exceptions.\n\n God bound the sacraments as necessities but he is not bound by them--for he is God, not restricted by anything. He can save without the sacraments but the most efficacious way in salvation is through the sacraments which he instituted. So a man can have a baptism of desire--meaning he has accepted Jesus in faith but has no chance for a Christian baptism--he can still be saved. A man can have a baptism of blood--death for his fellow man or for the faith in a last minute submission--he can still be saved.\n \n Our redemption is through Christ's blood and the gate by which we enter is baptism--the gate which he constructed. You must tell me why Paul and the Gentiles were water baptized if it has no benefit. Water baptism does not minimize the sacrifice of Christ.\n \n \nNo sacrament conveys anything to anyone, at least, not according to your Bible. Grace is mercy that we do not deserve. \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God;Eph 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9.\n\n \n \nPaul explains, \"Rom 5:1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.\" Romans 5:1+2. Conveyance of grace through a sacrament? Please support that statement using Scripture.\n\n First, let me clarify that I do not believe that all points of Christian doctrine need to be specifically spelled out in the Bible. Your requests to support my statements with scripture will be attended to diligently, however. \n \n There is nothing in Catholic doctrine contrary to scripture. Many Catholic teachings are implicit in scripture, if not explicit. Furthermore, one must consider the Bible, Holy Tradition, and the teaching authority of the Church in unison--not solely the Bible.\n \n Regarding the conveyance of grace through the sacrament of baptism one need only to read Acts 22:16 , Romans 6:4, and 1 Peter 3:21.\n \n \nYour task is not to prove that someone was saved by water baptism. We both agree on that point. You are trying to show that water baptism is the 'one baptism' of Ephesians 4:5.

Water? or Spirit?\n\n It is not Water or  the Spirit it is both Water and  the Spirit. I do not believe that Paul was attempting to single out baptism by water versus baptism by the Spirit. I think he is stating that there is one baptism--one in Jesus Christ and under no other name by which men are to be saved--one baptism, one faith--unified--no sects or denominations. What does Peter say in Acts 2:37-38? \"Repent, be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\"\n \n Peace.",

Again, Paul writes to the Galatians, \"It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but {I did so} in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.\" Gal. 2:2. \n \n 1. If Peter and Paul have been preaching the same gospel message for the past twenty years, then why is Paul going down to present Peter anything? \n \n 2. Your opinion is that Paul and these 'pillars' (Peter, John, James) preached the same gospel. So, why is Paul going down in fear of failure?\n \n Maximus << The Gospel of Jesus is comprehensive and complementary. I agree with you that there are many rich and deep layers of the gospels...many meanings. But when one accepts \"Paul's gospel\" he does not delete \"Peter's gospel.\"\n \n Terral's reply << Here is your problem. Peter's Gospel includes the precepts of repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38. Their justification is by \"works and not by faith alone.\" (James 2:20). Paul's Gospel includes the precepts of hearing (Rom. 10:17) and believing (Eph. 1:13+14) the message of truth concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Christ (1Cor. 15:1-5). Our redemption is through His blood. Eph. 1:7. \n \n Simply saying that those two messages are the same does not make it so. The first is by water, and the second is by blood. See 1John 5:6 which says that Christ came in BOTH! The first includes the work of water baptism (John's Baptism), the second does not. Paul's Gospel must be accepted by faith apart from works. Rom. 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9. Adding the work of water baptism to the message of truth defiles the simplicity of the cross. 1Cor. 1:17.\n \n Maximus << So when you say that our redemption is not about water baptism and repentance you are wrong. \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. What you are saying is that Paul is wrong. When did water baptism cease to be a work done by human hands? The 'one baptism' of Eph. 4:5 is Spiritual, just like all the other 'ones' in that passage. Paul describes our one baptism in 1Cor. 12:12-14 (13) as the one performed by the Holy Spirit, as we are placed into His Body. You have taken a precept of the gospel of the kingdom (washing in water) and placed it among the precepts of the gospel of the grace of God. In doing so, you have created a different gospel (2Cor. 11:4) from the one that Paul preaches throughout his Gentile Epistles. \n \n Maximus << When you say that our redemption is about receiving the grace and sacrifice of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit you are right. One does not contradict the other. Both are important. \n \n Terral's reply << Our redemption is through the blood of Christ. Eph. 1:7. The sins of the Kingdom Disciples were forgiven through repentance and water baptism. Acts 2:38. Those two methods of forgiving sins contradict one another. Even after the crucifixion, Peter continued to preach repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Acts 2:38. The fact that we would have sins forgiven through Christ's blood, and a 'good news' message, was not made known to anyone until revealed to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12) after Acts 9. Paul went down to submit our gospel to Peter, John and James in fear of failure, because none of them knew anything about it. \n \n The 'fear' aspect of Paul's testimony has its base in the subject of 'circumcision.' Note Paul's words just after he speaks of this fear. \"But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.\" Gal. 2:3. These 'false brethren' were seeking to place the members of the body of Christ in bondage by adding the work of circumcision. After all, Peter, John and James preached that anyone joining the Kingdom must be circumcised in order to keep the Law. Paul knew that adding a work to our justification voided the simplicity of the cross. \n \n Note very carefully that the 'false brethren' are tied to those men of reputation. \"But {it was} because of the FALSE BRETHREN secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage. But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me.\" Gal. 2:4-6.\n \n Who went in to spy out their liberty? James tells us, \"Since we have heard that some of OUR NUMBER to whom we gave no instruction have DISTURBED YOU with {their} words, unsettling your souls, it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Acts 15:24-26. These discussions over circumcision would become a source of great division among the Disciples (under James) and the Brethren (under Paul) later in Acts, and so much so, that the Disciples would seek Paul's life.\n \n Scripture says, \"And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. After he had greeted them, he {began} to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. And when they heard it they {began} glorifying God; and they said to him, \"You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who HAVE BELIEVED, and they are all ZEALOUS for the LAW.\" Acts 21:18-20.\n \n James sees a showdown coming, and he fears for the life of Paul, saying, \"And they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to CIRCUMCISE their children nor to walk according to the customs. What, then, is {to be done?} They will certainly hear that you have come.\" Acts 21:21+22. Now, perhaps the words of Paul are more easily understood, when he said \"fear of failure.\" Gal. 2:2. James' plan for Paul to pay for those 'under a vow' (Acts 21:23) is an attempt at pacifying these Jewish believers who are 'zealous for the Law' (Acts 21:20). The end result is that Paul was almost beaten to death (Acts 21:30+31) and the Roman guard had to save him (Acts 21:32).\n \n These Jews 'who believed' were zealous for the Law, because that is part of what it means to be saved under the Kingdom Administration. They were to keep the whole Law, as commanded by Christ (Matt.5:17-19) and James himself (James 2:10). Paul, on the other hand, teaches contrary to everything they believe. Paul tells these Galatians, \"Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive CIRCUMCISION, Christ will be of no benefit to you.\" Gal. 5:2. \n \n Do you still believe that Paul and James preached the same messages? Are we fully aware that observing the Sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments? What does Paul tell us concerning the Sabbath? \"Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day--things which are a {mere} shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.\" Col. 2:16+17.\n \n The Apostle Paul is addressing 'Brethren' and members of the body of Christ who are under grace and not under law (Rom. 6:14), who were saved according to Paul's Gospel (Rom. 16:25, 1Cor. 15:1-5). James is addressing these Jewish believers (zealous for the Law) who had been saved according to the 'gospel of the kingdom.' Paul's group is not under the Law, while James' group most definitely is under the Law. Just saying that they preach and believe the same things does not make it so.\n \n Maximus << The water baptisms that are spoken of in Acts did occur after Jesus' death (Acts 2:41, Acts 8:38, Acts 9:18). What do you think the value of those baptisms were?\n \n Terral's reply << Peter, John and James would continue preaching the gospel of the kingdom their entire lives. Those members of the Kingdom Administration had sins forgiven through repentance and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:12). Then, afterwards, Peter and John came (Acts 8:14) and laid hands on them (Acts 8:17), then they received the Holy Spirit. Again, please reply to my post on that thread. \n \n Maximus << I don't really know what \"Kingdom Disciples\" are. \n \n Terral's reply << Christ will explain it to you, and from a single source. Christ went out to preach what? \"From that time Jesus began to preach and say, \"Repent, for the KINGDOM of heaven is at hand.\" Matt. 4:17. And also, \"Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.\" Matt. 4:23. Christ says, \"This GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\" And lastly, Christ commands these Disciples, \"Go therefore and make DISCIPLES of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" Matt. 28:19.\n \n When you preach the gospel of the kingdom and create disciples, what shall they be called? The word disciple (mathetes #3101) is used about 250 times from Matthew 1 to Acts 28. Please guess how many times the Apostle Paul uses this word in all of his thirteen Gentile Epistles. Paul never uses the word even once. Paul says, \"But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God (Paul's Gospel). And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom (Gospel of the Kingdom), will no longer see my face.\" Acts 20:24+25. Paul would continue preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, until Acts 28:28. That marks the time of his writing of the Prison Epistles (61Ad.). \n \n Maximus << I'm not sure what the \"Kingdom Dispensation\" is. \n \n Terral's reply << To understand what the Kingdom Dispensation is about, we must understand the definition of a 'dispensation' (Eph. 3:2). From Vine's Expository Dictionary of NT Words: http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0000766\n \n <1,,3622,oikonomia< \n \n primarily signifies \"the management of a household or of household affairs\" (oikos, \"a house,\" nomos, \"a law\"); then the management or administration of the property of others, and so \"a stewardship,\" Luke 16:2-4; elsewhere only in the Epistles of Paul, who applies it (a) to the responsibility entrusted to him of preaching the Gospel, 1 Cor. 9:17 (RV, \"stewardship,\" AV, \"dispensation\"); (b) to the stewardship commited to him \"to fulfill the Word of God,\" the fulfillment being the unfolding of the completion of the Divinely arranged and imparted cycle of truths which are consummated in the truth relating to the Church as the Body of Christ, Col. 1:25 (RV and AV, \"dispensation\"); so in Eph. 3:2, of the grace of God given him as a stewardship (\"dispensation\") in regard to the same \"mystery;\" (c) in Eph. 1:10; 3:9, it is used of the arrangement or administration by God, by which in \"the fullness of the times\" (or seasons) God will sum up all things in the heavens and on earth in Christ. In Eph. 3:9 some mss. have koinonia, \"fellowship,\" for oikonomia, \"dispensation.\" In 1 Tim. 1:4 oikonomia may mean either a stewardship in the sense of (a) above, or a \"dispensation\" in the sense of (c). The reading oikodomia, \"edifying,\" in some mss., is not to be accepted. See STEWARDSHIP. \n Note: A \"dispensation\" is not a period or epoch (a common, but erroneous, use of the word), but a mode of dealing, an arrangement, or administration of affairs. Cp. oikonomos, \"a steward,\" and oikonomeo, \"to be a steward.\"\n \n Terral continues << The Kingdom Dispensation was given to Peter as the head. \n \n \"I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.\" Matt. 16:18+19. \n \n The Kingdom Dispensation is the topic of discussion throughout the Kingdom Epistles (Matthew -Acts, Hebrews - Revelation). Everything you say about water baptism saving souls is true for everyone within that Kingdom Administration. However, do not sit there and pretend that Peter and Paul sat on the same side of the table in Jerusalem (Acts 15). Do not pretend that James and Paul preach the same precepts of doctrine to the same group, when Scripture shows that they preach exactly the opposite (Romans 4:5 versus James 2:24, Col. 2:16+17 versus James 2:10).\n \n Paul writes 'to' us today, \"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--if indeed you have heard of the stewardship (dispensation) of God's grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.\" Eph. 3:1-3. In the very same way that Peter was given the Dispensation of the Kingdom and the keys to that kingdom, Paul was given the Dispensation of God's grace. They are two totally separate Dispensations and Administrations with totally separate precepts contained within their doctrine of salvation. \n \n Maximus continues << But I do know that the Eunuch baptized with water in Acts 8:38 was an ethiopan, a \"gentile.\" And in Acts 10 Peter water baptizes Gentiles after they have received the Holy Spirit.\n \n Terral's reply << The Eunuch was a Gentile? Where on earth did you get that idea? Why is this Gentile traveling to Jerusalem to worship? \"So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship.\" Acts 8:27? Do you suppose that there existed Gentile Temples of Aphrodite there? And why was this Gentile reading from the OT Scriptures? Israel traveled back to Jerusalem from all over the known world, according to the Law. This Eunuch was just one of those making his yearly pilgrimage to the Temple. \n \n Maximus << I think also that both Peter and Paul and other apostles preached the gospel to the Gentiles. I think that's what Peter means in Acts 15: 7 when he says that he has been chosen as the conveyor of the gospel to the Gentiles.\n \n Terral's reply << We certainly disagree. Cornelius and his family became part of the Kingdom Administration under Peter. Paul had not even gone down to submit our gospel to Peter, until Acts 15. How could Peter preach salvation by God's grace through faith in the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ, when Paul had yet to even tell him about it? Remember again that Peter is seen here preaching water baptism and the work performed by human hands. Yes, these Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before the actual washings had taken place. That was the 'sign' to these Kingdom Disciples that God would give us the 'earnest of our inheritance' (Eph. 1:13+14) without any works at all. Peter became the witness to the Kingdom Disciples that this would soon take place. \n \n Also, you have a serious problem in trying to attach any 'conveyor' qualities to Peter concerning Gentiles. What does the Scripture say, \"But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter {had been} to the circumcised (for He who effectually worked for Peter in {his} apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles), and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that WE {might} {go} to the GENTILES and THEY to the CIRCUMCISED.\" Gal. 2:7-9.\n \n I do believe that you understand what Scripture is describing when it says 'circumcised'? Peter, John and James went to Israel of the flesh, while Paul and the Brethren went to the Gentiles. I challenge you to find Peter, John or James addressing the 'Gentiles' in the first person in any of their Hebrew Epistles. Where do we see Peter going to Rome to bring the Kingdom Administration there? Good luck my friend, because your Bible does not contain any such thing. Instead, Peter declares that this 'wisdom given him' (Paul; 2Peter 3:15) is 'hard to understand' (2Peter 3:16). He says that people are distorting that wisdom to their own destruction. 2Peter 3:16. \n \n And, I also say this: That your mixing together of these Kingdom and Grace precepts serve only to distort that wisdom given Paul. If you do not understand the meaning of terms such as Kingdom Dispensation and Grace Dispensation, then perhaps it would be wise to ask more questions, instead of arguing blindly and misleading others. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Greetings to Ron and All:\n \n Ron writes << Terral03, Reading through your posts, I can see only one thing: Names. The Gospel is the same despite what it's called. It has not changed from the time it starts with Jesus all the way through to Jesus in Revelations. \n \n Terral's reply << \"Only one thing\"? If you have truly read through my posts, then you see much more than just names. If you really believe that there is just one gospel in the New Testament, then please demonstrate that point using Scripture. I will assure you that nothing in that post shall remain standing. Here is just one problem with your theory: Scripture says, \"Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.\" Matt. 4:23. \n \n Christ Himself went out proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. Paul preaches, \"Now I make known to you, brethren, the GOSPEL l which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.\" 1Cor. 15:1-4.\n \n Prove to everyone here that the 'gospel' preached by Christ in Matthew Chapter Four is the same 'gospel' preached by Paul in 1Corinthians Chapter Fifteen. Just because you can say \"they are the same\" does not make it so. There is no way that the 'gospel' preached by Christ Himself is the same 'gospel' preached by Paul concerning His death, burial and resurrection. What do you believe that Christ actually preached to Israel? \"Crucify Me for your salvation!\"? Please . . . Scripture and the Holy Spirit use the names \"Gospel of the Kingdom\" (Matt. 4:23, 9:35, 24:14) and \"Gospel of the Grace of God\" (Acts 20:24) for a reason. I did not make these things up. Paul calls his gospel \"my gospel,\" not once, but three times in his Gentile Epistles. Romans 2:16, 16:25, 2Tim. 2:8. \n \n Paul tells you specifically that his gospel is 'according to the revelation of the mystery.' Romans 16:25. Peter warns that people are distorting the 'wisdom given him' (2Pet. 3:14-16) to their own destruction. And you write me saying that there is one gospel? People who distort the truth concerning the mystery of the gospel revealed to Paul are being destroyed. Paul says, \"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\" 2Cor. 4:3+4.\n \n As a warning to all who hold this view, I quote Paul who says the same exact thing (in CAPS, because it is OT Text): \"'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.'\" Acts 13:41. I am describing it to you in great detail, as something totally separate from what Peter and the Twelve set out to do in Acts 2; TOTALLY SEPARATE! And you will not believe. 2Thes. 2:10-12.\n \n Ron << Yes, there was some contention between Peter and Paul, but they worked it out. Peter was hard-headed anyway and was set in his ways. But, he came around. And, yes, Peter was passionate about the Scriptures, adhered to them stringently. But, so did Paul. \n \n Terral's reply << Please forgive, but what you are saying has no basis in the Text at all. Peter is seen going one direction and Paul in exactly the opposite direction in Galatians 2:7-9. Paul and the brethren went to the Gentiles, while Peter, John and James went to the circumcised. In 67 Ad., almost four decades after the crucifixion, when Peter wrote his second Hebrew Epistle, he still believed whole-heartedly that this 'wisdom given him' was 'hard to understand.' 2Pet. 3:14-16. So please, do not try to convince me that they preached the same gospel message. People are distorting that wisdom today, to their own destruction. \n \n Ron << Even the Bereans, who were a strict and noble people, examined Paul's messages to see if what he preached lined up with the Scriptures.

What about this Simon flying to heaven story? And who crashed to the ground? Unlike the stories you tell, my words are supported by what is written in your Bible. You say there is only one gospel in the Bible. Very good. Prove it using Scripture and not tall tales. Paul preaches Christ crucified and redemption through His blood. Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20. Peter preaches repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Acts 2:38. Christ preached the gospel of the kingdom in Matthew 4:17, 23.

   "Hi Ron:\n \n I used Simon as one example referring to his (Satan's) power and to attempt to draw your attention to the simple truth.\n \n \"...a house divided will fall...\" Matthew 12:25\n \n If Peter and Paul preached separate gospels they could not have withstood the Powers of Darkness.\n \n Terral's reply << Please forgive, but the content of your original post is straight out of Hollywood. I hope you will accept my challenge and present your 'one gospel' theory, as a new thread on this forum. A good title might be \"There is one gospel/many gospels in your Bible. My opinion is that more than half of the professing Christians in the world today believe as you do. \n \n To all of those who believe there is only one gospel, Paul and I ask, \"Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?\" 1Cor. 1:20. The 'hidden wisdom' (1Cor. 2:6-8) of God is revealed in the Pauline Epistles. Paul's gospel is according to the 'revelation of the mystery.' Rom. 16:25. Paul says, \"and {pray} on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.\" Eph. 6:19. \n \n Christ revealed our gospel to Paul Himself, after He acended into the heavenly. Please pay careful attention to Paul's words here: \"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12. Now think about this very carefully. If Christ revealed Paul's gospel to him after Acts 9, how could Christ and the Twelve preach that same good news in Matthew 4 and 10? What you are suggesting is physically impossible. How could Christ preach salvation to anyone through His own death, burial and resurrection that was still future? \n \n In your example above, you wanted to 'draw' my attention to the truth using a Satanic example. Please allow me to do just that. Walk with me for a moment back to a time prior to the crucifixion of Christ. Do you realize that Satan entered Judas? \"And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve.\" Luke 22:3. \"After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, \"What you do, do quickly.\" John 13:27. Now, answer me this: When Satan entered Judas, what did Judas know that Satan did not know? \n \n Can we agree that Satan and his heavenly hosts knew what was known by the disciples? Next, pay careful attention to these words from Paul about this hidden wisdom. \"Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden {wisdom} which God predestined before the ages to our glory; {the wisdom} which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\" 1Cor. 2:6-8.\n \n Paul is saying that if Satan had known about God's plan to redeem us through the blood of Jesus Christ and His crucifixion, then he would never have crucified Him. It is for that reason that Paul's gospel is according to the revelation of the mystery. Our gospel for today had to be kept secret from Satan and his angels of darkness. They were led to believe that Christ was coming to be the King of the Jews under the Dispensation of the Kingdom. Or have you all forgotten that Israel was to accept Him as the Messiah? \"Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.\" Matt. 1:16. \"He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which translated means Christ).\" John 1:41.\n \n Satan entered Judas to put a stop to that prophecy. God tricked the devil into crucifying His Only Begotten Son, so that later on He could offer us the good news of His death, burial and resurrection through Paul's Gospel. The Apostle Paul preaches Christ crucified and redemption through His blood. Eph. 1:7, etc.. You truly believe that there is just one good news message in the New Testament. There is no way you can prove to anyone that Christ preached that same good news in Matthew 4:17-23. Do you see those words 'gospel of the kingdom' in verse 23? Those words of the Holy Scriptures are describing something other than Christ crucified. Even though you seem unable to comprehend that truth, somehow, some way, something inside of you must submit to the truth of what 'is' written in your Bible. \n \n Christ preached the gospel of the kingdom to Israel of the flesh for three years, before they rejected Him and crucified Him. Only after the Christ had risen to be seated at the right hand of God (Acts 2:33, 7:55, 56, etc.) did He reveal our gospel to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). I have proven that these are two separate good news messages, whether you can accept that or not is between you and God. Your first vital clue is that the first message had water baptism for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38), while our redemption is through His blood (Eph. 1:7).\n \n Good luck, and I hope you come to see it,\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral \n \n \n __________________",

   "Hi Ron and All:\n \n Thank you very much for the kind words at the end of your post. While it is not my intent to split hairs with you, please allow me to clarify some points from your statements. \n \n Ron writes << I think I get the gist of your post...I think. You are saying that there are many teachings (gospels) that tell of God's plan for us to be with Him. I agree. There are different steps, procedures, that we must understand before we can comprehend the Mystery, the \"secret things\" that were established before the foundation of the world. \n \n Terral's reply << Prophecy explains how everything came from one source; from God and His Word to creation to Adam and male and female and everyone else. The Mystery explains how everything shall be summed up in Christ, so \"that God may be all in all.\" 1Cor. 15:28. The 'gospel of the kingdom' is according to Prophecy, as God allowed the prophets to see it coming. Isaiah saw John the Baptist coming in the wilderness (Isaiah 40:3). Malachi saw John the Baptist coming in the wilderness. Malachi 3:1. Nobody in the Old Testament saw Paul coming with this dispensation of God's grace (Eph. 3:2). Again, Paul tells you specifically that his gospel is according to the revelation of the mystery. Rom. 16:25. Now, weigh into that statement. Stand upon it and hold it near and dear to your heart. \n \n As I described in the last post to you, Satan was not allowed to see our gospel for today. If he had any idea that 'Christ crucified' would be the core precept of our doctrine of salvation, then he would never have crucified Him (1Cor. 2:6-8). Therefore, just from those truths, you should be able to see that Paul's gospel is not part of the 'gospel of the kingdom' from Matthew 4:17 (23). They are not the same thing. If they were the same thing, then Satan would have known God's plan for us. So we cannot ascribe the characteristics of Paul's gospel to the gospel of the kingdom. They 'must' be two totally separate 'good news' messages. Just acknowledging that they are different is the beginning of wisdom.\n \n Ron << But, the mystery is not and will never be revealed in writing, not even in the Bible. It is only when we release ourselves into the supernatural, the spiritual world, that we can even begin to comprehend it, and then we can see it written in the Bible. I'm with you on that. I have always believed that the Word of God is alive.\n \n Terral's reply << What did you just read in 1Cor. 2:6-8? \"Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden {wisdom} which God predestined before the ages to our glory.\" 1Cor. 2:6+7. God's hidden wisdom is revealed in a mystery. Paul tells the Ephesians, \n \n \"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.\" Eph. 3:1-4. \n \n Paul's descriptions about the 'mystery of the administration' (Eph. 1:9+10, 3:5-12) can give you insight into the Mystery of Christ. Here is a clue for you: When Paul mentions a mystery, he is describing one thing being baptized into another so that the first becomes a member of the second. Our gospel is according to the revelation of the mystery (Rom. 16:25), because that is the avenue through which we are baptized into His body (1Cor. 12:12-14 (13)). Now, our lives are hidden in God with Christ. Col. 3:3. \n \n Guess what? That is exactly the same spot that the mystery was hidden, before revealed through Paul (i.e., hidden in God). Are you aware that the body of Moses also has members? Please read the words of 1Cor. 10:1-4 again. Even though that concept is totally foreign to anything taught in the OT, Paul is able to reveal it through his knowledge of this 'hidden wisdom,' i.e., the mystery. Therefore, we can know the mysteries of God and His hidden wisdom, but that means letting go of our preconceived notions and emptying our cup so that He can fill it. \n \n Ron << Now, for me, I believe that the Gospel of God is one message, that is comprised of different levels. \n \n Terral's reply << Again, there is no way for you to make the 'gospel' of Matthew 4:17 (23) become the same as the 'gospel' of 1Cor. 15:1-4. You can generate all of these evasive arguments as justification for holding onto your 'one gospel' view, if you like, but the entire Bible shall remain a mystery to you.\n \n Ron << Metaphors are acceptable but partial descriptions of God's plan for us. Christ's gospel can be called the gospel of the kingdom, gospel of salvation, gospel of grace, gospel of God, gospel of eternal life, etc. \n \n Terral's reply << Scripture and the Holy Spirit are much more precise than that. When Scripture calls Christ's message the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:23), then that is exactly what it is. Note that the Disciples very first question to Christ after the crucifixion was about restoring the kingdom to Israel. Acts 1:6. What you are saying in simple terms is, \"I do not understand the difference.\" The 'gospel of the grace of God,' or Paul's gospel, is not taught in the Four Gospels. But it is the only good news message taught in the Pauline Epistles. \n \n Do you understand that we are saved by God's grace through faith in the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ? Because I believe you do. You just do not realize that the 'gospel of the kingdom' is a totally separate message. Here is a little exercise to help you discover that Paul's gospel does not appear in the Four Gospels. How many times does the word 'grace' (charis) appear in the Four Gospels? This word appears outside of John chapter 1 (vs. 14, 16, 17) only once (Luke 2:40). Every use of this word in the Four Gospels is directly related to Christ Himself. By contrast, Paul uses the word 83 times in his Gentile Epistles, and 21 times in Romans alone. \n \n Try and guess how many times the word faith (pistis) is used in the Gospel of John? Would you believe zero? Anyone who had faith in the Four Gospels was a Gentile. The other uses include Christ's words about how 'little faith' Israel indeed possessed (Matt. 6:30, 8:10, 26, 14:31, etc.). Christ told the disciples, \"Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen.\" Matt. 21:21. Do you suppose that Christ envisions mountains being tossed about like twigs? No. He is telling the disciples that they had NO FAITH! By contrast, Paul uses the word faith 135 times in his letters, and 40 times in Romans alone. In light of this evidence, please try to prove that Paul's Gospel is preached in the Four Gospels. That would be quite impossible, because the precepts of God's grace and faith and Christ's shed blood do not even appear there anywhere. Remember again that Peter preaches water baptism for the forgiveness of sins, even after the crucifixion (Acts 2:38), so obviously he had no clue.\n \n Ron << The gospel is an announcement that we can live with God forever through Jesus Christ our Savior. Paul's gospel came from Christ personally because Christ did not have the opportunity to teach him first-hand when Paul was Saul.\n \n Terral's reply << Please note that Saul was always Paul. Paul is just his Roman name. Scripture says, \"But Saul, who was also {known as} Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him.\" Acts 13:9. The Holy Spirit is using this verse to signify a change in administrations. It is in this chapter that Paul would take our gospel to the Gentiles. \"Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, \"It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.\" Acts 13:46. And also, \"When the Gentiles heard this, they {began} rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.\" Acts 13:48. And notice, no mention of water baptism.\n \n Ron << I took from your post referring to Galatians, that Christ revealed another gospel, but you left out this part: \"I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. \n \n Terral's reply << These men from James were trying to add the work of circumcision to the gospel Paul had preached to them. So, it was not really a 'different gospel,' like the gospel of the kingdom. Instead, this is a distorted version of Paul's gospel with the added work of circumcision. Paul is emphasizing the fact that adding one work to our gospel cancels the whole deal. \n \n \"Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.\" Gal. 5:2+3. \n \n Doesn't that sound a lot like James' words in James 2:10? Yes it does. Those men from James who were disturbing the brethren in Christ (Acts 15:24) were saved through repentance and water baptism. So they were still under the Law. James 2:10. Paul would have nothing to do with it, because our gospel does not allow the addition of any works at all. Romans 4:4+5, Eph. 2:8+9. \n \n Ron << But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!\" (Galatians 1:6-9) \n \n Terral's reply << Please look more closely at what you just quoted. If anyone should preach a gospel contrary to 'WHAT WE HAVE PREACHED TO YOU,' he is to be accursed!\" Those key words explain why we must adhere to Paul's Gospel, and the message preached from within his Thirteen Gentile Epistles. The 'gospel of the kingdom' and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins, is NOT taught in Paul's Epistles. Therefore, we are accursed if we try to add those precepts to our gospel.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Thank you very much for the kind words at the end of your post.\n\n You&#8217;re welcome. It is refreshing to discuss the finer, less taught things with someone who, evidently, knows that there is more to Christianity than Sunday school class.\n \nWhile it is not my intent to split hairs with you, please allow me to clarify some points from your statements.\n\n Split away. That&#8217;s how we iron out the differences. So many times people are drawn to church and are only given milk. We all need a good dose of meat now and then. God guide you, my friend.\n \nProphecy explains how everything came from one source; from God and His Word to creation to Adam and male and female and everyone else. The Mystery explains how everything shall be summed up in Christ, so &#8220;that God may be all in all.&#8221; 1Cor. 15:28.

Just acknowledging that they are different is the beginning of wisdom.\n\n All I can say is, yes, they are different as I said, but I can&#8217;t separate them into two unrelated parts. My knowledge of Christ &#8211; so far &#8211; will not allow it, for to do so would cause me to question my belief in the Oneness of God, His single-mindedness. One Gospel, one Baptism, one Religion, and one God&#8211; that is what I believe.\n Note: the &#8220;one baptism&#8221; is that of the Holy Spirit, which I know you have as a thread starter and will get to that later, I hope. Even though baptism of water, fire, and the cross are important, baptism of the Holy Spirit is utmost.\n \nWhat did you just read in 1Cor. 2:6-8? &#8220;Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden {wisdom} which God predestined before the ages to our glory.&#8221; 1Cor. 2:6+7.

Therefore, we can know the mysteries of God and His hidden wisdom, but that means letting go of our preconceived notions and emptying our cup so that He can fill it.\n\n Well said, Terral. We must be willing to let go of the carnal things. If we could only prove that the Bible can reveal that mystery, get people to read through the Holy Spirit, then they can understand just what happened &#8220;before the foundation of the world&#8221; and why we must read Paul&#8217;s message closely. I think it would blow many readers&#8217; minds. It would completely shatter their current beliefs&#8230;that&#8217;s for sure.\n \nAgain, there is no way for you to make the &#8216;gospel&#8217; of Matthew 4:17 (23) become the same as the &#8216;gospel&#8217; of 1Cor. 15:1-4. You can generate all of these evasive arguments as justification for holding onto your &#8216;one gospel&#8217; view, if you like, but the entire Bible shall remain a mystery to you.\n\n No, I can&#8217;t make it become the same message. But, I would not want to. That&#8217;s my point, though, and where we seem to have a simple problem that has us both at odds. I realize the different message, but it leads me to the same place, the same conclusion. I will agree with you to that extent, but, again, I cannot separate them.\n \nScripture and the Holy Spirit are much more precise than that. When Scripture calls Christ&#8217;s message the &#8216;gospel of the kingdom&#8217; (Matt. 4:23), then that is exactly what it is. Note that the Disciples very first question to Christ after the crucifixion was about restoring the kingdom to Israel. Acts 1:6.

But it is the only good news message taught in the Pauline Epistles.\n\n What I am saying in simple terms is that I know the difference. Paul took the message a step further, not because he had another gospel, but because he had the knowledge of the Third Heaven. That additional knowledge empowered him, not only to see what the first part of the gospel meant, but where it was meant to go. It uncovered the things Jesus laid out for us all, but were too blind to see.\n \nDo you understand that we are saved by God&#8217;s grace through faith in the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ? Because I believe you do. You just do not realize that the &#8216;gospel of the kingdom&#8217; is a totally separate message. Here is a little exercise to help you discover that Paul&#8217;s gospel does not appear in the Four Gospels. How many times does the word &#8216;grace&#8217; (charis) appear in the Four Gospels?

By contrast, Paul uses the word 83 times in his Gentile Epistles, and 21 times in Romans alone.\n\n John 1:17 is to show where grace came from: From Christ to you and I; to Paul, who preached that, &#8220;by grace we are saved through faith&#8230;. Yes, understand.\n \nPlease note that Saul was always Paul. Paul is just his Roman name. Scripture says, &#8220;But Saul, who was also {known as} Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him.&#8221; Acts 13:9. The Holy Spirit is using this verse to signify a change in administrations.

And notice, no mention of water baptism.\n\n True. Good point.\n \n Good job, Terral. Now you&#8217;ve got me wanting to get back on my &#8220;Foundation of the World&#8221; thread. I have had no replies since I posted it about 3 weeks ago&#8230;\n \n It&#8217;s those like you that make me want to study more. I once belonged to a great Bible Study group, but have moved and have not found one, or even a home church yet&#8230;but we are still searching.",

   "Greetings to Ron and All:\n \n Thank you for the very good post. Please allow me to comment on some of your statements. Also, remember that I am trying to shine light on this topic to the widest possible audience.\n \n Ron writes on two gospels << All I can say is, yes, they are different as I said, but I can't separate them into two unrelated parts. \n \n Terral's reply << Nobody said to do that. Any two 'good news' messages contained in the New Testament must have certain attributes of sameness about them. Both are offered as a gift from God. The first gospel had the kingdom as the subject, while Paul's gospel has Christ crucified at the core. Here is the problem. Almighty God (who stands beyond this realm of time and space) has offered reconciliation and redemption through the blood sacrifice of His Only Begotten Son for our obedience. Let us look at the very ending of Romans:\n \n \"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to MY GOSPEL and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY which has been kept secret for long ages past, but NOW is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, {leading} to OBEDIENCE OF FAITH; to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.\" Rom. 16:25-27. \n \n What are you going to add to the blood of Jesus Christ to make it good enough to cleanse you of all unrighteousness? Shall we wash you in water and call it a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins like God offered Israel? Then, will you be saved? No sir. We cannot and shall not add one thing to the sacrifice of Christ for the forgiveness of our sins. If you do, then there is a penalty from God. The consequence of unbelief is more severe that you might expect. Scripture says,\n \n \"For the MYSTERY OF LAWLESSNESS is already at work; only he who now restrains {will do so} until he is taken out of the way. Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; {that is,} the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not RECEIVE THE LOVE OF THE TRUTH as to be saved. For this reason GOD SENDS upon them a deluding influence so that they will BELIEVE WHAT IS FALSE, in order that they all may be judged who did not BELIEVE THE TRUTH, but took pleasure in wickedness.\" 2Thes. 2:7-12.\n \n Since God places such importance upon the love of 'the' truth, then man would be wise to do the same. The gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of the grace of God are to be treated as different good news messages, because that is exactly what they are to God. If God intended for the precepts of these two gospel messages to be mixed together and dispensed according to your wishes, then He would have only one name for 'the' gospel. You know the verse of Scripture, \"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.\" 2Tim. 2:15. Paul is saying to 'cut straight' the word of truth. The dispensationalists say, \"rightly divide.\" Therefore, God is commanding us to see the difference and to preach the difference. After all, this is His good news to mankind we are talking about. \n \n Someone comes along and preaches 'the' truth to you about Christ and His death, burial and resurrection, and the good news that you have eternal life as a gift from God by believing in what He did for you. But, you do not believe it. Instead, you are like Peter and the Twelve who had no faith. So God sends the deluding influence (Satan) and you begin to believe what is false. At that stage of the game, nobody on earth can help you. Who among men is strong enough to break the spell placed upon you by God Himself? Therefore, do not add or take away one dot or dash from Paul's gospel. \n \n What do you mean that Peter and the others had no faith? Mary was commanded by our risen Lord to go and tell the disciples that He had risen. How many of them believed her? \"She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.\" Mark 16:10+11. Can anyone today be saved by God's grace through faith in the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ without believing He was raised from the dead? Absolutely not! And yet, you cannot separate these two messages \"into two unrelated parts\"? We cannot place Paul's gospel into the hearts and minds of the Twelve in the Four Gospels, and we must preach the difference.\n \n Ron << My knowledge of Christ - so far - will not allow it, for to do so would cause me to question my belief in the Oneness of God, His single-mindedness. One Gospel, one Baptism, one Religion, and one God- that is what I believe.\n \n Terral's reply << You are quoting from Ephesians. \"{There is} one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.\" Eph. 4:4+5. Your 'religion' comment above is out of place. The Latin 'religious' means 'to bind back.' Religion is man's attempt to bind himself back to God using works and rituals. Christianity is not a religion. It is a relationship between the believer and God Almighty through His Son, by the power of the Holy Spirit. But, regarding the 'ones' of Eph. 4 above, I have this question for you: which of the 'ones' can you see with human eyes? The one 'body' is the body of Christ. The one Spirit, well, you can't see that. Hope, no, Lord, no way, Faith no can't see that, baptism . . . let's come back to that one. God and Father we can't see. That leaves us with the baptism. \n \n The baptism of the Spirit that Paul describes in 1Cor. 12:12-14 is definitely done by the Spirit. We are baptized into His Body on the cross at Calvary to participate in His death, burial and resurrection. So we cannot see that either. But, perhaps you can see the problem with having a ritualistic Levitical type baptism in this mix? \n \n The baptism for the forgiveness of sins is simply part of the gospel of the kingdom. It has absolutely nothing at all to do with Paul's gospel. You see Paul baptizing in Acts (19:1-6, etc). Then he tells the Corinthians that he was not sent to baptize. 1Cor. 1:17. But he did baptize some (vs. 16). Paul baptized some, because they were members of the Kingdom administration; Jews mostly who were baptized in water, in the name of Jesus and had hands laid on them for the Holy Spirit. This Corinthian Church was among the largest in the world, and had members from both administrations. Those who were baptized in water for the forgiveness of sins were claiming to be 'of Peter,' and 'of Apollos.' 1Cor. 1:12. \n \n Paul was not sent to baptize members of the body of Christ. Luke wrote Acts from the Kingdom slant, while Paul's Epistles are from the Grace perspective. The seeming contradiction disappears, when you realize that Paul is addressing two separate groups of people from the two dispensations (Kingdom; Jews dominant/Grace; Gentiles dominant). You will find Paul quoting OT Scripture to churches with many Jewish members. Neither of his letters to the Thessalonians contain a single OT quote; thus, all Gentile. \n \n When you come to realize that this one work, of water baptism being added to our gospel, is Satan's main source of delusion (2Thes. 2:10), then you will see the importance of teaching the distinction between the two gospel messages. There is a mystery of Christ and a mystery of lawlessness. Two bodies are being formed before our eyes (body of Christ and the body of the Anti-Christ). To which do you belong? We all use the same Bible, and the subjects of this discussion are very important to many lost souls. \n \n Ron << Note: the \"one baptism\" is that of the Holy Spirit, which I know you have as a thread starter and will get to that later, I hope. Even though baptism of water, fire, and the cross are important, baptism of the Holy Spirit is utmost. \n \n Terral's reply << The 'one baptism' of Eph. 4:5 is the one that places you 'in' Christ. 1Cor. 12:12-14 (13), Eph. 1:13+14 'sealed in Him'. Without that one baptism, you are not 'in' Christ, and still standing in your sins.\n \n Ron's original << We must be willing to let go of the carnal things. If we could only prove that the Bible can reveal that mystery, get people to read through the Holy Spirit, then they can understand just what happened \"before the foundation of the world\" and why we must read Paul's message closely. I think it would blow many readers' minds. It would completely shatter their current beliefs...that's for sure. \n \n Terral's reply << The average church going professing Christian has things fixed in his mind, so that nothing in this world will ever change it. 2Thes. 2:10-12. Those from the secular realms have a much better chance of seeing it. But then again, the seeds of faith turn into the shoots of knowledge within the heart of men. Only with time and watering of the word will the fruit of wisdom appear bearing more seeds. That is how God protects His hidden wisdom from natural men. Milk first, then meat. \n \n Ron said about the two gospels << No, I can't make it become the same message. But, I would not want to. That's my point, though, and where we seem to have a simple problem that has us both at odds. I realize the different message, but it leads me to the same place, the same conclusion. I will agree with you to that extent, but, again, I cannot separate them. \n \n Terral's reply << Okay. When you preach the gospel to someone, does it include parts of both of these messages? Or are you preaching only the precepts contained within Paul's gospel without realizing it? \n \n Ron original << What I am saying in simple terms is that I know the difference. Paul took the message a step further, not because he had another gospel, but because he had the knowledge of the Third Heaven. \n \n Terral's reply << Okay then, Paul is the lair. He says, \"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12. According to your theory, Instead of receiving our gospel from Christ after His resurrection, Paul simply added a few points to Peter's gospel and took that message a step further. Please present a blueprint for this updated version of the gospel of the kingdom with the precepts, that Paul calls 'my gospel' (Rom. 16:25). Of course, if you are correct, and Paul simply modified a previous good news message, then he cannot really call it my gospel at all. \n \n Ron continues << That additional knowledge empowered him, not only to see what the first part of the gospel meant, but where it was meant to go. It uncovered the things Jesus laid out for us all, but were too blind to see. \n \n Terral's reply << There is no such thing as a first part and second part of Paul's Gospel, as if sins were forgiven through water baptism (Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38) then we just add Christ's shed blood and call it a mystery. No sir. All you are doing is assisting Satan in selling his counterfeit good news message. John the Baptist, Christ and the Twelve preached something totally different in the Four Gospels and Acts. Paul's gospel is a totally separate good news message.\n \n Ron << Now you've got me wanting to get back on my \"Foundataion of the World\" thread. I have had no replies since I posted it about 3 weeks ago...\n \n Terral's reply << Please direct me to the URL.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Nobody said to do that. Any two &#8216;good news&#8217; messages contained in the New Testament must have certain attributes of sameness about them. Both are offered as a gift from God. The first gospel had the kingdom as the subject, while Paul&#8217;s gospel has Christ crucified at the core.\n\n We agree here. What I need to do is back out of this argument due to the fact that all we disagree on is the Two Gospel approach. I see two distinct messages, but say that they are both required. You say that they are both required and are two distinct Gospels &#8211; same thing to me. But I can see where an uneducated person, who is without wisdom, can get confused. So I will back out on those grounds. (See 1 Corinthians 15:11 &#8211; Therefore, whether it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed.) If it were not for Paul&#8217;s message (or gospel as you call it) we would not be able to withstand the trickery of Satan. Yes, we agree on that.\n \nSince God places such importance upon the love of &#8216;the&#8217; truth, then man would be wise to do the same. The gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of the grace of God are to be treated as different good news messages, because that is exactly what they are to God. If God intended for the precepts of these two gospel messages to be mixed together and dispensed according to your wishes, then He would have only one name for &#8216;the&#8217; gospel. You know the verse of Scripture, &#8220;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.&#8221; 2Tim. 2:15. Paul is saying to &#8216;cut straight&#8217; the word of truth. The dispensationalists say, &#8220;rightly divide.&#8221; Therefore, God is commanding us to see the difference and to preach the difference. After all, this is His good news to mankind we are talking about.\n\n Good point. I will add that one cannot &#8220;cut straight&#8221; the truth without submission&#8230;spiritually. It is impossible.\n \nSomeone comes along and preaches &#8216;the&#8217; truth to you about Christ and His death, burial and resurrection, and the good news that you have eternal life as a gift from God by believing in what He did for you. But, you do not believe it. Instead, you are like Peter and the Twelve who had no faith. So God sends the deluding influence (Satan) and you begin to believe what is false. At that stage of the game, nobody on earth can help you. Who among men is strong enough to break the spell placed upon you by God Himself? Therefore, do not add or take away one dot or dash from Paul&#8217;s gospel.\n\n Again, I agree. \n \nYour &#8216;religion&#8217; comment&#8230;is out of place.\n\n No, it was in reference to my belief system. Please do not associate my belief system with a word I despise, personally. I have to use the term sometimes, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I enjoy it. There comes a time (now and then), in my ministry, that I have to control the urge to explain the difference between religion and untainted belief. It&#8217;s during those times that I have to pray I get the right message across.\n \n There is no such thing as a first part and second part of Paul&#8217;s Gospel, as if sins were forgiven through water baptism (Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38) then we just add Christ&#8217;s shed blood and call it a mystery. No sir. All you are doing is assisting Satan in selling his counterfeit good news message. John the Baptist, Christ and the Twelve preached something totally different in the Four Gospels and Acts. Paul&#8217;s gospel is a totally separate good news message.\n\n Re-read my post. I did not say Paul&#8217;s Gospel, I said the Gospel of God.\n \n And I can assure you that I know Satan and Satan knows me &#8211; all too well. I have assisted him far too much already. To the point that he attacked (spiritually) my friends and family and have turned some against me. I have seen horrible things while employed by the powers of darkness, so much that I refuse to describe them here or anywhere else. So, you can dispel that idea about me; that is a certainty.\n \nTerral&#8217;s reply << Please direct me to the URL.\n\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2450",

   "Terral,\n \nMaximus << Furthermore, the \"gospel of Paul\" is the Gospel of Jesus and the same gospel of all the Apostles. \n \n \nTerral's reply << That statement is unsupported and incorrect. This time, I am going to quote Scripture and ask you to answer specific questions. Paul went down to Jerusalem in about the year 50 Ad for a specific purpose. Again, Paul writes to the Galatians, \"It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but {I did so} in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.\" Gal. 2:2. \n \n The statement is supported and correct.\n \n Paul preached the gospel of Jesus:\n 1 Corinthians 2:2 \"For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.\"\n \n Paul preached the same gospel as the apostles:\n 2 Corinthians 11:4-5 \"For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough. I think that I am not in the least inferior to these superlative apostles.\"\n \n This gospel was one and anyone preaching one contrary would be accursed:\n Galatians 1:6-9 \"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel--NOT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER GOSPEL, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed.\"\n \n \n1. If Peter and Paul have been preaching the same gospel message for the past twenty years, then why is Paul going down to present Peter anything? \n \n 2. Your opinion is that Paul and these 'pillars' (Peter, John, James) preached the same gospel. So, why is Paul going down in fear of failure?\n\n Paul is presenting his teachings to Peter to verify that they were, in fact, teaching the same gospel. He was verifying their continuity. Paul is submitting \"his gospel\" to those who walked with Jesus. The apostles were unified. That's why Jesus chose them.\n \n Because Paul received the gospel after Christ ascended does not mean that he received a different gospel. Because he received the gospel by a different means at a different time does not mean that the gospel itself was different. \n \n Also, the fact that Paul states in Galatians that the gospel which was preached to him was not \"man's gospel\" is not surprising. He means that he is not preaching things of this world--of man. The men he is referring to here are not the apostles. The gospel of the other apostles was not a gospel of man, it was the gospel of the Son of Man, the gospel of God. \n \n \nTerral's reply << Here is your problem. Peter's Gospel includes the precepts of repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38. Their justification is by \"works and not by faith alone.\" (James 2:20). Paul's Gospel includes the precepts of hearing (Rom. 10:17) and believing (Eph. 1:13+14) the message of truth concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Christ (1Cor. 15:1-5). Our redemption is through His blood. Eph. 1:7. \n \n \nSimply saying that those two messages are the same does not make it so. The first is by water, and the second is by blood. See 1John 5:6 which says that Christ came in BOTH! The first includes the work of water baptism (John's Baptism), the second does not. Paul's Gospel must be accepted by faith apart from works. Rom. 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9. Adding the work of water baptism to the message of truth defiles the simplicity of the cross. 1Cor. 1:17.\n\n John says that if all the things Jesus did were written then \"the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\" There are many messages in Scripture. None of the messages in your quotes above contradict another. \n \n Our redemption is through his blood and our participation in his sacrifice. We enter into this by baptism. I have not added the work of baptism to the cross. Jesus intitiated baptism. Without the blood of Jesus then baptism has no meaning. I'm not sure why Jesus would want to defile his own cross.\n \n \nTerral's reply << No sir. What you are saying is that Paul is wrong. When did water baptism cease to be a work done by human hands? The 'one baptism' of Eph. 4:5 is Spiritual, just like all the other 'ones' in that passage. Paul describes our one baptism in 1Cor. 12:12-14 (13) as the one performed by the Holy Spirit, as we are placed into His Body. You have taken a precept of the gospel of the kingdom (washing in water) and placed it among the precepts of the gospel of the grace of God. In doing so, you have created a different gospel (2Cor. 11:4) from the one that Paul preaches throughout his Gentile Epistles. \n \n I have not said that Paul is wrong. I have not contradicted him. Has he contradicted himself? I am still wondering why he was baptized in Acts 9:18.\n \n What makes you think that the spiritual baptism in Ephesians 4:5 and 1 Corinthians 12:12-14  is not a water baptism? Why do you think Paul alludes to water baptism with the words wash and bath in 1 Corinthians 6:11  and Titus 3:5?\n \n What do you think of Paul's words to Timothy concerning the gifts of God received by laying on of hands (Paul's hands in the second citation)? (1 Timothy 4:14  and 2 Timothy 1:6)\n \n Peace.",

I listed the four gospel messages in the very first post on this thread. Instead of disproving one word of that, your attempt here is to oversimplify the terms used in this debate with the phrase 'gospel of Jesus.' If you wish to show that Peter and the Twelve preached the same good news as Paul and the brethren, then why not just quote those verses? The problem is that those verses do not exist. So you seek to twist Paul's words, ignore everything that Peter preaches in the Bible, and call that proof. Okay. But do you really believe that any of the third party readers will believe your report? \n \n Original Quote:\n \n Maximus << Furthermore, the \"gospel of Paul\" is the Gospel of Jesus and the same gospel of all the Apostles. \n \n Original Response:\n \n Terral's reply << That statement is unsupported and incorrect.

Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16) is described in 1Cor. 15:1-5 and concerns itself with the death, burial and resurrection. We are baptized into His body (1Cor. 12:13) upon hearing (Rom. 10:17) and believing (Eph. 1:13) the gospel. I presented that on the very first page of the original post. Your task has been to prove that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17, 23, 9:35, Acts 2:38 etc.) is the same message. That good news message is also described on page one. Please prove that #1 and #2 are the same thing. Good luck.\n \n Maximus << Paul preached the same gospel as the apostles: 2 Corinthians 11:4-5 \"For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.

Where is your proof that the gospel of the kingdom and Paul's gospel are the same good news message? You can continue to quote Paul all day long, but what the third party reader needs is your evidence that the two are the same. BTW, your translation above is miles away from the Greek of the Textus Receptus and Majority Text. \n \n Maximus << This gospel was one and anyone preaching one contrary would be accursed: Galatians 1:6-9 \"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel--NOT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER GOSPEL, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.

Where is your evidence that the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 24:24, Acts 8:12), and the message that Peter preached in Acts 2 is the same good news Paul described in his Epistles? Because I agree with you 100 percent that Paul's gospel is presented fully in his letters. Thus far, not one word you have typed out disproves one thing from my original post. \n \n Terral's Original Questions to Maximus:\n 1. If Peter and Paul have been preaching the same gospel message for the past twenty years, then why is Paul going down to present Peter anything? \n \n 2. Your opinion is that Paul and these 'pillars' (Peter, John, James) preached the same gospel.

He was verifying their continuity. Paul is submitting \"his gospel\" to those who walked with Jesus. The apostles were unified. That's why Jesus chose them.\n \n Terral's reply << Those are interesting opinions about what you believe to be true. I see no Scriptural support, because it simply does not exist. This meeting in Jerusalem is taking place twenty years after the crucifixion. The reason that Paul goes down to submit the gospel he preached among the Gentiles is spoken of by Paul himself. \n \n \"Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. It was because of a REVELATION that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but {I did so} in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain. But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be CIRCUMCISED. But {it was} because of the FALSE BRETHREN secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage. But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.\" Gal. 2:1-5.\n \n Paul uses this word 'revelation' twice in this letter to the Galatians, and this is the second time in Gal. 2:2. The first is here, \"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a REVELATION of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12.\n \n Paul would continue to receive such 'revelations' about the mystery (Eph. 3:1-3) and other things directly from our Lord Jesus Christ. Paul writes, \n \n \"Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.\" 2Cor. 12:1. And again, \"Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me--to keep me from exalting myself!\" 2Cor. 12:7.\n \n When Paul goes down to submit our gospel to Peter, John and James (Gal. 2:7-9), he did so because of a revelation; in other words, because Christ told Him so. The problem was that men from James (Acts 15:24) were disturbing the brethren (I have already written this on this thread). They were seeking to add circumcision to Paul's gospel and lead the brethren into bondage. You believe that Peter and Paul preached the same thing? Okay. Please explain this: \n \n \"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, \"If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how {is it that} you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews? \"We {are} Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles;\n nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\" Gal. 2:14-16.\n \n Peter and the others were trying to force circumcision upon Gentiles as part of their acceptance of Paul's gospel. Peter's hypocrisy is exposed in Gal. 2:11-13. Paul continues to explain the precepts of our gospel to Peter, John and James, because they had it wrong; and not because they all preached the same thing. \n \n Maximus continues << Because Paul received the gospel after Christ ascended does not mean that he received a different gospel. Because he received the gospel by a different means at a different time does not mean that the gospel itself was different. \n \n Terral's reply << Your opinions about what is written mean nothing. Do you have a shred of evidence that proves Paul received the same good news message that Peter preached in Acts 2? No you do not. If you did, then we would not be looking at your unsupported opinions above. The truth still remains that Peter preached water baptism for the forgiveness of sins in Acts 2:38, just as John the Baptist did from day one. Mark 1:4. Our sins are forgiven through Christ's shed blood today. Eph. 1:7. Blood and water are NOT the same thing. Still, if you wish to try and prove that case, please do so using Scripture.\n \n Maximus continues << Also, the fact that Paul states in Galatians that the gospel which was preached to him was not \"man's gospel\" is not surprising. He means that he is not preaching things of this world--of man. The men he is referring to here are not the apostles. The gospel of the other apostles was not a gospel of man, it was the gospel of the Son of Man, the gospel of God.\n \n Terral's reply << Half of your problem is that terrible translation. Once again, our opinions mean nothing. And standing within the Pauline Epistles is not going to prove one thing that Peter preached in Acts 2. You are avoiding all the differences in the two gospel messages and placing your opinions above what 'is' written in the Text. \n \n Paul writes, \"But we did not yield in subjection to THEM for even an hour, so that the TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL would remain with you. But from those who were of HIGH REPUTATION (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--well, those who were of REPUTATION contributed nothing to me.\" Gal. 2:5+6. Those men of high reputation are \"James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars.\" vs. 9. James, Peter and John were adversaries to Paul and the brethren in regard to this discussion over circumcision being added to Paul's gospel. That is why these two separate groups are having this meeting in the first place. Read Gal. 2:1-3 again. Peter is the one who stood condemned in verse 11, and he was wrong about the 'truth of the gospel' in verse 14. Peter and Paul would go in opposite directions as a result of this meeting (Gal. 2:9). \n \n Original Quote:\n \n Terral's reply << Here is your problem. Peter's Gospel includes the precepts of repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins. Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38. Their justification is by \"works and not by faith alone.\" (James 2:20). Paul's Gospel includes the precepts of hearing (Rom. 10:17) and believing (Eph. 1:13+14) the message of truth concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Christ (1Cor. 15:1-5). Our redemption is through His blood. Eph. 1:7. \n \n Another Origian Quote:\n \n Simply saying that those two messages are the same does not make it so. The first is by water, and the second is by blood. See 1John 5:6 which says that Christ came in BOTH! The first includes the work of water baptism (John's Baptism), the second does not. Paul's Gospel must be accepted by faith apart from works. Rom. 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9. Adding the work of water baptism to the message of truth defiles the simplicity of the cross. 1Cor. 1:17. \n \n Maximus avoids the water/blood aspects and replies << John says that if all the things Jesus did were written then \"the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\" There are many messages in Scripture. None of the messages in your quotes above contradict another. \n \n Terral's reply << If you do not know the difference between blood for the forgiveness of sins (Eph. 1:7) and water for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38), then you just do not know the difference. \n \n Maximus << Our redemption is through his blood and our participation in his sacrifice. We enter into this by baptism. I have not added the work of baptism to the cross. Jesus intitiated baptism. Without the blood of Jesus then baptism has no meaning. I'm not sure why Jesus would want to defile his own cross.\n \n Terral's reply << Do you believe also that Peter and the Twelve were had sins forgiven by the time Christ sent them out to preach the kingdom to Israel? Matt. 10:5-7? Yes? Okay, how where their sins forgiven? Christ had yet to die for anyone! How does that fit into your theory? If Peter really and truly believed that sins were forgiven through the blood of Christ (Eph. 1:7), after the crucifixion, then why does he continue to preach water baptism for the forgiveness of sins? Acts 2:38. No sir. \n \n The gospel of the kingdom and Paul's gospel are two totally separate good news messages. Instead of preaching the gospel that Christ revealed to Paul after the crucifixion (1Cor. 15:1-5) as 'the' gospel for today, you are inserting the precepts of the gospel of the kingdom into that message. Since that includes repentance and water baptism (Acts 2:38), then that work of water defiles the simplicity of the cross (1Cor. 1:17). Peter tells you that people are distorting the 'wisdom given him' (Paul; 2Pet. 3:15) to their own destruction (vs. 16). And yet, you continue to do just that. Go ahead, mix together all the precepts from both of the good news messages of the NT, and dispense as you wish, and teach others to do the same, knowing you have been warned.\n \n Original Quote:\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. What you are saying is that Paul is wrong. When did water baptism cease to be a work done by human hands? The 'one baptism' of Eph. 4:5 is Spiritual, just like all the other 'ones' in that passage. Paul describes our one baptism in 1Cor. 12:12-14 (13) as the one performed by the Holy Spirit, as we are placed into His Body. You have taken a precept of the gospel of the kingdom (washing in water) and placed it among the precepts of the gospel of the grace of God. In doing so, you have created a different gospel (2Cor. 11:4) from the one that Paul preaches throughout his Gentile Epistles. \n \n Maximus responds with a question << I have not said that Paul is wrong. I have not contradicted him. Has he contradicted himself? I am still wondering why he was baptized in Acts 9:18.\n \n Terral's reply << At the time of Paul's conversion, the good news about the kingdom of God\" (Acts 8:12) was the only game in town. Christ did not reveal our gospel to him, until after Acts 9. The 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 24:14; Peter's gospel 'to the circumcised' Gal. 2:7) would continue to be preached by Paul, to Israel of the flesh and proselytes, until Acts 28:28. Paul did baptize those members into the Kingdom. Acts 19:1-6, etc.. He was not sent to baptize (1Cor. 1:17) anyone into the body of Christ. Those are two totally separate administrations of Kingdom and Grace.\n \n Maximus asks << What makes you think that the spiritual baptism in Ephesians 4:5 and 1 Corinthians 12:12-14 is not a water baptism? \n \n Terral's reply to Eph. 4:5 << Look at all the 'ones' in Eph. 4:4+5. How many of them can you see? Answer: zero. They are all of the Spirit.\n \n Terral's reply to 1Cor. 12:13: Because, that is what the Bible says. Please forgive if I quote the word of God: \"For by ONE SPIRIT we were all baptized into ONE BODY, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of ONE SPIRIT.\" 1Cor. 12:13. Paul also writes on this same topic to the Ephesians, \"Eph 1:13 In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were SEALED IN HIM with the HOLY SPIRIT of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14.\n \n Paul also tells the Galatians, \"For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.\" Gal. 3:27. Did that say, \"For all of you who were baptized into water have . . .\" No. The One Spirit baptizes us into His Body so that we become 'clothed with Christ.' This process of the 'one baptism' by the 'One Spirit' has absolutely nothing at all to do with water or anything seen. \n \n Those from among the denominations are being used by Satan (2Thes. 2:7-12) to replace these spiritual gifts from God with works done by human hands. Then, these man made churches place themselves in the position of your intercessor that stands between you and God (as Levitical priest). Do not be deceived by such trickery.\n \n Maximus asks << Why do you think Paul alludes to water baptism with the words wash and bath in 1 Corinthians 6:11 and Titus 3:5?\n \n Terral's reply to 1Cor. 6:11 << Paul does not allude to water baptism in this verse. That is the way you interpret the verse. \"Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the SPIRIT OF OUR GOD.\" 1Cor. 6:11. Then, as we have already seen, Paul tells them, \"For by ONE SPIRIT we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.\" 1Cor. 12:13. Paul is alluding to the baptism by the One Spirit that he describes in this same letter.\n \n Terral's reply to Titus 3:5 << \"He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the HOLY SPIRIT.\" Titus 3:5. 'Washing of regeneration' is not even close to baptism 'for the forgiveness of sins' (Acts 2:38). Again, Paul is describing the one baptism (Eph. 4:5) by the One Spirit (1Cor. 12:13) that clothes us with Christ (Gal. 3:27) the moment we believe (Eph. 1:13+14). \n \n Maximus asks a very good question << What do you think of Paul's words to Timothy concerning the gifts of God received by laying on of hands (Paul's hands in the second citation)? (1 Timothy 4:14 and 2 Timothy 1:6)\n \n Terral's reply << Remember that Paul preaches both the 'gospel of the kingdom' and the 'gospel of the grace of God' throughout Acts. Paul wanted to use Timothy (like a son; see 1Cor. 4:17, 1Tim. 1:18, 2Tim. 1:2) to also preach according to both the Kingdom and Grace administrations. You will note the seeming contradiction between Paul's words to the Galatians (Gal. 5:2) and what Paul does in Acts (Acts 16:3).\n \n Acts 16:1 Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a DISCIPLE [Kingdom] was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek, and he was well spoken of by the brethren [members of the body of Christ] who were in Lystra and Iconium. Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and CIRCUMCISED him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.\n \n Timothy could not preach the gospel of the kingdom to Jews in the area, if he did not conform to Mosaic Law. After all, they were still under the Law (Matt. 5:17-19, James 2:10). Therefore, Timothy also had the three baptisms of the Kingdom performed upon him (same as the men in Acts 19:1-6), which included the 'laying on of hands,' and the sign gifts. Paul and Timothy (and others) were part of both the Kingdom and Grace Administrations. And so, Paul's words to Timothy contain precepts of both.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus << In regard to there being separate gospels and a different dispensation for Israel and the Gentiles, what do you think of these scripture verses?\n \n John 10:16 << \"And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, one shepherd.\"\n \n Terral quotes << \"I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. \"I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock {with} one shepherd.\" John 10:14-16.\n \n Terral's reply << While the gospel of the kingdom was only offered to Israel at first (Matt. 10:5-7), after they accepted, this gospel was to go to the entire world. As it is written, \"Go therefore and make disciples of ALL THE NATIONS, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" Matt. 28:19-20. The 'other sheep' are Gentiles from around the world. However, Peter and the others are seen still going to the circumcised twenty years later (Gal. 2:9), because Israel rejected the Kingdom offering. Paul finally gives up on Israel and the gospel of the kingdom in Acts 28:28. \n \n Maximus quotes << Ephesians 3:6 \"...that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel\"\n \n Terral quotes << \"By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; {to be specific,} that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.\" Eph. 3:4-7.\n \n Terral's reply << First off, these words of Paul follow a line of revelation from what was given to him (dispensation of God's grace, vs. 2) and the mystery (vs. 3) now revealed to the apostles and prophets (vs. 5) concerning the 'mystery of the administration (vs. 9) that is made known through the church (vs. 10) to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly (vs. 10), according to God's eternal purpose (purpose for the ages) vs. 11. There is no such thing as Jew or Gentile 'in Christ.' As it is written, \"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Gal. 3:26-28.\n \n This 'mystery' explains how Gentiles are becoming members of the body of Christ without Levitical rituals of the Temple, without Mosaic Law, and without repentance and baptism of the gospel of the Kingdom. The method through which they are becoming members is described in Eph. 1:13+14 and Eph. 2:8-10. These are the things described by Paul as \"my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,\n but now is manifested . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26a. Are we noting Paul's words about the 'mystery' and that which remained hidden, but \"NOW\" is manifested/revealed? Rom. 16:26, Eph. 3:6? \n \n Do you really and truly believe that Christ preached this message as the 'gospel of the kingdom' in Matthew 4:17 (23)? If so, please go to my original post on this thread. Cut and paste the descriptions of gospel #1 and gospel #2 and prove they are the same thing using Scripture. My guess is that you cannot justify the differences between Peter's message in Acts 2:36-38 (baptism for the forgiveness of sins) and Paul's gospel (Christ's blood for forgiveness of sins; Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20). You cannot even find one instance of the word 'grace' being used in the same book as 'gospel of the kingdom.' Matthew. And yet, we are saved by God's grace through faith apart from works. Eph. 2:8+9. \n \n Please look through the book of John for the word faith. How can John preach the gospel based upon God's grace through faith, when the word (pistis) is not even used in the entire account? Those two key words of Pauline Doctrine do not appear in the key places you would like to see them in the Four Gospels, and for a good reason. The saving grace and faith (Eph. 2:8+9, Rom. 5:1+2) that we have access to today were not available to anyone in the Four Gospels, because they were 'in' Christ. Christ is the Bread of Life (John 6:35) that had to be broken (Calvary) for us to share in them. \n \n The 'gospel of the kingdom' was not based upon the shed blood of Jesus Christ for anyone to believe for salvation. Christ sent the Twelve out to preach 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Matt. 10:7. Even Christ's true identity was not part of that good news message. What did Christ tell the disciples? \"Then He warned the disciples that they should tell NO ONE that He was the Christ.\" Matt. 16:20. Only after the crucifixion did Peter include this precept as part of the gospel of the kingdom. Acts 2:36. But, the repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins still remains as part of his message. Acts 2:38. The means of justification is the primary difference in these two separate good news messages. And that is why Peter continues to preach, \"Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you--not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\" 1Pet. 3:21. Paul, however, preaches the blood for forgiveness. Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20. The two are simply not the same thing.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Terral,\n Aspects of what you say are accurate. But not all of what you say is accurate. It may be true that Peter emphasizes repentance and Paul emphasizes grace. But this distinction does not mean that Peter neglects the work of the Holy Spirit and grace. To say that we are saved by grace is accurate. To say that only \"Paul's gospel\" has power is inaccurate. For there is one gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and within his gospel repentance and good works of all believers, Jew and Gentile alike, are needed.\n \n In order to avoid arguing blindly with you on this, I will do as you suggest and ask a few questions (I will include excerpts from posts you made to Ron and me):\n \n \nPost 13\n Do you understand that we are saved by God's grace through faith in the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ? Because I believe you do. You just do not realize that the 'gospel of the kingdom' is a totally separate message. Here is a little exercise to help you discover that Paul's gospel does not appear in the Four Gospels. How many times does the word 'grace' (charis) appear in the Four Gospels? This word appears outside of John chapter 1 (vs. 14, 16, 17) only once (Luke 2:40). Every use of this word in the Four Gospels is directly related to Christ Himself. By contrast, Paul uses the word 83 times in his Gentile Epistles, and 21 times in Romans alone.\n \n Try and guess how many times the word faith (pistis) is used in the Gospel of John? Would you believe zero? Anyone who had faith in the Four Gospels was a Gentile. The other uses include Christ's words about how 'little faith' Israel indeed possessed (Matt. 6:30, 8:10, 26, 14:31, etc.). Christ told the disciples, \"Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen.\" Matt. 21:21. Do you suppose that Christ envisions mountains being tossed about like twigs? No. He is telling the disciples that they had NO FAITH! By contrast, Paul uses the word faith 135 times in his letters, and 40 times in Romans alone. In light of this evidence, please try to prove that Paul's Gospel is preached in the Four Gospels. That would be quite impossible, because the precepts of God's grace and faith and Christ's shed blood do not even appear there anywhere. Remember again that Peter preaches water baptism for the forgiveness of sins, even after the crucifixion (Acts 2:38), so obviously he had no clue.\n\n I think I am correct in saying that you say that the gospel of grace and the gospel of the kingdom are two separate messages. You say that only the gospel of grace is intended for us and only the gospel of the kingdom are intended for kingdom Jews. \n \n Let us look back at Matthew 28:19, the risen Jesus says, \"All authority in heaven  and on earth  has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\" What does it mean to have all authority? Does the power of Jesus' saving grace not fall under all   the authority in heaven and on earth? Was Jesus with the apostles always to the close of the age? If he was with them always and if Jesus \"is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8) then how could Jesus himself preach two different Jesus'-one of repentance and works and one of grace?\n \n A similar reading can be found in Mark 16:15  to \"Go into all the world  and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized  will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.\"? Why would a Kingdom Dispensation be preached to everyone, to \"all nations,\" to the \"whole creation\"?\n \n You say that \"Paul's gospel\" does not appear in the four synoptics but it is found, especially in the citation you made from John. I believe your interpretation of those verses is incorrect. Paul's gospel can be found in other places in the synoptics as well if you consider Jesus' entire gospel. But in reverse, one may also see the four synoptics in Paul's writings. Paul sums up the pinnacle of THE gospel in Romans 13:8-10  (cross reference this to Galatians 5:14  and Mark 12:31). Paul tells us that he received the same gospel in many allusions throughout his writings but I will not cite them all here (look to 1 Corinthians 15:1-8 and also cross reference Romans 12:14  with Luke 6:27-28, Romans 12:17  with Matthew 5:30, Romans 13:7 and Mark 12:17  for some examples).\n \n You say that Paul had a different gospel message because Christ appeared to him after he ascended. Yet we must not forget that Christ appeared to the other apostles in resurrected form and probably after the ascension as well. Do you think that Jesus would allow the apostles to continue to preach an erroneous \"good news\" after he appeared to them in resurrected form? Why would he give this message to Paul and not the others? Why would he not give this message to his hand-picked followers? Would he give the power of baptism by the Holy Spirit only to Paul and not the others when the Holy Spirit touched the others so intimately? Let us look to scripture to find the answer.\n \n Jesus foreshadowed the teaching of the Spirit to all of the apostles...John 15:12-15 \"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth  comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.\" What do you believe the Spirit of truth is? What do you think Jesus means when he says that the Spirit of truth will guide the apostles into all the truth? Is not grace part of the truth? What does Jesus mean when he says the Spirit will declare what is his? Is not grace his?\n \n Also in Luke 24:45-48, the resurrected Jesus stood among the apostles and told them, \"'These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.' Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and said to them, 'Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.\" (Note that Jesus said that his message would be preached beginning from Jerusalem. That is, his message was to be preached first to the Jews (in its entirety) then to every single person in the world (in its entirety). I will expound on this later when I address your citation of Matthew 10:5-7).Would the risen Jesus neglect to tell the apostles about his gift of grace if he had explained every other aspect of himself from scripture?\n \n John 20:17  \"Jesus said to her, 'Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending  to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'\" John 20:19-23  \"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week...Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, 'Peace be with you.'...Jesus said to them again, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you. And when he said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.'\" Jesus sent the apostles (after ascending??) just as he was sent from the Father. How was Jesus sent from the Father?-with all authority. Jesus' authority includes grace and the apostles knew this after receiving the Holy Spirit.\n \n Lastly we see the Holy Spirit descend upon the apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2). Was this Spirit an incomplete one? Was it one that did not know about the grace of Christ? One that did not know the ascended Christ?\n \n \nPost 15\n Someone comes along and preaches 'the' truth to you about Christ and His death, burial and resurrection, and the good news that you have eternal life as a gift from God by believing in what He did for you. But, you do not believe it. Instead, you are like Peter and the Twelve who had no faith. So God sends the deluding influence (Satan) and you begin to believe what is false. At that stage of the game, nobody on earth can help you. Who among men is strong enough to break the spell placed upon you by God Himself? Therefore, do not add or take away one dot or dash from Paul's gospel. \n \n What do you mean that Peter and the others had no faith? Mary was commanded by our risen Lord to go and tell the disciples that He had risen. How many of them believed her? \"She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.\" Mark 16:10+11. Can anyone today be saved by God's grace through faith in the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ without believing He was raised from the dead? Absolutely not! And yet, you cannot separate these two messages \"into two unrelated parts\"? We cannot place Paul's gospel into the hearts and minds of the Twelve in the Four Gospels, and we must preach the difference.\n\n \n You say that \"Peter had no clue\" earlier and I find that hard to believe after reading the scripture concerning the words of the resurrected Jesus and the scriptures concerning the Holy Spirit teaching all truth that I explained above. Those scriptures show that Peter did have a clue. Other aspects of scripture demonstrate the same. \n I wonder...Why would Jesus put someone who didn't have a clue in charge of his entire flock (John 21:15-17)? Why would Jesus put him in charge of his own flock?-a flock that was to be united as one--Jews and Gentiles alike? (John 10:16)\n \n Above you act like Peter and the apostles never accepted and believed the resurrection (after all they saw the resurrected Jesus). You say that Peter and the others had no faith. When scripture says that Peter and the others did not believe this does not mean a stubborn, unrelenting, denial. This does not mean that they \"had no faith\" as you said. They were tested in their faith as we all are and in the end their faith prevailed. Jesus helped their faith prevail. Jesus actually guaranteed it in Peter's case...Luke 22:31-32  \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.\" Would Jesus' prayer for Peter be in vain? If Peter's faith did not fail then that means it would succeed. That means he believed in the death, resurrection, and ascension. He believed in the blood sacrifice of Jesus-1 Peter 1:2 \"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ...chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit   for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood...\" What does Peter mean when he speaks of the sprinkling of the blood of Christ? And what do you think Jesus meant when he said in the presence of the apostles  \"Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood  of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\" (Matthew 26:28 and also in the other gospels)? \n \n \nPost 11\n Christ revealed our gospel to Paul Himself, after He acended into the heavenly. Please pay careful attention to Paul's words here: \"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12. Now think about this very carefully. If Christ revealed Paul's gospel to him after Acts 9, how could Christ and the Twelve preach that same good news in Matthew 4 and 10? What you are suggesting is physically impossible. How could Christ preach salvation to anyone through His own death, burial and resurrection that was still future?\n\n Christ could preach salvation to anyone he chose through his death, burial, and resurrection-even before it occurred. He foreshadowed it and promised it--in grace. He promised salvation to come and this was preached in the four synoptics. We cannot put limits on God's saving power for he is all powerful. We cannot bind his saving grace. How do you think the thief on the cross was saved by Jesus? What do you think of Jesus' words \"today you will be with me in paradise?\" Did Jesus preach this man's salvation prior to his ascension?\n \n I have a bit more to say to you Terral but I will follow with other posts due to the length of this one and time constraints.\n \n Peace of Christ",

   "Terral,\n More questions:\n Do you believe that all aspects of the faith must be proved by scripture? \n \n \nPost 17\n Terral's reply << No sir. Both the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) and Paul's gospel (1Cor. 15:1-5) are not required. The first was sent to Israel ONLY. See Matt. 10:5-7. Note all the references to the 'men of Israel' in Acts 2. (vs. 5, 22, \"let all the house of Israel know\" vs. 36). \n \n \n I told you in the previous post that I would write more concerning your interpretation of Matthew 10:5-7. I believe that it means that the gospel will be preached first to the Jews but not that there will be a separate gospel for Jews and Gentiles. \n \n In regard to this, please read the story of the woman at the well in John 4:1-42. Why did Jesus offer a Samaritan salvation even though the story says that Jews had no dealings with Samaritans? Why did the Samaritans believe? \n \n See also Matthew 15:21-28. How does Jesus respond to a Canaanite? Jesus says he has come for the Jews. But he accepted her faith and granted healing. Does this demonstrate that there is no distinction by God of Jew nor Greek nor slave nor free in the four synoptics as well as in Paul's epistles?\n \n \nThe Eunuch was a Gentile? Where on earth did you get that idea? Why is this Gentile traveling to Jerusalem to worship? \"So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship.\" Acts 8:27? Do you suppose that there existed Gentile Temples of Aphrodite there? And why was this Gentile reading from the OT Scriptures? Israel traveled back to Jerusalem from all over the known world, according to the Law. This Eunuch was just one of those making his yearly pilgrimage to the Temple.\n\n Why does the Eunuch, if he is returning year after year to worship (\"making his yearly pilgrimage), not know anything about Isaiah? This was a man who was a minister of the queen of the Ethiopians. A man holding this office was likely of a sufficient age. Being that he did not know Isaiah, is it likely that he was studying Judaism as an outsider or perhaps that he was a new convert to Judaism?\n \n Peace",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Terral opens << Thank you very much for writing. Once again many of your points are mere unsupported opinions, but I shall endeavor to give a thoughtful reply. \n \n Maximus << Aspects of what you say are accurate. But not all of what you say is accurate. It may be true that Peter emphasizes repentance and Paul emphasizes grace. \n \n Terral's reply << My original post is not about what Peter and Paul emphasized about any given topic. Instead, I provided very specific details about precepts contained within the Peter's gospel 'to the circumcised' and Paul's 'gospel to the uncircumcised' (Gal. 2:7), as two totally separate good news messages. Simply cut and paste from my original post and provide us with your evidence that the two are the same.\n \n Maximus << But this distinction does not mean that Peter neglects the work of the Holy Spirit and grace. To say that we are saved by grace is accurate. To say that only \"Paul's gospel\" has power is inaccurate. For there is one gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and within his gospel repentance and good works of all believers, Jew and Gentile alike, are needed.\n \n Terral's reply << You were challenged to build a case against my prevailing view related to the two gospel messages of the New Testament (#1 gospel of the kingdom and #2 gospel of the grace of God). Please do everything within your power to prove that those two distinct messages are the same thing. Only then will your one gospel theory begin to take shape.\n \n Maximus << I think I am correct in saying that you say that the gospel of grace and the gospel of the kingdom are two separate messages. You say that only the gospel of grace is intended for us and only the gospel of the kingdom are intended for kingdom Jews. \n \n Terral's reply << That statement is not entirely accurate. While the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 9:35) was originally only offered to Israel of the flesh (Matt. 10:5-7), after they accepted the Kingdom, then that good news message would be offered to the entire world (Matt. 24:14). During the time of Acts, that Kingdom church (under Peter) was predominately Jewish in nature, while the Grace church (under Paul) was predominately Gentile in nature. \n \n Maximus << Let us look back at Matthew 28:19, the risen Jesus says, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\" What does it mean to have all authority? \n \n Terral's reply << I am a bit surprised that you focused upon that term. Note that Christ had authority to forgive sins back in Matthew 9:6. Christ gave the disciples authority over unclean spirits in Matthew 10:1. John testified that the Father gave Christ the authority of judgment. John 5:27. Christ used the authority He received from the Father to send out these disciples of the kingdom in order that they make disciples of the nations. However, Peter is still going to the circumcised in 50 Ad. (according to Gal. 2:9, speaking of events in Acts 15), because Israel never accepted the Kingdom. Peter would continue offering the kingdom to Israel for the rest of his life in the hope, 'that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.\" Acts 3:19. Peter believed that Christ would return if Israel accepted the Kingdom.\n \n Maximus << Does the power of Jesus' saving grace not fall under all the authority in heaven and on earth? \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. We must remain within the context of what the Text is saying. The commands of Christ to Peter and the disciples are dispensational and according to the Administration of the Kingdom. Note that these new converts to the kingdom were to \"observe all that I have commanded you.\" Matt. 28:20. That includes keeping all of Mosaic Law. Matt. 5:17-19. Our gospel for today is, \"according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, {leading} to obedience of faith.\" Rom. 16:26. In other words, God is making a choice among men through the foolishness of the message preached, \"to save those who believe.\" 1Cor. 1:21. No power or authority given to Christ can change anything pertaining to Paul's gospel.\n \n Maximus << Was Jesus with the apostles always to the close of the age? If he was with them always and if Jesus \"is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8) then how could Jesus himself preach two different Jesus'-one of repentance and works and one of grace?\n \n Terral's reply << Christ gave Peter his Great Commission instructions for the Kingdom of God on earth, as if Israel would accept it, and this gospel of the kingdom would go to the whole world. Christ did not reveal anything to Peter about this invisible 'dispensation of God's grace' that would be contained within the Kingdom Dispensation as a parenthetical administration. None of that would be revealed (Gal. 1:11+12), until after the conversion of the Apostle Paul, after Acts 9. \n \n Yes, Jesus is the same Person, but God's plan includes more than a single New Testament Administration/Household. Peter is building the members of the bride of Christ (See Mark 2:18-20, John 3:29, Rev. 19:5-10) from among Israel of the flesh. Paul is a member of both administrations, but in the end, he turns his back on Israel (Acts 28:28) to complete his mission (See Acts 20:24-28) of building the members of the 'body of Christ' (Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, etc.). \n \n Maximus << A similar reading can be found in Mark 16:15 to \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.\"? Why would a Kingdom Dispensation be preached to everyone, to \"all nations,\" to the \"whole creation\"?\n \n Terral's reply << Yes, we agree that Christ told these Kingdom Apostles (one sent) to go to all the nations. If Israel had accepted the kingdom through Peter and the Twelve, then Christ would have returned and the kingdom would have members from the entire world. Perhaps this will help: \n \n The Law and the prophets prophesied until what? Christ said, \"For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.\" Matt. 11:13. Christ told Israel that John the Baptist was the promised prophet (Mal. 4:5+6). Matt. 11:14. Therefore, the dispensation of the kingdom began with John. All Israel had to do was accept Christ as the King (but they crucified Him) or accept the gospel of the Kingdom from these apostles. But, we all know that Israel did not accept the kingdom. The Apostle Paul was raised up and given our gospel (Gal. 1:11+12) for today. 1Cor. 15:1-5. At the rapture of this Grace Administration Church (1Thes. 4:13-17), then Elijah will again appear on the scene, and 'repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand' will again become 'the' good news of that day. So, the diagram looks something like this from the time John the Baptist appeared:\n \n King(Grace Administration)dom Administration. \n \n The first \"(\" represents the conversion of Paul, while the last \")\" represents the rapture of the Grace Administration Church. Peter's gospel to the circumcised is the only good news message for those in the Kingdom Administration. Paul's gospel to the uncircumcised is for the members of the Grace Administration contained within those two \"( )\". Repentance and water baptism is for members of the kingdom seeking the Messianic Kingdom of Israel on this earth. The 'one baptism' of Eph. 4:5, by the One Spirit (1Cor. 12:13) is for the members of the body of Christ contained within this specific Grace Administration. That is it in a nutshell my friend. You either see it, or you do not.\n \n Is it difficult to believe that God provided us with the Pauline Epistles as Holy Scripture and our own personal mail with specific instructions for the members of this Grace Administration? He also provided the members of the future Kingdom Administration with their own personal mail in the form of the Hebrew Epistles of your New Testament. The Apostle Paul is writing to you and me today as members of the body of Christ. Peter and the other Hebrew writers are writing specifically to the members of the coming Kingdom Administration with instructions that they are to follow. The words of James 2:10 (keeping the whole Law) and James 2:24 (justification by faith and works) will apply to those members of the Kingdom Dispensation. In that day, false teachings will be derived from the mixing of Pauline Doctrine from his Gentile Epistles with the instructions of Peter, John and James for the Kingdom Administration. If we were both members of the coming Kingdom Dispensation, then I would be on your side arguing for repentance and water baptism as vital precepts of the gospel of the kingdom. But, we are not, and those things do not apply to us today.\n \n Maximus << You say that \"Paul's gospel\" does not appear in the four synoptics but it is found, especially in the citation you made from John. I believe your interpretation of those verses is incorrect. \n \n Terral's reply << This is certainly a bold statement about you belief system, but it has no Biblical support at all. In fact, Paul's words in 1Cor. 2:6-8 disprove your theory. If anyone had known about God's plan to redeem us through the crucifixion of Christ, then Satan would have known it also, and would have never crucified Him. No sir. Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16) is according to the 'revelation of the mystery' (Rom. 16:25), and it could not possibly become part of the Scriptural record before Paul himself. After all, Christ revealed it to Paul. Gal. 1:11+12.\n \n Maximus << Paul's gospel can be found in other places in the synoptics as well if you consider Jesus' entire gospel. But in reverse, one may also see the four synoptics in Paul's writings. Paul sums up the pinnacle of THE gospel in Romans 13:8-10 (cross reference this to Galatians 5:14 and Mark 12:31). \n \n Terral's reply << The 'neighbor' language of Mark 12:31 has nothing to do with the evidence in this case. Also, let's please try to stick to the topic at hand. Do you really want to bring the events of Mark 12 into this discussion? Now it is time for you to answer my query: \n \n Do you believe that a person must acknowledge the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ in order to obtain eternal life? 1Cor. 15:1-5? \n \n I believe that you must consent and say \"Yes, absolutely.\" Here is where the rubber meets the road for anything you wish to quote to me from the Four Gospels related to the \"Christ Crucified\" gospel. Yes, we see Christ sending out the Twelve to preach the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 9:35). Matt. 10:5-7. Yes, Christ even told the Disciples of specific events that would take place surrounding His death, burial and resurrection. As it is written, \"And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.\" Mark 8:31. However, what happened when Mary came and told the Disciples that He had risen? \"When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.\" Mark 16:11. \n \n Therefore, do not try and convince me that Peter and the others preached Paul's gospel (1Cor. 15:1-4) in the Four Gospels, when none of them believed it themselves! Paul was sent down by Christ Himself (through a revelation) to submit our gospel to these same disciples (Gal. 2:1-14 (2)) some two decades later. So again, please do not try to convince me that Peter even understood this gospel Paul preached among the Gentiles. Even if Peter did understand this 'wisdom given him' (2Pet. 3:14-16), then it would have been against Christ's Great Commission commands for him to preach it. After all, Peter 'was' sent to water baptize (Mark 16:15+16) disciples, and Paul was not sent to baptize members into the body of Christ. 1Cor. 1:17. \n \n Maximus << Paul tells us that he received the same gospel in many allusions throughout his writings but I will not cite them all here (look to 1 Corinthians 15:1-8 and also cross reference Romans 12:14 with Luke 6:27-28, Romans 12:17 with Matthew 5:30, Romans 13:7 and Mark 12:17 for some examples).\n \n Terral's reply << You are speaking of 'revelations.' And, if you have a point to make concerning the above quotes, then please make it. If Paul's gospel were the same as what Peter and all the others preached, then he could not say this, \"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12. \n \n It is your belief that Christ sent Paul down to Jerusalem to submit this gospel 'which I preach among the Gentiles' (Gal. 2:2) in fear of failure, and that they all preached the same thing. I understand fully that Christ sent Paul to Jerusalem, and that Peter and Paul sat on opposite sides of the table, because each preached something very different. After all, Scripture verifies that Peter preached repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; 'by works and not by faith alone; James 2:24), while Paul preaches forgiveness through His shed blood (Eph. 1:7; not by works; Eph. 2:8+9)).\n \n Maximus << You say that Paul had a different gospel message because Christ appeared to him after he ascended. Yet we must not forget that Christ appeared to the other apostles in resurrected form and probably after the ascension as well. \n \n Terral's reply << Please show us where Christ appeared to anyone other than Paul after his conversion. Also, Peter refers to 'these things' as the 'wisdom given him' (Paul; 2Pet. 3:15). If your theory is correct, why did Peter fail to mention that in reality this wisdom was given to all of them? No sir. I need not twist the words of Scripture to say anything other than what they actually say. This 'wisdom given him' is described by Paul as, \"a wisdom not of this age\" and \"hidden.\" 1Cor. 2:6-8. I am being no more or less specific about these things than Paul and Peter themselves. \n \n Maximus asks some very good questions << Do you think that Jesus would allow the apostles to continue to preach an erroneous \"good news\" after he appeared to them in resurrected form? \n \n Terral's reply << Absolutely not. Who said that the gospel of the kingdom is erroneous? Again, Peter and the other Kingdom Disciples would continue to preach the gospel of the kingdom their entire lives. It is through that good news message that the bride of Christ shall be gathered from among the nations during the coming Kingdom Dispensation. We are being gathered into the body of Christ today through Paul's gospel. Both the Kingdom and Grace Administrations are valid and very important in the plan of God. It is just that mixing together the precepts of those two gospel messages creates a 'different gospel' (#3 from my original post) from what either of those men preached.\n \n Maximus << Why would he give this message to Paul and not the others? \n \n Terral's reply << Why is a question beyond my capabilities to answer. Paul was the prefect choice as steward (Col. 1:25) of this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) being a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37) and a Jewish Pharisee (Phil. 3:5). Christ said, \"Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name's sake.\" Acts 9:15+16. I simply acknowledge that this 'wisdom given him' is associated with the 'gospel' which is 'according to the revelation of the mystery.' Rom. 16:25. Why? Because Peter says that people are distorting this wisdom to their own destruction (2Pet. 3:14-16). \n \n Maximus << Why would he not give this message to his hand-picked followers? \n \n Maximus << You are asking me to speculate on what God and Christ did not do. Christ did send Paul down to Jerusalem to submit this information to Peter, John and James through Paul. Gal. 2:1-14. Still, the end result is that Peter would continue to preach among the circumcised, while Paul and the brethren went to the Gentiles. Gal. 2:9.\n \n Maximus << Would he give the power of baptism by the Holy Spirit only to Paul and not the others when the Holy Spirit touched the others so intimately? \n \n Terral's reply << This question seems out of place. Peter and the others gave the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands. Acts 8:12-17. Yes, Paul also did the same thing, as he also preached the gospel of the kingdom to Israel. Acts 19:1-6. However, those things are beyond the scope of the 'revelation of the mystery,' and are not taught within Paul's thirteen Gentile Epistles to the members of the body of Christ.\n \n Maximus << Jesus foreshadowed the teaching of the Spirit to all of the apostles...John 15:12-15 \"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.\" \n \n Maximus asks << What do you believe the Spirit of truth is? \n \n Terral's reply << The Holy Spirit. Acts 2:1-4. This marked the third offering of the gospel of the kingdom. The first offering was through John the Baptist from God (John 1:6), then through Christ the Son (Matt. 4:17 (23)). So this was Israel's third strike, should they reject it.\n \n Maximus << What do you think Jesus means when he says that the Spirit of truth will guide the apostles into all the truth? \n \n Terral's reply << All truth pertaining to the offering of the Kingdom. If Peter and the other disciples had known 'the truth' pertaining to Paul's gospel, then there would have been no reason for Christ to send Paul to Jerusalem (Gal. 2:1-14).\n \n Maximus << Is not grace part of the truth? What does Jesus mean when he says the Spirit will declare what is his? Is not grace his?\n \n Terral's reply << Now you are really reaching. Remember that prior to the appearance of John the Baptist, all sin was dealt with at the Temple through the Levitical priesthood. The concept of water baptism for the forgiveness of sins is foreign to Mosaic Law. Therefore, Peter's 'repentance and baptism' message for the 'forgiveness of sins' (Acts 2:38) includes God's grace and mercy as the result of His great love. \n \n The gospel of the kingdom is simply a poor vehicle through which to justify a world filled with Gentiles IF Israel does not accept the kingdom. Paul's gospel to the uncircumcised is God's way of building the body of Christ by grace through faith apart from any works at all. And, most importantly, the message is in full power today in spite of Israel's rejection of the Kingdom. While many view Paul's gospel as God's Plan A for humanity, in actuality it was given to Paul in view of Israel's rejection of the gospel of the kingdom. \n \n Maximus << Also in Luke 24:45-48, . . . (Note that Jesus said that his message would be preached beginning from Jerusalem. That is, his message was to be preached first to the Jews (in its entirety) then to every single person in the world (in its entirety). \n \n Maximus asks << Would the risen Jesus neglect to tell the apostles about his gift of grace if he had explained every other aspect of himself from scripture?\n \n Terral's reply << Again, grace was at work in the gospel of the kingdom. The details related to the 'revelation of the mystery' would not be made known, until it was given to Paul.\n \n Maximus << John 20:17 \"Jesus said to her, 'Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them . . .\"\n \n Terral's reply << Yes, and none of them believed her. Mark 16:10+11. Please try to stick to the topic of 'what' was preached, and when and by whom. \n \n Maximus << Lastly we see the Holy Spirit descend upon the apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2). Was this Spirit an incomplete one? Was it one that did not know about the grace of Christ? One that did not know the ascended Christ?\n \n Terral's reply << I am not your straw man to be set up by ridiculous questions. The Holy Spirit began to offer the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 24:14, Acts 8:12) to Israel (Acts 2:22) at Pentecost, according to God's predetermined plan. Peter did not mention salvation by God's grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross in Acts 2, because the Holy Spirit was still offering the Kingdom to Israel. Peter knew everything he had to know about the kingdom of God on earth through the Holy Spirit. Paul's gospel has nothing at all to do with that. \n \n Maximus << You say that \"Peter had no clue\" earlier and I find that hard to believe after reading the scripture concerning the words of the resurrected Jesus and the scriptures concerning the Holy Spirit teaching all truth that I explained above. Those scriptures show that Peter did have a clue. Other aspects of scripture demonstrate the same. \n \n Terral's reply << Peter continued to believe that 'these things,' according to the 'wisdom given him' were 'hard to understand' (2Pet. 3:14-16) almost four decades after the crucifixion (time of the writing of 2Peter). How much less did he understand about these same things in Acts 2? No sir. Paul was sent by Christ to Jerusalem to submit our gospel to Peter and all the other disciples for a good reason; because none of them had a clue. That is why those men from James (Acts 15:24) were disturbing members of the church in Galatia (Gal. 2:4-6).\n \n Maximus << I wonder...Why would Jesus put someone who didn't have a clue in charge of his entire flock (John 21:15-17)? Why would Jesus put him in charge of his own flock?-a flock that was to be united as one--Jews and Gentiles alike? (John 10:16)\n \n Terral's reply << Peter knew everything about the Kingdom church, and nothing about the 'wisdom given him.' You are attempting to oversimplify terms to confuse the third party reader. Shame, shame. The weakness of your position in this debate is becoming more evident.\n \n Maximus << Above you act like Peter and the apostles never accepted and believed the resurrection (after all they saw the resurrected Jesus). \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. I used that reference to prove that none of them preached Christ's death, burial and resurrection in the Four Gospels. After all, they refused to believe that Christ had risen in Mark 16. How many chapters are there in the Gospel of Mark in your Bible? I hope you realize that Mark chapter 16 represents the same time as Matthew 28. Therefore, it is physically and spiritually impossible for Peter or the other disciples to preach Paul's gospel prior to that moment. All of your attempts to force those words into their mouths, in the Four Gospels, are a waste of everyone's time. But, that still leaves us the 'gospel of the kingdom.' Matt. 4:23, 9:35, 24:14. So your one gospel theory is having difficulty remaining above water.\n \n Maximus << You say that Peter and the others had no faith. When scripture says that Peter and the others did not believe this does not mean a stubborn, unrelenting, denial. This does not mean that they \"had no faith\" as you said. They were tested in their faith as we all are and in the end their faith prevailed. Jesus helped their faith prevail. \n \n Terral's reply << Please. Let us try to stay on the topic of the presence of one or several gospel messages being preached in the New Testament. Peter could not preach \"Christ crucified\" in the Four Gospels, if he did not believe it himself. Mark 16:10+11. However, Christ did send Peter out to preach something. Matt. 10:5-7. Scripture calls that message the 'gospel of the kingdom.' Matt. 9:35. Furthermore, your points about what Christ told Peter during that time (Luke 22:31, Matt. 26:28, etc.) are all mute. All you are doing is reinforcing my position all the more. Because, even with all of that information, and all of the things that Scripture does not even mention, Peter still failed to believe He had risen. \n \n Our gospel for today is Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25) as revealed to Him (Gal. 1:11+12) according to the revelation of the mystery. 1Cor. 15:1-5. Today we are saved by God's grace through faith apart from any works at all, period. Rom. 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9. That is a totally different message from the 'repent and be baptized' message of the Four Gospels and remaining Hebrew Epistles. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

Many of them therefore believed...\"\n \n Maximus' question << Why do you think the Bereans tested Paul's teachings by scripture?\n \n Terral's reply << First off, my challenge to Ron was to prove that Paul's teaching concerned the 'only one' Gospel. That information does not appear in the Text. Since Paul is addressing Jews and God fearing Gentiles in the Synagogues (Acts 17:1,10,17) then Paul is preaching the 'good news concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12). Scripture records that the Bereans were testing Paul's teaching by the Scriptures to see \"whether these things were so.\" Acts 17:11. Paul says that our gospel is the one, \"which I preach among the Gentiles.\" Gal. 2:2. \n \n Christ did not send Paul down to Jerusalem to submit the 'gospel of the kingdom' to Peter, John and James. After all, that is the gospel they have been preaching for the past 20 years (repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins; Acts 2:38). Remember again that Paul was preaching both gospel messages. ('gospel of the grace of God'; Acts 20:24, and 'preaching the kingdom'; Acts 20:25). The 'whole purpose' (Acts 20:27) included the preaching of both good news messages for Paul. As our risen Lord says, \"But the Lord said to him, \"Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the GENTILES [gospel of the grace of God] and kings and the SONS OF ISRAEL [gospel of the kingdom].\" Acts 9:15.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Terral,\n \nMaximus << Acts 17:10-12 \"The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea; and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so. Many of them therefore believed...\"\n \n Maximus' question << Why do you think the Bereans tested Paul's teachings by scripture?\n \n Terral's reply << First off, my challenge to Ron was to prove that Paul's teaching concerned the 'only one' Gospel. That information does not appear in the Text. Since Paul is addressing Jews and God fearing Gentiles in the Synagogues (Acts 17:1,10,17) then Paul is preaching the 'good news concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12). Scripture records that the Bereans were testing Paul's teaching by the Scriptures to see \"whether these things were so.\" Acts 17:11. Paul says that our gospel is the one, \"which I preach among the Gentiles.\" Gal. 2:2. \n \n Christ did not send Paul down to Jerusalem to submit the 'gospel of the kingdom' to Peter, John and James. After all, that is the gospel they have been preaching for the past 20 years (repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins; Acts 2:38). Remember again that Paul was preaching both gospel messages. ('gospel of the grace of God'; Acts 20:24, and 'preaching the kingdom'; Acts 20:25). The 'whole purpose' (Acts 20:27) included the preaching of both good news messages for Paul. As our risen Lord says, \"But the Lord said to him, \"Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the GENTILES [gospel of the grace of God] and kings and the SONS OF ISRAEL [gospel of the kingdom].\" Acts 9:15.\n \n\n Paul began preaching the \"kingdom gospel\" (to use your terms). Then he stopped that and began preaching a \"good news gospel of grace.\" There is nothing in the text that I can see where Paul states that he is preaching a different gospel than the one he started preaching. I think this would be a big piece of information to explain to his students. There is no evidence of a transition in his teachings. Can you show me this in scripture?\n \n What do you think Paul meant when he said in Ephesians 3:4 \"When you read this you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit...\" Why does Paul not say that the mystery was revealed to him alone if it was by revelation of Jesus that he received a different gospel?",

   "Terral,\n More specific points concerning the different gospels as you requested:\n \n the apostles say that repentance is necessary in \"both gospels\"--cross reference Matthew 4:17  to Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9, 2 Corinthians 7:10, 2 Timothy 2:25\n \n Paul preaches the \"kingdom\" of God frequently-cross reference Matthew 9:35  with 1 Corinthians 6:9, 1 Corinthians 6:10, 1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21, Ephesians 5:5, Colossians 1:12, Colossians 1:13, Colossians 4:11-Paul calls the Jews present \"fellow workers for the kingdom\" in this verse\n \n The gospel will be preached throughout the world and the end will come--Matthew 24:14  cross referenced to 2 Timothy 4:1-5\n \n Furthermore, previously in Post #7 you attempt to establish conflict between Colossians 2:16-17  and James 2:10  but there is none. Both James and Paul were teaching Jesus' words.\n \n Colossians 2:16-17 corresponds to Jesus' words in Matthew 12:8 and Mark 2:27-28. Jesus demonstrates this when he \"breaks\" the Sabbath apparently (but not truthfully) in Matthew 12:1, Matthew 12:10-12.\n \n James 2:10  corresponds to Jesus' words in Matthew 5:17-19. One should read the whole chapter. Notice also what law James speaks of in James 2:8 \"the royal law\" of Jesus (love one's neighbor) and in James 2:12...\"to be judged under the law of liberty.\" \n \n So it can be seen that Jesus taught both of these precepts secondarily taught by James and Paul. If James and Paul are in conflict then Jesus was in conflict with himself. But we know this is not the case if we read Matthew 5:17. \n \n More on the Law:\n \nTerral's reply << No sir. We must remain within the context of what the Text is saying. The commands of Christ to Peter and the disciples are dispensational and according to the Administration of the Kingdom. Note that these new converts to the kingdom were to \"observe all that I have commanded you.\" Matt. 28:20. That includes keeping all of Mosaic Law. Matt. 5:17-19. Our gospel for today is, \"according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, {leading} to obedience of faith.\" Rom. 16:26. In other words, God is making a choice among men through the foolishness of the message preached, \"to save those who believe.\" 1Cor. 1:21. No power or authority given to Christ can change anything pertaining to Paul's gospel\n\n The converts were to observe all that Christ commanded them but in the new view of the law...not the Old Mosaic Law but the Law viewed in the light of Christ (subsequently that is why Paul spoke so much on works having no power to save--works of the OLD MOSAIC LAW). This is the same law that Paul preaches in Galatians 6:2. Do you believe there is a law in the gospel of grace?\n \n You say that no authority given to Christ can change anything pertaining to Paul's gospel. But Paul has no authority without Christ. Christ has power over Paul.\n \n You have also attempted to put James 2:24  in conflict with Paul's epistles. But again, I say there is no conflict, no separate gospel but one gospel:\n \n The first thing one must do is look at the works of which James speaks in Chapter 2...they are Christian works not works of the Mosaic Law...the \"brethren\" are to show no partiality, give to the poor, love one's neighbor.\n \n The second thing one must do is cross-reference James 2:24  with Romans 2:2-8, Galatians 5:4-6, and Ephesians 2:8-10.\n \n All of the apostles preached the same gospel. One gospel.",

They were the 'go to' people in Jerusalem with regard to anything regarding the Kingdom of God on earth. For example: Philip was in Samaria preaching the 'good news concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12) and baptizing 'men and women alike.' Peter and John were sent by the Apostles in Jerusalem to go and lay hands on them, \"that they might receive the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 8:15), which they did in Acts 8:17. The members of the kingdom within the Corinthian Church believed themselves to be 'of Cephas.' 1Cor. 1:12. Plus each of these kingdom disciples were chosen by the Holy Spirit to pen NT canonized Text regarding the Kingdom. Therefore, they obviously knew a great deal about that subject. \n \n Peter, John and James required instruction on points regarding Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16), which is according to the 'revelation of the mystery' (Rom. 16:25). This is an entirely new administration/household (members of the body of Christ; Rom. 12:4+5). As it is written, \"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles-IF INDEED you have heard of THE STEWARDSHIP [dispensation] OF GOD'S GRACE which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.\" Eph. 3:1-4. \n \n The Holy Spirit chose these particular words, because even many today have not heard of the dispensation of God's grace which was given to Paul for us Gentiles. Christ not only has a Jewish 'bride' (Hosea 2:19+20, John 3:29, Rev. 19:5-10), but He also has a Gentile 'body' (1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, Eph. 5:30, etc.). It was unlawful for Peter or any Jew to even visit unclean Gentiles. Acts 10:28. And yet, Paul calls himself \"Apostle of Gentiles.\" Rom. 11:13. Peter, John and James were led by the Spirit of God into all things pertaining to the bride of Christ, which is the fulfillment of OT Prophecy. Paul (as the steward of this dispensation) and the brethren were led by the Spirit of God into all things pertaining to the body of Christ. The heads of these two administrations met in Jerusalem in Acts 15 of your Bible (Gal. 2). So let's not have a pity party for Peter and the other Kingdom Apostles over the fact that God chose Paul (a Roman citizen/Jewish Pharisee) as steward of this dispensation of God's grace. Those are the simple facts regarding the principals of this post-crucifixion era. Please try reading the NT again as it 'is' written, and not according to your Catholic (works based religion) interpretations. After all, they picked the wrong apostle as head of their man-made church. And both of us know that is the real reason for our current pity party for Cephas. \n \n Maximus original << I wonder...Why would Jesus put someone who didn't have a clue in charge of his entire flock (John 21:15-17)?

Yes, Peter was left in the dark about the 'revelation of the mystery.' But, Christ did send Paul down to Jerusalem to present that to Peter, John and James (Acts 15, Gal. 2). So they were being led by the Spirit into all things. \n \n God used Moses as a steward to bring Israel the Law. Peter was being used as a steward of the kingdom to bring Israel the good news of the Kingdom. In the same way Paul was used to bring us the vital information about the 'mystery of Christ,' and the gospel that is according to the revelation of the mystery. Those are the pure facts in this case, whether you have heard of this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) or not. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

These are the verses I asked you about in my previous post. Why does Paul say that the mystery of Christ was revealed to Jesus' \"holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit\" if it had only been revealed to Paul? Paul is not trying to say that he has received a different, special gospel. When Paul speaks of revelation he is distinguishing that he came to the knowledge of the mystery of Christ by a unique and singular revelation whereas the other apostles came to their knowledge by Christ's teaching when he was on earth and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The content of the revelation was not unique though--it was known by the other apostles. \n \n \nThe Holy Spirit chose these particular words, because even many today have not heard of the dispensation of God's grace which was given to Paul for us Gentiles.

And both of us know that is the real reason for our current pity party for Cephas. \n \n You are getting more belligerent and less insightful as your arguments fail. \n \n Christ's bride is both Jewish and Gentile and his body is made up of every kind of person on the planet. Why do you think Paul conveys the Church as Jesus' bride in Ephesians 5? The concept of the body of Christ does not conflict with the bride of Christ and it does not show separate dispensations.\n \n And you cite Acts 10:28  to show that Peter did not associate with Gentiles? Read the whole verse \"and he [Peter] said to them, 'You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\" Also read Acts 11  and it tells how Peter was criticized for \"going to uncircumcised men.\"\n \n By the way, the Catholic Church did not pick Peter as the head of our Church. Jesus/God did. You have cited the verse plenty of times so you should know that (Matthew 16:18). Jesus picked Peter as the head of His Church--one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. The one Church that has been there since the beginning and the one that has shown consistency and constancy for 2,000 years. \n \n I guess we both should read the New Testament again.\n \n \nTerral's original reply << Peter knew everything about the Kingdom church, and nothing about the 'wisdom given him.'

Yes, Peter was left in the dark about the 'revelation of the mystery.' But, Christ did send Paul down to Jerusalem to present that to Peter, John and James (Acts 15, Gal. 2). So they were being led by the Spirit into all things. \n \n And your scriptural evidence that there was not to be one flock? The evidence that Peter was not to lead that flock? Below you will see that Peter was not left in the dark.\n \n I have been wondering more about Acts 15:7-11 which I previously mentioned. \"Peter rose and said to them, 'Brethren, you know that in the early days  God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.'\" \n \n Peter preached the gospel to the Gentiles in the early days  (although Paul did become a primary apostle to the Gentiles later). What gospel would Peter, being a kingdom disciple who had no clue about the gospel of grace, preach to Gentiles? Would he not have to preach the gospel of the kingdom if that is all he knows? But why would he preach the kingdom gospel to Gentiles when it is strictly for Jews? \n \n Do Peter's words above demonstrate a kingdom gospel, a gospel of grace, or both--one united gospel? Why does Peter, a kingdom apostle who had no clue, say that God made \"no distinction\"   among the Jews and Gentiles? Why does he say that God \"cleansed their hearts by faith?\" Why does Peter say the we shall be \"SAVED THROUGH GRACE   of the Lord Jesus just as they will?\"\n \n I would also like to know what you think of Peter and Paul's collaboration in Rome. What were the kingdom apostle and church apostles doing together?\n \n Also, when did theories of dispensationalism come into being?\n \n I look forward to hearing your responses to these questions, to my points on the kingdom and repentance gospel being preached by Paul, and to Peter's mentioning of the sprinkling of the blood in his epistle as well as Christ's words to the apostles at the last supper stating that we would be saved by his blood. \n \n Peace.",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus << I think it would be better to read Ephesians 3:1-6 instead of just Ephesians 1-4. These are the verses I asked you about in my previous post. Why does Paul say that the mystery of Christ was revealed to Jesus' \"holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit\" if it had only been revealed to Paul? \n \n Terral's reply << Again, Paul is describing a line of revelation that begins with himself in Eph. 3:2 (stewardship of God's grace which was given to ME for you) and finishes with the manifold wisdom being made 'through the church (that's us) to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly.' Eph. 3:10. Along the way others appear within this line of revelation, \"which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has NOW been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit.\" Eph. 3:5. \n \n Remember that Paul is writing this letter to the Ephesians from a prison cell in about 62 Ad., or about a year after the very end of Acts. So the manifold wisdom of the mystery of Christ is NOW being made known to the Apostles and prophets in the spirit some three decades after the crucifixion. Do you see the words in Ephesians 3:10 that say, \"so that the manifold wisdom of God MIGHT NOW be made known . . .\"? So Paul's line of revelation being revealed to us in Ephesians Chapter Three extends into the ages of the future. God is going to use us to teach the heavenly authorities about the power of 'grace,' as He sums up all things in Christ.\n \n Remember that you are trying to prove the existence of a single good news message that is preached by everyone in the NT; that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:23, Acts 8:12) is the same as Paul's gospel (Rom. 16:25) described in 1Cor. 15:1-5. The fact that Paul would later reveal the details of the mystery to everyone else has absolutely nothing to do with what was actually preached by Peter in Acts 2. Why not simply admit that Paul's gospel to the uncircumcised and Peter's to the circumcised (Gal. 2:7) are two totally separate good news messages? I can tell you why. Because that would mean that these two good news messages contained their own specific precepts of doctrine. Since the Roman Catholic Church as incorporated elements from both messages into a third gospel message (#3 from original post), then your admission to this simple fact would serve to destroy the very foundation on which this man-made religion is based. So instead, you ask questions about meaningless points that serve only to confuse the third party reader, and place as much distance between the discussion and my very first post on this thread. If you truly had a case, then you would be making it from the key places in Scripture where the 'gospel' is actually mentioned (Matt. 4:23, 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) and preached (Acts 2:36-38).\n \n Maximus << Paul is not trying to say that he has received a different, special gospel. \n \n Terral's reply << Paul is not describing the gospel in Ephesians 3, other than to say that our membership into His body is 'through the gospel.' (Eph. 3:6). He is describing things associated with the 'administration of the mystery' (Eph. 3:9) which he wrote about in brief in Eph. 1:9+10. This aspect of the mystery is a microcosm of the 'mystery of Christ.' That is why we can gain insight into 'the mystery of Christ' (Eph. 3:4) by reading about the mystery of the administration (which is about New Jerusalem; Gal. 4:26).\n \n Maximus << When Paul speaks of revelation he is distinguishing that he came to the knowledge of the mystery of Christ by a unique and singular revelation whereas the other apostles came to their knowledge by Christ's teaching when he was on earth and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The content of the revelation was not unique though--it was known by the other apostles.\n \n Terral's reply << That is just about the most ridiculous argument I have ever heard relating to the revelation of the mystery. Of course, this is just another of your many unsupported opinions. Please try to prove this statement true using Scripture (GL). So, according to your opinions, everything Paul says in Ephesians 3 is a lie. The 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) was not really and truly given to Paul for us. Instead, Christ gave that to someone else (I would bet you think Peter knew about this hidden wisdom first). And, when Paul says, \"that by revelation there was made known to ME the mystery\", (Eph. 3:3) then he really means \"that by revelation there was made known to Peter and everyone else the mystery.\" Surely 'me' in that verse cannot possibly be referring to Paul. No sir. Once again you seek to twist the truth out of what 'is' actually written in God's Word to fit into your preconceived Catholic dogma. It is for reasons such as this that people are being destroyed (2Pet. 3:14-16). So the content of the 'mystery of Christ' is not unique, and was known by the other apostles. And you boldly profess that without a single shred of evidence of Biblical support. Fine.\n \n Maximus << You are getting more belligerent and less insightful as your arguments fail. \n \n Terral's reply << Surely you jest. Please draw your sword and use anything from Scripture to support your non-existent case. None of my challenges are being met, and you are ignoring the pile of evidence that does support everything I am saying. Instead of trying to prove the existence of your 'one gospel theory,' you are standing within the boundaries of Ephesians 3 and proving yourself a fool. When do you get back into the Four Gospels and prove that the gospel of Matt. 4:23 is the same gospel preached by Paul in 1Cor. 15:1-5? So Peter's gospel of Acts 2 is the same as Paul's gospel. Okay, prove it. If there is truly one gospel, as you say, then those two messages must be the same thing. \n \n Maximus << Christ's bride is both Jewish and Gentile and his body is made up of every kind of person on the planet. Why do you think Paul conveys the Church as Jesus' bride in Ephesians 5? The concept of the body of Christ does not conflict with the bride of Christ and it does not show separate dispensations.\n \n Terral's reply << Bride? Paul never uses the word in any of his 13 Gentile Epistles. NASB. When do you get back onto the subject of the gospel messages that are preached in the NT? Perhaps you intend to sidetrack this debate by jumping all over the Text and making ridiculous assumptions? If you have a case, then make it. Otherwise, please spend time on topics where you can begin to take educated guesses. FYI, this thread is about the gospel messages of the NT; or in your case, the single gospel message. When do you get around to writing a post on that single message? Or do you wish to waste time talking about everything else under the sun first? Thus far, every single word of my original post remains standing. \n \n Maximus << And you cite Acts 10:28 to show that Peter did not associate with Gentiles? Read the whole verse \"and he [Peter] said to them, 'You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\" Also read Acts 11 and it tells how Peter was criticized for \"going to uncircumcised men.\"\n \n Terral's reply << Okay. Show us one more example of Peter going to another Gentile in the entire Bible. Then, show us any of those pillars (Peter, John and James) addressing Gentiles in the first person in any of their Hebrew Epistles. The law says that it is unlawful for a Jew to even visit an unclean Gentile. That is the substance of the truth contained in the verse. James says that the member of the kingdom administration must keep the whole Law. James 2:10. Perhaps God showed Peter that he should not call any man unclean, but still he did not go to another Gentile after Cornelius in Acts 10. And Scripture shows him continuing to go 'to the circumcised' in 50 ad. (Gal. 2:9), which was written in about 57 Ad.. Since Paul did not retract that statement anywhere, then we are lead to believe that Peter never again went to the Gentiles.\n \n Maximus << By the way, the Catholic Church did not pick Peter as the head of our Church. Jesus/God did. You have cited the verse plenty of times so you should know that (Matthew 16:18). Jesus picked Peter as the head of His Church--one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. \n \n Terral's reply << The gospel of the kingdom and the kingdom dispensation is currently held in abeyance by God, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. Rom. 11:25. Then, \"AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT.\" Acts 15:16.\n \n Paul's Gentile (dominant) Church being build through this dispensation of God's grace is not Peter's Kingdom Church. The Kingdom Dispensation is slated to return in full force after the rapture of the current Grace Church (1Thes. 4:13-17). Again, the RC church picked the wrong apostle. \n \n Maximus << I have been wondering more about Acts 15:7-11 which I previously mentioned. \"Peter rose and said to them, 'Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.'\" \n \n Terral's reply << Again, God used Peter to show all of the other Kingdom Disciples that the Gentiles would be justified by faith apart from works. This 'sign' was given to Peter by God through this experience with Cornelius. Acts 10. Peter's testimony here at this meeting would prove vital to the eventual settlement arrived upon by James and the other Kingdom Disciples, even though Peter would never preach to another Gentile, or even address them in the first person in either of his canonized Epistles. Peter's testimony in Acts 15 in no way supports evidence that he preached Paul's gospel prior to that point. After all, Christ still sent Paul down to Peter, John and James to submit the gospel he preached among the Gentiles. Gal. 2:2. If Peter already was preaching Paul's gospel, then there would be no reason for Christ to do so. Oh, that's right, according to your unsupported opinions, Christ did not really reveal anything new to Paul. How convenient. \n \n More of Maximus' unsupported opinion << Peter preached the gospel to the Gentiles in the early days (although Paul did become a primary apostle to the Gentiles later). \n \n Terral's reply << Okay, so why did Christ really send Paul down to Jerusalem in Galatians 2:1-15? According to you, it could not have been to \"submit them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles\" (Gal. 2:2), because Peter has already been preaching that since Acts 10. How stupid of me to actually believe what Scripture says. Okay, I am beginning to see the light. Christ actually sent Paul down so that Peter could explain the ins and outs of the gospel that Christ actually revealed to him in Gal. 1:11+12. So, if I am willing to exchange Paul's name in those verses for Peter's, then my feet shall be planted firmly in the truth. Not! I do not believe that you can actually type those things out, and you actually believe that Peter preached Paul's gospel in Acts 10, before it was even revealed to Paul! \n \n Even More of Maximus's unsupported opinion << What gospel would Peter, being a kingdom disciple who had no clue about the gospel of grace, preach to Gentiles? \n \n Terral's reply << Peter preached a single good news message to everyone after the crucifixion, and that included repentance and water baptism. Christ charged him and the other Kingdom disciples to preach the 'gospel of the kingdom.' Matt. 24:14 (Mark 16:15+16). That is the message he preached in Acts 2 and Acts 10. The only difference is that these Gentiles received the Holy Spirit upon believing. Then Peter ordered the water baptisms. That was the 'sign' given to the Kingdom Apostles that the Gentiles would be saved by God's grace through faith apart from any works at all. It was at the meeting in Jerusalem with Paul that this sign made sense. \n \n Peter calls this 'wisdom given him' 'hard to understand' in 67 Ad.. (2Pet. 3:15+16) And yet, you have Peter preaching it with confidence in Acts 10, before there is any evidence at all that this 'wisdom given him' (Paul) was even yet revealed. BTW, the events of Acts 10 occur between the time of 38 and 40 Ad.. Paul was sent down to submit our gospel to Peter in about 50 Ad.. (Acts 15). How do you suppose Peter managed to preach it, before Paul told him about it? So, you have Christ sending Paul down to submit the gospel he preached among the Gentiles (Gal. 2:2), when really and truly Peter knew about it all the time, and was already preaching it. The sad part is that you really believe that. \n \n Maximus << Would he not have to preach the gospel of the kingdom if that is all he knows? But why would he preach the kingdom gospel to Gentiles when it is strictly for Jews? \n \n Terral's reply << Is that what Christ says? Or did you also make this up? Christ told the Kingdom Disciples, \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\" Matt. 24:14. And also, \"but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.\" Acts 1:8. For the umpteenth time, Israel was to accept this gospel of the kingdom and then the entire world was to be blessed. Peter is still going strictly to the circumcised, according to Paul (Gal. 2:9), because Israel was not accepting the kingdom. Paul turns his back on the gospel of the kingdom and Israel in Acts 28:28.\n \n Maximus << Do Peter's words above demonstrate a kingdom gospel, a gospel of grace, or both--one united gospel? \n \n Terral's reply << Peter preached the gospel of the kingdom his entire life. His Epistles are written to, \"1 Pet 2:9 But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR {God's} OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\" 1Pet. 2:9. Do you see those words, \"A chosen race\"? That chosen race is Israel of the flesh, and a nation of priests. That is the bride that shall be gathered during the coming Kingdom Dispensation. That is the Kingdom Church that Peter started way back in Matthew, and which Elijah shall restore at his coming (Matt. 17:11, Acts 3:22+23, 15:14-18).\n \n Maximus << Why does Peter, a kingdom apostle who had no clue, say that God made \"no distinction\" among the Jews and Gentiles? \n \n Terral's reply << Because, God is the justifier of both (Rom. 3:30). However, you cannot place the words of Paul's gospel into the mouth of Peter in Acts 10, when Paul did not submit it to him until Acts 15. Ohh, you can do whatever you wish, but a reasonable person debating God's Word who actually supports his statements with Scripture cannot.\n \n Maximus << Why does he say that God \"cleansed their hearts by faith?\" Why does Peter say the we shall be \"SAVED THROUGH GRACE of the Lord Jesus just as they will?\"\n \n Terral's reply << God's grace is a key part of anyone being justified through any good news message. \n \n Maximus << I would also like to know what you think of Peter and Paul's collaboration in Rome. What were the kingdom apostle and church apostles doing together?\n \n Terral's reply << Am I supposed to guess about your Scriptural reference? Or is this question about the RC version of the movie? This meeting in Acts 15 is in Jerusalem. Paul says that Peter and the others returned to the circumcised (Gal. 2:9). Did you place an 'un' in front of that word, making it uncircumcised, and suppose that this meant Rome? \n \n Maximus << Also, when did theories of dispensationalism come into being?\n \n Terral's reply << About 60 Ad., \"if indeed you have heard of the stewardship (dispensation) of God's grace which was given to me for you.\" Eph. 3:2. From here: \n \n http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0000766\n \n Topic: Dispensation\n \n <1,,3622,oikonomia< \n primarily signifies \"the management of a household or of household affairs\" (oikos, \"a house,\" nomos, \"a law\"); then the management or administration of the property of others, and so \"a stewardship,\" Luke 16:2-4; elsewhere ONLY IN THE EPISTLES OF PAULl, who applies it (a) to the responsibility entrusted to him of preaching the Gospel, 1 Cor. 9:17 (RV, \"stewardship,\" AV, \"dispensation\"); (b) to the stewardship committed to him \"to fulfill the Word of God,\" the fulfillment being the unfolding of the completion of the Divinely arranged and imparted cycle of truths which are consummated in the truth relating to the Church as the Body of Christ, Col. 1:25 (RV and AV, \"dispensation\"); so in Eph. 3:2, of the grace of God given him as a stewardship (\"DISPENSATION\") in regard to the same \"mystery;\" (c) in Eph. 1:10; 3:9, it is used of the arrangement or administration by God, by which in \"the fullness of the times\" (or seasons) God will sum up all things in the heavens and on earth in Christ. In Eph. 3:9 some mss. have koinonia, \"fellowship,\" for oikonomia, \"dispensation.\" In 1 Tim. 1:4 oikonomia may mean either a stewardship in the sense of (a) above, or a \"dispensation\" in the sense of (c). The reading oikodomia, \"edifying,\" in some mss., is not to be accepted. See STEWARDSHIP. \n \n Note: A \"dispensation\" is not a period or epoch (a common, but erroneous, use of the word), but a mode of dealing, an arrangement, or administration of affairs. Cp. oikonomos, \"a steward,\" and oikonomeo, \"to be a steward.\" \n \n Terral continues << Members of the Roman Catholic Church pretend that this key word does not exist. Therefore, to them, the dispensation of God's grace was not given to Paul for us Gentiles (Eph. 3:2). Christ did not really give Paul our gospel through a revelation (Gal. 1:11+12), and the gospel itself is not according 'to the revelation of the mystery.' Rom. 16:25. No. All of that is part of Peter's gospel to the circumcised, and the two parties at the meeting in Jerusalem (Acts 15) all sat on the same side of the table. And the 'wisdom given him' (Paul) that people distort to their own destruction (2Pet. 3:14-16), well, they just wont worry about that part. After all, \"The content of the revelation was not unique though--it was known by the other apostles.\" (Maximus' quote from above) And the fact that Peter himself found 'these things' 'difficult to understand' (2Pet. 3:16), well, this cannot really be true, as he preached those things to Cornelius years before Paul even knew about it. So, what's to worry about? BTW, you placed the \"Roman Catholic\" label upon yourself. The dispensationalists (there are several different kinds of them) are wrong about a lot of things also. So please do not herd me into that crowd. \n \n Maximus << I look forward to hearing your responses to these questions, to my points on the kingdom and repentance gospel being preached by Paul, and to Peter's mentioning of the sprinkling of the blood in his epistle as well as Christ's words to the apostles at the last supper stating that we would be saved by his blood.\n \n Terral's reply << First off, nobody ever won a debate by asking questions. My request along those lines was offered in light of the fact of your very weak unsupported arguments. Nothing you have said or asked threatens a single word of the original post; not even close. The 'gospel of the kingdom' (#1; water based) is still just that, and Paul's gospel (#2; blood based) is something totally different. Anyone who is lead to destruction, by your distorting of this 'wisdom given him,' deserves your just reward (2Pet. 3:16).\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "Terral,\n \nSo instead, you ask questions about meaningless points that serve only to confuse the third party reader, and place as much distance between the discussion and my very first post on this thread. If you truly had a case, then you would be making it from the key places in Scripture where the 'gospel' is actually mentioned (Matt. 4:23, 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) and preached (Acts 2:36-38).\n\n So first you tell me it would be better to ask questions and now you say stop asking questions because you don't like the ones I ask?\n \n \nSurely you jest. Please draw your sword and use anything from Scripture to support your non-existent case. None of my challenges are being met, and you are ignoring the pile of evidence that does support everything I am saying. Instead of trying to prove the existence of your 'one gospel theory,' you are standing within the boundaries of Ephesians 3 and proving yourself a fool. When do you get back into the Four Gospels and prove that the gospel of Matt. 4:23 is the same gospel preached by Paul in 1Cor. 15:1-5? So Peter's gospel of Acts 2 is the same as Paul's gospel. Okay, prove it. If there is truly one gospel, as you say, then those two messages must be the same thing. \n \n We must be careful how we use the sword of scripture. It is not meant to inflict harm or insult.\n \n I have used plenty of scripture but you only read what you want to read. You only hear what you want to hear. Have you no response to my scripture showing Paul preached the gospel of the kingdom and of repentance? Have you answered my scriptural references on Peter's mentioning of the sprinkling of Jesus' blood or on the teaching of Jesus' himself on the saving power of his blood in the supposed kingdom gospels?\n \n \nTerral's reply << Bride? Paul never uses the word in any of his 13 Gentile Epistles. NASB. When do you get back onto the subject of the gospel messages that are preached in the NT? Perhaps you intend to sidetrack this debate by jumping all over the Text and making ridiculous assumptions? If you have a case, then make it. Otherwise, please spend time on topics where you can begin to take educated guesses. FYI, this thread is about the gospel messages of the NT; or in your case, the single gospel message. When do you get around to writing a post on that single message? Or do you wish to waste time talking about everything else under the sun first? Thus far, every single word of my original post remains standing. \n \n Get back to the subject? Jumping all over the text? Spend time on topics where I can take an educated guess? I am simply responding to topics that you brought up.\n \n Are you saying that Paul is not comparing Jesus and the Church to a husband and his bride in Ephesians 5? Does the word bride have to be mentioned for you to understand that?\n \n \nTerral's reply << Okay. Show us one more example of Peter going to another Gentile in the entire Bible. Then, show us any of those pillars (Peter, John and James) addressing Gentiles in the first person in any of their Hebrew Epistles. The law says that it is unlawful for a Jew to even visit an unclean Gentile. That is the substance of the truth contained in the verse. James says that the member of the kingdom administration must keep the whole Law. James 2:10. Perhaps God showed Peter that he should not call any man unclean, but still he did not go to another Gentile after Cornelius in Acts 10. And Scripture shows him continuing to go 'to the circumcised' in 50 ad. (Gal. 2:9), which was written in about 57 Ad.. Since Paul did not retract that statement anywhere, then we are lead to believe that Peter never again went to the Gentiles.\n\n How many examples more than the two I gave you in Acts do you need? Do you need 5, 10, 20? What more word than the word of scripture do you need? I have shown you Peter's words concerning Gentiles in Acts 10,11, 15. Then you can look at James words on including Gentiles in Acts 15. I'm not sure what more you want. How unclear is the crystal of scripture?\n \n Why do you suppose that Peter's first epistle includes those exiles in Galatia?\n \n \nTerral's reply << The gospel of the kingdom and the kingdom dispensation is currently held in abeyance by God, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. Rom. 11:25. Then, \"AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT.\" Acts 15:16.\n\n Again you quote scripture incompletely. Here is the full writing:\n \n \"Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take \n out of them a people for His name. \"And with this the words of the prophets \n agree, just as it is written: 'After this I will return And will rebuild the\n tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, \n And I will set it up; So that the rest of mankind may seek the LORD, Even all \n the Gentiles who are called by My name, Says the LORD who does all these\n things.' \"Known to God from eternity are all His works. -Acts 15:14-18\n \n Doesn't sound like the kingdom is being held in abeyance.\n \n \nPaul's Gentile (dominant) Church being build through this dispensation of God's grace is not Peter's Kingdom Church. The Kingdom Dispensation is slated to return in full force after the rapture of the current Grace Church (1Thes. 4:13-17). Again, the RC church picked the wrong apostle. \n \n There is no need to pick one apostle over another in that manner. We live by the teachings of both.\n \n \n \nMaximus << I have been wondering more about Acts 15:7-11 which I previously mentioned. \"Peter rose and said to them, 'Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus asks << If Paul preached a different gospel than the synoptics then why do you think two of his friends and disciples were the actual authors of two of the four \"kingdom\" gospels? \n \n Terral's reply << You really need to start another thread Maximus. Who says that they did not also write about Paul's gospel in other letters? Is anyone really qualified to tell you 'why' anyone wrote about any given topic?\n \n Why did Luke write letters to Theophilus (Luke 1:3, Acts 1:1)? Luke writes, \"It seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write {it} out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus.\" Luke 1:3. My feeling is that Luke and Mark had a good perspective of kingdom events by hearing the entire story from a number of eye witness sources. So the answer for Luke is that he felt qualified to write about it to his friend Theophilus, because of his investigations.\n \n Mark was the cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10), who was Paul's main companion until the disagreement at the famous meeting in Jerusalem of Acts 15 (about 50 Ad.). Mark writes about the kingdom, because he is counted among those of the circumcision who are \"fellow workers for the kingdom of God.\" As it is written, \n \n \"Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and {also} Barnabas's cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); and {also} Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me.\" Col. 4:10+11. \n \n The fellow workers for the kingdom believed that if Israel accepted this 'gospel of the kingdom' that the time of refreshing would come from the 'presence of the Lord.' Acts 3:19. Remember again that Paul preached both good news messages. He would also take Timothy and circumcise him ('because of the Jews' Acts 16:3) so that he could also preach both gospel messages. After all, Paul had just lost his two key players for the kingdom in the persons of Barnabas and Mark.\n \n BTW, if we conclude that Paul wrote Hebrews (the only Pharisee of the bunch), then seventeen of the twenty-seven NT books were penned by Paul and his companions. You could also ask why two of the four Gospel accounts were written by men who where not even there. That is a question for the Holy Spirit. \n \n Maximus << Why didn't his followers write about his gospel?\n \n Mark and Luke were companions/followers of Paul. See 2 Timothy 4:11 , Philemon 24, and Colossians 4:10 . \n \n Terral's reply << Do you really believe that over this long expanse of time that only 27 letters were written to members of these two administrations? I believe that all of these key figures wrote hundreds, even thousands, of letters to many people on a variety of topics. Why did the Holy Spirit chose to canonize these accounts from Luke and Mark? Again, that is a question for the Holy Spirit. My guess would be: since Christ revealed the details of the 'mystery' directly to Paul as our steward, then only he was qualified to pen canonized accounts to the members of the body of Christ. \n \n Maximus << \"Matthew published his own Gospel among the Hebrews in their own tongue, when Peter and Paul were preaching the Gospel in Rome and founding the church there. \n \n Terral's reply << We have a NT account of Matthew penned in Hebrew or Aramaic? All of the manuscripts I am aware of are in Greek. And nothing in your Bible even hints at Peter and Paul preaching anything together in Rome or anywhere else. Paul was taken to Rome in chains to stand before Caesar, because he was a Roman citizen. Peter and Paul go opposite directions in Gal. 2:9. Please reveal the source of this Peter and Paul fantasy trip. \n \n Maximus << After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, himself handed down to us in writing the substance of Peter's preaching. \n \n Terral's reply << Mark and Peter also hook up together? Mark is not mentioned again in Acts after he joined Barnabas and they both left Paul (Acts 15:39). In fact, Peter is not mentioned in Acts after this meeting in Jerusalem. How is it that your most important figure and the head of your Church is cut out of the Script in the middle of Acts? Again, where are you getting this information? \n \n Maximus << Luke, the follower of Paul, set down in a book the Gospel preached by his teacher.

I am inclined to believe God's Word over the words of this man. Nothing he says carries an ounce of weight in this debate.

It is wise to ask questions to expose the weaknesses of your debating opponent's position, so that you can mount an aggressive attach on those positions. But by all means stick to the topic at hand. Otherwise, you come off as a bumbling idiot. \"Why didn't his followers write about his gospel?\" Asking me why somebody did not do something hardly qualifies as a stealthy move. By contrast, this question to you seems like a good one, \"How is it that your most important figure and the head of your Church is cut out of the Script in the middle of Acts?\" If the things you are saying were part of God's Word, then you certainly would have used the quotes.

So Peter's message in Acts 2 is the same thing Paul preaches as 'my gospel' (Rom. 2:16, 16:25). Haaa! Your posts have been about everything but proving your one gospel theory.

   "Terral,\n \nTerral's reply << In case you are unaware, your questions have been answered. It is wise to ask questions to expose the weaknesses of your debating opponent's position, so that you can mount an aggressive attach on those positions. But by all means stick to the topic at hand. Otherwise, you come off as a bumbling idiot. \"Why didn't his followers write about his gospel?\" Asking me why somebody did not do something hardly qualifies as a stealthy move. By contrast, this question to you seems like a good one, \"How is it that your most important figure and the head of your Church is cut out of the Script in the middle of Acts?\" If the things you are saying were part of God's Word, then you certainly would have used the quotes. The fact that you are trying to use irrelevant sources to prop up mere fantasy is a telling sign. \n \n \n \nTerral's reply << Where? You say that there is one gospel message. Great! Where is all your Scriptural evidence? So you have gone back to Matthew 4:17, (23) and explained in great detail how this message is the same thing as Paul's gospel (1Cor. 15:1-5). Where? So Peter's message in Acts 2 is the same thing Paul preaches as 'my gospel' (Rom. 2:16, 16:25). Haaa! Your posts have been about everything but proving your one gospel theory. In practically every post I challenge you to prove your one gospel theory. And you have given us plenty of Scripture? That is simply a lie.\n\n Where? In a post about 3 pages ago. Let me re-post it here:\n \n the apostles say that repentance is necessary in \"both gospels\"--cross reference Matthew 4:17  to Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9, 2 Corinthians 7:10, 2 Timothy 2:25\n \n Paul preaches the \"kingdom\" of God frequently-cross reference Matthew 9:35  with 1 Corinthians 6:9, 1 Corinthians 6:10, 1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21, Ephesians 5:5, Colossians 1:12, Colossians 1:13, Colossians 4:11-Paul calls the Jews present \"fellow workers for the kingdom\" in this verse\n \n The gospel will be preached throughout the world and the end will come--Matthew 24:14  cross referenced to 2 Timothy 4:1-5\n \n Furthermore, previously in Post #7 you attempt to establish conflict between Colossians 2:16-17  and James 2:10  but there is none. Both James and Paul were teaching Jesus' words.\n \n Colossians 2:16-17  corresponds to Jesus' words in Matthew 12:8 and Mark 2:27-28. Jesus demonstrates this when he \"breaks\" the Sabbath apparently (but not truthfully) in Matthew 12:1, Matthew 12:10-12.\n \n James 2:10  corresponds to Jesus' words in Matthew 5:17-19. One should read the whole chapter. Notice also what law James speaks of in James 2:8 \"the royal law\" of Jesus (love one's neighbor) and in James 2:12...\"to be judged under the law of liberty.\" \n \n So it can be seen that Jesus taught both of these precepts secondarily taught by James and Paul. If James and Paul are in conflict then Jesus was in conflict with himself. But we know this is not the case if we read Matthew 5:17.\n \n These are direct responses to your quotes. You continually cry that I am avoiding the issue and not staying on topic but everything I have written addresses the issue at hand. I was not aware that these points had been addressed by you. I was not aware that the following points were answered either:\n \n Peter believed in the blood sacrifice of Jesus-1 Peter 1:2 \"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ...chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit   for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood...\" What does Peter mean when he speaks of the sprinkling of the blood of Christ? And what do you think Jesus meant when he said in the presence of the apostles \"Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\" (Matthew 26:28  and also in the other gospels)?\n \n I then showed in response to your post below that James and Paul do not conflict but got no response.\n \nTerral's reply << No sir. We must remain within the context of what the Text is saying. The commands of Christ to Peter and the disciples are dispensational and according to the Administration of the Kingdom. Note that these new converts to the kingdom were to \"observe all that I have commanded you.\" Matt. 28:20. That includes keeping all of Mosaic Law. Matt. 5:17-19. Our gospel for today is, \"according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, {leading} to obedience of faith.\" Rom. 16:26. In other words, God is making a choice among men through the foolishness of the message preached, \"to save those who believe.\" 1Cor. 1:21. No power or authority given to Christ can change anything pertaining to Paul's gospel \n The converts were to observe all that Christ commanded them but in the new view of the law...not the Old Mosaic Law but the Law viewed in the light of Christ (subsequently that is why Paul spoke so much on works having no power to save--works of the OLD MOSAIC LAW). This is the same law that Paul preaches in Galatians 6:2. Do you believe there is a law in the gospel of grace?\n \n You say that no authority given to Christ can change anything pertaining to Paul's gospel. But Paul has no authority without Christ. Christ has power over Paul.\n \n You have also attempted to put James 2:24  in conflict with Paul's epistles. But again, I say there is no conflict, no separate gospel but one gospel:\n \n The first thing one must do is look at the works of which James speaks in Chapter 2...they are Christian works not works of the Mosaic Law...the \"brethren\" are to show no partiality, give to the poor, love one's neighbor.\n \n The second thing one must do is cross-reference James 2:24  with Romans 2:2-8, Galatians 5:4-6, and Ephesians 2:8-10.\n \n All of the apostles preached the same gospel. One gospel.\n \n \nMaximus << Have you no response to my scripture showing Paul preached the gospel of the kingdom and of repentance? \n \n Terral's reply << How many times must I inform you that Paul preached both messages. When do you get down to proving Peter's Acts 2 'gospel' message is the same as Paul's gospel? Instead, we are forced to endure statements about Peter and Mark heading off together; Peter and Paul, and other nonsense. \n \n But why are these messages of the kingdom by Paul (listed above) written in his epistles to the Gentiles??? \n \n \nTerral's reply << Very good; then perhaps you will not be disappointed.

   "Terral,\n I would like to elaborate on my points concerning Jesus' words and the apostles knowledge of the blood sacrifice. \"Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\" Matthew 26:28\n \n Why would Paul advise the Gentiles to participate in the covenant given to the Kingdom? Why would Paul talk to these Gentiles about participating in a work if grace was the only thing needed? Why would Paul talk about participating in a work instituted and given to the Kingdom apostles  at the Last Supper? See the scripture below:\n \n 1 Corinthians 10:16-17  \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 11:27  \"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself.\" (Notice how Paul quotes Jesus in just before the above statement in 1 Corinthians 23-26)\n \n Furthermore, you denounce Catholicism as a religion of works. But we believe in faith and works just as Paul did:\n \n Romans 2:5-8 \"For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing   seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life...\"\n \n Galatians 5:4-6  \"...nothing counts but faith working through love...\"\n \n Ephesians 2:8-10  \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God--not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\"\n \n Philemon 2:12-13  \"...work out your own salvation   with fear and trembling...\"",

Paul preached both #1 and #2. We have been all through that.\n \n Maximus << no words on why both Paul and James words mirror the words of Jesus, \n \n Terral's reply << Let's see: \n \n 1. Paul says that our justification is by faith without works. Rom. 4:5. James says that the kingdom disciple is justified by works and not by faith alone. James 2:24. \n \n 2. Paul says that keeping the Sabbath (one of the Ten Commandments) is a mere shadow of things belonging to Christ, and nobody is to be our judge (Col. 2:16+17). James says that the kingdom disciple must keep the whole Law (James 2:10). \n \n 3. Yes, the words of James (James 2:10) mirror Christ's words in Matthew 5:17-19 and Matt. 28:20, but Paul contradicts Christ by saying, \"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.\" Rom. 6:14. \n \n 4. Christ says to keep the whole Law (Matt. 5:17-19) like Jamas. Paul says, \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\" Rom. 10:4. And you sit there and say that both Paul and James 'mirror' the words of Jesus. \n \n 5. Earth calling Maximus . . . Christ send Paul down to Jerusalem to submit the gospel he preached among the Gentiles to Peter, John and James some two decades after the crucifixion. Gal. 2:2 (Acts 15). The result was the Paul and the brethren went to the Gentiles, while Peter, John and James went to the Jews. Gal. 2:9. If the words of James and Paul 'mirrored' Christ's for those twenty years, then why is Christ sending Paul to Jerusalem? \n \n No sir. Those two separate groups sat on opposite sides of the table. I gave you the story about how the kingdom Jews almost tore Paul's body apart over keeping the Law. Acts 21:20-31. Those Kingdom Jews did not understand the precepts of Grace Doctrine, as it was being dispensed through the steward of this dispensation of God's grace to the Gentiles. The words of Galatians 5:1-18 do not apply to Kingdom Disciples, and those words are in direct opposition to everything James teaches about keeping the whole Law. \n \n Maximus << no response to 1 Peter 5:13 showing that Peter was in Rome with Paul, \n \n Terral's reply << Paul in 1Peter 5:13? \"Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard {him}), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and {so does} my son, Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.\" 1Pet. 5:12-14.\n \n Maximus << no response to Peter's knowledge of the blood sacrifice of Christ as shown in his epistle in 1 Peter 1:2, \n \n Terral's reply << What Peter wrote three decades after the crucifixion proves nothing about what he preached before it. Christ sent Peter and the other disciples out to preach the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 9:35) in Matthew 10:5-7. Peter preached the same 'repentance and water baptism' message after the crucifixion (Acts 2:38), as John the Baptist did in Mark 1:4. The 'good news concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12) was the ONLY good news message to be preached by ANYONE prior to our gospel being revealed to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). And then, even Paul preached this same kingdom message, until Acts 28:28. And yet, Paul also preached the 'gospel of the grace of God' along the way (Acts 20:24). I am confident that this area has been covered thoroughly in this thread. \n \n So the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) is the same \"Christ crucified\" gospel message of the Pauline Epistles? Once again, prove it. Remember, that is your theory, not mine. When you feel ready, please start your own thread on that topic.\n \n Maximus << no words on why Peter wrote to Galatia in 1 Peter...at least I have not seen any adequate response to explain this. \n \n Terral's reply << What? You believe there was only one church in the region? Even so, how does that affect one thing in my original post on the four gospels of the NT? Answering your questions on 1000 unrelated points serves nothing. \n \n Maximus << You keep telling me to respond using scripture but I guess scripture is not good enough for you because that's what I've done. \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. I stopped asking you to prove your 'one gospel' theory, because we both know that is impossible. The fact that there are clearly four distinct good news messages in the NT is the focus of this thread, and all of those points remain. Please remember that you are writing posts on my thread in an attempt to challenge points made at the very top. If your questions do not challenge anything in the first post, the rest is academic. \n \n The gospel of the kingdom is about repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38), and justification by works and not by faith alone (James 2:24). Paul's gospel is about forgiveness through Christ's shed blood (Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20); about salvation by God's grace through faith apart from works (Eph. 2:8+9), and justification by faith apart from works. Rom. 4:5. \n \n Maximus << But why must I prove everything using scripture? You still haven't quoted the scripture for me yet that tells us to do that. I asked you that a while back. \n \n Terral's reply << We are in the Religion section under 'Biblical' Contradictions on a 'One/Four Gospels in the NT' thread. We are supposed to \"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.\" 2Tim. 2:15. The third party reader is here to decide which of us (if either) is accurately handling the word of truth. Plus, the points of my original post are all supported by Scripture. It is your mission (should you decide to accept it) to expose any weakness in the original post by showing that I have used God's Word out of context. Does the NT describe four different good news messages, or just one? \n \n Maximus << Maybe you will respond to a different but relevant question. Where did we get the Bible?\n \n Terral's reply << From God: \"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\" 2Tim. 3:16+17.\n \n Please try to stick to the topic.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

The 'good news concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12) was the ONLY good news message to be preached by ANYONE prior to our gospel being revealed to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). And then, even Paul preached this same kingdom message, until Acts 28:28. And yet, Paul also preached the 'gospel of the grace of God' along the way (Acts 20:24). I am confident that this area has been covered thoroughly in this thread. \n \n What was Peter trying to say then? Was the sacrifice of Christ's blood a part of the Gospel that Peter preached involving water baptism and repentance?\n \n \nMaximus << no words on why Peter wrote to Galatia in 1 Peter...at least I have not seen any adequate response to explain this. \n \n Terral's reply << What? You believe there was only one church in the region? Even so, how does that affect one thing in my original post on the four gospels of the NT? Answering your questions on 1000 unrelated points serves nothing. \n \n I'm just wondering why Peter, a kingdom preacher, was sending a letter to a Gentile church in Galatia. (If in fact it was a Gentile church and not a separate one as you contend).\n \n \nTerral's reply << We are in the Religion section under 'Biblical' Contradictions on a 'One/Four Gospels in the NT' thread. We are supposed to \"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.\" 2Tim. 2:15. The third party reader is here to decide which of us (if either) is accurately handling the word of truth. Plus, the points of my original post are all supported by Scripture. It is your mission (should you decide to accept it) to expose any weakness in the original post by showing that I have used God's Word out of context. Does the NT describe four different good news messages, or just one? \n \n So you don't think all doctrines must be proved from scripture?\n \n \nMaximus << Maybe you will respond to a different but relevant question. Where did we get the Bible?\n \n Terral's reply << From God: \"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\" 2Tim. 3:16+17.\n \n Please try to stick to the topic.\n \n\n This is on topic. And I will soon show you why.\n \n Do you have a collection of scripture called the Bible which you used to start this post? How many books are in your New Testament? How were the letters of scripture compiled? Who decided this many books would be in the New Testament--no more, no less?\n \n Peace.",

   "Hi Maximus:\n \n Yes, I made a typo. I realize that you are defending 4 gospel messages and I am defending a unified gospel.\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. On my thread, you are attempting to prove my assertions to be incorrect. When you start your own thread, and present your 'One Unified Gospel' (which will never happen), then you will be defending a Unified Gospel Theory. There are no vaild points in this post that stand against one thing written in my original. But hey, why not answer a few questions anyway. \n \n Maximus << If Paul was preaching a grace gospel to Gentiles then I'm not sure why he would be including elements of the Kingdom gospel. I'm unsure why he was telling Gentiles to keep Kingdom covenants. This is one of many aspects I have shown that dismiss the idea of four gospels and point to one gospel.\n \n Terral's reply << Aspects? What on earth are you talking about? Are we supposed to guess about which verses of Scripture you are talking about? So you honestly believe that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (#1) is the same as 'Christ crucified' (Paul's gospel #2)?\n \n \"But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness\" 1Cor. 1:23.\n \n \"For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" 1Cor. 2:2.\n \n \"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the {life} which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.\" Gal. 2:20.\n \n So Christ preached 'Christ crucified' as the 'gospel of the kingdom' in Matthew 4:17 (23). Christ sent Peter, John and James out to preach 'Christ crucified' as 'the gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 9:35) in Matthew 10:5-7. It is your view that those words 'gospel of the kingdom' are about Christ dying for our sins and being raised on the third day (1Cor. 15:1-4). Okay, fine. Prove it. \n \n Just how did Christ preach 'Christ crucified' in Matthew 4, some three years before He was crucified?! There is no way I can prove those two distinct 'gospel' messages to be the same. It is impossible. What did Christ preach, \"Crucify Me for your salvation!\"? Please. \n \n You can divert the attention of the third party reader to other things in which you are 'not sure' about all you like. Go ahead . . . I suppose that Christ send Paul down to submit Peter, John and James the gospel he preached among the Gentiles (Gal. 2:2) so that they could then add those elements to the 'gospel of the kingdom' they had been preaching for the past 20 years. And Paul did that in 'fear of failure,' because ??? \n \n If there was only one gospel message for everyone to preach, then there is no reason for Christ to send Paul there in the first place. I wish you all the luck in the world, as you prepare to present us with your One Unified Gospel Theory. Please go ahead and present that for All. Then it will be my turn to show how Scripture has been taken out of context. BTW, it is much easier, and takes less skill, to tear down a house than to build one. \n \n Maximus << Why does Paul say in 1 Corinthians 7:19 \"For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.\"??\n \n Terral's reply << Because, \"Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.\" 1Cor. 7:20. There are members of both groups in the Corinthian congregation. Those who professed to be 'I of Peter' and 'I of Apollos' (1Cor. 1:12) were Kingdom disciples under the Law (James 2:10). The 'commandments of God' to them includes the elements of Mosaic Law. Gentiles have never been under Mosaic Law (Rom. 2:14). \n \n The 'commandments of God' to the uncircumcised include the elements of Grace Doctrine. As Paul writes, \"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.\" 1Cor. 14:37+38. So recognizing Paul as the steward of this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) and his words (in the Gentile Epistles) as the Lord's commandment is a command from God. Since the RC Church (and Maximus) sees Peter as the steward of this dispensation of God's grace, then you are not recognized. Go ahead . . . take this \"wisdom given him\" (2Pet. 3:14-16) and distort it by adding it to the gospel of the kingdom. Create your own 'unified gospel' and sell that to the masses. \n \n We are to preach what Paul calls \"MY GOSPEL and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY which has been KEPT SECRET for long ages past, but NOW is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the COMMANDMENT OF THE ETERNAL GOD . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26. \n \n The 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 12:8) is according to PROPHECY. That is why Isaiah (Isa. 40:3) and Malachi (Mal. 3:1, 4:5+6) could see it. None of the OT prophets saw Paul or our gospel that is according to the revelation of the mystery. And some folks do not see it to this day, because, \"our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world (2Thes. 2:7-12) has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 2Cor. 4:3+4. \n \n You do not see it Maximus, and I know you don't. It is hidden in plain sight. \n \n Maximus << Why does he say in Ephesians 6:1 \"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right, 'Honor your father and mother' (this is the first commandment with a promise)...\"?? \n \n Terral's reply << \"So that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.\" Eph. 6:3. Pauline Doctrine to the members of the body of Christ (Eph. 5:30) includes precepts of Mosaic Law. Paul also says, \"For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the {statement,} \"YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.\" Gal. 5:14. Like the men from James (Acts 15:24) in Galatians 1:7, you are trying to place us under the Law. \n \n More Maximus \"Why\" questions << Why does he quote the 10 Commandments and tell Gentiles to keep this commandment? \n \n Terra's reply << These are good things for the members of the body of Christ to keep in mind in their daily lives, even if they are mere shadows (Col. 2:16+17). This still does not change that fact that we are not under law, but under grace. Rom. 6:14. We should not be surprised that the Commandments of the Lord through Paul (1Cor. 14:37+38) include parts of the Law. \n \n Maxmius' supposition << Could it be that the works Paul dismissed were works of the law yet a moral law of Christianity based on that of Judaism remained in Christ's fulfillment of the law? \n \n Terral's reply << You know what? I will again ask you to try and stay with the topic. We are miles from what was actually preached a 'good news' messages. Please start a thread on Christ's fulfilling Mosaic Law. \n \n Maximus original << no response to 1 Peter 5:13 showing that Peter was in Rome with Paul, \n \n Terral's original reply << Paul in 1Peter 5:13? \"Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard {him}), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and {so does} my son, Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.\" 1Pet. 5:12-14. \n \n Maximus' confusion about 1Pet. 5:13 << Please elaborate. I do not understand the point you are wishing to make.\n \n Terral's reply << I am not wishing anything. You wish that Paul's name appeared in 1Peter 5:13. I quoted the verse before and after to show that Paul is not mentioned in the verses. In fact, Paul's name appears only once after Philemon 1:19, and that is in Peter's warning not to distort the 'wisdom given him.' 2Pet. 3:14-16. Are you thinking Mark and typing Paul? I have already included Mark with the 'the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision.\" Col. 4:11.\n \n Maximus asks << So you don't think all doctrines must be proved from scripture?\n \n Terral's reply << Yes, absolutely, but not ALL DOCTRINES should be proved ON THIS THREAD. Matthew - Revelations (27 books, NT). I understand that is it difficult to stay on topic, when your task is to sow as much discord and confusion as possible. On this thread, please try to stick to the topic. I look forward to reading your 'Unified Gospel' post. GL,\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

There are no vaild points in this post that stand against one thing written in my original. But hey, why not answer a few questions anyway. \n \n As I said in one of my first posts, I agree with you that there are many rich and deep layers of the gospels...many meanings, many messages. But they are all united as one gospel, the gospel of Paul, is the gospel of the apostles, is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Repentance and good works are needed in union with grace.The Gospel of Jesus is comprehensive and complementary. \n \n And I am sorry that you are so defensive that you cannot accept the points I am making as relevant. But they are all relevant because they poke holes in your theory. You say I am attempting to divert the third party reader but the third party reader is not my concern. I am in dialogue with you. I have no veiled, secretive, manipulative intentions. \n \n \nMaximus << If Paul was preaching a grace gospel to Gentiles then I'm not sure why he would be including elements of the Kingdom gospel.

Are we supposed to guess about which verses of Scripture you are talking about? So you honestly believe that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (#1) is the same as 'Christ crucified' (Paul's gospel #2)?\n\n I'm not sure why you have to keep guessing as I have posted these scripture verses twice already. Here they are a third time:\n \n the apostles say that repentance is necessary in \"both gospels\"--cross reference Matthew 4:17  to Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9, 2 Corinthians 7:10, 2 Timothy 2:25\n \n Paul preaches the \"kingdom\" of God frequently-cross reference Matthew 9:35 with 1 Corinthians 6:9, 1 Corinthians 6:10, 1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21, Ephesians 5:5, Colossians 1:12, Colossians 1:13, Colossians 4:11-Paul calls the Jews present \"fellow workers for the kingdom\" in this verse\n \n The gospel will be preached throughout the world and the end will come--Matthew 24:14  cross referenced to 2 Timothy 4:1-5\n \n \n\"But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness\" 1Cor. 1:23.\n \n \"For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" 1Cor. 2:2.\n \n \"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the {life} which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.\" Gal. 2:20.\n \n So Christ preached 'Christ crucified' as the 'gospel of the kingdom' in Matthew 4:17 (23). Christ sent Peter, John and James out to preach 'Christ crucified' as 'the gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 9:35) in Matthew 10:5-7.

It is impossible. What did Christ preach, \"Crucify Me for your salvation!\"? Please. \n \n You ask if Christ preached \"Crucify me for your salvation.\" No, he did not. But he surely did preach a subtle variation of that, \"I will be crucified for your salvation.\" \"I lay down my life willingly for your salvation.\" That's what he preached.\n \n You think Christ did not preach his crucifixion to the apostles and others before it happened? \n \n What do you think Christ was preaching in Matthew 10:38-39, \"and he who does not take up his cross and follow me  is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will loose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.\"\n \n And in Matthew 16:24  when he said \"Take up your cross and follow me?\"\n \n Matthew 26:1-2, \"When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.\" \n \n Take up your cross?? Do you think he was foreshadowing his crucifixion?\n \n What about in John 10:11  when he says outright that he will give his life for others, \"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life  for the sheep.\"\n \n John 10:17-18  \"For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.\"\n \n Do you think Jesus was preaching the crucifixion?\n \n Jesus also preached his resurrection before it occurred:\n \n John 2:19  \"Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.'\" \n \n John 11: 25-26  \"Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection   and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.\"\n \n Matthew 20:28  \"...even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life for the ransom of many.\"\n \n Matthew 12:40  when he says, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\"\n \n \nMaximus << Why does Paul say in 1 Corinthians 7:19 \"For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.\"??\n\n \nTerral's reply << Because, \"Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.\" 1Cor. 7:20. There are members of both groups in the Corinthian congregation. Those who professed to be 'I of Peter' and 'I of Apollos' (1Cor. 1:12) were Kingdom disciples under the Law (James 2:10). The 'commandments of God' to them includes the elements of Mosaic Law. Gentiles have never been under Mosaic Law (Rom. 2:14). \n \n And why is Paul telling them in these verses to shun saying \"I belong to Peter\" or \"I belong to Apollos?\" Why would Paul care if those who are Kingdom disciples say they belong to Peter if there was a lawful division among them?\n \n He tells them that they all belong to Jesus Christ. He tells them there is unity in Jesus, not division.\n \n \nThe 'commandments of God' to the uncircumcised include the elements of Grace Doctrine. As Paul writes, \"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.\" 1Cor. 14:37+38. So recognizing Paul as the steward of this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) and his words (in the Gentile Epistles) as the Lord's commandment is a command from God. Since the RC Church (and Maximus) sees Peter as the steward of this dispensation of God's grace, then you are not recognized. Go ahead . . . take this \"wisdom given him\" (2Pet. 3:14-16) and distort it by adding it to the gospel of the kingdom. Create your own 'unified gospel' and sell that to the masses. \n \n We are to preach what Paul calls \"MY GOSPEL and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY which has been KEPT SECRET for long ages past, but NOW is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the COMMANDMENT OF THE ETERNAL GOD . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26. \n \n The 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 12:8) is according to PROPHECY. That is why Isaiah (Isa. 40:3) and Malachi (Mal. 3:1, 4:5+6) could see it. None of the OT prophets saw Paul or our gospel that is according to the revelation of the mystery. And some folks do not see it to this day, because, \"our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world (2Thes. 2:7-12) has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 2Cor. 4:3+4. \n \n You do not see it Maximus, and I know you don't. It is hidden in plain sight. \n \n You don't think that the Paul preached a gospel that was evident in Old Testament prophecy? What about these references Paul makes to Old Testament prophecy? Paul preached Christ crucified, yes, as your abundant quotes suggest and my first example shows Christ crucified in Old Testament prophecy:\n Deuteronomy 21:23  \"...his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall bury him the same day, for a hanged man is accursed by God...\"\n \n Galatians 3:13-14  \"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us-for it is written, 'Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree'-that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might received the promise of the Spirit through faith.\"\n \n Other Old Testament prophecies that Paul references to show their fulfillment in the Church:\n \n A promise spoken to Israel:\n Hosea 1:10 \"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered. And it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' There it shall be said to them, 'You are sons of the living God.' \"\n \n Paul's application to the Church:\n Romans :22-26\"What if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory, even us whom He called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? As He says also in Hosea: 'I will call them My people, who were not My people, And her beloved, who was not beloved.' 'And it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' There they shall be called sons of the living God.\" \n \n Spoken to Israel -\n Ezekiel 37:27\"My tabernacle also shall be with them; indeed I will be their God, and they shall be My people.\" \n \n Paul's application to the church -\n 2 Cor 6:16\"And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: 'I will dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And they shall be My people.'\" \n \n The promise made to Israel is fulfilled in the Church-the Church made up of Jews and Gentiles alike. The Church that Paul spoke of as one body of Jews and Gentiles in Ephesians 3:6 \"...that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel\"\n \n The Church is the body of Christ as you said and as scripture says. Paul says that the Gentiles are fellow heirs with the Jews and that both are of the same body-the body of Christ-the Church of Christ.\n \n \nMaximus << Why does he say in Ephesians 6:1 \"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right, 'Honor your father and mother' (this is the first commandment with a promise)...\"?? \n \n \n \nTerral's reply << \"So that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.\" Eph. 6:3. Pauline Doctrine to the members of the body of Christ (Eph. 5:30) includes precepts of Mosaic Law. Paul also says, \"For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the {statement,} \"YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.\" Gal. 5:14. Like the men from James (Acts 15:24) in Galatians 1:7, you are trying to place us under the Law. \n \n \n \nMore Maximus \"Why\" questions << Why does he quote the 10 Commandments and tell Gentiles to keep this commandment? \n \n \n \nTerra's reply << These are good things for the members of the body of Christ to keep in mind in their daily lives, even if they are mere shadows (Col. 2:16+17). This still does not change that fact that we are not under law, but under grace. Rom. 6:14. We should not be surprised that the Commandments of the Lord through Paul (1Cor. 14:37+38) include parts of the Law. \n \n So sometimes Paul is speaking to Jews that are in the Churches with Gentiles and that is why he preaches aspects of the kingdom gospel. Sometimes the the Gospel of Grace actually utilizes precepts of the Mosaic Law. Sometimes its just good for the brethren to keep in mind some of the Old Law in their daily lives. Sometimes Paul preaches a kingdom gospel, sometimes he preaches a grace gospel, and at one time he preached both.\n \n \nMaximus original << no response to 1 Peter 5:13 showing that Peter was in Rome with Paul, \n \n \nTerral's original reply << Paul in 1Peter 5:13? \"Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard {him}), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God.

I have already included Mark with the 'the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision.\" Col. 4:11.\n\n I was quoting this verse to show that Peter was, in fact, in Rome. Peter and Paul collaborated in the Church of Rome. This verse does not mention Peter and Paul both. That is obvious. But we all know that Paul was in Rome from other writings. \n \n \n \nMaximus asks << So you don't think all doctrines must be proved from scripture?\n\n \nTerral's reply << Yes, absolutely, but not ALL DOCTRINES should be proved ON THIS THREAD. Matthew - Revelations (27 books, NT). I understand that is it difficult to stay on topic, when your task is to sow as much discord and confusion as possible. On this thread, please try to stick to the topic. I look forward to reading your 'Unified Gospel' post. GL,\n\n Can you please support your tradition that all doctrines should be proved from scripture by quoting the scripture that proves it?\n \n You have 27 books in the New Testament. All Protestant and Catholic Bibles do. These books were canonized by the Catholic Church. No more, no less. You accept the books of the Bible as established by the authority of the Catholic Church yet you do not accept the authority of the Church to interpret the very book that it put together by the power of the Holy Spirit and the protection granted it by Christ? You are following a different gospel than that taught by the Church that established your Bible. Paul told us not to turn to another gospel than the one preached by the Church. \n \n \nThe only gospel message in your Bible that has power today is Paul's Gospel (#2). The Gospel of the Kingdom was rejected by Israel three times (John's death, death of Christ, death of James/Steven). This marked Israel's rejection of the Gospel of the Kingdom from the Father (through John), the Son (through Christ), and the Holy Spirit (death of disciples). Paul totally turned his back on Israel and their good news of the kingdom in Acts 28:28 (61 Ad.). At the death of the last remaining Kingdom Disciple, the dispensation of the kingdom became dormant. God placed that aspect of His plan on the back burner, so that the members of the Body of Christ could be gathered through Paul's Gospel.\n\n So you have told me in these last posts that elements of the Mosaic law are included in Paul's doctrines of Grace, the brethren should keep the 10 commandments in mind in their daily lives even though they are not under the law, Paul participated in and taught the New Covenant with the Kingdom in the Eucharist, and the kingdom disciples and grace brethren interacted together in the same churches. It seems that the dividing line between the Kingdom and Grace dispensations is becoming thinner and thinner.\n \n Peace.",

Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 11:23-27  \"For I received from the Lord  what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, 'This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.' For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\n \n Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself.\" \n \n I am still wondering why Paul would advise the Gentiles to participate in the covenant given to the Kingdom? Why would Paul talk to these Gentiles about participating in a work if grace was the only thing needed? Why would Paul talk about participating in a work instituted and given to the Kingdom apostles at the Last Supper? Was he talking to the Jews in the Corinthian congregation? If so then why does he say that \"we who are many are one body\" by partaking of the one bread? Isn't the Church called the Body of Christ? Why does he say he received this from the Lord? It seems that some of the Kingdom Covenant, some of the Kingdom Gospel, was made known to Paul by revelation and is unified with the Grace Gospel that he received.\n \n (and as a sidenote, if you didn't believe that Paul refers to the Church as the bride of Christ by reading Ephesians 5 then you can also read \n 2 Corinthians 11:2. The fulfillment of Israel's matrimony to Christ as the bride is in the Church's matrimony to Christ as the bride--with Jew and Gentile as members. The Church is the Body of Christ and it is the Bride of Christ)",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus << But they are all united as one gospel, the gospel of Paul, is the gospel of the apostles, is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Repentance and good works are needed in union with grace.The Gospel of Jesus is comprehensive and complementary.\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. The 'gospel of the kingdom' preached by Christ (Matt. 4:17 (23) is not the same thing as \"Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" 1Cor. 2:2. Christ Himself did not send Peter and the others out to preached 'Christ crucified' in Matt. 10:5-7. The focus of the gospel of the kingdom is upon the kingdom of heaven on earth. That is why they preached, \"'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Matt. 10:7.\n \n Maximus << And I am sorry that you are so defensive that you cannot accept the points I am making as relevant. But they are all relevant because they poke holes in your theory. \n \n Terral's reply << There is no reason to be sorry. The points you are trying to make are simply wrong. Poke away.\n \n Maximus << You say I am attempting to divert the third party reader but the third party reader is not my concern. I am in dialogue with you. I have no veiled, secretive, manipulative intentions.\n \n Terral's reply << Then present your one gospel theory on your own thread and stop horsing around. Nothing in your very long post threatens a single point of my post at the top of this thread.\n \n Maximus << the apostles say that repentance is necessary in \"both gospels\"--cross reference Matthew 4:17 to Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9, 2 Corinthians 7:10, 2 Timothy 2:25.\n \n Terral's reply << How can this be? Your premise is that there is just one gospel message, and yet you say 'both.' Paul writes the Romans, saying, \"Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?\" Rom. 2:4. This is your proof that repentance is necessary? Paul also writes the Corinthian Church, \"For the sorrow that is according to {the will} {of} God produces a repentance without regret, {leading} to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.\" 2Cor. 7:10.\n \n Repentance 'can' lead to salvation, but having a change of perception about sin or anything else can lead to many things. The difference is that Israel was bound by Mosaic Law to bring all sin to the priest, and make the necessary animal sacrifices for that sin. That process restored fellowship between that particular person/household and God. Under the gospel of the kingdom, the child of Israel confessed their sins to John the Baptist (or whoever was baptizing). Then they were washed by baptism in water. Matt. 3:6. That water washing process was 'the way' to deal with sin through the 'gospel of the kingdom.' And thus, Peter preached, \"Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the FORGIVENESS OF YOUR SINS; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\" Acts 2:38. Therefore, repentance and water baptism are precepts and vital components of the gospel of the kingdom.\n \n Paul's gospel is a totally different message with the basis of our forgiveness being based upon Christ's shed blood. As it is written, \"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight\n He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him.\" Eph. 1:7-9. We are established, \"according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested.\" Rom. 16:25+26a. Our gospel was revealed to Paul after Acts 9, and nobody preached it for the salvation of anyone prior to Paul. Therefore, the 'gospel of the kingdom' (water based forgiveness) is not the same thing as what Paul calls 'my gospel' (blood based forgiveness). The fact that repentance can lead to salvation does not make it a vital component of Paul's gospel. Paul simply says that we must hear (place self into position of obedience; Rom. 10:17) and believe (Eph. 1:13+14). \n \n Maximus << You ask if Christ preached \"Crucify me for your salvation.\" No, he did not. But he surely did preach a subtle variation of that, \"I will be crucified for your salvation.\" \"I lay down my life willingly for your salvation.\" That's what he preached.\n \n Terral's reply << This thread is not what about Christ taught. It is about the good news messages that are present in the NT. Even if Peter and the other disciples believed Christ's teachings (which they did not; Mark 16:10+11), that changes nothing about what Christ sent them out to preach. Matt. 10:7.\n \n Maximus << You think Christ did not preach his crucifixion to the apostles and others before it happened?\n \n Terral's reply << Your point only serves to prove the point that Peter and the other disciples had no faith. What happened when Mary told them about His resurrection? \"She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.\" Mark 16:10+11. Therefore, none of these disciples preached Christ crucified to anyone in the Four Gospels, because they did not believe it themselves. \n \n You are looking at Christ's teachings using hindsight in light of what Christ revealed to Paul later on. You are placing Paul's gospel into the hearts and minds of Peter and the other disciples during the time of the Four Gospels. Instead of recognizing Paul's gospel as revealed to Paul, later on (Gal. 1:11+12), you are including those precepts into the gospel of the kingdom; creating your own good news message. Therefore, do not be sorry to me about that. I have provided you with all the warnings not to do so. \n \n Maximus << You don't think that the Paul preached a gospel that was evident in Old Testament prophecy? What about these references Paul makes to Old Testament prophecy?\n \n Terral's reply << Nobody could make the connection back to the Old Testament, until Paul did that for us. You think Satan was unaware of OT Scripture? He knows every word of it. But, if he had known about Paul's gospel and God's hidden wisdom, then, \"they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\" 1Cor. 2:8. But, they did crucify the King, because they did not understand it. They did not understand it because Christ had yet to reveal this mystery to Paul or anyone. Satan crucified Christ to stop the King from bringing in the kingdom of heaven to Israel. In doing so, he opened the door for God to redeem us through Christ's shed blood. This explains why Christ revealed our gospel to Paul after the crucifixion, and why nobody in the Four Gospels could preach 'Christ crucified' to anyone. But, Satan has the power to blind \"the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.\" 2Cor. 4:4. \n \n You want to dilute the power of the blood of Christ with water? Go for it, and teach others to do the same, but to your own destruction. 2Pet. 3:14-16 (16). BTW, some among us believe my warnings are an attempt at being mean spirited, but they are not. I honestly have a burden for everyone to see it. \n \n Maximus << Other Old Testament prophecies that Paul references to show their fulfillment in the Church:\n \n Terral's reply << That changes nothing about what was actually preached during the time of the Four Gospels (gospel of the kingdom) and after the conversion of Paul (Christ crucified; 1Cor. 15:1-5). Again, you are using hindsight and using information from Paul's Epistles that Satan (nor anyone) knew about, until after Christ revealed it to Paul. \n \n Maximus << So sometimes Paul is speaking to Jews that are in the Churches with Gentiles and that is why he preaches aspects of the kingdom gospel. \n \n Terral's reply << That is why he teaches aspects of Mosaic Law. Like here: \"But if you bear the name \"Jew\" and rely upon the Law and boast in God, and know {His} will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law, and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth, you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?\" Rom. 2:17-21.\n \n Paul also addresses unbelieving Gentiles, \"But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,\" Rom. 2:5.\n \n Maximus << Sometimes the Gospel of Grace actually utilizes precepts of the Mosaic Law. \n \n Terral's reply << I believe you are confusing terms here. \"Therefore the Law has become our tutor {to lead us} to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.\" Gal. 3:24. Paul writes, \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.\" Rom. 1:16. How can God present any good news message to the Jew first, without aspects of the Law? Didn't Christ come to fulfill the Law? \"Now He said to them, \"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" Luke 24:44. The Apostle Paul/Saul is the Roman Citizen/Pharisee capable of understanding how these things apply to both groups. \n \n Maximus << Sometimes it's just good for the brethren to keep in mind some of the Old Law in their daily lives. \n \n Terral's reply << \"So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.\" Rom. 7:12.\n \n \n Maximus << Sometimes Paul preaches a kingdom gospel, sometimes he preaches a grace gospel, and at one time he preached both.\n \n Terral's reply << At Paul's conversion, the 'good news concerning the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12) was the only game in town. After all, Christ had yet to reveal what Paul calls 'my gospel' (Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.) to anyone. Then the time comes when \"I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face.\" Acts 20:25. But why?? Because of what Paul wrote just prior, \"But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.\" Acts 20:24.\n \n Do not think for a moment that Paul went about arbitrarily preaching whatever he wished. Take these two verses for example: \"They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been FORBIDDEN BY THE HOLY SPIRIT to speak the word in Asia; and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the SPIRIT OF JESUS DID NOT PERMIT THEM.\" Acts 16:6+7.\n \n And these two: \"And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.\" Acts 20:22+23. The Apostle Paul was led by the Spirit to teach and preach according to the will of the Almighty. He was sent to, \"the GENTILES and kings AND the SONS OF ISRAEL; for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name's sake.\" Acts 9:15+16. Therefore, Paul was serving the Spirit in regard to the bride of Christ (under gospel of the kingdom) and the body of Christ (under gospel of the grace of God).\n \n Maximus << You are following a different gospel than that taught by the Church that established your Bible.\n \n Terral's reply << Your points regarding RC Church being an authority on anything miss the mark with me. Nothing they have ever done changes anything about the Word of God. Scripture is God breathed, and not RC Church breathed. Can we please leave your man-made religion out of this discussion? My God man . . . the topic is gospel messages, not who, what, when, where, etc, about the Bible.\n \n Maximus << It seems that the dividing line between the Kingdom and Grace dispensations is becoming thinner and thinner.\n \n Terral's reply << Thinner and thinner to whom? To the third party reader? You said above, \"but the third party reader is not my concern.\" The gospel of the kingdom (#1 from my original post) and Paul's gospel (#2) are still two separate messages. The first (which Israel rejected) is according to prophecy, while the second (Christ crucified) is according to the revelation of the mystery (Rom. 16:25). Some among us know the difference.\n \n \"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\" 2Cor. 4:3+4.\n \n \"Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless, and regard the patience of our Lord {as} salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, as also in all {his} letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as {they do} also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.\" 2Pet. 3:14-16.\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

But yet you reject the ability of that same Church to give the correct interpretation of the books it recognized and authenticated as being God-breathed.\n \n The Catholic Church is man-made, in a sense...made by the God Man, Jesus Christ.

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus << I said there were many messages within the gospel but one united gospel.\n \n Terral's reply << One united gospel? Once again I will ask you to present that one united gospel message on your own thread. GL.\n \n Maximus << Christ gave a new meaning to repentence and sacrifice. And he professed it prior to being Crucified. What do you think Jesus meant when he said \"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice?\" (Matthew 9:13, 12:7) \"Peter's repentance\" was not the repentance of the Old Mosaic Law but one pure of heart. One that gained the mercy of God through grace.\n \n Terral's reply << Christ gave a new meaning to repentance and sacrifice? While I am sure that might apply to a topic on some thread someplace, it certainly has no place here. Scripture says, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and say, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Matt. 4:17. And also, \"Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.\" Matt. 4:23. Then Scripture says, \"Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.\" Matt. 9:35. Then, Christ sent the Twelve out to preach something: \"And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Matt. 10:7.\n \n Again, this thread is not about the meaning of repentance, but it is about the actual 'gospel' messages that appear in our New Testament. John the Baptist, Christ and the Twelve all preached the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM long before the crucifixion. Israel was to accept the good news of the Kingdom of God/Heaven on earth and Christ as her King/Messiah. This is the gospel that ISRAEL REJECTED, by allowing John the Baptist to die in prison (Matt. 14:10); by demanding the crucifixion of Christ (Matt. 27:22-25), and by stoning Steven to death with their own hands (Acts 7:55-60). Then we see Paul raised up (Acts 9), and Christ revealed to him our gospel (Gal. 1:11+12). 1Cor. 15:1-5. 'Peter's repentance'? Baaa! What on earth are you saying? The word grace (charis) is not even used in the entire Gospel of Matthew or in Mark. In fact, the word appears only once outside of John Chapter 1 (Luke 2:40). Each of the five references to 'grace' in the Four Gospels is directly related to Christ Himself, and not to any good news message. \n \n Maximus << Its not about what Christ taught? I thought that was the crux of the matter.\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. \"There Is One Gospel/Four Gospels In The New Testament\". Please start your own thread on the Bible Doctrine board on the Teachings of Christ.\n \n \n Maximus on Mark 16:10+11 << Mary's words concern the resurrection not the crucifixion. \n \n Terral's reply << Paul's Gospel is about the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Please forgive if I use verses that actually contain our primary words, \"Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.\" 1Cor. 15:1-4.\n \n Paul defines this teaching to these same Corinthians, and in this same letter, saying, \"But we preach CHRIST CRUCIFIED, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness.\" 1Cor. 1:23. And again, \"For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him CRUCIFIED.\" 1Cor. 2:2. Paul calls this message \"the gospel of the grace of God.\" Acts 20:24. Paul uses the word 'grace' (charis) more times in Romans Chapter 5 than it appears in all of the Four Gospel accounts combined. The focus of what Paul calls 'my gospel' (Rom. 2:16, 16:25) is about our forgiveness/redemption through Christ's shed blood. Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20. \n \n The focus of the 'gospel of the kingdom' is the kingdom of heaven on earth. Israel was to believe that the kingdom of heaven was indeed 'at hand.' They were to present themselves to John the Baptist, confess their sins and be baptized in water for the forgiveness of their sins. Matt. 3:1-6, Luke 3:1-6, Mark 1:4, etc. That is the message Peter preached in Acts 2, and Philip in Acts 8:12. As it is written, \"But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike.\" Acts 8:12.\n \n Maximus << Are you saying the examples I gave are not evidence that \"Paul's gospel\" is a part of Old Testament propecy? He directly quotes the Old Testament prophecy in reference to his teachings.\n \n Terral's reply << Scripture says, \"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been KEPT SECRET for long ages past, but NOW is manifested . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26. Paul's gospel is definitely not part of OT prophecy. It is impossible for it to be hidden in God (1Cor. 2:6-8) and kept secret for long ages past (Rom. 16:25) AND ALSO revealed as part of OT prophecy. You are missing the mark in understanding what Paul's calls the 'mystery of the gospel.' As it is written, \n \n \"With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and {pray} on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the MYSTERY OF THE GOSPEL, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in {proclaiming} it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.\" Eph. 6:18-20. The gospel of the kingdom (#1 from original post) is according to OT Prophecy, while Paul's gospel (#2 from original post) is according to the revelation of the mystery. \n \n Maximus << And beware that you have not been led astray. Beware that you do not lead others to destruction. Let us both continue to study the Word.\n \n Terral's reply << I understand that Paul's gospel is a totally separate gospel message from the gospel of the kingdom, and that each has its own set of precepts. Paul was sent by our risen Lord to submit the gospel he preached among the Gentiles (Gal. 2:2), because Peter and the others were not aware of it. In fact, Paul condemns Peter over the fact that, \"they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel.\" Gal. 2:14. That meeting in Jerusalem (Acts 15) had two parties seated on opposite sides of the table. Peter, John and James were on the one side (James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars\" Gal. 2:8) with Paul and Barnabas (Gal. 2:8) on the other. If they all preached your single united gospel message, then this meeting should have never taken place. After all, the events of Acts 15 occur some twenty years after the crucifixion, and if they were all preaching one unified Gospel, then Paul had nothing to submit. \n \n I also understand that Peter calls Paul's gospel \"the wisdom given him.\" 2Pet. 3:14-16 (15). Peter also says that this wisdom is \"hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as {they do} also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.\" 2Pet. 3:16. And, even though Scripture provides these warnings, and more (2Cor. 4:3+4), you still insist on blending Paul's gospel and the gospel of the kingdom into a united gospel message. Added to this is the fact that nobody here has had the opportunity to actually read a single word from your essay on this single unified gospel theory. \n \n If I were you, then I also would be reluctant to present such a theory. How are you going to prove that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) is the same message as 'Christ crucified,? (1Cor. 15:1-4) How can you prove that the gospel of the kingdom is according to the revelation of the mystery? Rom. 16:25? That is impossible, because the OT prophets saw John the Baptist and the coming of the Lord (Isaiah 40:3, Malachi 3:1). Therefore, it is you who hold to a belief system that is contrary to what Scripture says, and all of those warnings apply directly to you. \n \n Maximus << So Paul's gospel does contain fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?\n \n Terral's reply << Please continue to ask the same questions over and over again. Your theories shall become more believable, when you replace these questions with solid statements that can be supported by Scripture. \n \n Maximus << Right--nothing the Church has done has changed anything about the Word of God. You have changed the Word though, distorted it, by introducing a foreign interpretation of it. \n \n Terral's reply << The RC Church distorted the 'wisdom given him' (2Pet. 3:14-16) by combining the precepts of the gospel of the kingdom and Paul's gospel together to form a different gospel. They have been selling that counterfeit for the better part of the past 2000 years. Since you have purchased their interpretations hook, line and sinker, then you believe contrary to what is actually written. Did I make up the terms \"gospel of the kingdom\" and what Paul's calls \"my gospel?\" No. Did I invent the fact that Christ sent Paul down through a revelation to present \"to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles.\" Gal. 2:2? Again, no. Peter's gospel to the circumcised (Gal. 2:7) is about repentance and water baptism \"for the forgiveness of sins.\" Acts 2:38. Paul's gospel is about, \"redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace.\" Eph. 1:7. \n \n Am I also making up the fact that one is based on water, while the other is clearly based on Christ's shed blood? No. Instead, you are trying to prove that the gospel of the kingdom and Paul's gospel are the same thing. Instead of accepting Paul as the steward of this dispensation of God's grace (Eph. 3:2), you hold to the Roman Catholic view that Peter is the head of this Grace Dispensation. And you contend that my interpretation if foreign to 'the Word?' The entire discussion is proof of the power of the 'deluding influence.' 2Thes. 2:10-12 (10). \n \n Even though I present you with all the evidence in the world showing these two gospel messages are totally different, you shall continue to insist otherwise; even though you refuse to present us with your one united gospel message theory. Do you not find that quite strange? Even if you managed to prove one word of my original post false (which you have not), then that simply proves me to be in error. It does nothing to support your one gospel theory at all. \n \n Maximus << The Catholic Church's members wrote the Bible, inspired/breathed by God, and the Church protected it from corruption by canonizing the right books and only the right ones. \n \n Terral's reply << None of the writers of Scripture were Catholic.\n \n Maximus << Have you found the verse in scripture yet that proves that each and every doctrine must be proved by scripture?\n \n Terral's reply << What kind of question is that? What's the matter? Scripture does not say what you want it to say? So you wish to bring in the writers of your Roman Catholic dogma? Blaaa! How much value should men ascribe to doctrines that are not supported by God's Word? There are literally thousands of denominations of Christianity in the world today. Nothing any of your Catholic fathers have written can transform the gospel of the kingdom (#1, good news of the Four Gospels and Acts) into Paul's gospel (#2, good news of Paul's Gentile Epistles). I find it amusing that you are willing to place such weight upon the writings of men, when Paul warns that the secrets of men shall be judged according to 'my gospel.' Rom. 2:16. The boundaries of this discussion are the 66 books of our Bible, because we are debating on the Biblical Contradictions Forum. Stop being foolish and try to stick to the topic at hand. \n \n Maximus << Have you any response to my previous post on the Eucharistic Covenant and Paul's teaching on it?\n \n Terral's reply << The phrase \"Eucharistic Covenant\" is not from the Bible. That is the Roman Catholic invention based upon their man-made teachings. Please take that topic to a Roman Catholic Forum, where the subject might sustain some validity. I cannot speculate on things that are not mentioned in Scripture on this Bible Forum.\n \n Maximus << Finally, what is your take on these verses in regard to a separate kingdom and grace dispensation:\n \n Romans 15: 26-27 \"For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 27They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.\"\n \n How have the Gentiles shared in the Jews spiritual blessings if the two were recipients of different dispensations?\n \n Terral's reply << How will may answer change anything pertaining to the gospel of the kingdom versus Paul's gospel? Let's see just how far from the topic at hand we can go. The Gentiles have shared in Israel's spiritual blessings, because of Israel's disobedience. As it is written, \n \n \"What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at {that} law. Why? Because {they did} not {pursue it} by faith, but as though {it were} by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, just as it is written, \"BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\" Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for {their} salvation. For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\" Rom. 9:30-10:4.\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",
