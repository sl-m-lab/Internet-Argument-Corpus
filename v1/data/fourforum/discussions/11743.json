   "Hello here is a helpful work IMHO,\n \n The Core Rules of Netiquette are excerpted from the book Netiquette by Virginia Shea. \n \n \n \"Introduction \n Rule 1: Remember the Human \n Rule 2: Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life \n Rule 3: Know where you are in cyberspace \n Rule 4: Respect other people's time and bandwidth \n Rule 5: Make yourself look good online \n Rule 6: Share expert knowledge \n Rule 7: Help keep flame wars under control \n Rule 8: Respect other people's privacy \n Rule 9: Don't abuse your power \n Rule 10: Be forgiving of other people's mistakes \"\n \n This is the one I am currently reviewing, as I am new here to this forum,\n \n \"Rule 10: Be forgiving of other people's mistakes\n Everyone was a network newbie once. And not everyone has had the benefit of reading this book. So when someone makes a mistake -- whether it's a spelling error or a spelling flame, a stupid question or an unnecessarily long answer -- be kind about it. If it's a minor error, you may not need to say anything. Even if you feel strongly about it, think twice before reacting. Having good manners yourself doesn't give you license to correct everyone else. \n \n If you do decide to inform someone of a mistake, point it out politely, and preferably by private email rather than in public. Give people the benefit of the doubt; assume they just don't know any better. And never be arrogant or self-righteous about it. Just as it's a law of nature that spelling flames always contain spelling errors, notes pointing out Netiquette violations are often examples of poor Netiquette. \"\n \n So I installed ieSpell - Spell Checker add-on for Internet Explorer to help limit some of my errors and I recommend it to others also.\n \n Cheers,\n Vis.",
