   "Well, I can tell you how it works in my dark corner of the universe.\n \n I am straight, my husband is bisexual, and we take the rules of our marriage pretty seriously. It's just that the rules, as they stand, allow for all sorts of interesting and colorful behavior. We go to \"parties\" and since we believe that possessiveness is the forefather of jealousy, and that jealousy destroys trust, neither of us make any claims to the other. He is not My Man, he's my friend, and my partner, and as it happened our friendship was so good, we sealed it between ourselves and our gods, as a permanent committment. Fidelity, we decided early on, had nothing to do with it. Lying is hurtful. Cheating, as we understand it, has a good deal more to do with lying than the act of sex. We are both allowed (within reason) to sleep with whoever we wish so long as we communicate honestly. Our roommates, as it happens, are a lesbian couple and bless them, they find our lifestyle to be out there. Really out there. They are not swingers, but this is because by nature they are both reasonably conservative ladies. Nothing wrong with that. Now they know another couple, also lesbians, who have been together for about 10 years (longer than my hubby and I have been) and that couple believes very much as my husband and I do, and have very similar rules, which are still of course unique to their relationship.\n \n Homosexuality is one thing. Swinging is something else entirely. It tends to be more popular among heterosexual folks, but let's face it, there are more heterosexual folks in the world, and homosexual folks probably have a hard enough time in the dating arena without unnecessarily complicating it. Hopefully, as we grow and change, this trend will seem less pronounced",
