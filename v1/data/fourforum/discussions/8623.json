   "The IAEA scours Georgia for radioactive materials, without entering Pankissi Gorge where Chechen terrorists hide \"dirty bombs\"\n \n \n The IAEA has started a new effort to trace lost radioactive sources (orphan sources) in Georgia, IAEA.org reports. For now, as many as 300 radioactive devices containing Caesium 137 and Strontium 90 have been recovered in Georgia since 1997. IAEA officials say it's important to trace all orphan sources in Georgia because these radioactive sources could be used for radiological dispersal devices (they are usually named \"dirty bombs\") if they fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, Chechen insurgents. \n \n The radioisotope Caesium 137 is a powerful gamma emitter, among the most common radioactive isotope in industrial use that can be found on numerous abandoned factories of Georgia. Strontium 90 sources are used to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), many of them originally located in remote areas of Georgia as stand-alone electrical generators that remain unaccounted for. Both radioisotopes can be collected among scrap metal from abandoned factories and former military bases, and this is exactly what Chechen terrorists make use of. \n \n Though, the IAEA team is scouring Georgian mountains over orphan sources, they never entered the Pankissi Gorge (the place where Chechen insurgents hide out) for fear of their life. Yet, it is exactly in the Pankissi Gorge where Chechen terrorists have been collecting radioactive sources they had been buying up throughout Georgia of late years to make \"dirty bombs\". Therefore, a threat of Chechen \"dirty bombs\" still remains despite the efforts of the IAEA.",
