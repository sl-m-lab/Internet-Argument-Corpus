When Constantine converted and started proclaiming monotheism this rather threw the system into confusion.\n \n More important than all that however is what Gibbon says regarding the Vigin Birth.\n At one time the Church said that Jesus divinity was based on his being without sin.

Sure, he believe that diety may have been above all the others, but he was still a pagan, he even continued to put Sol Invictus on his coins and promote only pagans to the top offices in the empire. \n \n I'd be more inclined to say that while the followers of Christianity as a whole did not intend or want to be a contributing cause to the fall of the empire, there were definitely destabalising elements (towards the Romans at least) within the belief at the time.",
