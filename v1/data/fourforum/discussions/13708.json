And when they respond on the ballot, they do so punatively.\n Just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give ALL Federal Employee's same sex partners bennies on OUR DIME despite DOMA. I'm guessing that some additional Democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies.\n \n You need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences. I believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage. And I count myself amongst that majority.\n\n \n Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.\n \n And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?\n \n And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...\n \n What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...\n \n But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content.",

   "No, they didn't. They voted for homosexual marriage, a special right for a minority which practices an unnatural sexual practice by participating in same gender sex.

   "How does your criticism and complaint about the consequences of advertising your sexuality respond on point to my post in any way? In what way did my post call for, justify or excuse any type of abuse toward homosexuals at all? Even those who are dumb enough to wear T-shirts advertising their sexuality when they apparently, as you do, fully understand the negative repercussions it attracts? What does it say about peoples intellect who continue to repeat actions which they know draw negative attention to themselves? \n \n I clearly disagreed with Jason's claim that this vote in DC was some move towards equality. The whole presumption is a self deceptive lie and a delusion since every single homosexual in america has the exact same rights to marry as every other american does. So homosexual marriage is nothing more than a special right. So try to stay on track and stop, for once in your life trying to pulling out the emotional card and playing the victim. All you people know how to do is dole out the talking points in emotionally charged appeals for sympathy as self promoted victims as if you are a member of some persecuted minority race. First create the situation which paints you as a victim, then call for equality in order to fix the problem you create by playing the poor abused diva. That's the gay agenda's S.O.P. and I reject it as a political ploy which forces us to oppose your emotionally charged manipulation of the society you are dragging down to your communities perverse level with these manipulative antics and tactics which you all practice in lock step like lemmings.\n\n \n \n1.) I am not playing the 'poor abused diva'. I am telling the truth.\n\n \n No, like all of the homosexuals on this forum, you play the victim and act like the world is out to get you. What I can't understand is why you would advertise your sexual preference if you do in fact believe that being gay is as normal as being straight. When was the last time you saw a straight person wearing a shirt proclaiming their sexual proclivity or march in a straight pride parade? And why do you endorse this crazy demand for equality when gays have all of the same rights the rest of us have? It's not like you're an oppressed race or something, hence the victim mentality I'm speaking of.\n \n \n 2.) Implying I'm stupid is not a good move.\n\n \n Is that a threat? Are you going to track me down snuff me out? emoticon_xchicken\n \n \n3.) Until you apologize for these remarks, I will not be responding to anymore of your hate filled, pathetic posts.\n\n \n Is that a promise? emoticon_xbouncer emoticon_xbye\n \n \n4.) Your profile says you're 56. Act your age.\n\n \n I am, that's what infuriates the radical homosexuals around here who try to play the victim card in every debate. They just hate it when I remind them that their talking points wont work with me.\n \n \n5.) Do the world a favor and don't ask people to do something we wouldn't ask of you. Such as the shirt issue. If you wore a shirt that got negative attention (as well as some positive), I would support you, not call you stupid. That is just cruel and uncalled for.\n\n \n If I get threatening feedback when I wear my Jesus loves you T shirt, I confront the person and use the opportunity to explain the gospel message to them boldly and with confidence. You know why? Because I hold no shame or fear for my beliefs and trust in Christ. I know that my relationship with Him is good and right no matter what this world thinks of me for it. And don't think for a minute that atheists and homosexual haters haven't ever attempted to intimidate me. The difference is that I stand up to them and give as good as I get through the word of God. \n \n And I don't have to yell and scream or wear offensive t shirts, or march in wild and outrageous parades which offend all but those who share my beliefs as the homosexual community does every year. This is what I mean by wearing your sexuality on your sleeve and making it your identity. That is why most people don't respect the homosexual community. Because you feel justified in cramming your unnatural sexual proclivities down our throats as if by us knowing about it, somehow makes your sexual confusion right.",

   "We are carrying on the same argument in two places. I moved it all here.\n \n \nIn this post that may have been your current focus of criticism, as misguided as it is. But your general m.o. is to always defend the reprobates against the moral traditionalists. That is just where your loyalties lie Jito, and that's because you have no more solid a moral center than those you defend. \n\n \n Can't you see how absolutely infantile and narrow-minded this stance is (not to mention hugely arrogant, you hardly know my opinion on every matter)? \"If one does not have MY morality (on this one issue) they have none. If they don't think like ME (about this one issue) they are rebrobate.\" There is nothing wrong with my moral center. I simply do not use an ancient text to define it. I use real life. I pay attention to the actions of people and see who is causing whom harm. With that as my guide it is absolutely obvious that, according to my morality, you are in the wrong.\n \n As to what Sister said that I was responding to, I have posted it below. She claims that volunteering in the service is nothing and that Jazy's service in paricular is meaningless simply because he is gay.\n \n I know in the past you have said that homosexuality is no greater sin than many others so - put your money where your mouth is and tell me if you believe we should dismiss the service of all the men in women in the military since, according to your religion, all people are sinners? Tell me you would back someone who made this kind of insult to a heterosexual serviceman. Or maybe, just maybe, you can have the honesty to admit that your attitude against homosexuals is a little more than concern about a sinner.\n \n \nYeah. It cancelled it out when you decided to bend over frontwards, and backwards for the local men. Plus, you said possibly, did you actually go?! Or did you just volunteer and never was shipped out?! Because just volunteering means nothing.emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \nAnd while we're at it, go ahead and prove that Jason ever actually served in the military, on this internet setting. Go on, I challenge you to prove anything he says is true true in reality in any way? \n\n \n As soon as you prove that the personal stuff you have bothered to share about yourself isn't anything but a pack full of lies. Prove you are happily married Christian man who loves his family. Maybe you are just some nutter who eats babies for breakfast.\n \n I will take everyone in here at their word unless there is evidence not to. And even if he were not telling the truth and never served, there are plenty of homosexuals who do and Sister's comments are still out of line.\n \n \nWhat? What are you incoherently rambling on about now, because I have no idea what you are attempting to align me with. What does this statement even mean? So your religion/God/heaven endorses blaming victims for physical violence visited upon them if the perp was gay and insulting the good works of people if they happen to be gay.  And point out via quotes where I have endorsed any violence or oppression against homosexuals in any way rather than just making blanket condemnations which assume I endorse violence against anyone at all for any reason.\n\n \n I am rambling about what is implied below and in your comments about the hypothetical situation where someone wearing a gay pride shirt gets beat up. You say that you condemn violence against anyone out one side of your mouth while out of the other you insinuate that if they were gay they had it coming.\n \n \nAnd I'm not doubting he did join the navy and get beaten up by his fellow soldiers. But I don't believe they attacked him as a gang because he was just a selfless homosexual as he claims to be. I believe he made an inappropriate pass to one or more of these guys and they just had enough of him so they set out to teach him a lesson. If there's one thing I have learned in this life, there are two sides to every story. So just hearing the version from a homosexual who is proven to be biased and dishonest in their objectivity leaves me unsure of what part of his testimony to believe, if any of it.\n\n \n \nOh please Jito. In every post you write, you attempt to dishonestly blame me for the reason you aren't a born again believer in God through Christ Jesus, our Lord, and I have been dealing with you for years on 2 different forums. You are so manipulative and dishonest that you must attempt to blame me for your spiritual condition. How disingenuous can you be to blame me for your hatred for anything right and good in this world as you always promote and defend the lowest moral common denominator in life. You are as spiritually dead and reprobate as those values which you defend here so stop blaming me for your spiritual condition, because neither I nor anyone else can ever prevent you from seeking a higher truth if that is what you chose. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Please, you give yourself far too much credit. I blame you for nothing. You are hardly important enough in my life to have been the cause of anything. You are simply a handy reminder. \n \n \nBe assured Jito that eternity does await you. Of that there is no doubt. If you were even half as enlightened as you claim to be, you would know this without any question at all. And on the contrary, both God and I have given many reasons why you should seek the truth if you chose to truly be spiritually free.

You and the maker chat on the phone this morning? Did he tell you himself, \"hey man, that Leslie chic, I am gonna SO fry her\"? Speaking for the good lord yourself; this an example of that Christian humility?\n \n \nYou know, the regret, the knowledge that they had the opportunity to grasp unconditional love yet they squandered it and even fought against it as they hated those people who told them about the blessings that come with a relationship with the living God of life who made us in His image. If you had acquired any wisdom in this life, these truths would be self evident to you.
