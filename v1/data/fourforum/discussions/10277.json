To have doubts about one's religion is very normal, and every Christian I've ever known well enough to talk about something like that has had them.

That is absolutely not the MO of most Catholics. \n \n However I think Momma T was very much interested in getting converts. At least her accusers claim she was more concerned with soul health than physical health. She encouraged the poor to embrace poverty as it was somehow a means to be closer to god.

   "She encouraged the poor to embrace poverty as it was somehow a means to be closer to god.\n\n \n I think this mentality (which is not limited to Mother Theresa) needs to be explained a bit more here. I don't think she or Jesus (who asserted basically the same thing in Matthew chapter 5) meant that one shouldn't try to get out of poverty if they can. The fact is, there are situations around the planet in 3rd world countries that truly are hopeless. Things aren't going to change and everyone there knows it. There's no middle class capitalist structure in place for the poor to better themselves. It's an American mindset that doesn't understand the concept of truly HAVING to be content in being poor. Does that mean that they wouldn't accept a decent paying job if one came along? No, and I don't think Jesus or Mother Theresa was advocating that they not do so. \n \n I remember the 1st time I was in a 3rd world country, and one of the things that really struck me was how happy many of the poor people there were. The kids were happy, parents were happy, and there was a lot of love in their families. These were people that didn't always know for sure where their next meal was coming from, in a place where the average life expectancy was in the 40s. One of the reasons for this is that they had not been programmed (by capitalism and western society and all it's commercial advertising) to think they should be unhappy unless they had more. Their contentment wasn't tied to what they had or didn't have. These people were obviously a lot more content and happy than many people in American society who live like kings in comparison. I think the whole \"embracing poverty\" simply means to accept what cannot be changed (and make no mistake, it can't for many of these people--believe me) and let one's contentment not be tied to what they have or don't have. It's a very foreign concept to people who live in a more capitalist society. (the U.S. AND Europe.)\n \n I'd also add that I don't really see this as a means of converting, in the case of Mother Theresa or others that have expressed such teaching. It's not like she was proselytizing. In places like India, you generally don't have to tell people they need to get closer to God--they already believe in God (or a god or some sort) and are eager to hear and respect a religious figure.",

Not all evangelism has to be hard sell tactics.\n\n \n As someone coming out of evangelical upbringing, I believe that many evangelicals are changing (and have greatly done so already) in this regard. I think evangelicalism as a movement is slowly becoming more like Catholics in some ways (seeing the benefits of that sort of worship and life)--witnessing though living; but on the flipside, Catholics are becoming more like evangelicals as well over the years too. For instance, JP II has been described by some as basically an 'evangelical pope'. Catholic worship has become more mass-friendly in many cases (the switch from the latin rite to the vernacular is a good example), and in some cases more lively. I think more and more Catholics are becoming more apt to speak openly of their faith (verbal witnessing!!) rather than just go through the motions. IOW, barriers are breaking down some and both groups are taking on what they see as better characteristics the other has. This is a good thing, IMO.\n \n Historically, there are also definitely cases where Catholicism engaged in converting. They just did so in a different (if not more malevolent) way that evangelicals. The Jesuits, for example, would go into new areas and establish converts. Catholics would sometimes convert by conquering earlier on.",

She could have used the prize money to change her life.\n\n \n \n This is more psychology than means.\n \n \nYou know, it's kinda funny when Mother Theresa is apparently the best one can come up with in terms of people to call a hypocrite. The hypocrisy police are getting stretched pretty thin these days, apparently.\n\n \n Just using the womans OWN WORDS.\n \n What you going to do next? Say Marjoe Gortner was only jesting when he made his award winning documentary outting his charlatan practices in the 1970's.\n Nope, no hypocricy there.\n \n \nWhy do you say that? Don't all Christians try to convert others? Especially those who have power over the poorest? Like Bush's Faith Based help programs?\n\n \n Not all conversion methods are the same.\n Mother Teresa used the biblical version that says you should let your good fruit (deeds) bear witness for the Christ so that all who see may beleive.\n \n Unlike the others who simply push a Jack T. Chick tract into your hand and run off, patting themselves on the back or force you to confess love for your newfound faith at the point of a sword.\n \n \n Teresa could very well be a normal human who had doubts and human pains like the rest. She could also have been a void with no inner convictions. A robot on auto-pilot doing what they've always done until they ran out of fuel and crashed...awaiting instructions from a master who never responded.\n She did a lot of good for a lot of people.\n But, in the realm of Christianity, it matters not.\n You can't buy yourway into heaven nor buy faith...the only commodity that's pleasing to the Lord.\n \n Maybe she should have prayed \"Lord I want to believe, help me with my unbelief!\"\n But, I forget, prayer doesn't work and the Lord doesn't exist.\n \n Hopefully she was content with her lot in life...the bible does mention contentment as being something to aspire to.",
