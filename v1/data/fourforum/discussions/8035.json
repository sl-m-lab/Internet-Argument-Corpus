   "United 93 is an emotional experience. Close up shots of the passengers, air traffic controllers and terrorists put us right in the events of 9/11. It all comes back, the planes flying into the twin towers and the Pentagon. We recall Todd Beamer and \"Let's roll\" although the film subdues his call to arms. Paul Greengrass wrote and directed United 93. He spent time with the families of the victims. His is a sympathetic portrayal. Even the terrorists are human. They are obviously nervous and are shown muttering prayers to their god. They believe in their twisted mission. A picture of the U.S. Capitol is posted on the control panel in the cockpit, so we assume it was the target of the 4th plane, not the White House. \n \n MOVIES 100 http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=28",

Can we believe the \"Let's roll!\" recordings?\n\n is there any reason to be skeptical that the passengers called or got calls from their loved ones? some of the calls were recorded. some were emergency hotline calls. and the box that recorded the cockpit sounds was recovered. everything aligns perfectly with the evidence. unless you have a theory that better fits what is given based on the evidence, then on what grounds is the skepticism?\n \n as for whether we are ready for another 9/11 movie, the question itself sounds hypocritical. for weeks and months after the event, the most popular slogan about the towers was \"we will never forget\". now when 9/11 is brought up people dont want to hear about it. whats up with that?",
