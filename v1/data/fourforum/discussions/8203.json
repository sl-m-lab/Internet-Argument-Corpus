New Justice Samuel Alito cast the tie-breaking vote. \n \n \n Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court's majority, said the First Amendment does not protect \"every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or her job.\" \n \n \n The decision came after the case was argued twice this term, once before Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired in January, and again after her successor, Alito, joined the bench.\n\n \n \n \n <snip<",
