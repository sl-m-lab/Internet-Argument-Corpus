Under some interpretations of Shariah, men could attain a divorce simply by stating their intention three times in their wives' presence. \n \n Article 14 would replace a body of Iraqi law that has for decades been considered one of the most progressive in the Middle East in protecting the rights of women, giving them the freedom to choose a husband and requiring divorce cases to be decided by a judge.\n \n If adopted, the shift away from the more secular and egalitarian provisions of the interim constitution would be a major victory for Shiite clerics and religious politicians, who chafed at the Americans' insistence that Islam be designated in the interim constitution as just \"a source\" of legislation. Several writers of the new constitution say they intend, at the very least, to designate Islam as \"a main source\" of legislation.\n \n By rough count, nearly 200 women and men showed up in the fiery heat to hand out fliers and wave white banners in a throng of traffic. \"We want to be equal to everybody - we want human rights for everybody,\" read one slogan. The demonstration came hours before two Sunni Arabs involved in writing the constitution were fatally shot near a Baghdad restaurant, threatening to throw the drafting process into turmoil. \n \n \"We want a guarantee of women's rights in the new constitution,\" said Hannah Edwar, an organizer of the protest. \"We're going to meet with the constitutional committee and make our thoughts known.\" . . .",

   "I don't consider that much of a surprise. Islamic nations, pseudo-democratic or otherwise, are bound by their belief system (Islamic Law) and most that I'm aware of use Islamic jurisprudence as a main source of legislation.\n \n As an example, Syria, in spite of continual US harassment, has a fairly modern constitution with a large percentage of female participation in commerce and government, including high rank positions. When their constitution is examined Islamic Law (primarily Hanafi school) and modified traditional customs dominate the Personal Status section in favor of the husband. But it works for them and that's what being a sovereign nation is all about. \n \n This is just another rejection of US nation building policy.",

   "Islamic Sharia law?\n\n \n Yes. While there are several schools, interpretations, and other complimentry sources, none may be inconsistant with Sharia, which is taken from the Qur'an (Koran). Even translations of the Qur'an are considered invalid in the Islamic faith. \n \n That's the constitutional clause 'The draft of a chapter of the new constitution obtained by The New York Times on Tuesday guarantees equal rights for women as long as those rights do not \"violate Shariah,\" or Koranic law' (among others) that the US insisted on being removed from the first draft. That was, of course, when the US was 'winning the war against foreign terrorists in Iraq' and Emperor Bremer was still in charge. \n \n Many on this forum and others have long argued that attempts of instilling democracy as recognized by Western standards would be in direct conflict with much of Islamic Law, but those arguments were generally dismissed by most Americans as 'We know what's best for the world'.",
