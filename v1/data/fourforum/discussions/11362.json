   "http://www.reason.com/news/show/28582.html\n \n \nOn a June evening two years ago, Dan Rather made many stiff British upper lips quiver by reporting that England had a crime problem and that, apart from murder, \"theirs is worse than ours.\" The response was swift and sharp. \"Have a Nice Daydream,\" The Mirror, a London daily, shot back, reporting: \"Britain reacted with fury and disbelief last night to claims by American newsmen that crime and violence are worse here than in the US.\" But sandwiched between the article's battery of official denials -- \"totally misleading,\" \"a huge over-simplification,\" \"astounding and outrageous\" -- and a compilation of lurid crimes from \"the wild west culture on the other side of the Atlantic where every other car is carrying a gun,\" The Mirror conceded that the CBS anchorman was correct. Except for murder and rape, it admitted, \"Britain has overtaken the US for all major crimes.\"\n \n In the two years since Dan Rather was so roundly rebuked, violence in England has gotten markedly worse. Over the course of a few days in the summer of 2001, gun-toting men burst into an English court and freed two defendants; a shooting outside a London nightclub left five women and three men wounded; and two men were machine-gunned to death in a residential neighborhood of north London. And on New Year's Day this year a 19-year-old girl walking on a main street in east London was shot in the head by a thief who wanted her mobile phone. London police are now looking to New York City police for advice.\n \n None of this was supposed to happen in the country whose stringent gun laws and 1997 ban on handguns have been hailed as the \"gold standard\" of gun control. For the better part of a century, British governments have pursued a strategy for domestic safety that a 1992 Economist article characterized as requiring \"a restraint on personal liberty that seems, in most civilised countries, essential to the happiness of others,\" a policy the magazine found at odds with \"America's Vigilante Values.\" The safety of English people has been staked on the thesis that fewer private guns means less crime. The government believes that any weapons in the hands of men and women, however law-abiding, pose a danger, and that disarming them lessens the chance that criminals will get or use weapons.\n \n The results -- the toughest firearm restrictions of any democracy -- are credited by the world's gun control advocates with producing a low rate of violent crime. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell reflected this conventional wisdom when, in a 1988 speech to the American Bar Association, he attributed England's low rates of violent crime to the fact that \"private ownership of guns is strictly controlled.\" \n \n In reality, the English approach has not re-duced violent crime. Instead it has left law-abiding citizens at the mercy of criminals who are confident that their victims have neither the means nor the legal right to resist them. Imitating this model would be a public safety disaster for the United States.\n \n The illusion that the English government had protected its citizens by disarming them seemed credible because few realized the country had an astonishingly low level of armed crime even before guns were restricted. A government study for the years 1890-92, for example, found only three handgun homicides, an average of one a year, in a population of 30 million. In 1904 there were only four armed robberies in London, then the largest city in the world. A hundred years and many gun laws later, the BBC reported that England's firearms restrictions \"seem to have had little impact in the criminal underworld.\" Guns are virtually outlawed, and, as the old slogan predicted, only outlaws have guns. Worse, they are increasingly ready to use them.\n \n Nearly five centuries of growing civility ended in 1954. Violent crime has been climbing ever since. Last December, London's Evening Standard reported that armed crime, with banned handguns the weapon of choice, was \"rocketing.\" In the two years following the 1997 handgun ban, the use of handguns in crime rose by 40 percent, and the upward trend has continued. From April to November 2001, the number of people robbed at gunpoint in London rose 53 percent.\n \n Gun crime is just part of an increasingly lawless environment. From 1991 to 1995, crimes against the person in England's inner cities increased 91 percent. And in the four years from 1997 to 2001, the rate of violent crime more than doubled. Your chances of being mugged in London are now six times greater than in New York. England's rates of assault, robbery, and burglary are far higher than America's, and 53 percent of English burglaries occur while occupants are at home, compared with 13 percent in the U.S., where burglars admit to fearing armed homeowners more than the police. In a United Nations study of crime in 18 developed nations published in July, England and Wales led the Western world's crime league, with nearly 55 crimes per 100 people.\n \n This sea change in English crime followed a sea change in government policies. Gun regulations have been part of a more general disarmament based on the proposition that people don't need to protect themselves because society will protect them. It also will protect their neighbors: Police advise those who witness a crime to \"walk on by\" and let the professionals handle it. \n \n This is a reversal of centuries of common law that not only permitted but expected individuals to defend themselves, their families, and their neighbors when other help was not available. It was a legal tradition passed on to Americans. Personal security was ranked first among an individual's rights by William Blackstone, the great 18th-century exponent of the common law. It was a right, he argued, that no government could take away, since no government could protect the individual in his moment of need. A century later Blackstone's illustrious successor, A.V. Dicey, cautioned, \"discourage self-help and loyal subjects become the slaves of ruffians.\"\n \n But modern English governments have put public order ahead of the individual's right to personal safety. First the government clamped down on private possession of guns; then it forbade people to carry any article that might be used for self-defense; finally, the vigor of that self-defense was to be judged by what, in hindsight, seemed \"reasonable in the circumstances.\"\n \n The 1920 Firearms Act was the first serious British restriction on guns. Although crime was low in England in 1920, the government feared massive labor disruption and a Bolshevik revolution. In the circumstances, permitting the people to remain armed must have seemed an unnecessary risk. And so the new policy of disarming the public began. The Firearms Act required a would-be gun owner to obtain a certificate from the local chief of police, who was charged with determining whether the applicant had a good reason for possessing a weapon and was fit to do so. All very sensible. Parliament was assured that the intention was to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous persons. Yet from the start the law's enforcement was far more restrictive, and Home Office instructions to police -- classified until 1989 -- periodically narrowed the criteria. \n \n At first police were instructed that it would be a good reason to have a revolver if a person \"lives in a solitary house, where protection against thieves and burglars is essential, or has been exposed to definite threats to life on account of his performance of some public duty.\" By 1937 police were to discourage applications to possess firearms for house or personal protection. In 1964 they were told \"it should hardly ever be necessary to anyone to possess a firearm for the protection of his house or person\" and that \"this principle should hold good even in the case of banks and firms who desire to protect valuables or large quantities of money.\" \n \n In 1969 police were informed \"it should never be necessary for anyone to possess a firearm for the protection of his house or person.\" These changes were made without public knowledge or debate. Their enforcement has consumed hundreds of thousands of police hours. Finally, in 1997 handguns were banned. Proposed exemptions for handicapped shooters and the British Olympic team were rejected.\n \n Even more sweeping was the 1953 Prevention of Crime Act, which made it illegal to carry in a public place any article \"made, adapted, or intended\" for an offensive purpose \"without lawful authority or excuse.\" Carrying something to protect yourself was branded antisocial. Any item carried for possible defense automatically became an offensive weapon. Police were given extensive power to stop and search everyone. Individuals found with offensive items were guilty until proven innocent.\n \n During the debate over the Prevention of Crime Act in the House of Commons, a member from Northern Ireland told his colleagues of a woman employed by Parliament who had to cross a lonely heath on her route home and had armed herself with a knitting needle. A month earlier, she had driven off a youth who tried to snatch her handbag by jabbing him \"on a tender part of his body.\" Was it to be an offense to carry a knitting needle? The attorney general assured the M.P. that the woman might be found to have a reasonable excuse but added that the public should be discouraged \"from going about with offensive weapons in their pockets; it is the duty of society to protect them.\"\n \n Another M.P. pointed out that while \"society ought to undertake the defense of its members, nevertheless one has to remember that there are many places where society cannot get, or cannot get there in time. On those occasions a man has to defend himself and those whom he is escorting. It is not very much consolation that society will come forward a great deal later, pick up the bits, and punish the violent offender.\"\n \n In the House of Lords, Lord Saltoun argued: \"The object of a weapon was to assist weakness to cope with strength and it is this ability that the bill was framed to destroy. I do not think any government has the right, though they may very well have the power, to deprive people for whom they are responsible of the right to defend themselves.\" But he added: \"Unless there is not only a right but also a fundamental willingness amongst the people to defend themselves, no police force, however large, can do it.\"\n \n That willingness was further undermined by a broad revision of criminal law in 1967 that altered the legal standard for self-defense. Now everything turns on what seems to be \"reasonable\" force against an assailant, considered after the fact. As Glanville Williams notes in his Textbook of Criminal Law, that requirement is \"now stated in such mitigated terms as to cast doubt on whether it [self-defense] still forms part of the law.\"\n \n The original common law standard was similar to what still prevails in the U.S. Americans are free to carry articles for their protection, and in 33 states law-abiding citizens may carry concealed guns. Americans may defend themselves with deadly force if they believe that an attacker is about to kill or seriously injure them, or to prevent a violent crime. Our courts are mindful that, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, \"detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an upraised knife.\" \n \n But English courts have interpreted the 1953 act strictly and zealously. Among articles found illegally carried with offensive intentions are a sandbag, a pickaxe handle, a stone, and a drum of pepper. \"Any article is capable of being an offensive weapon,\" concede the authors of Smith and Hogan Criminal Law, a popular legal text, although they add that if the article is unlikely to cause an injury the onus of proving intent to do so would be \"very heavy.\"\n \n The 1967 act has not been helpful to those obliged to defend themselves either. Granville Williams points out: \"For some reason that is not clear, the courts occasionally seem to regard the scandal of the killing of a robber as of greater moment than the safety of the robber's victim in respect of his person and property.\"\n \n A sampling of cases illustrates the impact of these measures:\n \n &#65533; In 1973 a young man running on a road at night was stopped by the police and found to be carrying a length of steel, a cycle chain, and a metal clock weight. He explained that a gang of youths had been after him. At his hearing it was found he had been threatened and had previously notified the police. The justices agreed he had a valid reason to carry the weapons. Indeed, 16 days later he was attacked and beaten so badly he was hospitalized. But the prosecutor appealed the ruling, and the appellate judges insisted that carrying a weapon must be related to an imminent and immediate threat. They sent the case back to the lower court with directions to convict.\n \n &#65533; In 1987 two men assaulted Eric Butler, a 56-year-old British Petroleum executive, in a London subway car, trying to strangle him and smashing his head against the door. No one came to his aid. He later testified, \"My air supply was being cut off, my eyes became blurred, and I feared for my life.\" In desperation he unsheathed an ornamental sword blade in his walking stick and slashed at one of his attackers, stabbing the man in the stomach. The assailants were charged with wounding. Butler was tried and convicted of carrying an offensive weapon. \n \n &#65533; In 1994 an English homeowner, armed with a toy gun, managed to detain two burglars who had broken into his house while he called the police. When the officers arrived, they arrested the homeowner for using an imitation gun to threaten or intimidate. In a similar incident the following year, when an elderly woman fired a toy cap pistol to drive off a group of youths who were threatening her, she was arrested for putting someone in fear. Now the police are pressing Parliament to make imitation guns illegal.\n \n &#65533; In 1999 Tony Martin, a 55-year-old Norfolk farmer living alone in a shabby farmhouse, awakened to the sound of breaking glass as two burglars, both with long criminal records, burst into his home. He had been robbed six times before, and his village, like 70 percent of rural English communities, had no police presence. He sneaked downstairs with a shotgun and shot at the intruders. Martin received life in prison for killing one burglar, 10 years for wounding the second, and a year for having an unregistered shotgun. The wounded burglar, having served 18 months of a three-year sentence, is now free and has been granted &#65533;5,000 of legal assistance to sue Martin.\n \n The failure of English policy to produce a safer society is clear, but what of British jibes about \"America's vigilante values\" and our much higher murder rate?\n \n Historically, America has had a high homicide rate and England a low one. In a comparison of New York and London over a 200-year period, during most of which both populations had unrestricted access to firearms, historian Eric Monkkonen found New York's homicide rate consistently about five times London's. Monkkonen pointed out that even without guns, \"the United States would still be out of step, just as it has been for two hundred years.\"\n \n Legal historian Richard Maxwell Brown has argued that Americans have more homicides because English law insists an individual should retreat when attacked, whereas Americans believe they have the right to stand their ground and kill in self-defense. Americans do have more latitude to protect themselves, in keeping with traditional common law standards, but that would have had less significance before England's more restrictive policy was established in 1967. \n \n The murder rates of the U.S. and U.K. are also affected by differences in the way each counts homicides. The FBI asks police to list every homicide as murder, even if the case isn't subsequently prosecuted or proceeds on a lesser charge, making the U.S. numbers as high as possible. By contrast, the English police \"massage down\" the homicide statistics, tracking each case through the courts and removing it if it is reduced to a lesser charge or determined to be an accident or self-defense, making the English numbers as low as possible. \n \n The London-based Office of Health Economics, after a careful international study, found that while \"one reason often given for the high numbers of murders and manslaughters in the United States is the easy availability of firearms...the strong correlation with racial and socio-economic variables suggests that the underlying determinants of the homicide rate are related to particular cultural factors.\"\n \n Cultural differences and more-permissive legal standards notwithstanding, the English rate of violent crime has been soaring since 1991. Over the same period, America's has been falling dramatically. In 1999 The Boston Globe reported that the American murder rate, which had fluctuated by about 20 percent between 1974 and 1991, was \"in startling free-fall.\" We have had nine consecutive years of sharply declining violent crime. As a result the English and American murder rates are converging. In 1981 the American rate was 8.7 times the English rate, in 1995 it was 5.7 times the English rate, and the latest study puts it at 3.5 times. \n \n Preliminary figures for the U.S. this year show an increase, although of less than 1 percent, in the overall number of violent crimes, with homicide increases in certain cities, which criminologists attribute to gang violence, the poor economy, and the release from prison of many offenders. Yet Americans still enjoy a substantially lower rate of violent crime than England, without the \"restraint on personal liberty\" English governments have seen as necessary. Rather than permit individuals more scope to defend themselves, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government plans to combat crime by extending those \"restraints on personal liberty\": removing the prohibition against double jeopardy so people can be tried twice for the same crime, making hearsay evidence admissible in court, and letting jurors know of a suspect's previous crimes. \n \n This is a cautionary tale. America's founders, like their English forebears, regarded personal security as first of the three primary rights of mankind. That was the main reason for including a right for individuals to be armed in the U.S. Constitution. Not everyone needs to avail himself or herself of that right. It is a dangerous right. But leaving personal protection to the police is also dangerous.\n \n The English government has effectively abolished the right of Englishmen, confirmed in their 1689 Bill of Rights, to \"have arms for their defence,\" insisting upon a monopoly of force it can succeed in imposing only on law-abiding citizens. It has come perilously close to depriving its people of the ability to protect themselves at all, and the result is a more, not less, dangerous society. Despite the English tendency to decry America's \"vigilante values,\" English policy makers would do well to consider a return to these crucial common law values, which stood them so well in the past. \n",

   "What puzzles me is that Gun control advocates will not change their unrealistic ideas when presented the facts. It didn't work in DC, it didn't work in the UK.

If you believe government statistics then gun crime is at its lowest level for years. Police travel in twos because it's easier to catch people when there's more than one of you. It's been standard practise for years in lots of countries. The armour is mostly stab-proof and is largely to counter the rise in gang-related knife crime. It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).",

I just know that gun crime is at a lower level now than it has been for years. That said, outside organised crime, it was never a huge problem in this country anyway...\n \n \nSo you have gang problems that warrant more than one officer?\n\n \n In some cities. Indeed gang-related crime is on the rise in many inner cities. However having 2 cops makes more sense on the basis that it's a hell of a lot easier to catch someone when there are more of you. Ever tried herding an animal? Works better with more than 1 person....\n \n \nHow high has knife crime rates climbed?\n\n \n 19 teenage knife murders in London so far this year. It's a terrible statistic.\n \n \nIf the death toll from stabbings reaches higher then a certain amount, then the reduction in death by gunfire is a moot point since the number of death is in the same range.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but that doesn't make sense. It means that the death toll from guns has dropped, and that the death toll from knives has risen. Given that knife and gun crime are not normally committed by the same bracket of person, it means that the problem has changed. You can't argue that it doesn't matter because the same number of people have died. If banning guns results in the reduction of deaths by shooting, then it's worked. If knife crime then picks up it means that something then has to be done about that!\n \n \nSure sounds appropriate to me.

   "By default via uber govt regulation, yes. \n\n \n No they haven't a Socialist Government would not even bother with regulation they would just Nationalise the whole thing and put it under public control.\n \n If you want an example of this look at what the Labour Government of 1945 did with Coal mining and the Steel Industry. In my opinion the 1945 Government where the only Socialist Government the UK ever had. They enacted many Socialist policies including Nationalisation, Free public Health Care, and State owned public transport.\n \n I am starting to think that you don't even know what Socialism is, it seems to me that anything you don't agree with gets branded as Socialist.\n \n \nBasically. You cannot own property without paying yearly rent to the state\n\n \n That is called taxes it just so happens at the tax system in the UK has a tax on property and on income. Tax is not solely a Socialist ideal. Near enough every country in the World has some kind of tax system. Are you going to call them Socialist as well?\n \n \nNational Health System and Public Education? Yeah, you're right. No socialism here. Move along...\n\n \n Not just a Socialist idea, for example Scotland has had Public Education since 1496. If you know anything about the National Health System in the UK that the original idea for a free public health system came from Beveridge Report. This was commissioned in 1941 when we had a Collation Government of Conservatives and the Labour Party. \n \n I think before we even continue the discussion about this you should really define what you believe Socialism is.",

Please bear in mind that the percentages don&#8217;t tell the whole story as the overall crime rate is much lower over here (in terms of murder at least).\n\n \n Not really, I'm a large picture kind of person. If the number of gun-related deaths is lower than pre-dunblane, but the number of knife-related deaths is higher than pre-dunblane then all that says is the number of deaths isn't really changing, just the method of death.\n \n I don't know any details about the people that prefer to carry a knife or a bat compared to those that carry a gun. Some studies suggest a criminal will just use whatever's available to them at the time, other studies suggest that a criminal will go after what they feel is most effective regardless of the restrictions.\n \n \nBut don&#8217;t you see how that merely leads to a climate of escalation?\n\n \n I just see it as a matter of evolution of society. In the 1920s and 30s police were armed with revolvers chambered in .38 Special, and while this was a fine gun it was wholly inadequate for dealing with the steel armoring that the moonshine runners were employing simply because it was traveling too slow to punch through, so they later adopted the .357 Magnum.\n \n I don't think it's so much of a matter of escalation as it is a matter of the times and technology changing and everybody realizing that they need to follow in order to stay afloat.\n \n Classic example. Bad guys used to ride horses, then one day they began to use cars instead since they could go faster and provided better protection against getting shot by law enforcement. Police eventually began doing the same thing. Is this confrontation escalation or changing to meet the times?\n \n In 1997 two criminals robbed a bank in California and they were covered in layers of body armor that could stop handgun and shotgun rounds easily. They were essentially tanks. SWAT had to come in with rifles to finally take these two down, and since then it's becoming a growing trend for police to be issued patrol rifles. Is this confrontation escalation or simply addressing the fact that times are changing?\n \n \nBatons-knives-guns-AP rounds-tanks-God knows what! Because gun carrying is rare in the UK a policeman with a baton is enough to deter most criminals. If a gun is involved tactical squads are available to deal with it. \n\n \n Maybe, but I wouldn't want to be using a short stick if somebody was armed with a machete, or worse a sword. I'm not gonna want to fight somebody with one of those unless I have a 2:1 length ratio over them.\n \n \nNo, it&#8217;s a reductio ad absurdum and therefore not totally serious. I&#8217;m more worried about people making home-made explosives than people smuggling rocket launchers in. As a rule the UK exports those sorts of things....\n\n \n Who're your clients?\n \n \nBecause you carry a gun.... Those of us who are unarmed feel intimidated by a trained person waving a rather heavy and scary looking baton. As next to no people carry guns, there isn&#8217;t a need to tool up to overpower the suspect.\n\n \n I don't carry one yet, haven't gotten my permit. I just don't find a stick all that intimidating.\n \n \nI&#8217;ve been to DC a lot, and I&#8217;ve never heard of this. I haven&#8217;t been for a few years, so it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ve missed it. Do you have a source?\n\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/04/AR2008070402356.html \n \n \nTrue, but how often do people get attacked on the street? Do you need a concealed firearm whilst walking down the high street? I can understand it if you&#8217;re out at night in a dodgy neighbourhood, but in the middle of the day?\n\n \n It's happened before, especially in the larger cities where gangs and criminals are a serious problem; there's a reason they have high crime rates. And it's not just dodgy neighborhoods either, the scum tends to come out at night like cockroaches, and anybody who has to work late and walk to their car alone when the street lamps are on is a prime candidate to be mugged.\n \n I'm trying to find the story about an exhusband who attacked and stabbed his wife in the parking lot of a grocery store in the middle of the day with a lot of people around, and then tried to set her on fire with a can of gasoline. The only thing that stopped him was a bystander who was legally carrying a gun.\n \n \nExamples?\n\n \n http://www.zianet.com/web/gunstudy.htm \n \n \nExactly. When there are no guns, no-one&#8217;s going to get shot. When a gun is present , the risk is higher. When two guns are present (particularly if the people holding them are scared) the chances of being shot are infinitely higher.\n\n \n That's still just stating a basic fact that of physics, it doesn't really have any bearing on the law. It's like saying there's no chance of getting sick if there's no disease. Unfortunately these things do exist so these statements are basically moot and not grounded in reality.\n \n \nSo they carry guns, and pick on those that look too scared to use them if they have them. It&#8217;s the same as usual, but the chances of getting killed are increased.\n\n \n But so are the chances of not becoming a victim of violent crime. It's like a two-way street really. Everything has a negative potential and a positive potential.\n \n \nTrue, but that&#8217;ll just make them pick more on the vulnerable (women, kids and old people) or to increase the speed and violence of their crimes. I&#8217;m not sure how guns are meant to make you safer in this setting.\n\n \n As it is the attacking individual, the criminal, has a distinct advantage over their target. Since they're on the offensive they know who their target is, what they're going to do, what they intend to do, and they can take the target by surprise and throw them off. Basically in a situation like this when the intended victim is unarmed the chances of escaping unscathed are low because there are too few options available. \n \n You can run and scream for help, but that just risks making your attacker angry (just like running away from a doberman). You can comply and hope for the best, but I've seen no statistics that would prove that compliance is a guarantee or survival, and this is a poor choice if you're a woman and your attack wants to rape you. You can try and fight them off bare handed, but if they're in better physical condition than you are (like an old man against a young punk, or a 5'1\" 105 lb. woman trying to fight off a 6'2\" 225 lb. guy) then it's pretty much gonna be one sided.\n \n Being armed basically levels the playing field, it takes physical strength completely out of the equation, which is a good thing because far too often it's easy for disabled people to be taken advantage of and assaulted due to their physical conditions. If you have a heart condition then trying to beat your attacker down isn't a good idea, nor is trying to run if you have severe asthma. That's where a gun comes in handy, you don't need to run away, and whoever's attacking you is gonna have plenty of reason to believe they made a mistake, and motivation to turn and flee.\n \n Is it gonna be the solution to all of our crime problems? No, nothing will be. But it'll help take criminals from their current position of power and knock them down a few tiers so they're more easy to deal with.",

   "So my theory is technically right, but somebody mucked it up by changing the overall definition so there's no definite way to tell one way or another? \n\n Possibly. You have to bear in mind that the stats were rising before guns were outlawed. It has been suggested that the laws have taken ages to affect the culture. Guns are a cultural thing as much as anything else. Kids are growing up who haven't had contact with firearms and thus they don't carry them...\n \nNot really, I'm a large picture kind of person. If the number of gun-related deaths is lower than pre-dunblane, but the number of knife-related deaths is higher than pre-dunblane then all that says is the number of deaths isn't really changing, just the method of death. \n\n And the method is what is important. I think we're arguing two different arguments here. The point that I'm making is that deaths from shootings are rare in this country in part due to the restriction on guns. The fact that we're currently having a surge in knife crime is not a weapon of choice issue, it's a separate cultural issue, and therefore can't be linked together with gun culture. If that's a distinction you aren't interested in, then there's very little I can do about it.\n \nI don't know any details about the people that prefer to carry a knife or a bat compared to those that carry a gun. Some studies suggest a criminal will just use whatever's available to them at the time, other studies suggest that a criminal will go after what they feel is most effective regardless of the restrictions. \n\n And pathological criminals have a weapon of choice...\n \nI just see it as a matter of evolution of society. \n\n And that's where the argument for control stems from. If there's unbridled evolution of society then you have anarchy in short order. I'm not a fan of anarchy...\n \nIs this confrontation escalation or simply addressing the fact that times are changing? \n\n In the UK incidents of the kind you describe are very, very rare (I've never heard of a bank robbed in that fashion), even though our technology is at the same level as yours. This would suggest that there's a cultural thing to be addressed here. It also suggests that the climate of tooling up is following its natural course. What's the next step? \n \nMaybe, but I wouldn't want to be using a short stick if somebody was armed with a machete, or worse a sword. I'm not gonna want to fight somebody with one of those unless I have a 2:1 length ratio over them. \n\n Size isn't everything! Knowledge of how to use a weapon is more important in that sort of conflict. There have been attacks on police with swords. They don't achieve much. Civilians can get hurt in this scenario, but it's rare for police to be injured.\n \nWho're your clients? \n\n Whoever can afford them. That's how the arms trade works...\n \n \nI don't carry one yet, haven't gotten my permit. I just don't find a stick all that intimidating. \n\n When you've held a baton then you'd understand. Your own police carry them, and they're meant to be the first weapon drawn in a conflict. However what I've seen of your police they're pretty happy to draw their guns.\n \nanybody who has to work late and walk to their car alone when the street lamps are on is a prime candidate to be mugged. \n\n Same happens in this country. However there are few fatal muggings. The presence of fire arms would merely lead to an increase in mortalities....\n \nThe only thing that stopped him was a bystander who was legally carrying a gun. \n\n And that is a positive thing... I'm not convinced that one item of intervention justifies the policy, however it is a positive piece of evidence.\n \nUnfortunately these things do exist so these statements are basically moot and not grounded in reality. \n\n You in America have a culture and history based on guns. Over here we don't have that same culture. It is possible to have a culture in which guns are not a major factor in life.\n \nBut so are the chances of not becoming a victim of violent crime. It's like a two-way street really. Everything has a negative potential and a positive potential. \n\n Bearing in mind that not every civilian carries guns, but most criminals will, the chances of being killed in a mugging are much higher than if guns aren't an element of your culture. \n \nBeing armed basically levels the playing field \n\n It's a game?

   " A lot of things have been suggested. I've heard very wide-ranging theories on the subject, including one that the person behind Dunblane was hired by the government to do what he done die in order to give the government enough reason to ban handgun ownership. \n\n Please! If you start the paranoid conspiracy #### this discussion is going to plummet...\n \nHelp me out here, I'm having a hard time understanding this one. If somebody's killed with a knife they're just as dead as if they were killed with a gun. Regardless of the implement used the fact is that somebody has been deliberately killed. Murder is murder no matter how it's carried out. \n\n True, they are just as dead! However if you're looking to analyse the problem then you have to look at details such as this. Just comparing relative rates of murder allows all sorts of non-involved occurrences to interfere (e.g. Shipman).\n \nYou can ask anybody you want, but I don't think you'll find anyone that'll actually say that they'd be more upset if a loved one were shot to death than if they were stabbed to death or beaten to death. \n\n It sounds like you're trying to avoid the point. If you're making arguments about the effects of banning guns on gun crime then you have to look at gun crime statistics, not just the general crime stats...\n \nPathological criminals have no place in society. \n\n As you said earlier... These people exist and therefore must be dealt with, it's not the real world if you merely push them aside...\n \nNobody in their right mind is a fan of anarchy, nor is anybody here arguing in favor of anarchy. The point of the discussion is that times are changing and society must adapt to meet these trends. Once something has become outdated it needs to be replaced with something better. \n\n That which you describe is escalation. Have you considered that if there wasn't a culture of gun carrying, then people wouldn't dress up as tanks with automatic weapons to rob somewhere? The total number of people killed would probably be lower.\n \nI don't know what comes next, all I know is what the current step is. And the current step is the issuing of rifles to regular patrol officers, so if they do encounter a bad guy in body armor they can take the bad guy down quickly and on their own instead of having to wait for SWAT to be called out. The sooner a fight can be ended the less collateral damage there will be. \n\n A reasonable argument. However, as I said without the culture of guns these events don't occur (or at least occur very infrequently). You have to admit that having police armed with rifles leads to more shootings, and the increased chance that innocents will be killed.\n \n \n \nSize might not be everything, but it's intelligent to go into a fight better armed than your opponents. \n\n Accurately summing up American military philosophy. It doesn't always hold true however. The best thing to bring to a fight is intelligence and training. In an environment where everyone carries guns then carrying the biggest gun is logical. In an environment where guns are not habitually carried the need does not matter.\n \nI've held and used several types of batons before. I even own a few models. \n\n Then you'll know that a baton can easily break an arm, or knock someone out. That's quite a threat/\n \nThat's been suggested, but there's really no evidence to support that possibility or show that it's a common occurrence. \n\n Other than the logical idea that more people die in the presence of weapons than without them. \n \nAnd I'm not convinced that the actions of one demented fool should've been grounds for the laws of an entire nation being changed. \n\n I'm assuming you're referring to Dunblaine. There are many points where the course of entire nation moves on the action of one or two people. Look at the birth of the American Revolution.\n \nWell you did have a culture and history like ours at one point. \n\n I think your culture hasn't been the same as ours for 150 years at least, probably more. We're currently enjoying a period of low (ish) crime, and the gun laws seem to be playing their part. I've not seen evidence that relaxing those laws would make the system better.\n \nThat depends more on how criminals feel about killing people. I own a gun but I'm not necessarily more inclined to kill somebody for breaking in than my neighbor with the baseball bat would be, just because I'm better able to. \n\n Fair enough. However won't you concede that it's a much more involved process to beat someone to death, as compared to pulling a trigger? Bat someone, and there's a reasonable chance they'll live (unless you're built like a tree). Shoot at someone, and if you hit them, there's a much higher chance of doing a fatal injury.\n \nAnd if you find yourself unfortunate enough to be in the rare instance where a criminal's sense of self-preservation isn't working and not making them run away, then you're not going to want to be unarmed when you face them.\n\n Have you considered the possibility of not trying to fight back? Is it worth risking death for the sake of your wallet?",

People who don't run fast get stabbed. This, in my opinion, is the reason for the many stabbings in the UK.\n\n If you can't defend yourself, then don't try.

There's very little in the way of carrying guns there, and it hardly qualifies as an example of a gun culture, more like a gun control culture. And they did it three years into a new nationwide gun law, just proving how useless it was.\n \n If California had been a state with a healthy gun culture, these those two responsible for the North Hollywood Shootout would've been dead before so many officers got shot trying to stop them. Their body armor was good, but not good enough to stop a hunting rifle bullet from punching through.\n \n \nA reasonable argument. However, as I said without the culture of guns these events don't occur (or at least occur very infrequently). You have to admit that having police armed with rifles leads to more shootings, and the increased chance that innocents will be killed.\n\n \n Actually you're wrong on several counts. First there's been little evidence to show just how often police actually have to deploy their rifles in firefights, suggesting that it's very rare. Second, if police did deploy their rifles fore firefights then it's likely that fewer people would be put in danger since they're more accurate than shotguns and can put a threat down with fewer rounds discharged. In a way it's safer for the police to have rifles than shotguns. About the only reason to continue using shotguns is for the fact that they can take locks off of doors and be used with beanbag and rubber buckshot rounds for crowd control.\n \n \nAccurately summing up American military philosophy.\n\n \n Actually that's been the philosophy since warfare has existed. Look at the medieval examples of people carrying spears and pikes and lances sometimes 10 feet long. Anybody armed with a sword or a mace of a battle axe was at a disadvantage in terms of reach.\n \n \nIt doesn't always hold true however. The best thing to bring to a fight is intelligence and training. In an environment where everyone carries guns then carrying the biggest gun is logical. In an environment where guns are not habitually carried the need does not matter.\n\n \n Sure it pays to be more intelligent than the people you're facing, but intelligence on its own only goes so far.\n \n \nThen you'll know that a baton can easily break an arm, or knock someone out. That's quite a threat/\n\n \n Yeah well I've also had the experience of dealing with a guy that was hopped up on crack cocaine that tried to break into our house one night, and that guy didn't want to go down no matter how hard I hit him with the crowbar.\n \n \nOther than the logical idea that more people die in the presence of weapons than without them.\n\n \n And yet the states with more gun control have a higher death and crime rate than the states with less gun control. So obviously the presence of weapons alone isn't the determining factor.\n \n \nI'm assuming you're referring to Dunblaine.\n \n \n You assume right.\n \n \nThere are many points where the course of entire nation moves on the action of one or two people. Look at the birth of the American Revolution.\n\n \n The American Revolution is an entirely different cup of coffee than dunblane. \n \n And I still don't think it was right, a whole nation standing for their government comparing them all to a cold blooded killer. If that'd happened here there would've been outrage and resentment from one coast to the other.\n \n \nI think your culture hasn't been the same as ours for 150 years at least, probably more. We're currently enjoying a period of low (ish) crime, and the gun laws seem to be playing their part. I've not seen evidence that relaxing those laws would make the system better.\n\n \n I'm willing to bet that if the 1997 handgun ban didn't occur, crime rates would've leveled off by themselves anyway.\n \n \nFair enough. However won't you concede that it's a much more involved process to beat someone to death, as compared to pulling a trigger? Bat someone, and there's a reasonable chance they'll live (unless you're built like a tree). Shoot at someone, and if you hit them, there's a much higher chance of doing a fatal injury.\n\n \n More involved? Maybe, but that depends on variables. When some people get mad they lose their finer motor controls and are more likely to resort to primitive beating attacks rather than shooting. My first instinct when I get seriously mad is to start punching, not start shooting. Then again I might be an exception rather than the rule, I enjoy a good physical brawl.\n \n Also I don't believe that a gun is inherently more deadly than something like a baseball bat. If you beat somebody on the head with a bat then the blunt force trauma has a good chance of killing them, but unless you shoot them at the right angle then the bullet will just ricochet off the skull or be stopped entirely. There was a woman in New Zealand (I think) that was shot six times in the head, none of them penetrated the skull. There was a teenager in Texas that robbed a convenience store and was shot in the head, the bullet deformed and never penetrated his skull either.\n \n Bullet wounding isn't an exact science, there's a lot of variables involved that need to be taken into consideration when determining the lethality of it all. Shot placement is the key, and if you can't put the bullet in a vital area then you're only doing minor damage to the surrounding tissue. It's possible that a person who's been shot will bleed to death from their wound, but it's going to take time for that to happen, it's not instantaneous.\n \n \n \nHave you considered the possibility of not trying to fight back? Is it worth risking death for the sake of your wallet?\n\n \n Considered it, can't really agree with it. My mind always comes to the situation of \"What if you're a woman and the guy wants to rape you, do you just submit to that with no argument?\" I can't really go with the \"just give them what they want\" way of doing things, because if I had a wife and the scumbag wanted her then I'd be obligated to jack him up. And there's still the fact that compliance is no real guarantee that you'll survive.\n \n Comply if you want and hope for the best, just don't rely on it to save your life and be enough to satiate your attacker. Maybe they do want your wallet, but what if they want more than you can give them?",

Look at the medieval examples of people carrying spears and pikes and lances sometimes 10 feet long. Anybody armed with a sword or a mace of a battle axe was at a disadvantage in terms of reach. \n\n \n That's just wrong. Pikes have existed for centuries. A variant was used by the Greeks before the rise of the Roman Empire. The Roman Legions used a special type of short sword, designed to be used in tight formation. The Romans were finally brought down (apart from by corruption) by highly mobile armies using lots of cavalry. 10 - 15ft pikes were re-introduced to counter the medieval surge in heavy cavalry. Swords are actually the more useful weapon as once you get past the point of the pike, they aren't that useful. The only counter example I can think of is the Landesknecht Pikemen. Modern armies are based around the application of intelligently deployed well-trained troops. The American military really have a culture of attempting to out-tech the enemy. It normally works however see Vietnam, Korea and Afghanistan for examples of where an inferiorly armed enemy has run rings around US forces.",

Would you have shot him?\n \nAnd yet the states with more gun control have a higher death and crime rate than the states with less gun control. So obviously the presence of weapons alone isn't the determining factor. \n\n That's interesting. Do you have some stats?\n \nThe American Revolution is an entirely different cup of coffee than dunblane. \n\n You were arguing that the actions of one or two people shouldn't affect entire nations. On that basis they are comparable.\n \n \nAnd I still don't think it was right, a whole nation standing for their government comparing them all to a cold blooded killer. If that'd happened here there would've been outrage and resentment from one coast to the other. \n\n The American Revolution wasn't a populist movement at its conception. It was started, like so many events, by a few people and then it grew into a movement... I'm sorry if that offends you, but those are the facts...\n \nI'm willing to bet that if the 1997 handgun ban didn't occur, crime rates would've leveled off by themselves anyway. \n\n Possibly... but gun crime was on the rise, and now it's dropping. We can't work on the basis of what may have happened, only on what is...\n \nMore involved? Maybe, but that depends on variables. When some people get mad they lose their finer motor controls and are more likely to resort to primitive beating attacks rather than shooting. \n\n I'm sure that's true in some cases. However there is the fact that stabbing someone means you have to be close to them, and you will get blood on you. Shooting someone is a more distant activity. I'd be interested in knowing the calibre of bullet used in those attacks you mentioned.\n \nBullet wounding isn't an exact science \n\n True, but hitting someone anywhere in the torso has a high chance of causing serious damage to a major organ. The same is not true of a bat. I also don't think that there are many people who own a gun with a small enough calibre to be deflected by the skull, unless it's a skim shot.\n \n \nShot placement is the key, and if you can't put the bullet in a vital area then you're only doing minor damage to the surrounding tissue. \n \n I think the tissue trauma is not minor (unless it's an arm or leg wound, and even then).\n \nIt's possible that a person who's been shot will bleed to death from their wound, but it's going to take time for that to happen, it's not instantaneous. \n\n True. But how often do you open an artery with your fist?\n \n \nConsidered it, can't really agree with it. My mind always comes to the situation of \"What if you're a woman and the guy wants to rape you, do you just submit to that with no argument?\" \n\n Fair enough. That scenario is one where I'd agree that carrying a gun is justified. However have you considered other modes of defence such as pepper spray, alarms or non-lethal combat training?\n \nAnd there's still the fact that compliance is no real guarantee that you'll survive. \n\n True, but does being armed?\n \nMaybe they do want your wallet, but what if they want more than you can give them? \n\n Then you've come across a sociopath, and there's the serious probability that you'll be killed (or injured) regardless of whether you have a gun or not. I'm not someone who'll let people get away with muggings or assault if I can intervene, but I question how many people will go up against an armed assailant, even if they are carrying.",

   "Mick Dundee, maybe not. But I've seen some pretty big kitchen knives, and kitchen knives are supposed to be the most often used according to your papers. \n\n I would point out that most stab wounds are inflicted by small flick knives or by small concealable kitchen knives. The big knives are too cumbersome. Also, don't believe what our press put out. There's a sensational streak at the moment.\n \nInconclusive, there's not enough evidence to go by regarding the type of 9mm round in question. Is it a solid projectile with a round nose, a flat point, a wadcutter, a hollowpoint, etc.? Every bullet inflicts a different type of injury path, that's unique to their design. Now if the type of 9mm you're talking about is the full metal jacketed configuration, then the knife would cause more physical damage. \n\n Interesting. What is the normal ammo issued with a new 9mm? The problem with a bullet is that they cause tearing in the surrounding tissue radiating out from the entry point. This also applies to the FMJ. The knife causes a single deep disruption. I'll admit that different types of knife can cause more damage.\n \n\"Gun crime\" but not crime in general. \n\n Actually the crime stats show that crime as a rule has dropped. It certainly has around where I live.\n \nWell technically the Vietnamese were better armed than American troops. The Vietnamese were armed with the AK-47 and SKS, both of them able to function in adverse settings where they get dirty and can't be immediately cleaned. Americans were armed with the then-new M16, which in its original configuration was unsuited for dirty, muddy, humid conditions. Troops also didn't know how to clean their M16 rifles until a training manual was released months later.\n Kind of splitting hairs here, but they're points worth addressing.\n\n That's partially the point. The AK47 and its successor the AK74 are both good, reliable and simple weapons. American weapons are very high tech, and thus more vulnerable to conditions (they did however have greater accuracy, range and penetration making them the 'better' gun). This however hasn't stopped the quest for newer and more advance weaponry. Another point in the Vietnam issue is the American armour and air superiority. Both were rendered moot by the intelligent use of forces by the North Vietnamese...",

   "It seems to be one of the regular ups and downs of crime statistics. However, I want to be looking at the overall result of the gun ban.\n\n It would seem difficult to separate the two.... What do we work with, if not the stats?\n \nWell, that was one bad link. My own negligence for not reading through it. However, my other two sources still stand. \n\n And I still don&#8217;t see what you were trying to show. It&#8217;s true that at the moment there&#8217;s an increased chance of police being stabbed. So?\n \nA 9mm handgun round going through the body? You'd have to be pretty damn close. It really depends where the bullet and the knife hit. I am not sure which is more lethal, however I have heard that knife wounds are more painful because a gun wound is more traumatic causing the body to sometimes pump way too much adrenaline through the bloodstream. I don't think this happens as much with a knife wound, but I'm not doctor. If this were true knife wounds would be much more painful. \n\n Fair enough. I&#8217;ll accept that you probably know more about the penetrative qualities of guns than me. This does however bring up the likelyhood that surgery will be needed to extract the bullet. This isn&#8217;t the case with stabbing. I&#8217;m also not sure what relevance how much it hurts has...\n \nYou were implying that it is good that less officers are being shot, but stats show they are being stabbed more. You looked like you were treating this like a good thing. \n\n I didn&#8217;t say it was a good thing. Just because I&#8217;m pleased that shootings have come down, doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m happy that stabbings have gone up. Both of you seem to think that there&#8217;s a certain number of crimes that will be committed, and that the methods don&#8217;t matter... I have to confess that doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.\n \nLike I said the first time, I am looking at the overall picture, rather than this or last year. \n\n Again, I&#8217;m not sure what point you&#8217;re trying to make...\n \nSo, they made illegal possession a gun crime right when they banned guns? That seems like a big coincidence. But, that accounts for the rise in gun crimes in the US too, because the same has been done. \n\n Fair enough. I&#8217;d point out that your crimes per capita are much higher than ours. It makes sense to include possession under the umbrella of &#8216;gun crime&#8217;, I&#8217;d suggest that the number we&#8217;re interested in is assaults w. guns, and your stats show that they are dropping.\n \nI disagree. Being passive while being attacked or threatened is a bad idea. You should asses the situation, and if you can defend yourself you should, but if the guy looks slow and you're fast, then run. \n\n Sensible, and I agree. If you see what I said, I said &#8220;If you can&#8217;t defend yourself, then don&#8217;t try&#8221;. That means that pulling a weapon in a bad situation will only make it worse....\n \nHopefully, if guns are legalized, kids will not be able to obtain them, like here in the US. However in my opinion, banning guns using the argument that people using knives is better is a bad argument. We need to be attacking the root cause of the violence: the criminals. I don't want the US turning into another \"Beat It\" music video.\n\n So you don&#8217;t think that having guns in the parents&#8217; house will lead to opportunities for the children to obtain them? I&#8217;m not happy about the rise in knife crime, and I&#8217;ll happily participate in a discussion on how to stop it. I don&#8217;t subscribe to this idea that there&#8217;s a set amount of crime that will occur. I don&#8217;t think anyone in their right mind would be happy about a rise in any form of crime. It&#8217;s just in this debate we&#8217;re discussing gun crime, so the level of knife crime is by-the-bye.",

   "So you&#8217;re saying that people are going to die, and it doesn&#8217;t matter how, so we may as well not bother restricting things?\n\n \n Basically. Instead of trying to control the tools used to commit murder, instead focus on trying to stop the people themselves that are intent on murder.\n \n \nI don&#8217;t know what the Brady campaign is, but I&#8217;d say stopping criminals getting guns is a sensible approach to take.\n\n \n Not the way they suggest it.\n \n \nIt&#8217;s still in America. The gun culture is nationwide...\n\n \n Then how come it didn't happen in places with friendlier firearms laws.\n \n \nWhich law was this?\n\n \n The \"Assault Weapons Ban\" of 1994.\n \n \nYour argument is that if people were carrying rifles around, they&#8217;d have taken them out sooner?\n\n \n My argument is that if California wasn't a draconian state like it is, there would be better odds of those two being put down quicker than they were. Instead of being able to drag it out for nearly an hour they could've been put down in considerably less time.\n \n \nIntelligence also plays its part in recognising when a fight can&#8217;t be won, rather than initiating a shootout at the OK coral...\n\n \n The OK corral was fought between lawmen and criminals, not private citizens and criminals.\n \n \nIf he was that high he wouldn&#8217;t have reacted to you pointing a gun at him. Would you have shot him?\n\n \n Well let's see, somebody stoned on illegal narcotics, trying to break into your home and acting violent and irrational. To shoot or not to shoot? What would you do!?\n \n \nThat&#8217;s interesting. Do you have some stats?\n\n \n At the bottom of this page are links to the statistics for all 50 states. The ones with the more restrictive gun control tend to have significantly higher numbers of murder than the states with less restrictive gun control.\n \n \nI&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s true in some cases. However there is the fact that stabbing someone means you have to be close to them, and you will get blood on you. Shooting someone is a more distant activity. I&#8217;d be interested in knowing the calibre of bullet used in those attacks you mentioned.\n\n \n Distance activity? So what?\n \n In the New Zealand case it was a .32 caliber, in the Texas case it was a 9mm.\n \n \nTrue, but hitting someone anywhere in the torso has a high chance of causing serious damage to a major organ. The same is not true of a bat.\n \n \n If you hit somebody in the back with a bat you have a very good chance of breaking their spinal column and paralyzing them.\n \n \nI also don&#8217;t think that there are many people who own a gun with a small enough calibre to be deflected by the skull, unless it&#8217;s a skim shot.\n\n \n It's not about the caliber of the bullet, it's about the angle of impact. Hitting something straight on will do more damage than hitting from the side or an angle.\n \n \nI think the tissue trauma is not minor (unless it&#8217;s an arm or leg wound, and even then).\n\n \n During the Philippine-American war it was found that the then standard issue .38 Colt revolver cartridge, and even the .30-40 Krag rifle cartridge, were ineffective at stopping the Philippino warriors who were drugged up on narcotics, even when they were shot in the center of mass. Penetration was more than adequate, but tissue trauma wasn't.\n \n \nTrue. But how often do you open an artery with your fist?\n\n \n People involved in car wrecks have suffered internal bleeding, so obviously something can be torn open from simple impact.\n \n \nFair enough. That scenario is one where I&#8217;d agree that carrying a gun is justified. However have you considered other modes of defence such as pepper spray, alarms or non-lethal combat training?\n\n \n Pepper spray is very ineffective in the wind, rain, or cold air since it's a chemical reaction. Non-lethal methods require you to be within very close distances to actually use them, and alarms have a tendency of being ignored.\n \n \nTrue, but does being armed?\n\n \n It's more of a guarantee than hoping your attacker will be a humanitarian.\n \n \nThen you&#8217;ve come across a sociopath, and there&#8217;s the serious probability that you&#8217;ll be killed (or injured) regardless of whether you have a gun or not. I&#8217;m not someone who&#8217;ll let people get away with muggings or assault if I can intervene, but I question how many people will go up against an armed assailant, even if they are carrying.\n\n \n Depends on a lot of things. Maybe not for saving your own life but for saving the life of somebody else. Some people hold themselves in low regards and don't do much about themselves, but won't hesitate to try and save somebody else from danger.\n \n \nInteresting. What is the normal ammo issued with a new 9mm?\n \n \n There's no standard issue 9mm ammo, except for what the troops in Iraq get and that's all FMJ. They're basically fighting with target practice ammunition.\n \n \nThe problem with a bullet is that they cause tearing in the surrounding tissue radiating out from the entry point. This also applies to the FMJ.\n \n \n Sometimes.\n \n \nThe knife causes a single deep disruption. I&#8217;ll admit that different types of knife can cause more damage.\n\n \n I think a knife would easily cause more tissue damage. If you drag it across and cut into somebody's arm or leg then you could easily sever their tendons and they'll lose all motor control in the injured limb. And tendons are easier to cut than they are to shoot, because damaging them requires some amount of precisions.\n \n \nThat&#8217;s partially the point. The AK47 and its successor the AK74 are both good, reliable and simple weapons. American weapons are very high tech, and thus more vulnerable to conditions (they did however have greater accuracy, range and penetration making them the &#8216;better&#8217; gun).\n\n \n Well actually it was the M16 that was the high-tech and vulnerable design, the M1 Garand, M14, M1 Carbine and other weapons of the time operated similar to the AK-47 with a gas piston which prevented the operating system from getting overly dirtied. The M16 instead operates on a gas tube and all of the powder fowling and hot gasses are dumped right back on the moving parts and cruds them up.\n \n Also the AK-47 has the M16 beat in terms of penetration.\n \n This video shows that while the M16 can easily shoot further and more accurate than the AK-47, the AK-47 is better as penetrating hard obstacles.",

   "It would seem difficult to separate the two....

Also, if possession is rising, what are the point of the gun laws? It shows that people are still getting their hands on guns.\n \n \n \nSensible, and I agree.
