Fear is the one basic emotion which in the past guarenteed our survival. It has this specific function. \n The reason why you do not fear when under the influence of love, is because you are temporary ''blinded'' by it. The feeling is so intense, you do not or hardly register any other. It has a biochemical predisposition. But when the effect wears off, as it always does, you start to fear to loose your love, and emotion you were looking for is called jealousy, not hate. Jealousy is fear of loosing significant other for reason ____________ (fill here) or feelings of inadequacy compared to your partner , not hate which is emotion of intense revulsion, distaste, enmity, or antipathy for a person, thing, or phenomenon. It is generally attributed to cause a desire to avoid, restrict, remove, or destroy the object in question.\n The opposite you were looking for is in my opinion courage or confidence in oneself.",
