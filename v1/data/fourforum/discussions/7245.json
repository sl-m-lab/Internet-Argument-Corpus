Even the Governor seemed to be echoeing the same false information, and I would hope he got his intel from somewhere other than the television. I can understand information being misunderstood when being communicated initially. I was suprised, like everyone else, that it took so long to correct it.",

Often times safety regulations are in place, but workers ignore or circumvent them. I'd like to see a detailed description of the citations at the mine before jumping to conclusions. The article also stated that most of the violations had been addressed earlier in the year. In closing, the last sentence of the article seems to point out that the MSHA apparently wasn't concerned enough to close the mine???

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/opinion/06fri2.html\n \n January 6, 2006\n Editorial\n Coal's Power Over Politicians \n As inspectors delve into the deadly mine disaster in Sago, W.Va., their starting premise must be that the explosion that choked off 12 workers' lives would never have happened if all the safety rules now on the books had been properly enforced. Mining regulations born of decades of death and disaster dictate in detail the most basic protections for survival, like adequate ventilation and roof supports. \n \n Yet full enforcement was clearly lacking at the Sago mine, with its long record of chronic violations and an injury rate almost triple the average for similar mines. Federal officials claim that the mine was adequately monitored. \n \n But in accounting for the deaths, inspectors should look as well into the budget cutbacks and staff attrition that have marked the Bush administration's management of its own ranks in the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The latest budget imposes a $4.9 million cut for the safety agency, according to Congressional critics who estimate that the agency has suffered a reduction of 170 positions in the past five years.\n \n The ensuing government laxity - and the increasing risks that miners take to get their hard-earned wages - were underlined three years ago by the Government Accountability Office in a study of 10 years of work by the mine safety administration, a period covering the management records of both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. It warned of the looming retirements of qualified inspectors, and the failure to follow up adequately on nearly half of the violations found. Rather than turning this around, the Bush administration's main attention to the coal industry has been to appoint a raft of political appointees directly from energy corporations to critical regulatory posts.\n \n For better or worse, coal is ever a prime economic resource for West Virginia - a lodestone for corporations, and still a millstone for too many miners. This has been true through the political ages, right up through the powerful reign of the state's Democratic favorite son, Senator Robert Byrd, who has packed West Virginia with highway projects and other pork-barrel goodies that have somehow failed to securely touch the lives of the long-suffering coal miners. We hope for fresh orations from the gifted senator on behalf of the threats to his constituent miners, with an eloquence to match his speeches on behalf of the soldiers at risk in Iraq, coupled with the judicious use of his legendary political prowess to restore the money cut from the mine safety budget and to help make other needed reforms. \n \n It is hardly enough to say that coal mining, while inherently dangerous, has taken fewer lives across the decades. Even statistically, never mind morally, the 12 lives lost at Sago are startling in a state that had more than 120,000 miners a half-century ago but is now down to fewer than 14,000 in an age of greater mining mechanization. What is constant is the demand for coal, with companies zeroing in to work the most from marginal mines like Sago. And what is constant, too, is a shocking loss like the Sago 12, who might have survived if government had lived up to its responsibilities.",

Also, the metal casings of abandoned natural gas wells above a mine can conduct an electrical current into the ground.\n \n ''If this is in fact a strike of lightning onto a well, gas or oil, that sits above an abandoned section of the workings, that well should have had a substantial barrier to avoid this,\" said David McAteer, who oversaw the Mine Safety and Health Administration during the Clinton administration.\n \n ''We've had lightning strikes cause accidents in mines, and they're very disconcerting because they do just what this did.

Who's responsibility would it be to render these \"lightning rods\" harmless when the oil/gas drilling ceases??? Lightning strikes and Methane gas seem to occur naturally around the mines so the controllable variable appears to be the metal casings. Anyway, I'm just thinking out load.",

   "This event has gotten bloody little coverage in the so-called \"liberal\" mainstream media in the U.S. I wonder why:\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060130/ap_on_re_ca/canada_mine_fire\n \n 'Textbook' Rescue Saves 72 Canadian Miners \n By BETH DUFF-BROWN, Associated Press Writer \n Mon Jan 30, 5:57 PM ET\n TORONTO - Seventy-two Canadian potash miners Monday walked away from an underground fire and toxic smoke on Monday after being locked down overnight in airtight chambers packed with enough oxygen, food and water for several days. \n \n The company said the textbook case of safe underground mining was due to those chambers, extensive training of rescue workers and support from the rural community.\n \n \"I'm almost getting choked up thinking about how well this team worked together,\" Marshall Hamilton, a spokesman for Mosaic Co., the Minneapolis-based owner of the mine, said after he got word that all the men were evacuated safely.\n \n Greg Harris, one of the miners, said he was never concerned about his safety as he played checkers with colleagues in the refuge room waiting to be rescued. They drew the checkerboard on the back of a map and used washers as chips.\n \n \"Everything is good,\" Harris told The Canadian Press from his home. \"Communication was excellent. We had no problems whatsoever.\"\n \n Analysts said the rescue could serve as a lesson for their counterparts in the United States, China and other countries.\n \n \"It really looks like a textbook recovery to me\" said Davitt McAteer, head of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration under former President Clinton.\n \n McAteer is leading the investigation into the deaths of 12 miners who died earlier this month at the Sago coal mine in West Virginia.\n \n McAteer, in a telephone interview, said the safety chambers in the Mosaic mine in Canada's central Saskatchewan province were key to the miners' survival.\n \n \"I think that the question of the existence of the chamber that provided oxygen, food and protection is fundamentally important in any kind of a mine,\" he said. He acknowledged, however, that potash mines are not nearly as dangerous as those for coal - where an initial explosion can provoke a secondary one 10 times as strong.\n \n There are no such chambers in U.S. mines, he said, because back in the late 1970s, the U.S. government determined there was no material strong enough to withstand the secondary explosion. Since then, he said, NASA and the Defense Department have created stronger materials.\n \n \"If you can build a black box to withstand an explosion in an airplane, why can't you build one to escape an explosion in a mine?\" he asked.\n \n He said Canada, Australia and the United States run some of the safest mines in the world, with the United States reporting a record low 57 mine deaths last year.\n \n Earlier this month, 14 miners died in two separate accidents at mines in West Virginia. Two men died in a fire Jan. 21 at a mine in Melville, nearly three weeks after 12 men died after an explosion near Tallmansville.\n \n The number of mining deaths in Canada was not immediately available. The Saskatchewan Mining Association said there was only one mining death in the province last year.\n \n China has the world's deadliest mining industry, where more than 5,000 coal miners die each year.\n \n The mine in Esterhazy, about 130 miles northeast of the provincial capital of Regina, was Saskatchewan's first potash operation when it opened in 1962.\n \n Saskatchewan is North America's largest producer of potash, a pinkish-grey mineral used in the production of agricultural fertilizer, soap and glass ceramics. \n \n The fire first broke out early Sunday in the central Canadian mine's polyethylene piping, filling the tunnels with toxic smoke and forcing the 72 miners to seek refuge in the sealed chambers until the fire was out and the air safe to breathe. \n \n Thirty-two miners were brought to the surface early Monday; 35 emerged a few hours later. The last to be rescued Monday were five workers holed up in the farthest reaches of the mine. \n \n Shannon Reitenbach, an industrial mechanic at the mine, said employees hold routine fire drills and are trained to keep in constant contact with people on the surface and study maps of the labyrinth of mine shafts. \n \n Mosaic CEO Fritz Corrigan pledged a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire.",

This smacks of public relations more than worker protection. The safety agency, notorious for its political appointees from the coal industry, is also suddenly finding more inspectors for West Virginia, which has suffered 16 miner deaths recently. \n \n The tragedies have laid bare the passivity and pro-industry bias in the Bush administration's stewardship of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Last month, the chief of the now-galvanized agency cavalierly announced more pressing business and walked out of a Congressional hearing into the initial West Virginia deaths, even as shocked lawmakers still had key questions unanswered. \n \n We're glad that West Virginia's government has finally enacted laws requiring that miners be equipped with wireless communication and location devices, better oxygen supplies and faster, more organized rescue crews. Five other states are considering similar steps, but the crying need is for the administration to make this a national issue. In Canada, 72 miners were rescued after 20 hours thanks to underground \"refuge stations\" required by law to be stocked with oxygen, food and water. No such protection was at hand for the West Virginia victims.\n \n The administration should join West Virginia lawmakers calling for tougher inspections, penalties and safety equipment under federal law. The deaths showed that companies have too much leeway in running rescue efforts, and too little concern for crackdowns by the federal mine agency. \n \n A pro-industry bias by government should not be tolerated. Yet, at a hearing for the administration's latest choice of still another company veteran to take control of mine safety, Republican lawmakers shamelessly praised the industry for lowering fatality statistics across time - as if those killed in West Virginia were a tolerable cost of Big Coal's doing business.",

   "I'd like to see the practice of Mountain Top Removal banned.\n \n http://www.appvoices.org/mtr/default.asp\n \n http://www.ohvec.org/issues/mountaintop_removal/\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6462-2004Aug16.html\n \n http://www.google.com/search?q=+Mountain+Top+Removal&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\n \n\n Approximately 4-5 percent of the coal energy demands in the US today are met through surface mining techniques including one referred to as mountaintop removal (MTR). MTR, also known as valley fill mining, is used when a coal company finds that a certain seam of coal can be removed by MTR more economically than by traditional underground mining. The process is simple. Workers first clear-cut the land to be \"mined.\" Explosive charges ten to 100 times the power of the bomb used in the Oklahoma City bombing are set. They are then detonated, and up to 800 feet of the peak is blown apart. Massive machinesthen sift the rubble for coal. Finally, what is left of the mountain - the \"overburden\" - is unceremoniously dumped into a nearby valley. The slurry of chemicals and harmful metals, including arsenic, mercury, copper, lead, and chromium, including the water used in the processing of the coal are collected in a sludge pond (the word \"pond\" is actually a misnomer, these \"ponds\" sometimes hold billions of gallons). MTR produces myriad direct negative consequences. Numerous citizens have made complaints about MTR blasting, stating that their home's foundations have received damage\n or their well water has been depleted or made undrinkable. Rock and chemical dust from blasting and departing trucks linger around the communities adjacent to MTR sites, worsening air conditions and causing property values to drop. \"Fly Rock,\" a term for the debris that the blasts send off the mountain, strikes fear into the hearts of community members. In 2002, the mobile home of Jerry Pinson, a Kentucky resident, was crushed by an 11-foot boulder sent over a hillside as a result of blasting. Another consequence of MTR is the occasional spill of toxic chemicals. In 1972 heavy rain caused a sludge pond dam to burst, sending 132 million gallons of wastewater into the\n valley, killing 125, injuring 1100, and leaving 4000 homeless. Pittson Coal Company, whichhad been forewarned that the dam was dangerous, called it an \"act of God.\" Blackwater spills choke the life out of streams. In 2000\n one spill in Martin County, Ken. of over 300 million gallons of toxic sludge sent pollution 15 feet thick into residents yards and strangled 75 miles of waterways. It was called the southeast's worst environmental disaster.\n Blasting and blackwater spills are not the only source of problems, however. The bare land created by MTR dramatically worsens floods associated with summer thunderstorms. The lack of an intact ecosystem in an area sets off mudslides and floods, driving residents from their homes. In 2001 and 2002,\n flooding in southern West Virginia killed 15 people and damaged or destroyed thousands of homes. The recovery effort for those floods has topped $150 million. The increased risk of flood damage and personal harm visibly generates significant angst for denizens of coal communities. The largest social effect MTR triggers is the loss of communities, culture and irreplaceable\n and unique ways of life. MTR drives people away from their homes by creating a hazardous place to live, lowering the value of their property, poisoning their water and air, and prompting them to run in panic from the mountains for fear of losing their lives. Entire communities such as Blair, West Virginia do not exist anymore. Citizens that stay also are faced with economic issues. As more coal is mined, less and less miners are employed; coal production rose 32 percent between 1987 and 1997, while mining jobs dropped 29 percent. The top 15 coal producing counties in West Virginia produce 15 percent of the nation's coal, but have some of the worst poverty levels in the nation. Obviously, the only ones profiting from MTR are the coal companies.\n\n \n\n Mother Earth is taking an equally brutal beating from MTR as the coal communities. In West Virginia alone, over 500 square miles have been completely obliterated forever (that's almost 1000 Vanderbilt campuses). The coal industry has effectively buried 724 miles of Appalachian headwater streams and has negatively impacted over 1200 stream miles. Runoff from valley fills leaks with selenium, aluminum, manganese and a plethora of other pollutants into the watershed, poisoning the land, sometimes irrevocably. The forests of Appalachia are internationally renowned for their biodiversity. More than half of the flowering plants and ferns in the US are present in the South's hills. The forest also plays host to more tree species than all of Europe. It has been labeled an international biogem by the Natural Resource Defense Fund and a keystone forest by Greenpeace USA. It is home to more endangered aquatic species than the rest of the world and provides vital habitats for endangered species such as black bears and bald eagles. The US Fish and Wildlife service has reported that West Virginia's forests are key nesting grounds for neo-tropical migrant birds, and the destruction of said forests will reduce the migrant bird populations across the northeast. MTR is a growing threat to Appalachia, its people, and its fragile ecosystem. Coal composes about 23 percent of the nation's energy profile, and since MTR only produces 4-5% of the nation's coal energy, only about 1% of our energy demands are met via MTR coal. Mountain Justice Summer, an activist group out of Knoxville, Tenn., reports that 20 percent of our energy needs today can be met by simply practicing scrupulous conservation. Not burning unnecessary kilowatt-hours in the first place makes much more sense than does the long lasting devastation of MTR. Coal is a dirty business, and has been for a long time. Hopefully politicians and industry leaders will wake up and fix the problem of MTR by shifting the nation to a system utilizing a clean, reliable energy source such as solar energy or nuclear fusion.\n\n \n \nDID YOU KNOW...\n \u0095 More explosives are used every week in the extraction of coal in Appalachia,than were used in the first Gulf War, and the Afghanistan war combined.\n \u0095 Close to nine tons of toxic waste, produced by \"cleaning\" coal before burning it, lies behind an earthen dam just a few hundred yards behind an elementary school in West Virginia.\n \u0095 Over 1000 miles of streams have been buried and 500 square miles of mountains supporting one of the world's most biodiverse temperate forests have been destroyed by MTR coal mining in West Virginia alone.\n \u0095 According to the West Virginia Coal Association, a little over 50 years ago, over 100,000 miners were employed in West Virginia. In 2003, that number was fewer than 15,000. Meanwhile, far more coal is being mined.\n\n \n \nMy name is Jack Brown, Jr. and I live at 104 Finley Circle in Walhonda Village, which is in the Clear Creek Hollow. I am a lifetime resident of the great state of West Virginia. I was born in 1935 at Edwight, West Virginia and my dad as a retired coal miner. I watched him die of black lung six years ago. When I was a small boy living in the coal camp at Edwight, Whitesville and the surrounding areas there were thousands of coal miners working in the mines, not like today when only a few work in the I have seen the streams run black with coal dust. But not the whole tops of mountains leveled. The sludge dams they have built and the water they have polluted, coal trucks ruining the highways-for only a few real jobs? Believe me, I am not against jobs. When they polluted in the old days, at least 10's of 1000's of coal miners had good paying jobs. Then the let down happened; the mines shut down and the coal market dried up, people left the state to find work. But here we go again. Big coal companies have found a cheaper way to get the coal. Not like my dad got it, but by removing 1000's of mountaintop acres, filling in everything from us and our the little hollow streams. I used to catch spring lizards for fish bait. We don't find the wild things in the mountains like that any more. Big coal has bought and paid for politicians they own and don't give me much of a say so in the matter. They promise me better, but big coal uses their money to change the laws to suit them. I watched the flood waters wash over my brothers house, killing his animals and leaving him homeless. I saw what happened to Boger Hollow and Sycamore Hollow when the sludge ponds broke. I watched my friends and neighbors cry wondering what to do next. Now what did big coal do? Not our fault; an act of God; It wasn't our fault the dam busted and you cry-babies lost everything you had. In finishing this little letter--I'm going to stay here in my little home and I'm going to fight with the big coal for a decent place to live without a polluted environment like we have now and not one lawmaker to go to bat for me. I guess I'll be fighting for a long time or at least until someone does something to stop this land raping, polluting the water like big coal is doing. Oh yes, before I close, the governor of our state will only be a oneterm governor, so if you can stop the raping of my beautiful mountains and stand up to big coal. Please give me your name. I want to stand behind you and support you for governor.\n --Jack Brown, Jr.\n",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/02/national/02mine.html\n \n March 2, 2006\n U.S. Is Reducing Safety Penalties for Mine Flaws \n By IAN URBINA and ANDREW W. LEHREN\n CRAIGSVILLE, W.Va. - In its drive to foster a more cooperative relationship with mining companies, the Bush administration has decreased major fines for safety violations since 2001, and in nearly half the cases, it has not collected the fines, according to a data analysis by The New York Times.\n \n Federal records also show that in the last two years the federal mine safety agency has failed to hand over any delinquent cases to the Treasury Department for further collection efforts, as is supposed to occur after 180 days. \n \n With the deaths of 24 miners in accidents in 2006, the enforcement record of the Mine Safety and Health Administration has come under sharp scrutiny, and the agency is likely to face tough questions about its performance at a Senate oversight hearing on Thursday. \n \n \"The Bush administration ushered in this desire to develop cooperative ties between regulators and the mining industry,\" said Tony Oppegard, a top official at the agency in the Clinton administration. \"Safety has certainly suffered as a result.\"\n \n A spokesman for the agency, Dirk Fillpot, defended its record, pointing out that last year the coal industry had 22 fatalities, the lowest number in its history.\n \n \"Safety is definitely improving,\" Mr. Fillpot said. \n \n A spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, Carol Raulston, agreed. \n \n \"The agency realized in recent years that you can't browbeat operators into improved safety, and this general approach has worked,\" Ms. Raulston said. \"The tragic events of this year have given everyone pause. But I don't think it means we want to abandon what we have found works.\"\n \n Federal records show that fatalities across all types of mining have stayed relatively stable. In each of the last three years, 55 to 57 miners have died in all areas of mining. Experts say a long-term decline in coal mine fatalities is in part a result of growing mechanization.\n \n Mr. Fillpot also said delinquent cases had not moved to the Treasury Department since 2003 because of computer problems. He could not say when the problems would be corrected. \"Referrals from M.S.H.A. to the Treasury Department have been impacted by technical issues on both ends, which we are working to resolve while maintaining an aggressive record on enforcement and collections,\" he said.\n \n Although the agency has recently trumpeted Congressional plans to raise the maximum penalties, federal records indicate that few major fines are issued at the maximum level. In 2004, the number of major fines issued at maximum level was one in 10, down from one in 5 in 2003. \n \n Since 2001, the median for penalties that exceed $10,000, described as \"major fines,\" has dropped 13 percent, to $21,800 from $25,000.\n \n Also troubling, critics say, is that fines are regularly reduced in negotiations between mine operators and the agency. From 2001 to 2003, more than two-thirds of all major fines were cut from the original amount that the agency proposed. Most of the more recent cases are enmeshed in appeals, so it is impossible to know whether that trend has continued. \n \n \"The agency keeps talking about issuing more fines, but it doesn't matter much,\" said Bruce Dial, a former inspector for the mine safety agency. \"The number of citations means nothing when the citations are small, negotiable and most often uncollected.\"\n \n Before the January disaster at the Sago Mine near here, where 12 miners died, the operator had been cited 273 times since 2004. None of the fines exceeded $460, roughly one-thousandth of 1 percent of the $110 million net profit reported last year by the current owner of the mine, the International Coal Group. \n \n [At a House oversight hearing on Wednesday, agency officials repeatedly cited the frequency of fines against Sago in the year before the accident as proof of aggressive enforcement. Exasperated, Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, replied that maybe those fines had little effect because many were for $60. That point set off applause from audience members.]\n \n \"Most fines are so small that they are seen not as deterrents but as the cost of doing business,\" said Wes Addington, a lawyer with the Appalachian Citizens Law Center in Prestonsburg, Ky., which handles mine safety cases. Using federal records, Mr. Addington released a study in January indicating that since 1995 nearly a third of the active underground mines in Kentucky had failed to pay their fines. \n \n \"Operators know that it's cheaper to pay the fine than to fix the problem,\" Mr. Addington said. \"But they also know the cheapest of all routes is to not pay at all. It's pretty galling.\"\n \n (More)",

   "Larry Williams, who now lives in Craigsville, 50 miles east of Charleston, knows this frustration well. In 2002, he was working with a fellow miner, Gary Martin, in a deep mine near Rupert, 25 miles south of here, when the roof collapsed on them. Mr. Martin died instantly, and Mr. Williams was trapped for more than four hours under several thousand pounds of rock that crushed his pelvis and both legs. \n \n The men had been pillaring, or second mining, which involves extracting the last remaining coal in tunnels by scraping it from the coal pillars used to hold up the roof. This method is considered extremely dangerous. Federal regulations aim to reduce the risk.\n \n In this case, federal investigators found that the regulations were not followed. The operators were fined $165,000. Those fines have not been paid, even though the mine owner, Midland Trail Resources, which did not reply to requests for comment, remains in business, according to state records. \n \n \"It makes me mad,\" said Mr. Williams, 50, who is paralyzed through much of his right side. \"One dead and another man's life ruined, and they pay nothing? It just doesn't make sense.\"\n \n On Feb. 14, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, introduced a measure to raise the maximum penalty that the mine safety agency can assess for failing to eliminate violations that cause death or serious injury, to $500,000, from the current $60,000. \n \n The law would also prohibit administrative law judges from reducing fines for violations deemed flagrant or habitual.\n \n Ellen Smith, editor of Mine Safety and Health News, an independent newsletter that covers the industry, said that although the law was a positive step, one regulation that continued to need attention allowed fines to be lowered for smaller or financially troubled mines.\n \n \"The result of that provision is that it helps keep some habitual offenders in business,\" Ms. Smith said. \n \n Cecil E. Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, said changes in the law were vital but so were changes in the agency. \"If you don't have enforcement along with a strong law, then you don't have a law,\" Mr. Roberts said. \"The current agency mentality is to cooperate with mine operators rather than watchdog them, and safety suffers as a result.\"\n \n Even when Congress passes strong safety laws, the agency can write regulations that work around them. In 2004, for example, after years of pressure from mine operators, regulators wrote a rule that let mines use conveyor belts not just for moving coal but also to draw in fresh air from outside. A law already existed preventing such safety regulations because of concerns that in the event of a fire, the belts would carry flames and deadly gases directly to the work area or vital evacuation routes. \n \n Though the investigation is not complete, many experts say this is probably what occurred at the Aracoma Alma No. 1 Mine in Logan County, W.Va., where a fire left two miners dead on Jan 21.\n \n Mr. Fillpot said his agency was revising the regulations on imposing penalties. He also pointed to civil suits filed by the agency in what he said was an increasing effort to force operators to pay millions of dollars in unpaid penalties.\n \n \"You can expect to see more of these types of efforts from us in the coming months,\" Mr. Fillpot said. \n \n Mr. Williams, the miner who is partly paralyzed, remains skeptical.\n \n \"All I know is the roof collapsed only days after a federal inspector looked right at those pillars and saw that the operator was having us do illegal things,\" he said. \"In these mines, laws don't matter.\"\n \n Ian Urbina reported from Craigsville, W.Va., and Andrew W. Lehren from New York.",

A recent data analysis by The Times documented a risky, business-friendly downturn in penalties since 2001. At the same time, nearly half of the announced fines still go uncollected. \n \n With a rash of 24 mine deaths so far this year, Congress is considering tougher fines of up to $500,000 for culpable companies. But what good are fines if they are not being forcefully used by the federal agencies supposedly responsible for workers' safety? This question must be asked in deadly earnest in the case of the Sago Mine in West Virginia, where a dozen miners perished in January. The company was later found to have been cited for 273 violations in two years' time, not one of them costing more than $460. \n \n Under present practices, fines are rarely levied at the maximum level, and even then companies can negotiate the penalties downward through an industry-friendly appeals process. Fines as low as $60, if collected, amount to jaywalking tickets. \n \n Beyond the slump in fines, the administration's record has been distinguished by budget and job cuts in critical mine safety agencies. Lately, there's been a flurry of reform proposals in response to the deaths in the headlines. But an administration that prefers to fill key regulatory positions with mining lobbyists and executives has a long way to go toward miner safety. It should begin with an urgent reversal of its embarrassing record on penalizing flagrantly negligent companies.",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/us/28mines.html\n \n April 28, 2006\n Surviving Miner's Story \n By IAN URBINA\n In the final desperate hours of the Sago Mine disaster that left 12 men dead in West Virginia, at least four of the air masks meant to protect the miners from dangerous smoke and fumes did not work, the sole survivor wrote in a letter to victims' families this week.\n \n \"The first thing we did was activate our rescuers, as we had been trained,\" wrote the miner, Randal McCloy Jr. \"At least four of the rescuers did not function. There were not enough rescuers to go around.\" \n \n The two-page typed letter offers the first detailed account of what happened to the 13 men trapped 260 feet underground, struggling for air as rescue crews tried to reach them. \n \n \"As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else,\" Mr. McCloy wrote.\n \n Mr. McCloy was comatose when he was rescued and spent months in a hospital with extensive brain damage, originally described as remembering nothing about the disaster.\n \n His letter, however, is a cogent and moving account of what happened, and it was not immediately clear how he came to compose it or why he chose to send it.\n \n Stephen P. Goodwin, the lawyer for the McCloy family, verified that the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, came from Mr. McCloy and that it had been dictated, but would not say who wrote it down for him. \"All I will say is that the letter accurately reflects all of his thoughts and sentiments,\" Mr. Goodwin said. \n \n Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers Union of America, said: \"The letter raises some key concerns yet again, as we have done in the past, about these oxygen generation packs.\" Mr. Smith said it was \"absolutely imperative\" that federal mine regulators \"begin an immediate and nationwide inspection of these units.\" \n \n In a statement, the mine owner, International Coal Group Inc., refused to comment on the validity of Mr. McCloy's recollection. But the company said the miners' air packs, also known as self-contained self-rescue devices, or S.C.S.R.'s, had been tested by federal investigators after the Jan. 2 explosion that trapped the miners.\n \n \"I.C.G. was informed that the S.C.S.R.'s found at the barricade were deployed and showed evidence of use,\" the statement said. \"The federal investigators did not note any defective S.C.S.R.'s and all appeared to be in working order.\"\n \n The statement did not indicate whether workers at the mine, which resumed work on March 15, were still depending on the same equipment. \n \n Dennis B. O'Dell, administrator of occupational health and safety for the mine workers union, said that a typical oxygen pack had a shelf life of about 10 years. Under federal regulations, miners are supposed to visually inspect oxygen packs to see whether the color-coded indicator shows that they are functioning properly. \n \n In the letter, Mr. McCloy said the men were forced to share the few functioning air packs. He said the miners tried to escape but had to retreat because of smoke and fumes. \n \n \"We found a sledgehammer, and for a long time, we took turns pounding away,\" Mr. McCloy wrote, describing their frantic efforts to get the attention of rescuers above.\n \n Eventually realizing they were unlikely to escape alive, the men recited a \"sinner's prayer,\" and began quietly penning farewell notes to their families, the letter said.\n \n While the cause of the explosion remains uncertain, the company has speculated that lightning bolt ignited a natural buildup of methane in the mine. Federal officials are conducting an investigation and are expected to release their findings next month. \n \n There have been 26 mining deaths nationwide in only the first four months of the year. Last year at this time, there were 13 nationwide.\n \n It was unclear how Mr. McCloy, who was initially unable to speak and now does so with difficulty, could have put together such a detailed chronology of events. Mr. McCloy, 27, who has been nicknamed the \"miracle miner,\" survived exposure to toxic fumes for more than 40 hours. \n \n The statement from the coal company said that all of the oxygen packs had been inspected daily by miners and every 90 days by a mining official.\n \n Dirk Fillpot, a spokesman with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said his agency examined all the air packs recovered from the mine. Initial tests concluded that the packs were functioning properly, Mr. Fillpot said. He said his agency was \"looking at whether the miners received adequate training in the use of their S.C.S.R.'s.\"\n \n In 2005, the Sago Mine had only one violation concerning its oxygen equipment, according to federal records. The violation was for failing keep proper records of inspections of the mine's oxygen packs.\n \n Representative George Miller of California, the senior Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, expressed outrage at the revelations in the letter.\n \n \"The Bush administration killed a proposal in 2001 that could have required the more frequent replacement of these self-contained self-rescue units,\" Mr. Miller said, \"required more inspections of these units, and provided more adequate training on how to use them.\"\n \n He also expressed frustration that a mine safety bill sponsored by Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia, and supported by the West Virginia delegation had yet to receive a vote from the full committee. It would mandate more oxygen packs in mines and the construction of safe chambers where miners could go if the exits were blocked in an emergency.\n \n \"Miners are dying at an alarming rate,\" Mr. Rahall said. \"If this letter and the ongoing tragedies are not a motivation enough for Congress to act, then, by golly, I don't know what will be.\"",

(AP) -- ''Did our dad have to die?'' Peggy Cohen want to know Tuesday as mine safety regulators opened an emotional public hearing on questions still surrounding the January disaster that left 12 men dying deep inside the Sago Mine.\n \n Wives and children of the other miners followed her to the microphone, some clutching framed photos of the victims.\n \n ''We assure you, Mr. Politicians, that we're not going to let this rest,'' said John Groves, whose brother Jerry Groves was among the victims. ''We know in our hearts that this can be corrected. It needs to be done immediately, it needs to be done now. And it's on you.\n \n ''If another accident happens without safety changes, you are responsible.''\n \n Four months after the blast, officials from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, West Virginia's Office of Miners' Health Safety and the company that owns the Sago Mine began testifying about the disaster in a two-day public hearing.\n \n The miners' families wanted to know whether lightning caused the blast inside the mine that killed one of the crew. They also wanted to know why it took MSHA 11 hours to start the search for the trapped crew, and how the false news spread that 12 of the 13 trapped men were alive when all the men but one, Randal McCloy Jr., were dead.\n \n With government investigations underway, Groves wasn't expecting many answers.\n \n The testimony Tuesday centered on the mine's safety record in the year before the explosion and whether state and federal officials had appropriately enforced regulations.\n \n Kevin Stricklin, MSHA's district manager, defended the federal agency's enforcement efforts and talked about how MSHA and mine owner International Coal Group had been working to make the mine safer since ICG took over.\n \n ''I do think the mine did seem to be improving in the fourth quarter of 2005,'' Stricklin said. ''It wasn't a perfect mine, but we were working to make a better mine than what it was.''\n \n State and federal investigators have not determined precisely what caused the explosion and were expected to press ICG officials on Wednesday to explain why it believes a powerful lightning strike triggered methane gas in a sealed off section of the mine.\n \n One overriding question from the miners' relatives, including Fred Ware's daughter, Peggy Cohen: Was the explosion preventable?\n \n The blast occurred as crews were preparing to resume production after the New Year's holiday. Two miners entered the mine before the crews entered to check for problems.\n \n One of them, fireboss Terry Helms, is believed to have died in the explosion. The second escaped, but has told federal and state investigators that his inspection report has been lost.\n \n That doesn't sit well with Debbie Hamner, widow of George Hamner and the families' representative on the hearing panel. She said another miner recalls Helms reporting ''two small violations, but he can't remember what they were.''\n \n ''My husband's dead, so there's no small violations to me,'' Hamner said. ''This explosion, I believe, was preventable, and I don't call this an accident. I call this a disaster.''\n \n J. Davitt McAteer, a former MSHA director, is leading the hearing and the state investigation into the disaster. Gov. Joe Manchin has asked him for a report by July 1, along with recommendations on how to make coal mines safer, though McAteer said that deadline could be pushed back.\n \n McAteer said Tuesday that the families' testimony in such a hearing was rare, but he said: ''They have a right to expect that everything necessary will be done to improve mine health and safety conditions in the United States so that the Sago Mine disaster will be remembered as a turning point, as well as a tragedy.''\n \n In the end, the families say the hearings are about those 12 men who ''died doing what they were trained to do,'' said Pam Campbell, whose brother-in-law Marty Bennett died in the mine.\n \n ''They tried to escape, and when they couldn't escape, they went back where they knew they had air, and they barricaded themselves the way they were taught,'' she said. ''And as they shared rescuers amongst them, they beat on roof bolts and nobody listened. They waited for blasts from the surface, and those blasts never came.''",

The hearings are intended to give the families a chance to ask questions directly of the officials involved. By turns plaintive, skeptical and mocking, they challenged government regulators and officials of the International Coal Group, the mine owner, to provide more information.\n \n Family members remain angry about communications breakdowns that began immediately after the explosion, at 6:30 a.m. A misunderstanding late in the evening among rescuers in the mine led to a false report that all the miners had survived. Relatives waiting at the Sago Baptist Church were crushed when they learned, hours later, that all but one of the men had, in fact, died. \n \n \"My dad was the mine operator,\" Mrs. Cohen said at the hearing. \"Did he have a walkie-talkie that day, and did you ever try to contact him with it?\"\n \n Jeffrey Toler, superintendent of the mine and a nephew of Martin Toler Jr., who died in the accident, answered, \"Sadly, I didn't even think to take a radio into the mine with me.\" Mr. Toler said he had come within 2,000 feet of the lost miners minutes after the explosion, but was forced to evacuate because of rising carbon monoxide levels. \"That is part of my nightmare from that day, and I truly apologize to you.\"\n \n The explosion occurred in a closed section of the mine, according to John Stemple, assistant director of safety for International Coal. The company released a report March 14 that said the explosion might have originated with an enormous lightning strike that blew up a tree a mile and a half from the mine at nearly the exact instant the blast occurred. \n \n \"That's possible,\" said Robert M. Friend, acting director of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. \"I wouldn't say it's probable.\"\n \n The closed section had been sealed off with stone barricades that should have prevented the blast from affecting areas still being mined, Mr. Stemple said. \n \n Several barricades failed, however, and were so obliterated by the explosion that rescuers stepped over them without noticing, said Sam Kitts, senior vice president of operations for International Coal. \n \n Relatives asked whether the workers who installed the barricades had been properly trained, whether the barricades had been properly anchored to the mine walls and whether state or company workers had ever inspected the walls. \n \n Kevin G. Stricklin, district manager for the mine safety administration, said he did not know exactly how the barricades had been constructed.\n \n \"Well, you signed the order,\" said Russell Bennett, the son of Marty Bennett, one of the coal miners who died. \"You should know.\" \n \n The miners each carried self-rescuers, canisters that are supposed to provide an hour's worth of oxygen in case of an emergency. Initial tests by the safety administration showed that all of the canisters were functional, Mr. Friend said.\n \n But in a letter last week to victims' families, Randal McCloy Jr., the one surviving miner, wrote that four of the canisters had malfunctioned, forcing miners to share what little oxygen they had. Some officials have questioned whether the miners were adequately trained to use the devices.\n \n \"They donned their respirators and barricaded themselves as they were trained,\" said Christopher Toler, the son of Martin Toler Jr. \"Instead of pointing fingers at the men, M.S.H.A. is the one who needs to answer for its actions.\"",

(AP) -- A mining professor suggested that an electrical pulse from a lightning strike snaked into the mouth of Sago Mine and traveled down a conveyor belt, where it caused the explosion that led to the deaths of 12 miners.\n \n Once inside, the charge stopped just feet from the sealed-off section where the blast occurred, Thomas Novak, a professor at Virginia Tech, told a panel Wednesday on the second day of hearings into what caused the blast.\n \n ''Lightning doesn't have to strike something directly'' to cause an explosion, Novak said, then agreed under questioning that his preliminary findings could be characterized as a ''hypothesis.''\n \n Many at the hearings, which were to continue Thursday, have been skeptical about the explanation. International Coal Group, which owns the mine, announced in March that its internal investigation pointed to lightning as the cause of the blast, though it could not explain the precise conduit the electricity took into the mine. Federal and state regulators have yet to release their findings.\n \n The Jan. 2 blast killed one miner immediately, while 12 other miners slowly succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning in the gas-filled mine. One miner, Randal McCloy Jr., survived.\n \n United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts challenged Novak on the improbability of the explosion having been caused by a lightning strike so far from the mine -- and one traveling such an indirect path.\n \n ''In the history of coal mining in North America ... can you cite one single incident where lightning has struck the ground without going through a conduit of some type, such as metal pipe?'' Roberts asked.\n \n ''No, I can't,'' Novak said.\n \n ''But you come today suggesting that that's what happened at Sago, is that correct?''\n \n After a pause, Novak replied, ''That's correct.''\n \n Although rare, lightning strikes have been known to cause underground explosions.\n \n A 2001 report by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health blamed lightning for seven coal mine explosions that occurred in sealed, abandoned areas. In most cases, the seals on the worked-out sections were destroyed, and in all, some metallic conduit was later identified.\n \n ICG said it plans to hire another expert to assess the mine geology for the possibility of metal in the rock walls, roof and floor of the sealed area.\n \n Performance of the seals on a worked-out section of the mine is another area investigators have focused on as they explore the causes and aftermath of the explosion that killed 12 miners. Investigators and officials with ICG believe methane had accumulated near the seals and was somehow ignited.\n \n Dense foam block seals were blown apart by forces as much as 4 1/2 times stronger than they were built to withstand, Stephen G. Sawyer, a former engineer with the Mine Safety and Health Administration hired as a consultant by ICG, testified.\n \n Every seal involved was exposed to at least 25 pounds of pressure per square inch, slightly higher than the 20 psi federal standard for sealed mines, Sawyer said. What remains unclear is the amount of pressure it takes for the seals to fail and whether federal regulations should be toughened.\n \n Participants, including lawmakers and miners' families, also challenged Sawyer, forcing him to concede that while he'd been underground many times, Sago was his first trip into a mine's worked-out, sealed-off part.\n \n ''I bet it was for a lot of people,'' Sawyer said. ''One thing about Sago: We're going to learn a lot.''",

Coal miners are trained to bang metal roof bolts repeatedly, and those vibrations can be sensed by seismographs set up by rescuers at the mine entrance. \n \n \"The night of this tragedy, we asked whether anyone was listening to hear the miners pounding,\" said Bill Hamilton, a Republican in the West Virginia House. \"We were told yes, they were. But today we learned that wasn't true.\"\n \n The seismographs were never deployed, Mr. Urosek said, because the agency's system was designed in the 1970's and takes at least 12 hours to set up at the site. \n \n Mr. Bennett criticized the mine safety agency for its decision not to allow rescuers to enter the mine until 11 hours after the explosion. \n \n \"You guys are investigating International Coal Group,\" Mr. Bennett said to Mr. Gates, referring to the owner of the mine. \"Who's investigating M.S.H.A. and the state?\"\n \n Federal regulators responded that they could not answer many questions because their investigation was incomplete. But by the end of the day, it was clear they had grown tired of defending actions they said were taken by International Coal.\n \n \"I'll tell you this. M.S.H.A. doesn't own Sago Coal Company,\" said Ray McKinney, the agency's administrator of mine safety. \"M.S.H.A. doesn't contract mine rescue teams for Sago Coal Company. And M.S.H.A. is not responsible if Sago Coal Company doesn't train their people to know what to do in an emergency.\"\n \n On Wednesday, consultants hired by International Coal presented a theory of how electricity from a powerful lightning bolt might have traveled four miles into the sealed-off area to ignite the explosion. State and federal inspectors said they were still investigating that theory.\n \n But regulators have not ruled out the possibility that a falling section of roof behind the seals could have provided the spark.",

(AP) -- A three-day public hearing about the Sago Mine disaster ended much as it had begun, with a flood of tears, some hearts full of anger and too many questions unanswered.\n \n ''Can you tell the families what murdered our men?'' Debbie Hamner, whose husband George ''Junior'' Hamner died, demanded of state and federal investigators. When there was no immediate reply, she added, ''No one wants to answer?''\n \n That, she was finally told, is the goal of the continuing investigation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.\n \n Dozens of witnesses testified during some 27 hours of hearings, which concluded Thursday. Topics ranged from how seals were built on mined-out areas and how lightning could have ignited methane gas to why miners' air packs weren't used up and what caused the miscommunication underground that caused families to believe for three hours that 12 miners had survived 41 hours of entrapment when only one had.\n \n In at least one way, the hearing was a success -- it gave family members of the 12 dead miners the chance to question federal and state authorities. One man was killed in the blast and 11 others died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Only one man, Randal McCloy Jr., survived.\n \n ''Family members got to do something they have never before in history, ever, got to do, and that was to question federal government and state officials,'' said Pam Campbell, sister-in-law of fallen Sago miner Marty Bennett.\n \n The daughter of miner Terry Helms was asked if she believed the hearing was just ''for show.''\n \n ''I don't think any coal company at this point can do this for show because they're going to be 'on show' for a really long time,'' said Amber Helms, ''and it would actually be easier for them to implement these things.\n \n Chris Toler said in a letter that he was thankful for the hearings and will discard the pent-up anger he has felt over the death of his father, Martin Toler. But Hamner's daughter, Sarah Bailey, lashed out at mine owner International Coal Group Inc. in a tearful rage.\n \n ''ICG's neglect and lack of consideration for human life and safety has robbed me of a man who was dear to my heart,'' she shouted, sobbing. ''Their actions have caused our house to be an empty space that can never be filled again.''\n \n ICG President Ben Hatfield said there was nothing unusual to warn mine managers that an explosion was imminent, and he assured relatives that everyone was ''working tirelessly, using all resources available, to save your family members.''\n \n ''We deeply regret that there was not a different outcome,'' he said.",

That was scandalous enough. But the methane pocket that set off the blast in an abandoned shaft had never been effectively sealed off, since the company had cut corners with inadequate foam-block seals.\n \n Down below, faulty breathing masks sped the demise of the workers as they wrote farewell notes and prayed. Up above, better communications and tracking gear could have saved the men. The company had more apparent say in the rescue than supposed government protectors.\n \n The report amounts to an action agenda for reforming the withered state of mine safety. It begins with recommendations for better communications and breathing equipment that's already available. It calls on government to force the industry to use some of its booming profits to install refuge chambers in underground mines. \n \n Existing law that methane pockets have seals able to contain explosions clearly was not a priority at Sago, where the inquiry found \"catastrophic failure.\" The federal mine safety agency is promising to require stronger concrete seals. But the industry's rising death tally has underlined the shortcomings of that agency, bedeviled with patronage appointees from the coal industry and the loss of scores of safety inspectors to save money.\n \n The ultimate challenge of the Sago report is to the political powers. They must show the courage to look beyond their obeisance to the coal industry and make the lives of miners the highest priority.",
