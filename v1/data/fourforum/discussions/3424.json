Income alone does not explain the racial scoring gap. Consider these facts:\n \n *Whites from families with incomes of less than $10,000 had a mean SAT score of 980. This is 123 points higher than the national mean for all Blacks.\n \n *Whites from families with incomes below $10,000 had a mean SAT test score that was 46 points higher than blacks whose families had incomes of between $80,000 and $100,000.\n \n *Blacks from families with incomes of more than $100,000 had a mean SAT score that was 142 points below the mean score for Whites from families at the same income level.\n \n Homicide: Who's Killing Whom?\n \n The disparity in interracial murder rates is astounding. For every 100,000 White people, how many do you think kill Blacks? And for every 100,000 Negroes, how many do think kill Whites? Let's find out...\n \n Kill ratios Averaged for Five Years\n \n B on W - W on B\n 1994 1306 469\n 1995 1110 454\n 1996 1077 417\n 1997 974 343\n 1998 839 362\n ----- ------\n Total 5306 2045\n \n Average 1061.2 409\n \n \n White Population in thousands:\n \n 1998: 223,001\n 1997: 221,317\n 1996: 219,623\n 1995: 218,010\n 1994: 216,365\n \n Total: 1,098,316,000\n Average: 219,663,200\n \n Black Population in thousands:\n \n 1998: 34,431\n 1997: 33,973\n 1996: 33,518\n 1995: 33,098\n 1994: 32,654\n \n Total: 167,674,000\n Average: 33,534,800\n \n Black average of White murders / Black average population per 100,000:\n \n 1061 / 33,534,800 x 100,000 = 3.16\n \n White average of Black murders / White average population per 100,000:\n \n \n 409 / 219,663,200 x 100,000 = 0.186\n \n 3.16/0.186 = 16.99\n \n Conclusion: BLACKS ARE 17 TIMES (1700%) MORE LIKELY TO KILL WHITES THAN WHITES ARE TO KILL BLACKS\n \n \n Liberals often try to blame Black violence on poverty. The census data, however, disproves that hypothesis. How? In 1995, among the American poor, there were 16.3 million Whites (real ones), 10.0 million Blacks, 8.6 million \"Hispanics,\" and 1.4 million Asians. Blacks comprised about 27.6% of the American poor. Those poverty numbers can be verified at:\n \n http://www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/pov95/povest1.html\n \n During that year, Blacks committed about 54% of all US murders. Remember that the FBI, from whom the murder information comes, counts \"Hispanics\" as \"Whites,\" making the total number of poor persons eligible to be committing murders as \"Whites\" about 24.8 million. These \"Whites\" comprised 68.5% of the American poor, but committed -\n at most - only 46% of 1995 US murders, if we make the doubtful assumption that Asians and Amerindians committed none. The evidence argues against the liberal hypothesis that poverty causes crime.\n \n Rape is an economic crime if liberals are willing to admit that women are merchandise or \"goods\", and that menare compelled to take them because they're impoverished, and not criminal scum.\n \n See page 10:\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/soo.pdf\n \n The racial distribution of arrestees for rape is similar to the racial distribution for all violent arrests: 56% of arrestees for rape in 1995 were White, 42% were Black, and 2% were of other races.\n \n The population of all races - approx. 275,617,000\n White: 226,563,000\n Black: 35,392,000\n \n 226,563,000/275,617,000 = 82.2% of Whites in America\n \n 35,392,000/275,617,000 = 12.8% of Blacks in America\n \n Child abuse: Sexual All types Sexual Total\n Whites 64.8% 54.8% 17,978 139,480\n Blacks 19.2% 30.8% 5,399 78,339\n \n Source:\n \n http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/cb/publications/ncands96/table25.htm\n \n White total child abuse per 100,000:\n \n 139,480/2265.63 = 61.6\n \n Black total child abuse per 100,000:\n \n 78,339/353.92 = 221.4\n \n Now let's divide the smaller White rate into the larger black rate to get a comparison:\n \n 221.4/61.6 = 3.6\n \n Conclusion: Blacks are 3.6 times MORE LIKELY to abuse their children than Whites.\n \n White sexual child abuse per 100,000 (226,563,000/100,000 = 2265.63):\n \n 17,978/2265.63 = 7.94\n \n Black sexual child abuse per 100,000 (35,392,000/100,000 = 353.92):\n \n 5399/353.92 = 15.25\n \n Now let's divide the smaller White rate into the larger black rate to get a\n comparison:\n \n 15.25/7.94 = 1.9\n \n Conclusion: Blacks are 1.9 times MORE LIKELY to sexually abuse their children than Whites.\n \n \n It's almost impossible to adopt White babies in America\n \n http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/nation/intfile3-1.txt\n \n Population Figures:\n \n year White Black (in thousands)\n \n 1990 209,196 30,629\n 1991 210,975 31,137\n 1992 212,874 31,683\n 1993 214,691 32,195\n 1994 216,379 32,672\n \n avg. 212,823 31,663\n \n Now let's look at the race of children awaiting adoption from that same period.\n \n http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/cb/dis/vcis/iv19a.htm\n \n year White Black\n \n 1990 9,801 8,159\n 1991 10,193 9,650\n 1992 11,137 11,170\n 1993 11,538 12,199\n 1994 16,496 20,234\n \n avg: 11,833 12,282\n \n White Average of Children Awaiting Adoption per 100,000:\n \n 11,833/2128.23 = 5.56\n \n Black Average of Children Awaiting Adoption per 100,000:\n \n 12,282/316.63 = 38.79\n \n Black Average divided by White Average to get a rate comparison:\n \n 38.79/5.56 = 6.98\n \n Conclusion: A BLACK CHILD IS SIX TIMES (600%) MORE LIKELY TO BE AWAITING ADOPTION THAN A WHITE CHILD.\n \n \n Africa's problems:\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/771271.stm\n \n Roads: only 16% paved\n Telephones: 10 per 1000\n Electricity: 80% lack access\n Aids: 35 million infected\n Sanitation: inadequate for 75% of rural population\n Source: Can Africa Claim the 21st Century\n \n The total combined income of 48 countries in Africa is little more than that of Belgium.\n \n In the last 40 years, average incomes per person in Africa have stagnated while they have grown in most of the rest of the world.\n \n Africa now accounts for only 1% of the total world economic output and 2% of world trade.\n \n On average, African countries have economies smaller than a town of 60,000 people in a rich country.\n \n With only 10m telephone lines, half of them in South Africa, there is little chance of most Africans gaining access to the internet.\n \n Africa has fewer roads than Poland, only 16% of which are paved, and only one in five households has access to electricity.\n \n Two-thirds of rural Africans lack adequate water supplies, while three quarters lack adequate sanitation.\n \n \n \n \n .",

(Regardless of this fact you are still much more likely to be murdered by a white person, but I digress.) It seems to me that if the whole of white society were to abandon the whole of black society as an act of self-preservation there would be a major backfire. Left to their own murderous devices (as you have aptly demonstrated they have no shortage of) wouldn't they rise against the comparatively wealthy whites?\n \n In this racial war, whites would outnumber blacks by a considerable margin but they would be very vulnerable targets in their little enclaves. (It's far better to be the people on the outside of the castle than those on the inside.) Eventually black people would be eradicated but at what cost to your beloved white race? How many of them would die and would it really be worth the price paid? \n \n Wouldn't it just be easier to work towards making individual members of society more equitable? This would certainly result in many fewer white people dead. Or are you operating under the assumption that this racial war in a historical inevitability (much like the proletariat uprisings that Marx and Engels wrote of) and so we might as well bring it on?\n \n Whistler",

Statements like \"There is no reason that people should not consider that higher crime rates among black men has a lot to do with the way society has treated them. \" Are not part of the solution, either. By making excuses liek this, you give somethign fro unsucessful blacks to fall back on when they fail not due to \"teh way society has treated them\" but because they have failed to take advantage of the opportunities offered. \n \n The opportunities have been provided, as has the funding. The black community has reached the point where every assistance has been provided, yet individually a large number of them fail to take advantage of those opportunities. A lot have, and you are seeing a lot more black professionals in the workplace. I have found it interetsing that many of these black professionals who HAVE taken advatage of the opportunities offerd them, LOATHE those of their own race who have not and who complain about being oppressed by society. \n \n Outside of a few activists blacks, like jesse jackson or Al Sharpton, who make millions exploiting their own people as mounthpieces against social injustice, I think you would ba hard pressed to find affluent blacks (and there are plenty of them out there) who support any more spending or any more social programs to aid the black community. Even looking at the demographics of those who support guys like Jackson, they are predomintaly lower class or lower middle class. \n \n I have a black guy who works for me. He is an engineer.

When was the last time you heard of a black CEO of a Fortune 500 company? \n\n \n When was the last time you heard of an eskimo that was the CEO of a fortune 500 company, or a korean, or somebody who is chinese? The majority of our society is white. When youare talking an exclusive group like fortune 500 ceos, the majority of them are going to be white. In a society where the folks who end up in such positions are generally from old money families, the VAST majority is going to be white. \n \n If it was really a problem with white culture trying to keep minorities down, you would see similar descrepancies when it comes to the incomes of various other ethnic groups, but you don't. If you look at some of the asian groups, their average income is actually above that of whites, which is pretty impressive sance many of them are immigrants. \n \n \nI also disagree that it is easier for a black kid to get into college than a white one. If you take factors such as the fact that the poverty level is higher among black people, it probably isn't easier across the board.

A black kid has more than 4x the public and private funding available that a white kid does. The fact that there is a higher level of poverty in the black community workd FOR the black kid trying to go to college. People who are from families that live below the poverty lavel are almost gauranteed a high level of government aid. Add in black only scholarships like the NAACP programs, and a black kid can go to college, have money in their pocekt to play with, and never spend a dime of their own money.\n \n \n \nAgreed, but they are a minority trying to make it in a white society.

Do you think that blacks are just geneticly inferior, prone to ignorance and laziness? \n \n This is the problem with the liberal mindset when it coems to minorities. It is so incredibly racist that it should make those who really dont subscribe to the racist mentality sick. Wheras most conservatives seem to feel that, given equal opportunity, minority gorups should be able to do just fine in this country.

They didn't have to work, but always had party money. I, on the other hand, carried multiple majors so I could apply for a variety of specialist private scholarships, was not eligible for any need based finacial aid as I was from a fairly affluent family.

   "I agree. Statements like \"There is no reason that people should not consider that higher crime rates among black men has a lot to do with the way society has treated them. \" Are not part of the solution, either. By making excuses liek this, you give somethign fro unsucessful blacks to fall back on when they fail not due to \"teh way society has treated them\" but because they have failed to take advantage of the opportunities offered. \n \n The opportunities have been provided, as has the funding. The black community has reached the point where every assistance has been provided, yet individually a large number of them fail to take advantage of those opportunities. A lot have, and you are seeing a lot more black professionals in the workplace. I have found it interetsing that many of these black professionals who HAVE taken advatage of the opportunities offerd them, LOATHE those of their own race who have not and who complain about being oppressed by society. \n \n Outside of a few activists blacks, like jesse jackson or Al Sharpton, who make millions exploiting their own people as mounthpieces against social injustice, I think you would ba hard pressed to find affluent blacks (and there are plenty of them out there) who support any more spending or any more social programs to aid the black community. Even looking at the demographics of those who support guys like Jackson, they are predomintaly lower class or lower middle class. \n \n I have a black guy who works for me. He is an engineer.

You think we all grease each others palms and make it easy for other white people to succeed. This is not the truth. There is no club. There is no help. To make it in this society you must have ambition.

   "Anastagia, he won the debate. Every one dismissed him as racist rather than refutting his facts.\n \n Sinjin, not disabilities, rather dispositions or attitudes. Tell me why in todays world these people can not pull themselves up by the boot straps and bring the majority of their people to a higher living standard? Several individuals seperate themselves from the pack and make it, yet the group as a whole have not. Several other ethnic groups did it. The Irish, the Italians, Hispanics. It is not the color of their skin, but the culture that they keep.\n \n Bremmer, The facts above are not from bias pollsters with an objective. They are straight from the DOC, FBI, Department of justice. They are straight from the people that have to deal with them once we determine them no longer fit to be a part of society.\n \n Dzeron, I can't allow you get away with a blanket statement such as \"racial government policies.\" Please expand with specific example of such policies.\n \n I don't mean to burn crosses here. I don't believe pointing fingers and blaming the white man for someone elses failings will ever help that person achieve. I do think that we have fallen into a trap where any white man that say anything negative in nature about a black man is immediatly labeled a racist.\n \n Whistler, I don't know what the solution is. I don't think seig does either. I do know that first we must recognize the problem in order to solve it.\n\n \n Yes, the problem is all the melanin. I think we have a lesson to learn here from Micheal Jackson. Look, he made his skin pale and white and he never commits any crimes (against adults).\n \n \nI find it curious that when a person posts things like this, there will always be someone who will call it hating. or call names such as bigot or racist. Not everyone must agree that race mixing is ok....when in fact it is causing soooooooooo many medical problems. There IS a difference in bloods and organs but some are having difficulties accepting this FACT! No matter what someone chooses to beleive, it wasn't meant to be, race mixing.\n\n This is pretty funny. Please tell me why Halle Berry or Tiger Woods should be in intensive care right now.\n \n If race mixing was never meant to be, then why are there so many \"races\"?\n Or are you just talking about the main three (Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid)? I mean you shouldn't mix them to make Indians or Semetics or Arabs or Latinos. I mean look at all the health problems they have. \n \n \nWhat i really find disturbing is why you choose to ignore truths and facts....did you know that the blacks that were brought here from Africa were the criminal and the mentally deranged? 90% of blacks here today are a product of them.....think about that for a week.....have you listened to \"gangsta rap\" lately? it is the decay of the 90s....of society....but they keep getting richer!!!!!!!\n\n I love your \"facts.\" \n Actually most slaves were (1) sold by rival warlords who had conquered them (2) captured outright by raids on small villages (3) or prisoners. The majority of them came from (1) and a small minority came from (3).\n http://www.uncensoredentertainment.com/politics-slavery-revisited.html\n a nice little quote:\n \nSince most West African societies did not recognize private property in land, slaves functioned as one of the only profitable means of production individuals could own. West Africans, therefore, acquired and expressed wealth in terms of dependent people, whether as kin, clients, or slaves. \n\n This lack of private land ownership in west africa may be a root of susequent and current troubles. \n \n I'm not going to dignify the lame rap argument.\n \n \n For example Outkast outstrip all Brittney Spears talent by miles and miles and miles and miles. \n\n Sorry, they may have more talent thant Britney Spears, but that's not saying a lot. \n \n OUTKAST SUCKS!!!!!! \n \n THEY SUCK THEY SUCK THEY SUCK THEY SUCK\n \n like,, A LOT!!!!!!\n \n whew, there i said it......\n \n \nwell i hate to burst your bubble but Jimi Hendrix was the first to do all the \"noise\" on the guitar and yes he knew how to paly the guitar but is hardly the greatest guitarist........if one doesn't play guitar then he probably \"sounds\" like the greatest.....true talent is one who can play anything, not just 3 or 4 chords at the same genre....i don't know of any \"true\" talent starting from the 90s......rap is NOT music.....it is a jungle beat on a drum machine shouting out all kinds of pure nonsense and promoting mostly violence.\n\n Jimi Hendrix is the greatest. Period. \n Listen to live versions of Red House or Message of Love or I Hear My Train a Coming. Nobody sounds like Hendrix. Not now not ever. He took blues, mixed it with psychedelic and funk and rock and R&B and put out things that were aggressive and frenetic and at the same time beautiful.",
