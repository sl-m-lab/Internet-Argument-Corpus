Where the hell is the water for these people? Why can't sandwiches be dropped to those people in that Superdome down there? This is Thursday! This is Thursday! This storm happened five days ago. It's a disgrace, and don't think the world isn't watching. This is the government the taxpayers are paying for and it's fallen right flat on its face, in the way its handled this thing. \n \n CNN is also reporting that Charity Hospital in New Orleans has no security, no Guardsmen, no military or police at all.\n \n But don't worry--we've got all the troops we need to handle things.\n \n Jesus Christ on a pogo stick.\n \n People are dying, right now, as a result of the Bush administration's utter ****ing incompetence.\n \n ...Cafferty's not the only one who's angry. I just can't believe what I'm seeing on the tv. For the past couple years, critics of the administration have been trying to point out a couple of things: (1) Iraq is diverting resources from actual homeland security and (2) the situation in Iraq is almost certainly a complete XXXX-up. Well, the first point has been proven at far too high a price, and as for the second--they can lie about Iraq and plenty of people will believe them. Iraq's a long ways away. But this is New Orleans, Louisianna, and we're all watching the biggest ****up in history play out in real time.\n \n Just think about this: we've all made a lot of jokes about the Department of Homeland Security over the past four years. But apparently, the Department of Homeland Security has absolutely no plan for dealing with devastation on this scale, which is supposedly the thing we've all been worried about for four years.\n \n Neither do they seem to have given much thought to the transportation of refugees after a catastrophic event. In this case, we had 24 hours notice and the vast majority of the population got out on their own. If a terrorist attack of this magnitude were to occur, it would occur without warning, and the refugee problem would be exponentially greater. But right now, they can't even get in enough busses to get those people out of the Superdome.\n \n It may turn out that that stupid color coded chart really is Homeland Security's proudest achievement.\n\n \n http://echidneofthesnakes.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_echidneofthesnakes_archive.html#112557635057638481\n \n \n\"There are multiple people dying at the convention center,\" Lawrence said. \"There was an old woman, dead in a wheelchair with a blanket draped over her, pushed up against a wall. Horrible, horrible conditions.\n \n \"We saw a man who went into a seizure, literally dying right in front of us.\"\n \n This morning, about 7:05 am Eastern time, George Bush was interviewed by Diane Sawyers on ABC's Good Morning America. This is what he said:\n \n \n \"I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees.\"\n \n \n Mm. Here is a quote from an article originally published on June 8, 2004 in the Times-Picayune:\n \n \n For the first time in 37 years, federal budget cuts have all but stopped major work on the New Orleans area's east bank hurricane levees, a complex network of concrete walls, metal gates and giant earthen berms that won't be finished for at least another decade.\n \n \"I guess people look around and think there's a complete system in place, that we're just out here trying to put icing on the cake,\" said Mervin Morehiser, who manages the \"Lake Pontchartrain and vicinity\" levee project for the Army Corps of Engineers. \"And we aren't saying that the sky is falling, but people should know that this is a work in progress, and there's more important work yet to do before there is a complete system in place.\"\n \n ...\n \n \"I can't tell you exactly what that could mean this hurricane season if we get a major storm,\" Naomi said. \"It would depend on the path and speed of the storm, the angle that it hits us.\n \n \"But I can tell you that we would be better off if the levees were raised, . . . and I think it's important and only fair that those people who live behind the levee know the status of these projects.\"\n \n ...\n \n The Bush administration's proposed fiscal 2005 budget includes only $3.9 million for the east bank hurricane project. Congress likely will increase that amount, although last year it bumped up the administration's $3 million proposal only to $5.5 million.\n \n \"I needed $11 million this year, and I got $5.5 million,\" Naomi said. \"I need $22.5 million next year to do everything that needs doing, and the first $4.5 million of that will go to pay four contractors who couldn't get paid this year.\"\n \n \n \n And here is an excerpt from May of this year:\n \n \n In the event of a slow-moving Category 4 or Category 5 hurricane (with winds up to or exceeding 155 miles per hour), it's possible that only those crow's nests would remain above the water level. Such a storm, plowing over the lake, could generate a 20-foot surge that would easily overwhelm the levees of New Orleans, which only protect against a hybrid Category 2 or Category 3 storm (with winds up to about 110 miles per hour and a storm surge up to 12 feet). Soon the geographical \"bowl\" of the Crescent City would fill up with the waters of the lake, leaving those unable to evacuate with little option but to cluster on rooftops -- terrain they would have to share with hungry rats, fire ants, nutria, snakes, and perhaps alligators. The water itself would become a festering stew of sewage, gasoline, refinery chemicals, and debris.\n \n \n I guess it all depends on what one means by \"nobody\" and \"breach\" and so on.\n\n \n http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/8/30/212451/290\n http://www.prospect.org/web/printfriendly-view.ww?id=10180\n \n But according to Scott McClellan \"Now is not the time for finger pointing.\"\n You're right, Scott.

There are taxes collected that are targetted towards maintaining infrastructure, but a little history lesson is in order WRT New Orleans. The reason that the oil business boomed in Houston and NOT in New Orleans is because of the inherent corruption that was present in New Orleans. Big companies knew that in order to do business in NO, they'd have to pay huge bribes to local politicians. So, instead, they built their businesses in Houston, where corruption wasn't as prevalent.\n Why the history lesson? To demonstrate why nobody wants to give the local gov't significant amounts of cash.\n \n\n Now whether or not builing a city under sea level in hurricane country is a good idea or not is a different matter.\n\n \n No it isn't. Rebuilding New Orleans is just throwing good money after bad. At what point does sanity kick in? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "This is just a book review of the book that explains this.\n \n http://www.vdare.com/roberts/050425_unaccountable.htm\n\n From that link: \"Powell argues that the war, which began in 1914, was stalemated by 1917 and would have ended in a compromise peace. Wilson's entry into the war won the war for Britain and France and allowed the disastrously vindictive Versailles Treaty to be imposed on Germany.\"\n \n Wilson desperately tried to make the Treaty less harsh on Germany so that Germany wouldn't want revenge as well as ensuring Germany wasn't plummeted into an economic/social disaster, which would likely lead to extremism. Clemenceau on the other hand had other ideas, wanting to humiliate Germany, while Lloyd George wanted something in-between.\n \n Had Wilson got his way, Germany wouldn't have been so badly damaged, and it's highly doubtful that the Nazis would have found much support. How does this make him such a bad President?\n \n More from the link: \"Declaring Wilson to be \"the worst president in American history,\" Powell makes a strong case that the rise of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were unintended consequences of Wilson's arrogance.\" Wilson's actions led to communism in Russia?! I'd love to hear how the author manages to make a case for that. Can you make one? I don't really see the connection.\n \nhttp://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0310c.asp\n\n This shows the similarities between Bush and Wilson. I agree that the morality on entering WW1 and Iraq was and remains dubious. I don't see how this makes Wilson such a disastrous president. A lot of the things he wanted (America joining the League of Nations, lesser punishments for Germany and so on) were thwarted by people on his side (Clemenceau and congress).\n \n \nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200503/kennedy\n\n Can't comment as I can't see the article.\n \n \nYou're free to worship Bush as you please...\n\n Eh? I don't like Bush. I even thought Kerry was better (despite thinking he was fairly sh*t as well). I'm not arguing that Bush is good, just that WW isn't, imo, America's worst President.\n \n Finally:\n \n \n I dunno, read these and figure it out.\n I mean, damn, google is just so hard to use...\n\n I asked because I feel that WW isn't America's worst President.

   "Ah, yes, that was golden.\n \n \n Well so, anyway, I came across this article in The Nation.\n \n Somehow, this article cuts through the XXXX and gets the real human story out of everything.\n \n This article expresses my feelings on rebuilding New Orleans precisely, and the rest about the militarization of the area is just plain scary to me, including the mention of mercenaries, who are also in Iraq, which is never mentioned at all in MSM.\n \n http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050926/parentiweb\n \n \nNew Orleans: Raze or Rebuild?  \n Christian Parenti\n The water in the lower Ninth Ward is thickening into a glassy, fetid slick as the gasoline, oil, solvents and sewage from thousands of submerged vehicles and homes leaches out. Some rescue crews can stay out on their boats for only an hour before getting light-headed. The water's blue-black sheen casts back an almost mocking mirror image of the horrible devastation and incongruously beautiful blue sky above. \n \n A tour from Houston to Gulfport and into New Orleans for several days revealed not only this type of weird physical destruction but also a landscape of raw and tangled emotions, ranging from open fantasies of an impending race war to inspiring, ad hoc experiments in interracial mutual aid and grassroots organizing. This mix of the best and worst in American culture suggests the widely divergent political possibilities left in Katrina's wake. The storm could become an excuse to banish the African-American poor in the interests of the private redevelopment of New Orleans, or the city could become the geographic center of a progressive program of urban revitalization. \n \n In the lower Ninth Ward, controlled breaks by the Army Corps of Engineers have dropped the water by several feet, opening an archipelago of scum-encrusted islands that can be navigated by way of partially open streets. Late in the second week of the disaster a colleague and I made our way through this eerie and desolate maze. \n \n Though the area is routinely designated a ghetto, the homes of the Ninth Ward are mostly beautiful, century-old capes and bungalows, some with ornate wooden detailing reminiscent of old homes in the San Francisco Bay Area. \"They'll have to bulldoze it all,\" says a visiting New York City cop, surveying the damage from inside an NYPD van. \n \n Is that option--the right's much-touted tabula rasa--inevitable? \"They don't have to tear all these down,\" says Joe Peters, a Ninth Ward tier repairman. \"Under that siding, that's all cypress frames and barge board.\" Peters seems to think that the more solid homes of the Ninth Ward can be saved. Increasingly the holdouts here see the mandatory evacuation order as part of a huge land grab. \n \n I track down Mike Howell, a Nation reader I'd met several days before. \"Yeah, this could be their dream come true,\" he says. \"Get rid of all the poor African-Americans and turn the place into Disneyland.\" After camping on Howell's roof, my colleague and I leave him and his wife our extra water and gas and push on. \n \n At Kajun's, one of only two bars open at the end of last week, a bacchanalian, slap-happy air prevails among the handful of drunk and adrenaline-pumped patrons. A big man with a ponytail is weeping--he just put down his dog because it was biting everyone. A wide-eyed young woman named Caroline is changing the bandage on a dog-bite victim and talking a mile a minute. \"I am a massage therapist, but I am not licensed. I am giving garlic and herbs to everyone, even the soldiers.\" \n \n Outside, a man slips two bottles of cognac in the back seat of a police vehicle. The officer isn't harassing the patrons to leave. Someone brings him a big plastic cup of something iced. \n \n \"The evacuation order is just trying to get out the criminal element,\" says the cop in the classic flat, nasal Yat accent common to the Irish- and Italian-Americans who make up much of the city's white population. He explains how the military is mapping the city for holdouts using helicopters with infrared, and how troops on the ground mark the suspect building with a system of Xs and checks, a code that indicates to the police how many people are inside. The cop finishes his drink, shakes a few hands and rolls off. \n \n Facilitating the tabula rasa agenda is an increasingly militaristic attitude that borders on boyish fantasy and seems to pervade the numerous federal SWAT teams, out-of-town cops, private security forces, civilian volunteers and even journalists. There are exceptions: The young soldiers of the 82nd Airborne and First Cavalry seem much less caught up in it and are quite generous with their ice and MREs. \n \n When an APC full of federal marshals passes deep in the Ninth Ward, a journalist in a camo floppy hat riding with them glares at me and demands, \"Who are you with?\" For a second I think he's a cop. \n \n Downtown, a man on a bicycle wearing a pistol and carrying a medical bag says he's an emergency medical technician. \"I had to shoot one guy in the arm,\" the man explains. \"He was going for the bag. They think it's full of drugs.\" \n \n Elsewhere, two vehicle convoys from Blackwater USA--one of the biggest mercenary firms operating in Iraq--cruise the deserted city, their guns trained on rooftops ready for snipers, who have recently shot at a cell-tower repair crew. \n \n It seems the rescue effort is turning into an urban war game: An imaginary domestic version of the total victory that eludes America in Baghdad will be imposed here, on New Orleans. It's almost as if the Tigris--rather than the Mississippi--had flooded the city. The place feels like a sick theme park--Macho World--where cops, mercenaries, journalists and weird volunteers of all sorts are playing a out a relatively safe version of their militaristic fantasies about Armageddon and the cleansing iron fist. \n \n God's Wrath in Gulfport \n \n In Gulfport, Mississippi, God's wrath hath smitten the evil gaming industry. All the giant floating multi-story casinos have washed away--and much of their cash is unaccounted for. So, too, have all the houses on the beach been wiped out. An area two blocks from the beach is cordoned off because the shore is strewn with tons of rotting chicken and pork from a grounded freighter. Perhaps that cordon is also protecting the casinos' cash. \n \n At a shuttered gas station, I meet the young white night watchman, Joseph. He owns a seven-foot-long Monitor lizard and is going to great lengths to keep her warm now that the power is down. \"I have my plan for evacuation,\" he says. \"Those people in New Orleans shoulda too, but if you say that, then you're a racist.\" \n \n Later it comes out that Joseph thinks New Orleans is a cesspool that should be filled with even more water, that he doesn't like Vietnamese people and that he's licensed to carry a gun at all times. \"I tell you, we're on the verge of another Civil War in this country.\" \n \n A white woman pulls in to buy cigarettes. \"I think New Orleans is a satanic city,\" she says earnestly. \"I mean, I am not super-religious, but it's a horrible place full of very satanic people.\" She thinks voodoo and Mardi Gras might have something to do with Katrina's path. \n \n Trying to get gas north of Lake Pontchartrain, back in Louisiana, we pull in to a cops-only refueling depot and chat with a producer from Universal Studios in Florida who is now a volunteer parking attendant for the rescue effort. He's red with sunburn, fidgety and sweaty, his lingo laced with military jargon. \n \n \"My orders are to secure this area,\" he says. \"The situation is still pretty volatile here--there are a lot of evacuees from New Orleans around.\" He nods to the woods as if Charlie is out there on the proverbial tree line. \"I am trying to locate a truckload of NYPD ammunition that went missing.\" Everything about him says this is war. \"You guys be careful out there.\" Gun shops in Baton Rouge are reporting sales of up to a thousand a day. \n \n Outside a Red Cross shelter in Covington, there is a softer version of this siege mentality. When I interview some African-American evacuees, no less than four different white middle-class Red Cross staff intervene at various points, once even attempting to have me evicted from the area by police. In paternalistic tones, they explain to the black people I am talking with that newspapers and magazines do not give aid. \n \n \"Yes, ma'am, I know,\" says a woman named Raven. \"I want the whole world to hear my story.\" And the stories they tell are harrowing. \n \n A heavy-set older woman named Rosie Lee Riford is on the verge of tears. \"I am so worried. I feel like killing myself,\" she says. Her grown son, who uses a wheelchair due to a childhood gunshot wound, refused to leave the Saint Downs housing project. She was forced to leave without him as the storm took aim at New Orleans. Now that neighborhood is flooded. \"I never hurt anybody or did any wrong. I just keep asking God, Why? Why'd you do this?\" \n \n For Latino immigrants, the situation can be even worse. A Nicaraguan house painter named Juan tells me he will have to go home to Managua because he has lost everything: car, apartment, the business where he worked. He says the Red Cross cannot register him for benefits, so he eats at Latino churches. He bravely holds back tears. \n \n Not far from the Red Cross is a group from Veterans for Peace, who came here from Camp Casey in Crawford, Texas, and who are now coordinating a large-scale supply depot and distribution center. At the Vets' Internet tent sits Tenshenia Downs, a young, well-organized mother from East New Orleans. She is trying to find her relatives and set up housing in Atlanta. She spent a day on her roof with her three kids and was then evacuated by a National Guard flatboat and taken to the Superdome. \n \n \"It was like a prison,\" she says. \"It was hell. They had pedophiles up in there. People living like animals.\" She recounts the backed-up toilets, urine-flooded halls, the elderly near death, the fistfights, panic, lack of food and limited water. \n \n \"They wouldn't let us leave,\" she continues. \"But when I heard about the third rape, I just took my three kids and went. We waded through that water to I-10 and walked over the river to Gretna.\" From Gretna she walked and hitched rides with truckers and \"a real nice white couple\" here to Covington. \"I lost it all: everything in my house and a new car, no insurance.\" And the beauty spa where she worked, Bella Donna, is gone. \n \n She says she'll try and start over in Atlanta. Bizarrely, there is no Red Cross or FEMA clearinghouse of information yet established; instead, Ms. Downs is pointed to the MoveOn.org website for housing and job postings in Atlanta. \n \n Grace and Generosity in Houston \n \n At the Houston Astrodome, the stereotype of white America's worst nightmare has arrived: a wave of black people from some of the nation's worst ghettos. And, surprise, surprise, it's not so bad. \n \n On the sterile manicured lawns and the sidewalks of the sprawling shopping plaza around Reliant Center, hundreds of young dudes and well-dressed ladies from the Ninth Ward, East New Orleans and other desperately poor and excluded neighborhoods stroll around peacefully. \n \n The relief effort here is far from perfect and involves only some 11,000 people, but it is one of the most functional pieces of the response. The people of Houston have welcomed the evacuees with grace and generosity. Everyone here is getting tetanus shots and other basic healthcare, and they have debit cards (most are only good for a few hundred dollars, not the $2,000 usually cited in the press). And at some point in their stay, the evacuees in the Astrodome each get to spend a week in a hotel, to have some privacy, comfort and solid rest. Many are being successfully placed in more long-term housing and even set up with jobs. Their children will be entering schools that in many cases are far better than the disastrous system they left in New Orleans. \n \n Looking out at the scene, I can't help but be moved by its peaceful contrast to the flood-zone militarism. Nor is the so-called \"culture of poverty\" much in evidence. What is so striking here is not the role of culture but the role of opportunities, services and money. When the poor are treated with some modicum of respect and given a few resources, the social benefits are immediately apparent. When offered the chance, most of them rebuild their lives. \n \n Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge, Bush-connected firms like the Shaw Group, Bechtel and Halliburton are lining up to get big portions of the $62 billion in federal money that will soon flood the storm region. The fact that some of these companies had been convicted of defrauding the federal government in the past, are under investigation again for corruption in Iraq and were once banned from federal contracting due to unethical practices has not stopped the process. Many of the people here at the Astrodome, aware of the money headed to the region, say they too would like the chance to help reconstruct and shape their city. \n \n \n Get it?",

   "Subject: hurricane response\n \n \n Your Grrrs September 13, 2005 \n Monday, September 12, 2005\n \n By Mike Straka\n \n \n Miss Gordy in Wichita, Kan., via Memphis via Katrina from Metairie, La.: Hi Mike, as a \"displaced\" \"survivor\" \"refugee\" from Louisiana, I would like to respond to some of your readers who have tried to make points about the race issue and the government response issue among others.\n \n First, there is no race issue here. I was born and raised in the New Orleans area. Until last week I have never lived outside of Louisiana. Nor have I ever evacuated. We in south Louisiana were given plenty of advance warning and time to evacuate. They told us for three days to leave or be prepared to leave. There were numbers to call to ask for assistance and all the local and state government officials begged people to leave long before the Monday arrival of the hurricane. Many, many people did not leave. We have been evacuated so many times and come home the next day, many of them didn't see the real danger of this particular storm.\n \n Many, many people died. Black people. White people. Hispanic people. Death doesn't care what race you are. The reason there is so much attention going to the race issue is because the media has covered primarily the situation in downtown New Orleans. I lived in Metairie, where there are more white people and there was almost NO coverage on my area or others like it. We have hundreds dead where I live too. St Bernard Parish, where so many lost everything, where they cannot even begin to count the dead yet, had a primarily white population. We all lost. I am a white, single mom with two kids. I lost everything. My dad lost everything. My fianc\u00e9 lost 20 co-workers to the floodwaters.\n \n Everyone out there needs to shut up and stop trying to sound superior and like they know it all when all they know is what they have seen on the news. The local governments did the best they could. Period. The federal government is going to come through for us, but yes, they were unprepared and slow in their response. There is no blame. This was a terrible natural disaster. The scope of the damage and death is like nothing ever seen before in this country. This is a bad B-Movie come to life. Consider it on the same level as the warnings that one day an earthquake is going to split California in half and drop it into the sea. Yes, it is a statistical improbability, but technically it could happen one day. Well, this was the way Gulf Coast residents felt about what just happened to us. It could happen one day. But, hey, aliens could land tomorrow too.\n \n You can't possibly be prepared for the worst because it has never happened before, so there is no way to know what the worst will be. Why do we live in a city below sea level to begin with? We were born there. Our parents were born there. That is our home and our culture, just as yours is for you. I'd rather risk a hurricane every century than live in the snow. Or so I used to say. I am probably not going back as my fianc\u00e9 is from here, and will settle here in the Midwest, but I will miss New Orleans every day for the rest of my life. I know this is too long to print, but had to say my piece.\n \n Also, if you could, please send my thanks and the thanks of my family to all the cities around the country who are doing so much to help us. We spent a week in Memphis, and the people there were amazing. I have family and coworkers in Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, California, Tennessee and Alabama right now, and we have had nothing but welcome and help and warmth from the people and governments everywhere we are. The Days Inn at Gracelend was a true haven for may displaced Louisianians and took great care of us. I went to the Red Cross here in Wichita today and they gave us help for food and clothing and gas. Wonderful people, and we are so very appreciative. I would also like to pass a very special Thank You to the girls at the Build-A-Bear the East Mall here in Wichita for giving my kids each an animal from the collection they were taking for kids like mine. I had been holding it together pretty well until then, but their kindness brought forth the tears I have been trying so hard to hold back for the sake of the kids.\n \n On behalf of everyone affected by this storm, to the rest of our wonderful country, please stop laying blame and making issues where there are none just to have something to talk about. If you want to help, pray for us. Donate something. Smile at someone who is causing you more traffic than you are used to on your way to work tomorrow, because they don't know their way around your city. Thanks Mike for letting me vent.\n \n - Miss Gordy, you're very welcome. -Mike",

It was something like $14 billion. The first installment of the federal relief effort is $62 billion.\n \n \n Speaking of pet projects, this kind of talk is making me sick already.\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/washpost/20050912/pl_washpost/president_makes_his3rd_visit_to_gulf_coast\n \n \n\"There needs to be a Bush vision for the future of New Orleans,\" he said. \"I think a very presidential speech reporting to the country on progress to date and, more significantly, a vision to the future of New Orleans and the region is something that needs to happen sooner rather than later.\"\n\n No! No there doesn't need to be a Bush vision for the future of New Orleans. At all. Whatsoever. Bush needs to keep his visions to himself. They tend to get people killed or cost the treasury billions.\n \n There does not need to be a huge eminent domain land grab and hand outs to wealthy real estate developers.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090802037.html\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091300588.html?nav=rss_nation\n \nA top aide said he will stress that New Orleans officials will dictate how the city will be rebuilt, but will also make plain the reconstruction should reflect his vision of government -- including reducing regulatory obstacles and emphasizing entrepreneurship over big government, the aide said.\n\n What does that mean? He'll let city officials decide how New Orleans is rebuilt as long as it coincides with his \"vision of government\"?\n \n Sorry, Bush, we know you work on visions, but they haven't worked very well the whole time you've been in office.\n \n \n And I know this is like the battle of the pastes, but this Ted Rall column was quite interesting. It serves as a reply to what I can only assume is \"Bush's vision.\"\n \n http://www.uexpress.com/tedrall/\n \n\n Leave Katrina Relief Efforts to Government\n \n NEW YORK--Hurricane Katrina has prompted Americans to donate more than $700 million to charity, reports the Chronicle of Philanthropy. So many suckers, so little foresight.\n \n Government has been shirking its basic responsibilities since the '80s, when Ronald Reagan sold us his belief that the sick, poor and unlucky should no longer count on \"big government\" to help them, but should rather live and die at the whim of contributors to private charities. The Katrina disaster, whose total damage estimate has risen from $100 to $125 billion, marks the culmination of Reagan's privatization of despair.\n \n The American Red Cross leads the post-Katrina sweepstakes, quickly closing in on the $534 million it took in just after 9/11. But Red Cross spokeswoman Sheila Graham told the AP it needs another half billion \"to provide emergency relief over the coming weeks for thousands of evacuees who have scattered among 675 of its shelters in 23 states.\"\n \n Shelley Borysiewicz of Catholic Charities USA, which has raised $7 million thus far, also continues to solicit donations: \"We don't want people to lose sight of the fact that this is going to take years of recovery, and we're going to be there to help the people who fall through the cracks.\"\n \n What \"cracks\"? Why should New Orleans' dispossessed have to live in private shelters? We live in the United States, not Mali. There's only one reason flood victims aren't getting help from the government: because the government refuses to help them. The Red Cross and its cohorts are letting lazy, incompetent and corrupt politicians off the hook, and so are their donors.\n \n It's ridiculous, but people evidently need to be reminded that the United States is not only the world's wealthiest nation but the wealthiest society that has existed anywhere, ever. The U.S. government can easily pick up the tab for people inconvenienced by bad weather--if helping them is a priority. That goes double for Katrina, a disaster caused by the government's conscious decision to eliminate the $50 million pittance needed to improve New Orleans' levees.\n \n For our leaders the optional war against Iraq is such a priority, which the Congressional Budget Office expects to cost $600 billion by 2010. That's four or five Katrinas right there. (That's also where the levee money went.) Because rich people are always a political priority, their taxes have been slashed by $4 trillion over a decade--the equivalent of 32 Katrinas. So worried are our public servants about the tax burden placed on the rich that they're looking out for rich dead people. This is why they've gutted the estate tax that, at a cost of $75 billion annually, will run half a Katrina a year. Trickle-down economists beginning with Milton Friedman shout \"starve the beast,\" but while the social programs are put on a diet, the mean and powerful pig out more than ever.\n \n Disaster relief is too important to be left to private fundraisers, with their self-sustaining fundraising expenses, administrative overhead (nine percent for the Red Cross) and their parochial, often religious, agendas. It's also way too expensive. In the final analysis, after the floodwaters have receded and the poor neighborhoods of New Orleans have been razed under eminent domain, major charities will be lucky if they've managed to raise one percent of the total cost of Katrina. Congress, recognizing the reality that only the federal government possesses the means to deal with the calamity, has already allocated $58 billion--over 70 times the amount raised by charities--to flood relief along the Gulf of Mexico. As Bush says, that's only a \"down payment.\"\n \n Cutting a check to the Red Cross isn't just a vote for irresponsible government. It's a drop in the bucket compared to what you'll end up paying for Katrina in increased taxes.\n \n Granted, in terms of popularity of likelihood of success, trying to make a case against giving money to charities compares to lobbying against puppies. The impulse to donate, after all, is rooted in our best human traits. As we watched New Orleanians die of thirst, disease and anarchic violence in the face of Bush Administration disinterest and local government incompetence, millions of us did the only thing we thought we could to do to help: cut a check or click a PayPal button. Tragically, that generosity feeds into the mindset of the sinister ideologues who argue that government shouldn't help people--the very mindset that caused the levee break that turned Katrina into a holocaust and led to official unresponsiveness. And it is already setting the stage for the next avoidable disaster.\n \n It's time to \"starve the beast\": private charities used by the government to justify the abdication of its duties to its citizens.\n",

Karl Rove!\n \n By Dan Froomkin\n Special to washingtonpost.com\n Thursday, September 15, 2005; 12:00 PM\n \n All you really need to know about the White House's post-Katrina strategy -- and Bush's carefully choreographed address on national television tonight -- is this little tidbit from the ninth paragraph of Elisabeth Bumiller and Richard W. Stevenson 's story in the New York Times this morning:\n \n \"Republicans said Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff and Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, was in charge of the reconstruction effort.\"\n \n Rove's leadership role suggests quite strikingly that any and all White House decisions and pronouncements regarding the recovery from the storm are being made with their political consequences as the primary consideration. More specifically: With an eye toward increasing the likelihood of Republican political victories in the future, pursuing long-cherished conservative goals, and bolstering Bush's image.\n \n That is Rove's hallmark.\n \n Rove, Bush's long-time political adviser and the \"architect\" of Bush's ascendancy, was rewarded after the 2004 election with a position at the White House with overt policy responsibilities. But whereas in some previous White Houses, governance took precedence over campaigning once the election was safely over, Rove has shown no sign of ever putting policy goals above political ones. (See my Rove profile .)\n \n Tonight's speech promises two classic features of the Rove approach.\n \n Bush will take advantage of powerful imagery -- the Associated Press reports the speech will be held in historic Jackson Square, with the famous St. Louis Cathedral as a backdrop -- and he won't risk having anyone around who might disagree with him or ask an impertinent question. In fact, the AP says, there won't be a live audience at all. (And even the journalists covering the event are being told they won't be allowed to stray from their press vans.)\n \n As for the speech itself, it will inevitably seek to answer any naysaying about Bush by recasting him in the heroic, leadership role he played after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- while advocating a range of measures that are dear to the conservative political agenda.\n \n It will, on the other hand, feature one very unRovian tactic. Typically, it is the Democrats who are blamed for wanting to solve problems by throwing money at them. But tonight, Bush will be the one throwing the money around.\n \n Will it work? Rove has an astonishing track record of success. But at the same time, Bush finds himself today a deeply unpopular president according to the opinion polls, particularly damaged by his lackluster response to the protracted, televised suffering in New Orleans.\n \n And Rove himself has not been at his best of late. Unlike many of Bush's advisers, who have plausible deniability for his initial under-reaction because they weren't with him on vacation, Rove was tagging along with the president, blithely touring the West Coast even as the Gulf Coast drowned. Rove is haunted by the possibility of indictment by a federal grand jury investigating the leak of a CIA agent. And according to Time magazine, he was briefly hospitalized last week with painful kidney stones.\n \n Even many of the president's traditional allies say Bush -- and by extension, Rove -- have been off their political game. We'll know better by tomorrow morning whether that continues to be the case.\n\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/politics/15bush.html\n \n\n Bush to Focus on Vision for Reconstruction in Speech Tonight\n \n By ELISABETH BUMILLER\n and RICHARD W. STEVENSON\n Published: September 15, 2005\n \n WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 - President Bush is to pledge in an address to the nation from New Orleans on Thursday night that the federal government will provide housing assistance to victims of Hurricane Katrina and also help reimburse the states for costs they have absorbed in taking in evacuees, a White House official said Wednesday.\n \n The commitments are part of a series of initiatives that the president is expected to announce as he tries to recover from the political fallout over the government's handling of the storm.\n \n The initiatives will encompass education, health care and other social services, with specific housing and job assistance for people who return to New Orleans to live. White House officials said the president would not call for any set-asides or quotas for minorities in reconstruction contracts.\n \n The proposals were still in the planning stages on Wednesday night, and officials said the 9 p.m. address, the president's first major speech on the hurricane, would not be a State of the Union \"laundry list\" of proposals. Instead, they said, it would focus more generally on Mr. Bush's vision for the reconstruction of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, with the federal government playing a supportive role to what White House officials are calling a \"home-grown\" plan that must be created by city and state authorities.\n \n \"We're in the beginning of the rebuilding at this point, and there are a lot of ideas that people are expressing,\" Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday. \"The president wants people to think big.\"\n \n Mr. McClellan indicated that Mr. Bush would not use the speech to name a \"reconstruction czar\" to oversee the effort. A number of White House officials have advised the president to name such a czar, with Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of forces in the 2001 war in Afghanistan, being a favorite of Republicans who are pushing the idea.\n \n White House officials also played down the notion that Mr. Bush would offer a \"Marshall Plan\" for New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, as the Senate Republican leadership called for in a letter to the president on Wednesday. \"We stand ready to work with you to lay out a comprehensive approach to the coordination of relief and development efforts through a 'Marshall Plan' for the Gulf Coast as soon as possible,\" said the letter, signed by Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, and others.\n \n Instead, administration officials and a Republican close to the White House said Mr. Bush would offer some general principles about \"building a better New Orleans\" with stricter construction standards to try to avoid a replay of the recent catastrophe. Republicans said Mr. Bush would not mention a price tag, in large part because of budget and political pressures from House Republicans and other supporters angry about administration spending.\n \n Republicans said Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff and Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, was in charge of the reconstruction effort, which reaches across many agencies of government and includes the direct involvement of Alphonso R. Jackson, secretary of housing and urban development.\n \n As of Wednesday, few if any members of Congress had been informed by the administration of the president's plans. But Congressional leaders nonetheless offered Mr. Bush advice on his speech.\n \n \"I want him to reassure the people that the big part of this fight is ahead of us, and he's going to make sure that the federal government does a better job, does its part,\" Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said in an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday night. \"We're all to blame to a degree.\" Mr. Lott added that Congress should never have passed legislation, as the White House wanted, that made the Federal Emergency Management Agency part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n \"We went along with that, and I guess we'll have to go back and try to rewrite the history, but that should be an independent agency reporting only to the president of the United States,\" Mr. Lott said.\n",

   "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9379239/\n \n \nThat gesture, however, hasn't prevented accusations of cronyism, especially given that the president's former campaign manager Joe Allbaugh is a paid consultant to Shaw and Halliburton. Allbaugh and the companies deny he had anything to do with their contracts. \"Anyone who says otherwise is making it up,\" Allbaugh told NEWSWEEK. (Allbaugh does, though, admit to contacting White House chief of staff Andrew Card to offer Katrina aid and to advising Shaw on how to set up its hurricane response team.) Adding to the controversy: The SEC is investigating Shaw for possible accounting irregularities, NEWSWEEK has learned. \"Shaw has fully cooperated with the SEC,\" said company spokesman Chris Sammons. \"There is no reason to believe that the informal inquiry will go further.\"\n\n \n http://www.alternet.org/story/16901/\n \n\n But, like all other large defense contractors, sometimes it's just cheaper to pay a fine and move on to the next contract. In 1994 Fluor paid a $3.2 million fine for 'submitting heavily padded repair bills for work on Navy bases after hurricane Hugo; in 1997 it was charged with \"violations of the False Claims Act\" when the company sought government reimbursement. The company settled for $8.4 million; same year, it was charged with \"failure to effectively complete corrective actions\" on a DOE project and fined $10,000; in 1998 it was fined $140,625 for safety violations on a DOE project; in 1999 it was fined $30,000 for \"multiple and recurring failure to adequately and fully implement Quality Assurance,\" on another DOE project.

   "http://www.2theadvocate.com/stories/091805/new_blanco001.shtml\n \n \nBlanco says feds pledged buses\n By MICHELLE MILLHOLLON\n mmillhollon@theadvocate.com\n Capitol news bureau\n \n Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Katrina raged ashore, Gov. Kathleen Blanco still wants one question answered.\n \n Where were the buses?\n \n Hours after the hurricane hit Aug. 29, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced a plan to send 500 commercial buses into New Orleans to rescue thousands of people left stranded on highways, overpasses and in shelters, hospitals and homes.\n \n On the day of the storm, or perhaps the day after, FEMA turned down the state's suggestion to use school buses because they are not air conditioned, Blanco said Friday in an interview.\n \n Even after levees broke and residents were crowding the Louisiana Superdome, then-FEMA Director Mike Brown was bent on using his own buses to evacuate New Orleans, Blanco said.\n \n During the delay, misery and mayhem mounted in the Dome, thousands gathered in desperation at the nearby convention center, and Americans watched in shock as dead and dying New Orleans residents were broadcast on national television.\n \n The state had sent 68 school buses into the city on Monday.\n \n Blanco took over more buses from Louisiana school systems and sent them in on Wednesday, two days after the storm. She tapped the National Guard to drive them. Each time the buses emptied an area, more people would appear, she said.\n \n The buses took 15,728 people to safety, a Blanco aide said. But the state's fleet of school buses wasn't enough. On Wednesday, with the FEMA buses still not in sight, Blanco called the White House to talk to Bush and ended up speaking to Chief of Staff Andy Card.\n \n \"I said, 'Even if we had 500 buses, they've underestimated the magnitude of this situation, and I think I need 5,000 buses, not 500,'\" Blanco recounted.\n \n \"'But, Andy, those 500 are not here,'\" the governor said.\n \n Card promised to get Blanco more buses.\n \n Later Wednesday night, Blanco walked into the State Police Communications Center and asked if anyone knew anything about the buses.\n \n An officer told her the buses were just entering the state.\n \n \"I said, 'Do you mean as in North Louisiana, which is another six hours from New Orleans?,'\" Blanco recalled in the interview. \"He said, 'Yes, m'am.'\"\n \n It was at that point, Blanco said, that she realized she had made a critical error.\n \n \"I assumed that FEMA had staged their buses in near proximity,\" she said. \"I expected them to be out of the storm's way but accessible in one day's time.\"\n \n It was late Wednesday. The buses wouldn't get to New Orleans until Thursday. By then, many of the sickest and the weakest were dead or dying.\n \n The buses weren't the only resource to arrive late, Blanco said.\n \n It took days to get a communications system and outside troops. In the first days after the hurricane hit, Louisiana National Guard communicated by sending text messages on cell phones.\n \n The death and destruction multiplied as looters armed themselves and residents languished waiting for rescue.\n \n Brown was the first bureaucratic casualty in the massive governmental breakdown in responding to Katrina.\n \n He resigned last week amid criticism that he responded sluggishly to the hurricane. Brown lashed out a few days later, telling The New York Times that Blanco and her staff were \"incapable of organizing a coherent state effort.\"\n \n Brown said that, on the day before the storm hit, he asked Blanco and Maj. Gen. Bennett Landreneau, head of the state's National Guard, what resources they needed.\n \n \"The response was like, 'Let us find out,' and then I never received specific requests for specific things that needed doing,\" Brown told The New York Times last week.\n \n Blanco said it shouldn't have been up to her to provide a list.\n \n \"Specific things, my God,\" she said. \"(If) they didn't know that we were in the middle of search and rescue and needed to evacuate people, then they were not on the ground with us. We needed buses and helicopters.\"\n \n Besides, Blanco said, she thought Brown was in control of the situation.\n \n \"I had security in the knowledge that there were 500 buses,\" she said. \"Mike had emphasized the buses to me personally. That was not my first concern until I realized that they were not there.\"\n \n Meanwhile, the state continued to send school buses into the affected areas.\n \n One of Blanco's aides, Leonard Kleinpeter, said FEMA told him at one point that the state could stop sending school buses because the agency was going to bring in helicopters and use them instead of the commercial buses that still weren't there.\n \n Blanco told Kleinpeter to ignore those instructions.\n \n \"She said, 'I'll be damned. You keep loading the wagons on the school buses,'\" Kleinpeter said.\n \n Kleinpeter said he now wonders if FEMA temporarily halted its buses because the agency thought helicopters would work better.\n \n By Tuesday, the day after the hurricane, Brown was ready to cede control of state and federal relief efforts to the White House.\n \n Two days later, President George W. Bush met with Blanco on Air Force One and asked her for control of the troops that were finally pouring into the state. Blanco asked if Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour would be under the same regime. The answer was \"No.\"\n \n Blanco told Bush she'd get back to him in 24 hours. The president didn't wait. That night, the White House faxed a memorandum of understanding for her to sign to cede control of the troops. Her answer was \"No.\"\n \n \"If I thought that it was going to bring one more resource to bear, if I thought that he was denying me resource because of it, and I don't think he was, then it might have been something that I would have considered,\" she said.\n \n \"By that time, we were already getting the resources and commitments,\" the governor said.\n \n It wasn't the response that the White House wanted. People close to the Bush administration started criticizing Blanco, saying she bungled the state response.\n \n When Bush returned to the state a few days later, he didn't tell Blanco he was coming. The night before that second visit, Blanco learned about the visit from a news reporter and wrangled an invitation to accompany Bush on his tour.\n \n There was a noticeable tension between the president and the governor throughout the trip.\n \n \"What was going on is the national media people started picking on the president. So the White House began to defend the president. So they turned some guns on me,\" Blanco said.\n \n \"It was a colossal waste of our time and energy to get into the blame game,\" she said.\n \n Blanco said things are now fine between her and Bush.\n \n Bush has since acknowledged that his administration failed to respond adequately to the hurricane. The president has ordered a review of the sluggish response.\n \n \"Four years after the frightening experience of Sept. 11, Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency,\" he told the nation in an address from Jackson Square Thursday night.\n \n \"When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I as president am responsible for the problem, and for the solution,\" Bush said.\n \n Blanco is less emphatic in taking blame for the breakdown.\n \n She said she takes responsibility \"for assuming that help was on the way\" when it wasn't.\n \n Blanco said she's also learned a lesson.\n \n \"In the end, in a really dangerous, life-threatening situation, there is no army that's going to be there to save you,\" she said. \"It's going to be person-to-person, helping each other. Some people are putting their lives on the line to help other people whose lives are at risk. And that's the bottom line.\" \n\n \n And this is from Newsmax:\n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/9/12/103905.shtml\n \n\"We offered the city the opportunity to take evacuees out of harm's way,\" Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black told the Washington Post on Sunday. \"The city declined.\"\n \n New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said Sunday he had no idea what Black was talking about.\n \n I don't know where that's coming from,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Amtrak never contacted me to make that offer. As a matter of fact, we checked the Amtrak lines for availability, and every available train was booked, as far as the report that I got, through September. So I'd like to see that report.\"\n\n \n \n Of course, the Chimp worshippers will say that these are nothing but excuses, but everything Bush, Chertoff, and Brown said were reasonable explanations. AND all the Republican mouthpieces weren't making excuses, they were explaining how the Feds could have done their jobs right if it hadn't been for those pesky State and Local officials.",

   "For last 20 years smart people warned about looming effects of global warming - air and most importantly water is getting hotter (Mexican Gulf is 4-5 degrees warmer, Caribbean sea - 3*, World's oceans - up 1.5-1.9 degrees), the result is stronger and bigger hurricanes, like last 2 (Katrina & Rita, could these names be less appropriate).\n So who is to blame? All of us who use to much electricity, do not properly recycle, but most importantly drive gasoline wasting vehicles. I tried & failed to convince my parents to buy hybrid car, but now they are freaking out about the price of oil (gasoline, heating oil & gas). Personally I haven't driven a car in more then 3 years, I get around on my bicycle or a bus, every 2 weeks I go with them on a shopping run. Still I think the best example is Willie Nelson he tours on a bus that runs on biodiesel (diesel fuel + cooking oil leftovers say from McDonalds), also both of his cars run mixture of low-grade gasoline & vegetable oil, with the prices as they are now he actually better off.\n But without a government program to move us as a country to better forms of transportation or at least alternative fuel, and to more ecologically sound electricity generation (solar, wind, bio & thermonuclear), we will never move fast enough to prevent ecological disaster (could be as soon as 10-15 years from now). So Bush & his father & Reagan, along with Republicans (who control all of the branches of the government), as well as a few corporate Democrats are responsible for US not even trying to change thing for the better (not being a part of Kyoto treaty is just one of the crimes of current administration).\n It is economically sound investment to spend more on cleaner ways of functioning, because the alternative is starting to get clear to even the most conservatives.\n The fact that current Federal government is completely ignorant & inept should be clear by now, but putting inexperienced cronies into the most important posts like head of FEMA (and other positions having to do with our safety) is criminal. The local & state government is partially to blame for not doing enough to save people and protect New Orleans, but it has mostly to do with burocrathy & waste of resources. But their failings were exacerbated by the funds that were cut by the congress for construction & improvement of levies. And now Hurricane Rita has made things even worse for the Gulf coast, and showed that we are still not properly prepared.\n So do I think that Bush should resign? Of cause, but it's not going to happen. Should he be impeached, by all means and immediately, but for that we need Democrats in charge of the House, for which we will have to wait another year. Meantime Wolfowitz our face in UN is already planning another war - now with Iran, how long can this country take this abuse from blind, deaf & stupid corporate governing \"elite\", let's hope we can take another year.",
