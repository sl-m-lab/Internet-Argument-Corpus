   "One thing be sure, MLK was no saint and his fondness for women and other vices were well known. The cause he stood for has been forgotten over worship of the personna. If that woman Brady claims to have commented the way he quotes her, MLK would have been all over that.

   "One thing be sure, MLK was no saint and his fondness for women and other vices were well known. The cause he stood for has been forgotten over worship of the personna. If that woman Brady claims to have commented the way he quotes her, MLK would have been all over that. He didn't single out just the rights some folk would like to imagine he did, he wanted them all and for everyone; it was just that Blacks were way behind the ball. He certainly wouldn't have approved of the way most folks act now including Blacks and his speeches were very clear about that. His message remains today from the past and people trying to appeal to their own carnal desires are making a mockery of what he stood for. That behavior is despicable.\n \n Brady only brings his death up in hopes of stirring emotions to support his cause which is in death throes. What are you gonna do now brady that your gig is about over? emoticon_cry emoticon_xgood\n \n Perhaps we should name a Browning design the MLK Special in honor of all our civil rights and Constitutional rights ? emoticon_xgood emoticon_xhoho\n\n Are you trying to lower MLK to the gun nut level?\n Read these quotes by him and weep!\n \n \"How could I serve as one of the leaders of a nonviolent movement and at the same time use weapons of violence for my personal protection? Coretta and I talked the matter over for several days and finally agreed that arms were no solution. We decided then to get rid of the one weapon we owned. We tried to satisfy our friends by having floodlights mounted around the house, and hiring unarmed watchmen around the clock. I also promised that I would not travel around the city alone. I was much more afraid in Montgomery when I had a gun in my house. When I decided that I couldn't keep a gun, I came face-to-face with the question of death and I dealt with it. From that point on, I no longer needed a gun nor have I been afraid. Had we become distracted by the question of my safety we would have lost the moral offensive and sunk to the level of our oppressors.\"\n \n \"While the question 'Who killed President Kennedy?' is important, the question 'What killed him?' is more important. Our late President was assassinated by a morally inclement climate. It is a climate filled with heavy torrents of false accusation, jostling winds of hatred and raging storms of violence. It is climate where men cannot disagree without being disagreeable, and where they express dissent through violence and murder. It is the same climate that murdered Medgar Evers in Mississippi and six innocent children in Birmingham, Alabama. So in a sense we are all participants in that horrible act that tarnished the image of our nation. By our silence, by our willingness to compromise principle; by our constant attempt to cure the cancer of racial injustice with the Vaseline of gradualism; our readiness to allow arms to be purchased at will and fired at whim; by allowing our movie and television screens to teach our children that the hero is one who masters the art of shooting and the technique of killing; by allowing all of these developments we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes.\"",

Instead of letting the Anti-gun orgs make up your mind for you.   See this image , and read the linked story for the Whole story on Mr. Heston, and make up your own mind. \n \n The whole story, good and bad that brady wishes you would not see. From the UK's Independent paper Film critics Andy McSmith and Ciar Byrne. \n   Charlton Heston: as you won't remember him \n .... A shame, because there was once a younger Charlton Heston who threw his fame and good looks behind the civil rights movement, and other causes that required courage and conviction. There was even a time when he believed in gun control. \n \n &#8230;. Part of his motivation was his opposition at the anti-Communist witch-hunt launched by the Republican senator Joe McCarthy. Four years later, Heston at least had the satisfaction of being on the winning side when he backed John F Kennedy for the presidency. In 1963, he joined a civil rights march on Washington, and stood with Martin Luther King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in the US capital. He called King a \"20th century Moses\". \n \n &#8230; Instead, he reacted to this public humiliation of President Reagan as if his own face had been slapped, and joined the Republican Party. Heston felt he was still battling for civil liberties, except that now he was standing up for the liberty of the average white middle-class American male against the spread of \"political correctness\". \n \n A famous speech that he delivered to the Harvard Law School in February 1999, a cry of rage against gun control, gay rights, violent lyrics in rap music and other Heston bugbears, opened with the observation: \"If my creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, then I want to use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty, your own freedom of thought, your own compass for what is right.\"\n \n First elected chairman of the National Rifle Association in 1997, Heston was re-elected for an unprecedented fourth term in 2001. He electrified that year's annual NRA conference by holding a 230-year-old musket over his head and exclaiming: \"I have only five words for you: From my cold, dead hands.\" And while the actor carried off some of the grandest roles in cinematic history, it is that side of the man that many people will remember.\n",

The Right of Self Defense for instance can be seen in all animals. The Fight or Flight instinct. It is something hard wired into our Nature by God, or Well by whomever you might believe in. \n   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n\n   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution\n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records.

I also linked to a newspaper op-ed in which Salter explained how he and other civil rights workers used firearms for protection from Klansmen and other terrorists-when Klansmen knew that a homicide would not be witnessed by the news media. Since that blog post seemed to draw great interest from the readers, I thought that some persons might be interested in the longer version of Salter's history of the role of armed self-defense in the Civil Rights Movement.The longer version is John R. Salter, Jr., \"Social Justice Community Organizing and the Necessity for Protective Firearms,\" which is chapter 2 of The Gun Culture and Its Enemies 19-23 (William R. Tonso, editor, Merril Press, 1990.) (Merril Press is the press for the Second Amendment Foundation.) The chapter was first published as an article by Salter in Against the Current, July/August 1988. The magazine describes itself as an \"analytical journal for the broad revolutionary left.\"http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/publicationsUnfortunately, neither version is available on-line, so I will provide a summary.In the mid-1960s, Salter was a full-time community organizer for the Southern Conference Educational Fund, in the very poor and highly segregated North Carolina black belt. Klan activity was heavy, and \"Local law enforcement was almost completely dominated by the United Klans of America.\" Klan dues were collected at the police station in Enfield.Having received many death threats, Salter carried a Smith & Wesson .38 special in his attach\u00e9 case. One night, on a long stretch of isolated country road, a Klan vehicle tried to force Salter's car into a high-speed chase, by tailing him nearly bumper-to-bumper. \"But I continued to drive sedately, mile after mile...with my revolver in my hand.\" Salter and the other community organizers had put out word on the grapevine that they were all armed, and he surmises that this was the reason that the Klansmen did not try to shoot him that night.Soon after, \"a local civil rights stalwart, Mrs. Alice Evans, of Enfield, opened fire with her double-barreled 12 gauge, sprinkling several KKKers with birdshot as they endeavored to burn a cross in her driveway one night and, simultaneously , approaching her homes with buckets of gasoline.\" The Klansmen fled and went to the hospital. Mrs. Evans donated the cross to the Smithsonian Museum.Salter then recounts the story of the armed students and teachers who protected Tougaloo College, near Jackson, Mississippi, when Salter taught there in 1961-63. That story is recounted in the op-ed to which I linked in the previous post.In late 1964, the Klan was scheduling a state-wide rally in Halifax County, near a black residential area. Rally posters were displayed at \"most law enforcement offices in the county.\" Salter and his fellow organizers asked the office of Governor Terry Sanford to provide state police protection for the black residents. Sanford's office ignored the requests, until Salter went to Sanford's office, got a meeting with the chief of staff, and told him that if the state police did not provide protection, \"our people, armed to the hilt, would have no hesitation about utilizing armed self-defense in the event of Klan violence. Visibly shaken, the aide left me and conferred with Sanford. He returned quickly to promise the state police.\"Klan rallies continued for several more months in the area, and so did state police protection.In 1965 in North Carolina, the FBI and Justice Department told Salter than an informant inside a United Klans klavern had reported on a plan to bomb Salter's home in Raleigh.The FBI agent told Salter and his wife that the federal government could not do anything about it. Of course, \"Local law enforcement was not reliable. Fortunately, we lived in the middle of a heavily armed Black community,\" and Salter's neighbors were \"very protective.\" They and Salter put out the word that the community was armed for defense. Thus, \"We were not surprised when the bombing effort never materialized.\"In the summer of 1970, Salter was Southside Director for the Chicago Commons Association. As such, he was a community organizer for mostly \"Black, Puerto Rican, and Chicano\" people. On the South/Southwest side of Chicago, the racism was \"often more violent and sanguinary than the Deep South of the previous decade. The Richard Daley machine was openly antagonistic to us . . .\" In some but not all districts, the police were in league with the racists.Death threats were frequent. When they were phoned in, Salter told the callers, \"that I had a ticket for them, a pass to permanent eternity via my Marlin .444.\" One day while Salter was at work and his wife was at home, some men with knives came to the home, but a vigilant neighbor with a revolver frightened them away.In Chicago in 1973, Salter's community network of nearly 300 block clubs \"set up public citizen 'watch-dog' patrols.\" These were generally unarmed, with \"primary backup from a network of armed citizenry in the neighborhoods,\" with whom the patrols stayed in contact via Citizens Band radio and telephone. \"The effects of this well known campaign in deterring while racial violence were consistently substantial.\" Soon, and as a result, politicians \"forced in effect increasingly responsible and egalitarian law enforcement practices. But the patrols and vigilance of armed neighborhoods continued.\"In conclusion, Salter writers that firearms are not an absolute guarantee of safety for community organizers; Medger W. Evers (NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi) was murdered in June 1963, but being armed had helped him to live for nine years longer than most people expected he would when he took the job in 1954.In sum, \"I am stating categorically that the number of fatalities\" was \"much smaller\" because \"organizers and their grassroots groups\" were \"sensibly armed for self-defense.\"A few weeks ago, I linked to a picture of civil rights activist John Salter being attacked by a mob during a lunch counter sit-in during the 1960s.

When they were phoned in, Salter told the callers, \"that I had a ticket for them, a pass to permanent eternity via my Marlin .444.\" One day while Salter was at work and his wife was at home, some men with knives came to the home, but a vigilant neighbor with a revolver frightened them away.In Chicago in 1973, Salter's community network of nearly 300 block clubs \"set up public citizen 'watch-dog' patrols.\" These were generally unarmed, with \"primary backup from a network of armed citizenry in the neighborhoods,\" with whom the patrols stayed in contact via Citizens Band radio and telephone. \"The effects of this well known campaign in deterring while racial violence were consistently substantial.\" Soon, and as a result, politicians \"forced in effect increasingly responsible and egalitarian law enforcement practices. But the patrols and vigilance of armed neighborhoods continued.\"In conclusion, Salter writers that firearms are not an absolute guarantee of safety for community organizers; Medger W. Evers (NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi) was murdered in June 1963, but being armed had helped him to live for nine years longer than most people expected he would when he took the job in 1954.In sum, \"I am stating categorically that the number of fatalities\" was \"much smaller\" because \"organizers and their grassroots groups\" were \"sensibly armed for self-defense.\"A few weeks ago, I linked to a picture of civil rights activist John Salter being attacked by a mob during a lunch counter sit-in during the 1960s. I also linked to a newspaper op-ed in which Salter explained how he and other civil rights workers used firearms for protection from Klansmen and other terrorists-when Klansmen knew that a homicide would not be witnessed by the news media. Since that blog post drew great interest from the readers, I thought that some persons might be interested in the longer version of Salter's history of the role of armed self-defense in the Civil Rights Movement.\n \n The longer version is John R. Salter, Jr., \"Social Justice Community Organizing and the Necessity for Protective Firearms,\" which is chapter 2 of The Gun Culture and Its Enemies , pp. 19-23 (William R. Tonso, editor, Merril Press, 1990.) (Merril Press is the press for the Second Amendment Foundation.) The chapter was first published as an article by Salter in Against the Current, July/August 1988. The magazine describes itself Solidarity Pamphlets and Working Papers | Solidarity as an \"analytical journal for the broad revolutionary left.\" Since neither version is available on-line, I will provide a summary.\n \n In the mid-1960s, Salter was a full-time community organizer for the Southern Conference Educational Fund, in the very poor and highly segregated North Carolina black belt. Klan activity was heavy, and \"Local law enforcement was almost completely dominated by the United Klans of America.\" Klan dues were collected at the police station in Enfield.\n \n Having received many death threats, Salter carried a Smith & Wesson .38 special in his attach\u00e9 case. One night, on a long stretch of isolated country road, a Klan vehicle tried to force Salter's car into a high-speed chase, by tailing him nearly bumper-to-bumper. \"But I continued to drive sedately, mile after mile...with my revolver in my hand.\" Salter and the other community organizers had put out word on the grapevine that they were all armed, and he surmises that this was the reason that the Klansmen did not try to shoot him that night.\n \n Soon after, \"a local civil rights stalwart, Mrs. Alice Evans, of Enfield, opened fire with her double-barreled 12 gauge, sprinkling several KKKers with birdshot as they endeavored to burn a cross in her driveway one night and, simultaneously, approaching her home with buckets of gasoline.\" The Klansmen fled and went to the hospital. Mrs. Evans donated the cross to the Smithsonian Museum.\n \n Salter then recounts the story of the armed students and teachers who protected Tougaloo College, near Jackson, Mississippi, when Salter taught there in 1961-63. That story is recounted in the op-ed to which I linked in the previous post.\n \n In late 1964, the Klan was scheduling a state-wide rally in Halifax County, N.C., near a black residential area. Rally posters were displayed at \"most law enforcement offices in the county.\" Salter and his fellow organizers asked the office of Governor Terry Sanford to provide state police protection for the black residents. Sanford's office ignored the requests, until Salter went to Sanford's office, got a meeting with the chief of staff, and told him that if the state police did not provide protection, \"our people, armed to the hilt, would have no hesitation about utilizing armed self-defense in the event of Klan violence. Visibly shaken, the aide left me and conferred with Sanford. He returned quickly to promise the state police.\"\n \n Klan rallies continued for several more months in the area, and so did state police protection.\n \n In 1965 in North Carolina, the FBI and Justice Department told Salter than an informant inside a United Klans klavern had reported on a plan to bomb Salter's home in Raleigh.The FBI agent told Salter and his wife that the federal government could not do anything about it. Of course, \"Local law enforcement was not reliable. Fortunately, we lived in the middle of a heavily armed Black community,\" and Salter's neighbors were \"very protective.\" They and Salter put out the word that the community was armed for defense. Thus, \"We were not surprised when the bombing effort never materialized.\"\n \n In the summer of 1970, Salter was Southside Director for the Chicago Commons Association. As such, he was a community organizer for mostly \"Black, Puerto Rican, and Chicano\" people. On the South/Southwest side of Chicago, the racism was \"often more violent and sanguinary than the Deep South of the previous decade. The Richard Daley machine was openly antagonistic to us . . .\" In some but not all districts, the police were in league with the racists.\n \n Death threats were frequent. When they were phoned in, Salter told the callers, \"that I had a ticket for them, a pass to permanent eternity via my Marlin .444.\" One day while Salter was at work and his wife was at home, some men with knives came to the home, but a vigilant neighbor with a revolver frightened them away.\n \n In Chicago in 1973, Salter's community network of nearly 300 block clubs \"set up public citizen 'watch-dog' patrols.\" These were generally unarmed, with \"primary backup from a network of armed citizenry in the neighborhoods,\" with whom the patrols stayed in contact via Citizens Band radio and telephone. \"The effects of this well known campaign in deterring while racial violence were consistently substantial.\" Soon, and as a result, politicians instituted \"increasingly responsible and egalitarian law enforcement practices. But the patrols and vigilance of armed neighborhoods continued.\"\n \n Salter write that firearms are not an absolute guarantee of safety for community organizers; Medger W. Evers (NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi) was murdered in June 1963, but being armed did help him to live for nine years longer than most people expected he would when he took the job in 1954.\n \n In sum, \"I am stating categorically that the number of fatalities\" was \"much smaller\" because \"organizers and their grassroots groups\" were \"sensibly armed for self-defense.\"\n\n \n No doubt you nor Ms. Williams are really interested in blacks but chasing fiction in your head to collect money by re-creating history.\n \n EDITED FOR EMPHASIS",
