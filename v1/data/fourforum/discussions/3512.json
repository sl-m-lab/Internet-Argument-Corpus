   "Replacing all taxes with retail tax seems like a bad idea because:\n \n 1: It severly limits the governments ability to adjust the economy to counter implications of financial cycles. As the monetary option has been done away with (for good reasons) the government only has financial politics to play with.\n \n 2: A retail tax does not contain any automatic stabilizing qualities. Automatic stabilizing qualities can be found in income and labour baswed taxes as it cools of an overheated labour market.\n \n 3: The retail tax is basicly regressive, making the rich pay less than the poor. Even though there are rebates, these seems far to small to change the fact that the retail tax is inherrantly regressive.\n \n 4: While it would eliminate some tax evasion, it would encourage others. The argument that it would ellimnate all tax evasion is ludicrus. Evasion from retail tax also creates black markets. Something that often carries external costs.\n \n 5: It would tax governmental transfers and incomes deriving from labour or capital alike, forcing the government to increase transfers to maintain the current distribution levels.\n \n 6: I don`t understand how the tax pressure could be lowered because of the implementation of the so called \"fair-tax\" as the advocates never explain any dynamic advantages of the system and I don`t know wether the nubers listed are correct. To me it seems like a hoax, or even prank (the wording on the pages also supports this...).\n \n I can probably think of more reasons why the retail tax is a bad idea, but I have to go and buy groceries now ;)",

   "The only way jobs would come back to the US would be if it is more economical.

People who spend alot will be taxed alot, people who save will be taxed heavily. This is where a possible problem could arise. Given that the US economy is currently driven by consumer spending a decrease in consumer spending spurred by the tax savings could cause a serious slowdown in the US economy.",

   "Politics and facts are two different things. A professional economist could help you understand why prices would go down.\n \n\n \n Politics and facts are two different things. However, economics and facts are two different things as well. Economics is quite troublesome as a science as it is based on much simplifications. Just like political science, economics doesn`t work like natural science as it is based on generalisations and simplifications of human action. Economics also contains a couple of schools of thoughts. Depending on which school of thought an economist hails from, his/her conclusions and explenations about national sales tax would vary. Would I appreciate an economist who would explain all the marvels of national sales tax? Sure, but I would not take his word as legion. I would very much like to hear a second oppinion about the matter. And at the end of the day, I would make my own conclussion as to which method would apply best to my own personal preferences. Not very different from politics actually.\n \n \nYou should form your own opinion about politics, but economic history will tell you much about what to expect in the future when certain things happen. That history is best obtained from people who know it...the professional economists.\n\n \n I don`t agree. History (wether it is economic- or \"ordinary\" history) should be used to predict the future, but just like ordinary history, economic history cannot predict the future flawless. To be able to actually apply the lessons learned from history, we need to have an economic theory that can explain what happened in the past. And sadly, economists are not very good at using theory. Instead, they rely very much on empirical observations and make generalisations out of them. Problem with this is that empirism cannot explain those institutions and forces that cannot be observed through direct observation. It also makes the explanations rather static and hard to apply to the future. Now, don`t get me wrong. Economics is very interesting and basic economic theory is in my oppinion essential for everyone. An economist that can explain a situation would indeed be valueable in this case. Just like a politician or military expert that could explain a situation. But the problem is that many economists disagree on even the most basic premises for economic theory. Therefor I am not ready to give up my own decission and oppinions on these matters (ecp. since much economic theory lacks normative assumptions, which is needed to actually make a decission between two options).",

   "@ Jim\n \n Hmm, let me rephrase that. It got kind of confusing. Basicly this was what I was trying to say:\n \n Economists can predict and explain with various accuracy the consequences of certain actions and events. This prediction and explanation can often vary, depending on which school of thought the economist hails from. It also varies between different individual economists. However, certain basic assumptions, explenations and predictions are more or less based on consensus. After I have heard the explanation or prediction, it is up to me as an individual to judge how I should view the (predicted or explained) consequences. Economic theory lack normative explaining power. Am I to value equality more than economic efficiency? Am I to value economic freedom more than higher returns on capital investments? Am I too value higher wages more than lower inflation? etc, etc. On top of this, economic theory seldom succeeds in quantifying its explanations and prediction.\n \n This is not too different from political and sociological theories and ideologies and politics in general.",
