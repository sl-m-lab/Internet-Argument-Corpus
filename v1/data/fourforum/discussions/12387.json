   "Alas, in Texas:\n \nReport critical of sex education in Texas schools\n By Matt Frazier | The Fort Worth Star-Telegram\n The overwhelming majority of Texas schools use scare tactics and spread myths in place of teaching basic sex and health information that students can use to protect themselves and others, according to a report released Wednesday by watchdog group Texas Freedom Network.\n \n TFN's two-year study of education materials from 990 Texas school districts showed that about 94 percent of public schools use abstinence-only programs that usually pass moral judgments while either downplaying or ignoring contraception and health screenings.\n \n Two percent ignore sex education, according to the report, written by David Wiley, professor of health education at Texas State University, and Kelly Wilson, assistant professor of health education at Texas State.\n\n Blame school administrator fear of controversy and loud, obnoxiously unrepentant extremist religious groups.\n \n As a result of this shameful nonsense and hoaxism, Texas teens have have one of the nation's highest teen pregnancy rates in the nation.\n \n Texas educators should be ashamed of themselves. Perhaps they should be called idiocators.\n \n And those religious extremist witches should be burned at the stake.",

The government here is reacting in a couple of ways - by putting sex ed into the national curriculum at an earlier age (on the basis of 'better too soon than too late') and by creating teacher training specifically for 'PSHE teachers' (PSHE = personal social health education - this covers sex ed, contraceptives, relationships and STDs, amongst a host of others non-sex issues). Before this, the task of teaching fell (and still falls, the scheme is in early days) to form tutors, who were largely untrained and awkward in their roles.\n \n It's like seperate institutions for sex ed, but integrated into shcools.",

   "There are a variety of countries which don't have a \"21\" drinking age, but rather have no minimum alcohol drinking age.\n They enforce their \"drunk driving\" laws and the like, but they don't put alcohol consumption up on a taboo pedastal.\n And for the most part, their problem with teenage alcoholism IS LESS because of it...\n \n I think Texas's real problem is putting the \"sex\" issue up on a taboo pedastal. If you educate people and treat it like an adult issue instead of a \"don't touch that!\" issue, kids can behave responsibly.\n Unfortunately, our society seems to equate \"adult issue\" with \"don't touch that\".\n \n If a kid grows up realizing what sex is, it is de-mystified.\n If you let kids try to teach each other what sex is, it not only add to the mystery but you get all sorts of false information involved.\n \n Most people learn about sex by talking to their friends, and the \"education\" you get there is unbelievable junk. Can't get pregnant on the first time. Jumping up and down after the boy finishes will prevent pregnancy.\n How many people (growing up) actually asked an adult about sex? How many people (in that scenario) got an intelligent / intelligible answer?\n How many people learned a \"lot\" about sex BEFORE they ever considered asking an adult about sex?\n \n It's an issue where telling the kids \"don't do that\" is only pushing them to want to try it.\n Unfortunately, with many things, religion and morality start pushing into the situation and causing the reverse of what they intended.\n \n If you PERSUADE children to a point of view, of their own volition, they can reach that point of view and if they do, they can stick to it cause they have their reasons for doing so.\n If you TELL children they have to have a certain point of view, the results are going to be less substantial. You get situations like \"abstinence clubs\" where the kids who are proclaiming \"abstinence\" have less vaginal sex, but more non-vaginal sex and the same rate of STDs.\n \n If a kid sees the consequences of STDs, or realizes what will be given up if they have to care for a child at 15, it will go a LOT FARTHER than just \"don't touch that!\".",

   "In the ninth grade, I had a very good health teacher. She taught us that abstinence was the best choice, however condoms and contraception are acceptable. We spent most of the sex ed unit learning actual facts and consequences about sex, and what our options are. Whenever a kid wasn't paying attention, the teacher would shout \"Hey! I'm saving your life here! Pay attention.\" The teacher taught us that there was a possibility of dying resulting from sexual intercourse, however also taught us that condoms are 99.9% effective at preventing pregnancy and STDs.\n \n Allowing the church to have any say in the matter is ludicrous. The relationship between a religious individual and a student in terms of sex ed is that of a Sunni suicide bomber and a crowded Shiite mosque. The Christian (or muslim) will do anything to secure his or her spot in the afterlife, and will step on anyone to do so. If it means being partly responsible in the pregnancy or infection of an adolescent, then so be it. Religious individuals are selfish in this matter, and care more about doing \"God's work\" than protecting it.\n \n Throughout history, there are only two things churches are good at: misinformation and torture. Taking into consideration the advice of a religious person on this matter is akin to consulting your dog on the subject of nuclear physics.",
