If you click at the bottom of the picture on the page you linked, it will start depicting various stages going up the tree, with branches at each stage.\n \n There is also one that is a bit simpler at the Talk Origins Archive. It is part of the \"29+ Evidences for Macroevolution\" pages. This paper is just one line of evidence for common descent based on phylogeny.",
