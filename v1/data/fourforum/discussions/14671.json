   "id like to see some stats, im curious as the the actual comparison instead of this dancing around the bush nonsense. do gay kids get it worse than other minority groups?\n \n i was telling LA just now that kids who learn about gay people or black people or overweight people will take that all in and change will come, resulting in less bullying, but telling them 'dont be a bully' wont teach them anything and i bet you anything those kids will not stop bullying despite their parents telling them to.\n \n the difference is that people (and this forum is a good example) know that its bad to bully kids because theyre black or because theyre muslim or whatever, schools and parents are teaching these things to the kids, but homosexuality seems to be off limits to education. thus, and maybe after seeing stats would confirm this, its possible that gay kids do get bullied worse than others, and that can be shown through suicide rates.\n \n but who cares right? the point im trying to make is instead of telling kids what not to do, in which case they wont care one bit, teach them about how and why it would be good to make friends with people who are different than them, in which case they will listen and bullying will stop as a result.",

   "GLBT bullying is more problematic than heterosexual and other types of bullying. It should be addressed specifically even if it does rub fundies the wrong way.\n \n Mental Health America: Bullying and Gay Youth\n \n Bullying in Schools: Harassment Puts Gay Youth at Risk \n While trying to deal with all the challenges of being a teenager, gay/ lesbian/ bisexual/ transgender (GBLT) teens additionally have to deal with harassment, threats, and violence directed at them on a daily basis. They hear anti-gay slurs such as \"homo\", \"faggot\" and \"sissy\" about 26 times a day or once every 14 minutes.[1] Even more troubling, a study found that thirty-one percent of gay youth had been threatened or injured at school in the last year alone![2]\n \n Their mental health and education, not to mention their physical well-being, are at-risk.\n \n How is their mental health being affected?\n &#9632;Gay and lesbian teens are at high risk because 'their distress is a direct result of the hatred and prejudice that surround them,' not because of their inherently gay or lesbian identity orientation.[3]\n &#9632;Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth are two to three times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual counterparts.[4]\n How is their education being affected?\n &#9632;Gay teens in U.S. schools are often subjected to such intense bullying that they're unable to receive an adequate education.[5] They're often embarrassed or ashamed of being targeted and may not report the abuse.\n &#9632;GLBT students are more apt to skip school due to the fear, threats, and property vandalism directed at them.[6] One survey revealed that 22 percent of gay respondents had skipped school in the past month because they felt unsafe there.[7]\n &#9632;Twenty-eight percent of gay students will drop out of school. This is more than \n three times the national average for heterosexual students.[8]\n &#9632;GLBT youth feel they have nowhere to turn. According to several surveys, four out of five gay and lesbian students say they don't know one supportive adult at school.[9]\n What can we do to help?\n Schools should offer a safe and respectful learning environment for everyone. When bullying is allowed to take place, it affects everyone. For every GLBT youth who reported being targeted for anti-gay harassment, four heterosexual youth reported harassment or violence for being perceived as gay or lesbian.[10] Also, we know that bullying was a contributing factor in the Columbine shootings and other school violence. Students, teachers, and school administrators who look the other way are contributing to the problem. In contrast, kids who said that they had a supportive faculty or openly gay staff member were more likely to feel as if they belong in their school.[11]",

   "Tony Perkins: Gay Teens Resort To 'Depression Or Suicide' Because They Know They're 'Abnormal'\nTony Perkins: Gay Teens Resort To 'Depression Or Suicide' Because They Know They're 'Abnormal' \n \n Family Research Council President Tony Perkins recently gave an unsympathetic diagnosis for the recent surge in teen suicides caused anti-gay bullying: they resort to extreme measures because they're battling with the internal understanding that homosexuality is, in fact, \"abnormal.\"\n \n Speaking with NPR for a piece about how religious movements fit into the anti-gay bullying equation, Perkins's analysis of the situation appeared the least forgiving.\n \n Perkins told NPR that gay rights groups were exploiting the concern over anti-LGBT bigotry to build momentum for their movement, an argument that he has made before.\n \n \"There's no correlation between inacceptance of homosexuality and depression and suicide,\" Perkins told NPR.\n \n Here's how Perkins explained the issue:\n \n \"These young people who identify as gay or lesbian, we know from the social science that they have a higher propensity to depression or suicide because of that internal conflict,\" he says.\n \n Homosexuality is \"abnormal,\" he says, and kids know it, which leads them to despair. That's why he wants to confront gay activism in public schools. For example, his group supports the Day of Truth, when Christian high-schoolers make their case that homosexuality is a sin.\n \n Tony Perkins was given a platform to make a similarly uncompassionate polemic in the Washington Post earlier this month, on National Coming Out Day, no less. The paper later explained, over Twitter, that the editorial was their attempt to \"cover both sides\" of the debate.\n",

In one post, McCance protested the idea behind the initiative.\n \n \"They want me to wear purple because five qu**rs committed suicide,\" he wrote. \"The only way I'm wearing for them is if they all commit suicide. I can't believe the people of this world have gotten this stupid.\n \n In another post, he wrote, \"it p1sses me off, though, that we make special purple f@g day for them. I like that fags can't procreate. I also enjoy that they often give each other AIDS and die...I would disown my kids they were gay. They will not be welcome at my home or in my vicinity. I will absolutely run them off.\"\n \n During McCance's appearance on his show, Cooper confronted him about the extreme anti-gay sentiments he expressed.\n \n \"You have written some really terrible things,\" he told McCance. \"Do you really hate gay people that much, that you like to see them die?\"\n \n McCance, who said he was ashamed and embarrassed by his actions, told Cooper that \"I would never support suicide of any kids. I don't support bullying of any kids.\"\n \n \"What do you feel like you're apologizing for, exactly?\" Cooper asked him.\n \n \"It was over the top, Anderson,\" McCance replied. \"It was -- I -- I just went too far with it.\"\n \n That explanation, however, did not seem to be enough for Cooper, who pressed McCance further.\n \n \"But, I mean, do you have any idea of the... pain and fear you have caused to kids maybe even in your own district who are being bullied or who are gay or who don't feel safe telling anyone that they're gay?\" he asked him.\n \n McCance said that the situation Cooper was describing was a \"what-if.\"\n \n Then, Cooper got McCance to announce his resignation from the school board. McCance said that he did not want to be a distraction to the board, adding that, \"if they decide later, you know, a year, five years, 10 years from now to vote me back in, if my constituents want that, then -- then I will run again.\"\n \n By the end of the interview, Cooper also got McCance to call his Facebook comments \"hateful\" and to apologize for hurting people \"on a broad, broad spectrum.\"\n\n \n Video at the link.",

LOL!\n \n Romans 1:26-27\n\n \n hehe, I see that you were unable to live up to the challenge of saying something besides sound bytes.\n \n How about this: Show me where I've condoned anything like this. Also, how are you defining \"illicit\" in your post, since it is obviously not illegal? And finally, why do you think someone should be proud of being in step with Satan? Is is because you are also in step with Satan?",

If I believed in a different religious book, which I do not for the record believe in any religious book, we would then be on equal footing to debate such beliefs since your book would hold no more weight then mine. I could quote mine and you could quote yours. \n \n After I finish with mother goose perhaps I will then move on to your book of fairy tales emoticon_rolleyes",
