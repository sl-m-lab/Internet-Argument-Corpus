   "Todays import price index came in at an ASTOUNDING 2.8% MOM and 14.8% YOY. That includes the largest non petroleum increase EVER.\n \n http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120791616502207815.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\n \n \nImport Prices Show Pervasive Jump,\n Even When Oil Costs Are Excluded\n \n WASHINGTON -- Import prices surged in March, lifted by not only oil but also the biggest jump in nonpetroleum costs on record, a worrisome sign for inflation.\n \n Overall import prices rose 2.8% last month, after increasing an unrevised 0.2% in February, the Labor Department said Friday. Wall Street expected import prices to climb 2.1% in March.\n \n During the 12 months since March 2007, prices increased 15%. Between March 2006 and March 2007, prices climbed by 2.8%.\n \n Petroleum import prices increased 9.1% last month and fell 1.9% in February; prices soared 60.0% in the 12 months since March 2007. Between March 2006 and March 2007, petroleum import prices climbed by 3.1%.\n \n Excluding petroleum, all other import prices rose 1.1% in March, after increasing 0.7% in February. Prices excluding petroleum increased 5.4% in the 12 months since March 2007, nearly double the 2.8% climb between March 2006 and March 2007.\n \n \n\n \n In other news, the Reuters consumer sentiment index, widely considered one of the most accurate measures of consumer confidence, came in at a dismal 63.2.....a 26 year low (the last one being a 62 in 1982. The expectations portion fell to 53.4. \n \n Also, GE just took an earnings nosedive. \n \n Here is an article from reuters that covers it all:\n \n http://www.reuters.com/article/hotStocksNews/idUSN2431163120080411\n \n \nStocks tumbled 1 percent within minutes of the market's opening as the GE news added to worries about a U.S. recession. Shortly after the opening, a Reuters/University of Michigan report showed consumer confidence plunging, hurting the outlook for consumer spending.\n \n Shares of GE slumped nearly 12 percent, their worst decline since the market crash in October 1987. The conglomerate, which is viewed as an economic bellwether because of range of businesses, reported an unexpected 6 percent decline in earnings as well as lowering its forecast. \n\n \n With those numbers we can pretty much forget about the \"mild recession with recovery later this year\" scenario and we can be certain that any \"the worst is behind us\" talk was premature.",

It may file for bankruptcy as early as this week, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n Even retailers that can avoid bankruptcy are shutting down stores to preserve cash through what could be a long economic downturn. Over the next year, said it would close 140 stores, Ann Taylor will start to shutter 117, and the jeweler Zales will close 100. \n\n \n \n\"For years, no deal was too ugly to finance,\" he said. \"But now, nobody will throw money at these companies.\"\n \n Because retailers rely on a broad network of suppliers, their bankruptcies are rippling across the economy. The cash-short chains are leaving behind tens of millions of dollars in unpaid bills to shipping companies, furniture manufacturers, mall owners and advertising agencies. Many are unlikely to be paid in full, spreading the economic pain. \n \n Most of the ailing companies have filed for reorganization, not liquidation, under the bankruptcy laws, including the furniture chain Wickes, the housewares seller Fortunoff, Harvey Electronics and the catalog retailer Lillian Vernon. But, in a contrast with previous recessions, many are unlikely to emerge from bankruptcy, lawyers and industry experts said.\n",

   "They will go up because if you close your eyes and cover your ears then the problem doesn't exist.\n\n \n I almost feel sorry for folks who have the majority of their savings in equities. I feel even sorrier for people who have most of their savings tied up in equities and don't realize it (via equity heavy 401kaputs). I would, of course, feel worse if I had the majority of my savings tied up in equities.\n \n I say this because looking at numbers from WaMu, if credit card defaults keep increasing at the same level they have been for the next couple of quarters, they (wamu) will end up in bankruptcy court...and they are actually in better shape on that front than most of the other major banks. People are looking with great anticipation for the end of the \"sub prime mortgage crisis\" and it looks like the \"credit card default crisis\" will be in full swing before we get close to the end of the current crisis. \n \n In other news (just a bunch of observations), I currently know of 9 people who are going to lose their houses this month due to foreclosure. That does NOT include people that I work with through the charity I volunteer with, jsut 9 people in general. That does not seem like many, but considering that I have only ever personally known of ONE other person in my entire life who has lost their house through foreclosure, 9 seems like a lot to me. I know of at least another 4 who are in some phase of foreclosure, but they are probably another couple of months away from actually losing their homes.\n \n I have been reading up on a lot of forums that I sometimes lurk on. They are all economic forums (surprise surprise) and there are a startling number of people out there who are posting and apparently are planning to walk away from their homes. Many of them are not currently behind in their payments, they just do not see the point in maintaining payments on a depreciating asset. They are asking for advice about the best way to do it.\n \n What is a little disturbing is that none of them seem ashamed of the idea of walking away from their obligation. Don't get me wrong, I am 100% a financial realist and think that they SHOULD walk away from those loans, and furthermore I think that if the bank chose to give them a 110% no money down home loan in the middle of an obvious housing bubble, that the bank was choosing to take a significant risk with them. BUT BUT BUT, if attitudes toward debt have changed as much as they seem to have, where people are actually going to start making rational decisions about things like that, then this is going to be MUCH WORSE than I or anybody else projected. An estimated 8.8 million americans are currently upside down in their homes. The smart thing for the VAST majority of them to do is walk away. The problem is that if these people actually all get smart and start looking out for #1, we will almost certainly end up in a FAR worse situation than the great depression.\n \n Also, my wife knows a couple (I suppose I know them, too, but won;t admit to it) who just cleaned out their 401K. They were not specific about how much was in it, but they were SHOCKED that it had dropped significantly in value since last year....more than a 20% loss all told. \n \n Anyway, just some local observations.

If I get time I'll stop by the forums you mentioned and get involved.\n \n Thought I'd reply to this as it came up at work the last couple of weeks. Two of the people that work under me have (small) property portfolios (they've both been very lucky in life in regard to family money) and no matter what I read/hear that contradicts them, they are wildly optimistic about holding on to their assets.\n \n One thing that makes their cases unusual; I live in Brighton. It's kind of the San Fransisco of the UK (sun, sea, sand, cosmopolitan, hippies, wealthy students, new-agers, artists, nouveau riche, gay mecca etc) and it's also the one place where the relentless rise in property prices hasn't slowed.\n \n However, I think the only reason for this is due to the city's popularity among the upper-middle class; the city is still growing; demand for housing far outstrips supply, and there are no development projects going on (apart from redevelopments in the town center) as we are surrounded (thank god) by protected 'green belt' land, the Sussex South Downs (if you ever come to the UK I suggest you visit; it's got nothing on the vast wildernesses you have on the other side of the pond but it's pretty stunning scenery nonetheless).\n \n I've had a go at convincing them that we are on the verge of a (possibly major) downturn but 1) they seem to know less than I do about the larger issues that could affect them such as our reliance on the strength of the dollar and 2) they seem to have a fairly solid case due to the reasons above.\n \n I just wonder what predictions are out there for the speed and severity of a price collapse? And how meaningful are such predictions? The problem I have with economics in terms of comprehension is that it's very much like sociology (which I studied briefly) ie every single case seems to be unique; there are examples from the past we can base predictions on but the system as a whole seems to be inherently unstable and almost fractal in its patterns, ie there are patterns but the patterns are specifically unpredictable and different every time in speed and severity...\n \n Basically what this all amounts to is that I respect these guys and I'd like to be able to point them to some sources of information that will enable them to make some informed decisions, rather than just getting into a conversation about it and not being able to say much beyond \"Well due to factors x, y, and z my amateur opinion is that it's going downhill\".\n \n OK I'm pretty hammered so I'll finish there before I blather on forever.",

   "Maybe not. Sooner or later the EU central bank will do something. Europeans as I understand it are hurting pretty badly from the dollar's decline. Sooner or later the EU central bank will act.\n\n \n With Eurozone inflation running at an all time high, don't look for too much action.\n \n There seems to be a MAJOR break on this between US analysts and European analysts. US analysts are used to our central bank responding to economic weakness because the fed has a dual mandate...control inflation and maximize employment. The ECB does not. They have ONE mandate, and that is price stability. Their ideals are a little different from the US. Basically they have built the mandate of their central bank around the idea that economic stability is more important than ensuring growth and that artificial growth (which is what you get when..say...your central bank dumps interest rates to 1% for no logical reason) in the end does more harm than good. \n \n There are a couple of other factors in play here as well. First, ECB voting member do not seemed convinced that lowering rates and crashing their own currency will actually help with the problem. It is not just dollar weakness that is causing problems in Europe, it is lack of market. It is pretty clear that the US is in for a prolonged period of financial difficulty. Regardless of exchange rate, US consumers are going to be cutting back on luxury goods, which is most of what comes out of Europe. Look at last months retail sales numbers. The only retailers that had results that were less than dismal were china mart and chinaco. Bankers tend to take a little differnt view from a lot of people. They recognize that if you burn your own currency in order to stay competitive, but then inflation eats all your earnings up, you are in worse shape than if you ahd never made those sales to begin with.\n \n The other thing that is in play here is a long held belief from the ECB that Europe needs to work harder to decouple itself from the US. The US is a failing economy. There is no question of that and everybody in the financial world has known it for a very long time. It is not a question of IF, it is a question of WHEN. \n \n Even if they believed at the ECB that cutting rates would have a positive effect, it is not clear that they would do so, as keeping things as they are is helping force European businesses develop other markets for their products, which the ECB has in the past claimed was \"critical to continued prosperity\".\n \n Unless and until inflation in the EU slows down, it is unlikely that we will see a rate cut from the ECB. There is simply no room in their mandate to make illogical rate cuts in the face of record inflation numbers, nor would it be logical for them to do so.",

My biggest beef with the oil price-fixers is that they never run out of excuses to raise the price of gas. \"Oil goes up because economy is good thus increasing demand\" but if also goes up if \"the economy is bad causing the dollar to weaken\". While both may be somewhat good arguments you really can't have it both ways...well, yes you can because they have pulled it off.",

   "I am doing some research today and getting ready to go short on several stocks again. \n \n This is going to be another one where we all get to laugh at people again (remember as the dot com bubble exploded how we got to laugh at everybody who kept falling for suckers rallies while looking for the bottom). Maybe on Monday BOA will announce bankruptcy and that they are ceasing operations and the dow will jump back up to the 14,000 mark! \n \n It has actually been interesting watching the earnings results come out. Some of the big financial firms were especially interesting because most of them included their outlook for the future (universally negative) and it becomes apparent after actually reviewing the stuff that they have put out that many of them sold profitable investments off in order to make even the bad numbers. \n \n It was also interesting to hear Citis prediction for credit card, auto, and consumer loans. In one release they said that they expected those losses to \"balloon\". In another they said they expect them to \"explode\". Either way it is not good. \n \n Something else interesting that has apparently come with quarterly reports...one of my data services tracks publicly announced job losses (layoffs, plant closings, etc...) and so far this month has the highest number they have ever recorded (15 years). The month is not even over and already we have beat out post Katrina job loss announcements. That is a pretty bad sign.",

   "With Eurozone inflation running at an all time high, don't look for too much action.\n \n There seems to be a MAJOR break on this between US analysts and European analysts. US analysts are used to our central bank responding to economic weakness because the fed has a dual mandate...control inflation and maximize employment. The ECB does not. They have ONE mandate, and that is price stability. Their ideals are a little different from the US. Basically they have built the mandate of their central bank around the idea that economic stability is more important than ensuring growth and that artificial growth (which is what you get when..say...your central bank dumps interest rates to 1% for no logical reason) in the end does more harm than good.\n\n \n It's not that some countries don't WANT it, you can bet your XXX that Berlusconi will be wailing for a rate cut in the not too distant future (which by itself is a good reason not to have one, someone needs to smack some fiscal discipline in the Italian govt's XXX), it's just that our and the Germans' finance ministers go apeshit if they even consider asking the ECB for one.",

For example, early on I favored the Feds policies because I had some leveraged MBS issues that I needed time to unload on some poor, unsuspecting sap before they crashed. Obviously even then the actions being taken were irresponsible and destined to cause a great deal of pain to the masses, but I did not care as long as they worked out for me personally and gave me an opportunity to dump the junk and head for the exit. Screw the masses. \n \n On another note....I think that investors are being a little unfair to BOA today. All last week we saw terrible numbers coming out of the big banks. If you look at citibanks quarterly release, it is clear that they may well end up collapsing this year, and yet the market shot up and those banks gained. Today BOA releases terrible numbers and the market gets drug down. \n \n That hardly seems fair to me. If the market is going to rally on news that other banks are failing, it should rally when BOA fails as well.",
