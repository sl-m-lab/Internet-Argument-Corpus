Please substantiate your claim.\n \n \nYour feeling of freedom is nothing more than a self induced drugged state.\n I don't understand what you mean. Freedom is a delusion. Fear and happiness are illusions as ultimately, we have no free will. This applies to everything, not only theism.\n \n\n Religion appeals to your brain, instincts and behavior in such a way as to make you feel good.\n\n Yes.\n \n\n If it made you feel bad no one would believe it.\n\n Considering that blind faith is always required for any form of theist to believe, I agree.

   "I think that may be a false analogy. Belief in god, perhaps in some ways, is like a drug, but ultimately it is not physically addicting. The massive amounts of endophins released by heroin cannot be matched by what is felt by spirtiual experience in humans. The reduced production in endoprhins following the heroin blast creates dependance on heroin which leads to quick addiction.\n \n I suppose, however, that the reward of spiritual immortality is far too great for some to simply discard their belief in the face of reason. Great conflicts such as war may be a good example. Somehow, some people living during atrocities manage to keep their faith, right?",
