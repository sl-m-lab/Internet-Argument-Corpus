   "In an ironic twist the NKVD turned an old czarist courthouse, which was also used by the Gestapo during WWII, into a torture chamber. Now it is home to Lithuania's KGB museum.\n \n \"a new wave of terror from 1944 to 1953, which saw some 350,000 Lithuanians packed into cattle cars and shipped to Siberia. \n \n In the same period, 15,000 people suspected of anti-Soviet activities were brought to the NKVD building in Vilnius for questioning. More than 700 were shot, and what is believed to be their remains have been uncovered in a mass grave a few kilometers from the city center\"\n \n source: Rueters\n \n Latvia's prisoners of war also suffered a similar travesty.\n \n source: BBC News\n \n If they were capable of treating their prisoners of war and colonies in this manner, how do you suppose they treated their criminals. Hell, even the Russian visa website admits that criminals were executed right the in the center of Red Square.\n \n Source: Visit Red Square today\n \n Ever heard of Stalin's purges? In 1943, 170,000 executions were conducted. Gulags were often used. In 1953 1,700,000 were reportedly interned. Read up on Stalin's reign of terror. I am sure that their low crime rate has everything to do with the residual fear felt by Russian citizens. This sort of terrorism does not heal quick.\"It is estimated that around 50 million perished in Soviet gulags between 1930 and 1950.\" As you can see, Soviet concentration camps killed roughly 8 times more people than German concentration camps. Many of them were sent to the gulags for nothing more than holding a religious belief. Sickening. This is the system that Marxists support. The Soviet occupation of East Germany has an infamous history, because those who tried to escape were shot dead. They were not exactly soft on crimes committed in the name of freedom. Their human rights record is deplorable.",
