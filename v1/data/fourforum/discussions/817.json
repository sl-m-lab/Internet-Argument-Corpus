The fourth century saint, John Chrysostom, called Jews \"assassins of Christ,\" and he considered the synagogue \"worse than a brothel.\" In 1543 Martin Luther taught that all Jews in Germany should be \"put under one roof\" and if they still proved too dangerous for society, the \"poisonous bitter worms\" should be driven out of Germany \"for all time.\" ([I]by the way, wasnt Hitler a Catholic?) \"In 1871, Pope Pius IX, who was recently canonized, called members of the 2,200-year-old Jewish community of Rome \"dogs barking in all the streets.\"<http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives/100402/100402t.htm<\n \n I think \"held\" is the operative word here.

   "Tuesdeb,\n \n I have been researching the anti-semitism of the early Church. I have not finished but I have a little more than before. \n \n I am not sure if you are Christian, Jewish, or other. But did you know that the Christian Bible is even considered anti-semitic by many because of 1-2 lines? Read Matthew 23:37-38, \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\" Some say that Jesus did not make this statement but rather that the writer of the gospel of Matthew made it to put forth anti-semitic ideas. But we must note that this anti-semitism proposed is not what we think of in modern times as a racial hostility due to the fact that Jesus was Jewish and the writer of Matthew's gospel was Jewish. If realized as the true words of Jesus then it may be a statement of prophecy. And anyone crying anti-semitism at this must necessarily say that not only is the New Testament anti-semitic but the Old Testament as well. For there are worse \"curses\" there proclaimed Jew against Jew and worse actions Jew against Jew. It seems that anyone making an anti-semitic claim against the New Testament might also make that claim against the Old. Sounds a bit silly though that the Torah would be anti-semitic.\n \n Secondly, we can consider that this was not a one-sided affair. One can read what Paul writes about himself. He was riding about persecuting Christians before becoming one himself. The Christians, if guilty, were not the only ones guilty as is more frequently portrayed.\n \n Thirdly, at the Jewish Council of Jamnia, a benediction was introduced by the Jews with the purpose of dividing the two religions which had hitherto maintained unified worship. The only website I have on this right now is here:\n \n http://members.aol.com/johnprh/curse.html  \n \n If the Nazarenes (who would later fall under the blanket term Christians) were to continue to worship with the Jews then they must pronounce a benediction at worship services that was a condemnation of themselves!\n \n Finally, I think I have found the sources of the quotes of Chrysostom and Pius IX. It seems that they did in fact say these things. I have also found other Church Fathers have made similar statements. But these statements must be considered in light of the context above. Chrysostom supposedly spoke or wrote the quote you mentioned in Orations Against the Jews  or Orations against the Judaizers. There are two translations of the title of that work depending on what side your are own and there are two interpretations of the history. Here are two links describing the two modes of thought:\n \n \"pro-Chrysostom\" \n This site proposes that the expressed antipathy to the Judaizer was due more to theological debate. \n \n (Here is an edit to my original post. If you scroll down on the above webpage then you will come to the 2 sites that I am now adding. They expand on the use of the term \"Judaizers\" and on the Father's anti-semitism in general. They are a fairly quick read and I am posting them because I wasn't sure if you would make it that far down the page.\n Judaizers \n early Christian anti-semitism )\n \n \n \"anti-Chrysostom\" (I only read the intro to this one because it was so lengthy)\n \n I could find many more of the anti-Chyrsostom sites than pro-Chrysostom. \n \n I hope this is both interesting and useful. If I find out more on this then I will let you know.\n \n Peace.",

   "Maximus,\n Thank you for the links. Frankly, I was surprised by the reason for the upset over this new film. I hadnt heard this charge before, or hadnt even learned enough about the Catholic church to know that there were sects who do not agree with the changes of V-II. I have to say, though, that after I spent some time thinking about it, it did ring true...I can remember being told, as a child, that Jews \"killed Jesus\", and that that was good enough reason to hate them. I think the fear is based in the fact that the average person, Catholic or not, is not a scholar, and takes things at face value. I understand the mis-translation problem with the Chrysostom quotes, but honestly, I dont think that the Judaizer version is much less anti-semetic than the Jew translation. Imo, since \"Jew\" is not a race as much as it is a faith, someone who enjoys taking part in the faith is always a Judaizer. But, maybe you disagree...\n Anyways...I dont think that Jews have any more to fear from this film than Christians had to fear from The Last Temptation of Christ.",

There are limited resources in the world, and some of these are used to make films. I don't think films should be censored, but I also don't think filmmaking resources should be allocated to movies that aren't worth the celluloid (or plastic nowadays) they're printed on. Every time a see an ad for another stupid unfunny Adam Sandler movie (not the dramas/romances, he's actually good in some of these.) or the like, I get frustrated at the thought of all the work and resources that went into that useless trash, that will be watched by two fourteen year olds before it goes straight to video.\n \n Someone brought up the porn industry. They're a great example. So much porn is made that sucks (no pun intended), because ppl will still\n buy it. They have no vested interest in trying harder, because they're making profits. I also don't think retailers should stock Hustler on a low shelf next to Archie comics. These are areas which I think it's fine to control for. The industry has to take responsibility for quality and control of their products.\n \n Apart from that, the \"if you don't like it, look away\" argument works for me for porn and hookers. That's because I think people object to it on \"morality\" grounds, and I don't think other ppls \"morals\" are their business. I think spreading hate isn't \"immoral\", it's dangerous. However, I doubt that people who aren't already Anti-Semitic will be driven to violence by a movie. That said, there may be people who are already Anti-Semitic who might be driven to violence by a movie. Do I think this movie should be banned? No. Do I think an anti-Semitic movie should be made? Neither. I hope the difference is clear. \n I think it's fine to say that a movie is problematic if they are publishing hate, and to protest the publishing of that hate.

They arn't anti-semitic in any way shape or fashion. Mel Gibson certainly isn't anti-semitic, as he has made quite clear.\n\n I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not claiming to understand it. I was talking about the possibility of a movie provoking violence in general.\n \n Whether or not the movie is anti-Semitic remains to be seen, as few ppl have seen it yet. I'd like to know what you are referring to when you say Gibson has \"made it quite clear\" he isn't anti-Semitic. The reports I've heard state that he has not made any public anti-Semitic statements. It is his membership in an organization which disagrees with the papal statement against anti-Semitic accusations of deicide which originally made ppl nervous about him directing a Passion Play, given their anti-Semitic history. Since that time, his father has made inflammatory anti-Semitic public statements; denying the Holocaust, and speaking of a \"Jewish conspiracy\". Mel Gibson is not responsible for what his father says, but he does have a responsibility to respond to it- which he has refused to do.",

   "its interesting I read in an article yesterday in a NY newspaper (where Im from) that for fear of anti-semetic backlash some protestors were suggesting that mel put a disclaimer in the movie explaining that Romans killed Christ. this had me laughing. why would it be OK to promote prejudice against Romans as substitution for prejudice against Jews??? geez!\n \n Its ridiculous how similar movies from the past (like Amistad and Schindler's list) never had nearly the amount of controversy and public opposition as this movie. I think Schindler's List got 2 Oscars... yet the concept was the same: a movie dipicting the atrocities of one group of people towards another",

   "For those who don't know, Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" is not based directly on the gospels -- as propagandists desperately want you to believe. It is based on a work, written by an anti-semitic Catholic nun born in the 1770s. (Her beliefs regarding Jews were no different from most people of her time.)\n \n Other movies on the same topic such as \"The Gospel of John\" (http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1808509536), which was released just last fall, did not receive such strong (or any) criticism of anti-semitism that Gibson's movie received. And for good reason. The movie \"The Gospel of John\" was based on the actual Christian bible and not on the rantings of anti-semitic individual of centuries ago who just happened to be a nun with \"visions\".\n \n If Gibson used a different source material for his movie -- oh, like the Bible -- rather than use the work of an old-time anti-Jew, then his movie wouldn't have received such criticisim ... as well as all this free publicity. Did you even hear about \"The Gospel of John\" movie?\n \n Free publicity means 26 million dollars on the first day. The movie only cost 25 million to make. Profit on the 1st day. That don't happen very often in the movie business. \n \n People ignored \"The Gospel of John\" movie (rated PG-13) as if the movie never existed but they filled the theaters to see the work of an anti-Jew on the big screen that is rated R. I find that very interesting. Why? Because it shows what topics are profitable. The media puppet masters sure know what audiences wanted and they delivered. They may not always get a hit but they got one this time around.\n \n Anyone remember the movie \"The Last Temptation of Christ\"? All that controversy didn't generate a huge hit on the 1st day like 'Passion' did.\n \n Obviously, a movie on Jesus, controversy or not, does not make an instant hit. But throw in a little bit of anti-semitism then you have a hit. \n \n One clearly can not ignore the anti-semitism that the audience actually crave for. Whether that would translate to violence or increased discrimination against Jews that Jewish leaders claim, time can only tell. \n \n Gospel of John versus Passion of Christ versus Last Temptation. \n \n Winner: Passion by a long shot. \n \n Here's some excerpts from a review by Fr. Richard Leonard, Director of the Australian Catholic Film Office (http://www.americamagazine.org/leonard-passion.cfm):\n \n \n\n We know that Gibson was drawn to make this film after a spiritual awakening. His is on record as saying that one of the texts that affected him most deeply on this laudable journey was \"The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" Written in 1824 by the German mystic Catherine Emmerich, this book records her private revelations and visions about the suffering and death of Jesus. \n \n ...\n \n In many instances Emmerich's work varies significantly in detail and tone from any of the Gospels and unfortunately Gibson has incorporated a number of scenes from this book into his film\n \n ...\n \n As befits Catholic spirituality of the time, Emmerich was obsessed with the details of how Jesus suffered, and for how long. So is Gibson. \n \n ...\n \n Catherine Emmerich was also a European Catholic of her time and her work is particularly anti-Semitic in tone.\n \n ...\n \n One can see why this film has been targeted as being anti-Semitic. There are some stereotypically gratuitous portraits of \"the Jews,\" \n \n \n",

However, that doesn't automatically mean that the film is anti-semetic. I highly doubt that anyone is going to come out of the theatre with more anti-semitism than they already had. The movie does not make the Jews look like \"Christ-killers.\" It barely shows the Jews' part in Christ's death. It makes the Romans look much worse than it makes the Jews look. I don't doubt that some people could take the film and use it to promote anti-semitism, but any reasonable person should be able to recgonize that the film is not anti-semetic.",

It is based on a work, written by an anti-semitic Catholic nun born in the 1770s. (Her beliefs regarding Jews were no different from most people of her time.)\n\n \n That's completely inaccurate. Yes, Mel Gibson read the book by Anne Emmerich, but he in no way based it on his movie. The movie was based on the four gospels- and I haven't seen any connection between the events mentioned in Emmerich's book and the events in the movie, besides the ones that are in the gospel. \n \n \n If Gibson used a different source material for his movie -- oh, like the Bible -- rather than use the work of an old-time anti-Jew, then his movie wouldn't have received such criticisim ... as well as all this free publicity. Did you even hear about \"The Gospel of John\" movie?\n\n \n That's ridiculous. The mere fact that Gibson used the bible as his source material caused the criticisms. Look at the people who attacked the movie- liberal anti-christian New York Times, Hollywood Reporter. San Francisco Chronicle, and  Seattle Post-Intelligencer. These are ALL liberal sources! Why should we trust them? \n \n Fr. Richard Leonard is a Jesuit, which is a very liberal order in the Catholic Church. They are always attacking conservative sources, so using his as a source is a real farce. \n \n \n \n 1. The inability to dispute the claim that one of the source material for Gibson's movie was not the Bible at all but that of a work from an anti-semitic nun.\n\n \n Innacurate. \n \n \n 2. The inability to dispute claims made by Fr. Richard Leonard that the movie contained \"some stereotypically gratuitous portraits of 'the Jews'\".\n\n \n I've seen the movie and did not notice anything that was remotely anti-semitic. I did not look at the Jews as people unlike me- I looked at the Jews as people like me. Further, Jews such as David Horowitz loved the movie:\n \n  Mel Gibson's Passion - Wednesday, July 30, 2003 5:49 PM\n \n Mel Gibson's film, The Passion, which is about the last twelve hours of Christ's life is the object of campaign villification and book burning by a committee of Christians and Jews who want to shut it down before it is shown, or edit it to their own politically (or religiously) correct standards. Paula Fredriksen is a spokesman for this committee. The New Republic has shamed itself by printing her ill-informed and bigoted attack on the film.\n \n Unlike Fredriksen and others who want to destroy film before they have seen it, I have. It is not an attempt to portray the historical Jesus -- which is the subject of Fredriksen's entire screed -- nor could it be. By Fredriksen's own account there is no evidentiary basis for such a portrait and if anyone tried to create one it would be eviscerated by the same Savanarolas, precisely because no one can know what the truth is.\n \n Gibson's film is an artistic vision and must be judged that way. Like others who have seen the film, I am sworn to keep details confidential so that it gets its chance when the distributors present it to the viewing public next Easter. However, I will say this: It is an awesome artifact, an overpowering work. I can't remember being so affected by a film before. It is extremely painful to watch and yet the violence is never gratuitous. You never feel like you want to take your eyes off the screen. It is a wracking emotional journey which never strays from its inspirational purpose. It is as close to a religious experience as art can get. \n \n It is not anti-Semitic, as the film-burners have charged. Two illustrative details: Jesus is referred to in the film as \"rabbi,\" and there is never any distancing of Jesus or his disciples from their Jewishness. (One point missed by ignorant bigots like Fredericksen whose only familiarity with The Passion is with a stolen script) is that while the film is in Aramaic -- a brilliant effect that enhances the symbolic resonance of the story -- it has subtitles. Second detail: A Jew carries Jesus' cross along the terrible route to Golgotha and shares his miseries. But yes the film is also faithful to the Gospels and therefore the Pharisees are Jesus' enemies and they and their flock do call for Jesus' death (and why wouldn't they since Jesus was a threat to their authority and their beliefs?).\n \n But all this is to miss the point. This is a Christian parable. The cruelty, intolerance and lack of compassion of human beings is limitless -- and we who have lived through the Twentieth Century know this all too well. The moral of this Christian story -- of Mel Gibson's film -- is that we all killed Jesus -- Jew and Gentile alike -- and tortured him, and we do so every day. But if you believe the vision that Gibson has rendered so searingly and so well, Jesus forgives us for that very act. Whosoever will give up cruelty and love his brother will enter paradise. That is the message that Gibson has framed in his extraordinary\n \n I think you're completely far from reality. You want the movie to be anti-semitic because it is completely Christian. The movie was completely accurate to the gospels, and extremely well done.",

Since 'Passion' does not fit that description, the anti-Jews would not label the movie as anti-semitic.\n\n \n In other words, no, you have not seen the movie, but you still want to interject your personal opinions egarding its content. An interesting debating tactic.\n \n I am sure that Gibson drew from many sources, including Anne Emmerichs book. Have you read the book, or are you branding it as anti sementic based on what you have seen on TV or heard from other folks who have not read the book? While I did find some anti-sementic undertones in the book, they were far from prevelent in regards to the text.\n \n As far as the jews/money issue, a good jew should e thrifty. This is taught in the jewish religion, just like a good catholic should tithe, a teaching of the catholic religion.\n \n Part of the reason that some (few) people percieve jewish conspiricies, whihc I believe is a direct cause of anti-semitism, is the close relationship that the jewish community maintains. Jews prefer to do business with other jews. My sister maried a jewish guy who openly admits that he got the job he has today because the company he works for is owned by a jew. There were other, more qualified canidates, and he got the job because he is jewish.\n \n THere is a jewish guy who works for me that puts ogether and signs all the bid packages we send to certain companies. This was his idea. HE said \"If I do it, we will get the bid, even if we are not low bid\". He is right, we always get contraacts with certain companies, even when we are not the low bidder, because he prepares and signs the bid package.\n \n Oddly enough, if I decided to hire only catholics, or to give preferential treatment to catholics, I would be hammered by the local jewish community. Seems a little lopsided to me.\n \n The jews scream \"RACISM\" for the same reason the Japanese do. This is because they are both extremely racist people. Interestingly enough, both seem to have the roots of their racism in their religion (chosen people my left foot). Since they are racist, they assume everybody else must be, too. If you don't believe me, take a trip to japan. It becomes clear pretty quickly how they feel about you (if you don't catch on, learn some japanese, but don;t run around speaking it. The surest way to find what people feel is to pretend you can't understand them).\n \n I honestly always though that antisemetism was a problem, until my sister married a jew. Now it seems clear that the problem is more alongs the line of anti cristian or anti muslim bias in the jewish community.",

   "I heard something that I thought was very interesting on Pat Robertson's TV show the other day (I don't usually watch but I was channel surfing and it caught my ear). They were talking about The Passion and Pat was interviewing a Jewish man (I wish I could remember his name). He was forcefully rebuking those Jews who are protesting this movie for its supposed anti-semitic content. \n \n He thought it was interesting that modern day Jews were concerned that the Jews of Christ's era were being portrayed in a bad light. He said that if one thinks about it, the Jews who engineered Christ's death were also the very same Jews who were collaborating with Rome...the same Jews that would abuse their own people to maintain their status and luxury with Rome. To any faithful, true Jew, the portrayal of these men in a bad light would be justice served. The Jews that led Jesus to death were those Jews who were actually themselves anti-semites because of the way they treated their own people.\n \n Another thing I often hear requested from detractors of this movie is that Mel Gibson put a trailer at the end of it that would quell any problems...something like \"Jews were not responsible for Jesus' death and this film is not intended to portray or promote anti-semitism in any way.\" Mel Gibson addressed the problem with doing this in an interview on ABC with Diane Sawyer. He said doing that implies that there is something in his film that incites anti-semitism in the first place. Doing that is a sort of acknowledgment that there is something wrong or bad in the film. He stated that he would not do it for that reason.",
