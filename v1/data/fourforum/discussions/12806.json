   "There is always a poll coming out that says x % feel this way and want this and that and some other thing. So I looked up some poll results concerning gay marriage and was a little confused.\n \n The results showed that the more people were for\n \n Gays being allowed to serve in the military (openly or in the case of the military in the wall locker)\n Equal job rights\n Federal Benefits\n Survivorship Rights\n Hospital visitation\n Healthcare\n \n One poll had 58% opposed gay marriage, 34% said no legal recognition, 50% laws allowing a state not to recognize a same sex marriage of another state should remain, but then 54% think the Federal law that denies benefits to spouses of same sex couples should not continue, 54% support allowing same sex couples to adopt and 58% do not think gay marriage is a threat to traditional marriage. Another had numbers in the 70's and 80 percentile favoring gays for the above.\n \n The only poll I saw that gave any indication of some type of reason was one that had 41% think marriage a religious matter and 41% also state religion as very important.\n \n What I got from the information is there is a hang up on the the word marriage and to a lesser degree even civil union. Because when asked about marriage usually mostly not supported (but the trend is downward) civil union without all the benefits did better than with but usually lost to no legal recognition (trending upward for the first two down for the last), but when asked about the rights individually and not as part of marriage or civil union and suddenly 6 - 8 of every 10 support equality.\n \n It's like the religious right is using the Jedi Mind Trick or something like it. As long as the M word and CU words aren't used same sex couples can have all the benefits. \n \n So maybe instead of being wed you can coalesce, instead of husband and wife you can be a duo or a team and you wouldn't get married you would form an association.\n \n To see the questions and results I did go here\n Civil Rights\n \n So all kidding aside what specifically is the objection?",

   "The reason I see in the latest poll was the use of \"constitutional right.\" Of course most people would oppose it, because well, to be honest, most people are not familiar with the way the constitution works. Yes, it is not in the constitution that it is your right to get married, but there is a little something else that protects rights of individuals...erhmm equal protection, due process, etc you get the picture; most people who are not thoroughly educated do not understand this. The \"if it's not in the constitution\" argument is moot. Several cases have stated marriage is a right (the most famous one of Loving v Virginia.) The reason the Christian right has been successful is because of this ignorance of judicial review that has upheld marriage is indeed a right. What good is having marriage in our legal structure if it only benefits a certain sexual orientation. IMHO that is discrimination.",
