How can you be a Christian and deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ? YOU CAN'T BE! Yea such an one is an heretick! Unsurprisingly, Martin Luther King, Jr. did not believe that the BIBLE is infallible or that it is to be taken literally (you can best believe he does now but it is everlasting too late for him). Below is an excerpt of this paper concerning these critical doctrines--\n \n But if we delve into the deeper meaning of these doctrines, and somehow strip them of their literal interpretation, we will find that they are based on a profound foundation. Although we may be able to argue with all degrees of logic that these doctrines are historically and philolophically untenable*, yet we can never undermind the foundation on which they are based.\n \n *According to Webster's, untenable means that cannot be held, defended, or maintained. philology is scholarship or the study of literary texts to determine their authenticity or meaning. So in other words, the divinity, resurrection and virgin birth are undefendable based on the historical facts! Read on...\n \n A King quote from this same paper about the Sonship of Jesus--\n \n The first doctrine of our discussion which deals with the divine sonship of Jesus went through a great process of development. It seems quite evident that the early followers of Jesus in Palestine were well aware of his genuine humanity. Even the synoptic gospels picture Jesus as a victim of human experiences. Such human experiences as growth, learning, prayer, and defeat are not at all uncommon in the life of Jesus. How then did this doctrine of divine sonship come into being?\n \n We may find a partial clue to the actual rise of this doctrine in the spreading of Christianity into the Greco-Roman world. I need not elaborate on the fact that the Greeks were very philosophical minded people. Through philosophical thinking the Greeks came to the point of subordinating, distrusting, and even minimizing anything physical. Anything that possessed flesh was always underminded in Greek thought. And so in order to receive inspiration from Jesus the Greeks had to apotheosize him.\n \n ...As Hedley laconically states, \"the church had found God in Jesus, and so it called Jesus the Christ; and later under the influence of Greek thought-forms, the only begotten Son of God.\" \n \n Next, King on the virgin birth--\n \n First we must admit that the evidence for the tenability of this doctrine is to shallow to convince any objective thinker. To begin with, the earliest written documents in the New Testament make no mention of the virgin birth. Moreover, the Gospel of Mark, the most primitive and authentic of the four, gives not the slightest suggestion of the virgin birth. The effort to justify this doctrine on the grounds that it was predicted by the prophet Isaiah is immediately eliminated, for all New Testament scholars agree that the word virgin is not found in the Hebrew original, but only in the Greek text which is a mistranslation of the Hebrew word for \"young woman.\" How then did this doctrine arise?\n \n A clue to this inquiry may be found in a sentence from St. Justin's First Apology. Here Justin states that the birth of Jesus is quite similar to the birth of the sons of Zeus. It was believed in Greek thought that an extraordinary person could only be explained by saying that he had a father who was more than human. It is probable that this Greek idea influenced Christian thought.\n \n A more adequate explanation for the rise of this doctrine is found in the experience which the early christians had with Jesus. The people saw within Jesus such a uniqueness of quality and spirit that to explain him in terms of ordinary background was to them quite inadequate. For his early followers this spiritual uniqueness could only by accounted for in terms of biological uniqueness. They were not unscientific in their approach because they had no knowledge of the scientific. They could only express themselves in terms of the pre-scientific thought patterns of their day. \n \n And finally, King on the resurrection--\n \n The last doctrine in our discussion deals with the resurrection story. This doctrine, upon which the Easter Faith rests, symbolizes the ultimate Christian conviction: that Christ conquered death. From a literary, historical, and philosophical point of view this doctrine raises many questions. In fact the external evidence for the authenticity of this doctrine is found wanting. But here again the external evidence is not the most important thing, for it in itself fails to tell us precisely the thing we most want to know: What experiences of early Christians lead to the formulation of the doctrine?\n \n The root of our inquiry is found in the fact that the early Christians had lived with Jesus. They had been captivated by the magnetic power of his personality. This basic experience led to the faith that he could never die. And so in the pre-scientific thought pattern of the first century, this inner faith took outward form. \n \n Read this paper for yourself here.\n \n **EXAMPLE TWO**\n \n Next in line is his paper,\n \n \"The Sources of Fundamentalism and Liberalism\n Considered Historically and Psychologically\"\n \n Herein, \"Reverend\" Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. calls the garden of Eden a myth in line with \"other oriental religions\" and says that science and the Bible are at odds. He is scornful of \"fundamentalism\" and uncritical of liberalism. In this paper, King ascribes doctrines to \"fundamentalists\" that are so basic that you'd think they'd be ascribed to everybody who even thought about naming the name of Christ --\n \n \"...doctrines such as a supernatural plan of salvation, the Trinity, the substitutionary theory of the atonement, and the second coming of Christ are all quite prominant in fundamentalist thinking.\" \n \n Here's a further excerpt of this paper--\n \n \"The use of the critical method in approaching the Bible is to the fundamentalist downright heresy. He sees the Bible as the infallible word of God, from the dotting of an \"i\" to the crossing of a \"T\". He finds it to be a unity and a coherence of parts; \"the New Testament is in the old contained, and the Old Testament is in the new explained.\"13 Upon this first proposition (the infallibility of the Bible) all other fundamentalist views depend. They argue that if the Bible is true--that is, so divinely inspired as to be free from error--then all other truths follow inevitably, because they are based upon what the Bible actually says in language clear and unmistakable.\n \n \"When the fundamentalist comes to the nature of man he finds all of his answers in the Bible. The story of man in the garden of Eden gives a conclusive answer. Man was created by a direct act of God.14 Moreover, he was created in the image of God, but through the workings of the devil man {was} lead into disobedience. Then began all human ills: hardship and labor, the agony of childbirth, hatred, sorrow, suffering, and death.15 The fundamentalist is quite aware of the fact that scholars regard the garden of Eden and the serpent Satan and the hell of fire as myths analogous to those found in other oriental religions. He knows also that his beliefs are the center of redicule by many. But this does not shake his faith--rather it convinces him more of the existence of the devil.16 The critics, says the fundamentalist, would never indulge in such skeptical thinking if the devil hadn't influenced them. The fundamentalist is convinced that this skepticism of scholars and cheap humor of the laity can by no means prevent the revelation of God.\\[Footnote:] Sores, op. cit., p. 54.\\17\n \n \"Others doctrines such as a supernatural plan of salvation, the Trinity, the substitutionary theory of the atonement, and the second coming of Christ are all quite prominant in fundamentalist thinking. Such are the views of the fundamentalist and they reveal that he is oppose to theological adaptation to social and cultural change. He sees a progressive scientific age as a retrogressive spiritual age. Amid change all around he was {is} willing to preserve certain ancient ideas even though they are contrary to science.\" \n \n Read this paper here.\n \n **EXAMPLE THREE**\n \n King says Christianity grew out of mystery religions in his paper entitled,\n \n \"A Study of Mithraism\".\n \n Here's an excerpt--\n \n It is not at all surprising in view of the wide and growing influence of these religions that when the disciples in Antioch and elsewhere preached a crucified and risen Jesus they should be regarded as the heralds of another mystery religion, and that Jesus himself should be taken for the divine Lord of the cult through whose death and resurrection salvation was to be had.\n \n It is at this point that we are able to see why knowledge of these cults is important for any serious New Testament study. It is well-nigh impossible to grasp Christianity through and through without knowledge of these cults. That there were striking similarities between the developing church and these religions cannot be denied. Even Christian apologist had to admit that fact. For an instance, in the mystery-religions identification between the devotee and the Lord of the cult was supposed to be brought about by various rites of initiation; the taurobolium, or bath of blood; the eating of flesh of the sacrifical beast and the like. Now there was something of this in Paul too, for he thought of the believer as buried with Christ in baptism and as feeding upon him in the eucharist. This is only one of many examples that I could give to prove the similarity between the developing Christian Church and the Mystery Religions.\n \n This is not to say that a Saint Paul or a Saint John sat down and copied these views verbatim. But after being in contact with these surrounding religions and hearing certain doctrines expressed, it was only natural for some of these views to become a part of their subconscious minds. When they sat down to write they were expressing consciously that which had dwelled in their subconscious minds.1 It is also significant to know that Roman tolerance had favoured this great syncretism of religious ideas. Borrowing was not only natural but inevitable.\n \n One of the most interesting of these ancient cults was Mithraism, which bore so many points of resemblance to Christianity that it is a challenge to the modern student to investigate these likenesses and learn more about them. \n \n Did you spot King's lies about the apostle Paul? Read this paper here.\n \n **EXAMPLE FOUR**\n \n Did King repent and change before he died? The following was spoken the night before he died. The speech is entitled, \"I See The Promised Land\" and was delivered April 3, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. He had not abandoned his heretickal notions:\n \n \"As you know, if I were standing at the beginning of time, with the possibility of general and panoramic view of the whole human history up to now, and the Almighty said to me, 'Martin Luther King, which age would you like to live in?'-- I would take my mental flight by Egypt through, or rather across the Red Sea, through the wilderness on toward the promised land. And in spite of its magnificence, I wouldn't stop there. I WOULD MOVE ON BY GREECE, AND TAKE MY MIND TO MOUNT OLYMPUS. AND I WOULD SEE PLATO, ARISTOTLE, SOCRATES, EURIPIDES AND ARISTOPHANES ASSEMBLED AROUND THE PARTHENON AS THEY DISCUSSED THE GREAT AND ETERNAL ISSUES OF REALITY.\"\n \n You see what I mean? It is in line with his other speeches that puts King's humanistic \"Christianity\" in the same category as everything else. He USED \"Christianity\" as a springboard for his social gospel. The \"promised land\" for King was not heaven, it was social equality! Read this speech (it isn't a sermon) here.\n \n The answer to our question.\n \n The \"Reverend\" Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was no Christian. Period. He was an heretick. Below is a quote from Time Magazine (January 3, 1964)--King was Time Magazine's 1963 Man of the Year.\n \n (King speaking) \"I had doubts that religion was intellectually respectable.\" At Morehouse, King searched for \"some intellectual basis for a social philosophy.\" He read and reread Thoreau's essay, \"Civil Disobedience,\" concluded that the ministry was the only framework in which he could properly position his growing ideas on social protest.\n \n At Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pa., King built the underpinnings of his philosophy. Hegel and Kant impressed him, but a lecture on Gandhi transported him, sent him foraging insatiably into Gandhi's books. \"From my background,\" he says, \"I gained my regulating Christian ideals. From Gandhi I learned my operational technique.\"",

   "In the context of gays and Christianity, it's worth recalling the findings of a recent survey by the Christian Barna Group:\n \n A New Generation Expresses its Skepticism and Frustration with Christianity\n \n \nThe study shows that 16- to 29-year-olds exhibit a greater degree of criticism toward Christianity than did previous generations when they were at the same stage of life. In fact, in just a decade, many of the Barna measures of the Christian image have shifted substantially downward, fueled in part by a growing sense of disengagement and disillusionment among young people. For instance, a decade ago the vast majority of Americans outside the Christian faith, including young people, felt favorably toward Christianity's role in society. Currently, however, just 16% of non-Christians in their late teens and twenties said they have a \"good impression\" of Christianity.\n\n \n It seems that a lot of this negative impression is driven by the perception of Christian evangelicals and fundamentalists. Anti-homosexuality is high on the list of negative traits:\n \n \nInterestingly, the study discovered a new image that has steadily grown in prominence over the last decade. Today, the most common perception is that present-day Christianity is \"anti-homosexual.\" Overall, 91% of young non-Christians and 80% of young churchgoers say this phrase describes Christianity. As the research probed this perception, non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality, they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians. One of the most frequent criticisms of young Christians was that they believe the church has made homosexuality a \"bigger sin\" than anything else. Moreover, they claim that the church has not helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their friendships with gays and lesbians.\n\n \n Even young Christians are seeing Christianity as being defined by anti-homosexuality! It's no wonder non-Christians, and especially gays, are developing an essentially negative view of this religion. Before Jim jumps down my throat again for generalising, I realise this doesn't apply to all Christians, and many Christians don't define themselves by what they are against, but what has Christianity become if this is a dominant perception of it? Even among younger Christians?\n \n When people have come to regard the phrase \"Christian love\" as a satirical oxymoron, I think that's a sign that much of Christianity has left the path of love, if, indeed, it was ever on it. Many Christians are the fine, upstanding Desmond Tutu sort of Christians it is good to have at your side at the barricades, but many others are the judgmental sort who would as soon knife you in the back.\n \n Homosexuality, for good or ill, has become one of the defining issues for Christianity in this generation. The prospective schism of the Anglican church is a symptom of this. Christians will be judged by their peers on where they stand on it.",

I guess if everyone who hurts people's feelings is a sadist, then there are a hell of a lot of sadistic Christians. As I type this, I am listening to a radio broadcast by Pastor Albert Mohler, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant sect in the US, who has decided to campaign against homosexuality:\n \n America's Debate over Homosexuality: Are Christians On the Wrong Side of History?\n \n Every other word by Mohler and his callers is hurtful to gay people. They really resent our existence, and condemn us for being who we are. They think we are sinful when we become who we were made to be. Mohler, BTW, is one of those Christians who thinks genetic engineering of people is terrible, except if it were done to prevent homosexuality.\n \n The very title of that webpage is obnoxious, as it assumes that all \"real\" Christians must be homophobes, according to scripture.\n \n \nYou give me one example and call it a lot? I speak of millions.\n\n \n Millions more don't think Tutu is a \"real\" Christian. Besides, when I say, \"Many are a decent lot...\" I do not necessarily mean a lot are decent. I mean many are a decent lot. A \"lot\" is a portion, number or subset.\n \n \nWhether calling themselves Christians or not, to love thy fellow man is not a poisonous thing to do.\n\n \n It all depends on how that love is expressed. With respect to gays, it needs to be expressed as acceptance, not rejection and hatred.\n \n \nI believe the root of the divisiveness perceived to be caused by religion could be more accurately attached directly to human nature. I would be surprised to find that more than a few people do not think that all others should think like they do. We all think we are right.\n \n It is when one religion represses another that religious conflict is sparked. It generates radical, chest pounding heroes claiming to be servants of God. It is when one religion wishes death upon others that the radicalism has gone too far.\n\n \n It is the nature of Christian religion to suppress all other religions. Remember the commandments? The one about having no false gods before me, whichever one it was? This makes Christianity fairly divisive. Perhaps there are forms of religion less toxic than Judaism, Christianity and Islam in terms of their essential divisiveness. However, all religion has the potential to be divisive, because it is religiously adhered to, and appeals to some of humanity's baser instincts.\n \n \nI am not sure what you are trying to grow.

If it is a defining issue, it is more because of outside opponents of Christians than Christians themselves in general. I've never once heard a sermon on the subject of gay relations being sinful, and I've been in a lot of churches, some of them fundamentalist. In the grand scheme of things, other matters are talked about far more in Christian circles. For instance, one of the things I've heard levied against Christians as criticism is that they oppose gays marrying more than they do divorce, but this is just not true--I've heard WAAAAY teaching and preaching against divorce than gays getting married. Certainly the issue of gays marrying has been divisive in some places (such as the Anglican church example), but the many people for which it seems to be defining are those who are already out to see something bad in the religion. Again, as in many cases, this all goes back to the fact that Christians are not a monolithic group of one mindset; they do not sign anything; there is no governing body for all Christians, and there is little that can ever be said about the whole religion that is all-inclusive.

But it takes us dissenting heretics to make the bridge building possible, because we illuminate the gulfs that exist and need to be bridged.\n \n In the end, religious people will, as always, be in our debt, though they will never acknowledge it.",

   "If this is true, it is unfortunate because it is based on a wrong perception, for the most part, IMO. As someone who has been involved in Christianity for a very long time, my experience is that most Christians, including most pastors, don't really address the issue that much at all. If it is a defining issue, it is more because of outside opponents of Christians than Christians themselves in general. I've never once heard a sermon on the subject of gay relations being sinful, and I've been in a lot of churches, some of them fundamentalist. In the grand scheme of things, other matters are talked about far more in Christian circles. For instance, one of the things I've heard levied against Christians as criticism is that they oppose gays marrying more than they do divorce, but this is just not true--I've heard WAAAAY teaching and preaching against divorce than gays getting married. Certainly the issue of gays marrying has been divisive in some places (such as the Anglican church example), but the many people for which it seems to be defining are those who are already out to see something bad in the religion. Again, as in many cases, this all goes back to the fact that Christians are not a monolithic group of one mindset; they do not sign anything; there is no governing body for all Christians, and there is little that can ever be said about the whole religion that is all-inclusive. I think, honestly, that gay pride proponents probably spend a lot more time thinking about the negative things from the religion and the Bible over this than do most Christians themselves. \n \n Part of the problem is the ol' catch-22 that those who say insipid things tend to make the news more, and as a result the relatively few Christian leaders who are truly on a mission against gays are in the news more than the scores who aren't, and it plays right into the hands of those who are looking for something over which to berate religion already. And people on the fence who aren't willing to delve deeper for a more accurate look may sometimes get their perceptions colored about the whole religion because of a relatively few leaders who happen to be in the spotlight.\n \n I think over time, this issue will stabilize. I think it will play out a lot like the prohibition/temperance movement of the 20th century. Anti-gay Christians will, I think, eventually limit their objections to a more 'non-policy-related' arena that only focuses on the moralistic issue. From my perspective, it never was as much a pet issue in Christianity that critics think it is (or portray it as), and it will become even less so over time. FWIW, Christianity is hardly in any danger whatsoever from this perception out there. It has thrived under other less-than-accurate social perceptions about it in the past. It's not going to go away; religion is a fact of life in our society. Gay rights will come more quickly by people trying to build bridges to religion, rather than opposing it and just wishing it would go away. (For instance, helping religious people see that gays aren't bad people, for instance.)\n\n \n This is an interesting post. I think it's true that most Christians probably pay little or no attention to the issues surrounding the acceptance of gay people or the rights of gay people.....until the radical right-wing groups put anti-gay equality measures on the ballot, and people are called to vote on them! If gay people are paying attention to the anti-gay ideology of some church leaders, it's because we have had no choice. We have had to fight political battles just to keep from going backwards. Anti-gay activists have been politically active in trying to guarantee that we will never have equal rights under the law. This has happened mostly at the state level. The movement to amend the U.S. constitution has failed so far and will probably continue to fail, but the anti-gay activists did succeed in getting a whole bunch of anti-gay measures passed in the states. If we gay folks focus on this, there is good reason, as there is an active movement to drive us back into the closet and to ensure that we don't ever have equal rights under the law. \n \n As for working with people of faith to change attitudes in the churches, there are many gay people doing that now. They may not be posting in this forum in great numbers, but they are in the Christian churches working for change. And of course there is Soulforce, that model of non-violent activism, and the committed and brave young people who took part in the Equality Rides last spring. \n \n I was raised Lutheran. Today I read in the New York Times that a woman minister of a Lutheran congregation in the Bronx may face defrocking because she told folks honestly that she is a lesbian in a relationship, and she and her spouse have a daughter. Her congregation has been supportive of her, because they know and love her. The wider church body may take action against her.",

   "Well, whatever negatives about the Anglican church, and they only apply to parts of it, especially to the African communion, they aren't as singlemindedly homophobic as the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n \n It's a bit broadbrush to blame all African Anglican churches for homophobia in the Anglican communion. Few have been more progressive than South Africans like Desmond Tutu, and there are more than enough homophobes, mores the pity, in the church of england and ECUSA. In any case, I don't have a problem with people disagreeing about whether homosexuality is a sin or not, what bothers me is the obsession with this issue to the detriment of far more serious issues of poverty and injustice about which the church should be concerned. Where is the push from American churches to guarantee healthcare for everyone? Where is the pressure from American churches for US drug companies to lower their prices, particularly on HIV/AIDS medication?",

Now that would be a grand thing (if you have the money). http://www.seashorepoint.org/\n \n We spent the last week in Provincetown. From our condo deck we look out at Provincetown Harbor where the Pilgrims anchored in Dec. of 1620. It was warm enough on Thanksgiving Day to take a walk along the beach.",

Few have been more progressive than South Africans like Desmond Tutu, and there are more than enough homophobes, mores the pity, in the church of england and ECUSA.\n\n \n Oh, no quibble about that. Still, South Africa is very much in the minority, and not even all of the South African Anglicans would agree with Tutu on homosexuality.\n \n \nIn any case, I don't have a problem with people disagreeing about whether homosexuality is a sin or not,\n\n \n Well, I can respect disagreement, but I do have a problem with it on this issue, in that I think it's very wrong. It's not that I think people haven't a right to disagree with me, heaven forfend, but I think that this issue is as serious as racism or religious bigotry, which I also have grave, ethical reservations about. \n \n It's not merely \"tolerance\" I am after -- that is the minimal, non-negotiable position of compromise. It's moral acceptance I'm looking for. I realise that there will be many I cannot get it from, but from my perspective, I have major ethical problems with their attitudes. \n \n \nwhat bothers me is the obsession with this issue to the detriment of far more serious issues of poverty and injustice about which the church should be concerned. Where is the push from American churches to guarantee healthcare for everyone? Where is the pressure from American churches for US drug companies to lower their prices, particularly on HIV/AIDS medication?\n\n \n From what I've read of Tutu, he is at least concerned by what the homosexuality issue is smothering as by its own injustice. It does distract attention from more -- I almost said important issues, but I think more general is the more apt adjective. There is no point in expending resources and energy promoting injustice to gay people, when one could be fighting it on other fronts.",

Religion poisons everything.\n\n \n Ironic that you would say that after being given an example of someone it didn't poison: the Lutheran minister who apparently sees no conflict between being gay and her faith. As well as the Soulforce examples. Nor did it poison Desmund Tutu, as Lesz used in example earlier. You need to stop generalising, and I will continue to point out examples where your all-encompassing statements are quite simply wrong, when you do so.",
