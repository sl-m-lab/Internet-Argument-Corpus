It should be pointed out that Bush-the-Younger did not veto the proposed legislation either. Then again I can see the necessity of Bush's Gestapo, for it appears to me his entire foreign policy is premised upon inciting every terrorist in the world, encouraging every small nation to develop WMD to protect itself from relentless American bombing, and to make sure above all else such individuals can freely enter the United States with a VISA. Walk right in! Enjoy your stay Mohammed Atta! emoticon_rolleyes",

   "What adminstration started visa express? Anyone know? \n\n \n I do not define the context of debate as between \"Democrats\" and \"Republicans.\"\n \n \nThe INS does a horrible job. \n\n \n Yes there are millions of undocumented illegal aliens running amok in the United States at this very moment, thousands of whom are illegal aliens from Iraq. No one knows just who these individuals are, certainly not the Bush Administration. We are now in the year 2003, the third year of the Bush Presidency. Bush's handling of our borders has been nothing less than an absolute unmitigated disaster.\n \n \nDon't blame Bush for that...\n\n \n Oh here we go again, don't blame Bush-the-Younger, it has to be Clinton's fault who ceased to be President years ago! \n \n \nhe was president for a year. \n\n \n A year that turned out to be an absolute total failure.\n \n \nClinton didn't meet with his CIA director until around 6 months after the first WTC attack.\n\n \n What relevence does this have on the utter failure of the Bush Administration to control our borders, going on three years into the Bush Presidency? Bill Clinton is no longer President of the United States. George W. Bush is President of the United States. He has proven himself to be utterly unconcerned about the presence of MILLIONS of undocumented alien foreigners roaming about the United States? Why should anyone take Bush's foreign policy seriously when he shows such a cavalier attitude regarding the defense of his own country? Why should we give tbe Bush Administration billions of dollars to fight a war on Iraq, when the Bush administration continues to this very day to allow potential terrorists from that country to immigrate to the United States, right here in our own backyard?",
