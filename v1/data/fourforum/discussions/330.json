   "Here is something I think you may find of interest. \n \n Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand.\n Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this.\n \n The first four men -- the poorest -- would pay nothing;\n The fifth would pay $1:\n The sixth would pay $3;\n The seventh $7;\n The eighth $12;\n The ninth $18.\n The tenth man -- the richest -- would pay $59.\n \n That's what they decided to do.\n The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement -- until one day, the owner threw them a curve. \"Since you are all such good customers,\" he said, \"I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20.\"\n \n So now dinner for the ten only cost $80.\n \n The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six -- the paying customers? How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his \"fair share?\"\n \n The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would end up being *paid* to eat their meal.\n \n So the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay. And so the fifth man paid nothing, the sixth pitched in $2, the seventh paid $5, the eighth paid $9, the ninth paid $12, leaving the tenth man with a bill of $52 instead of his earlier $59. \n Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free.\n \n But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. \"I only got a dollar out of the $20,\" declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth. \"But he got $7!\" \"Yeah, that's right,\" exclaimed the fifth man. \"I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got seven times more than me!\" \"That's true!\" shouted the seventh man.\n \n \"Why should he get $7 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!\" \"Wait a minute,\" yelled the first four men in unison. \"We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!\"\n \n The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They were $52 short!\n \n And that, boys and girls, journalists and college instructors, is how the tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up at the table anymore.",

Just by creating a story involving money and using the same percentages doesn't make it a legitimate comparison. going out to dinner is a voluntary act.

   "OK here's the problem:\n Assuming that Limbaugh's figures are accurate (and I'm not sure I believe them) there are two key figures: the 96% taxes payed by top 50%, AND the 87% income earned figure by the top 50%. So basically, because they are making the vast majority of the money, they are paying the vast majority of the taxes. In words you can understand:\n lets say in the entire US, the total money earned is $100. The top 50% earn $87 of that amount, while the bottom half earn $13. Personally, I think that's unjust, but moving on. Under the current system, because they get the majority of the income, they pay the majority of the taxes, at a rate slightly higher than the amount they make. You say that's unfair b/c 50% of the people are paying 96% of the taxes (ignoring that they get 87% of the money). But let's say everyone pays the same amount. Specifically, let's say everyone pays one dollar, and lets say their are 10 people in this hypothetical world. The bottom 50% (5 people) combined earn $13 and pay $5 in taxes. They pay at a 38.5% rate. The top 50% earn $87 and also pay $5 in taxes, thus achieving your goal of having the same percentages of tax payers pay equal amounts in taxes. But they are paying at only a 5.75% rate. The impact is twofold: first, the tax system is regressive, and poorer people pay a GREATER percentage of their income than the rich. Second, because of the law of diminishing returns, the individual dollars they are losing hurt even more than the rich. Another analogy, if I make 1,000,000 and lose 50%, I have $500,000. I am still ok, not being \"taxed to death.\" If I make 10,000, and lose 50%, I have 5,000 left. That stings. Bigtime.\n Furthermore, Limbaugh (and you for that matter) don't address the taxes that DO fall disproportiantely on the poor, sales and payroll taxes.\n \n \nSo what if they make more money? You say that as if they are evil. They earned it! They worked their little buns off to make a decent living, so what is wrong with being rich? The top 10% of people in America are the ones who keep our economy running smoothly. Think about this: when they have more money, they can employ more people and pay their employees more! So why are we taxing them to death?\n \n \n I don't say like they are evil. I say it like b/c they make more money, they have more responsibilty. Plus, your analysis of how the rich help the economy is flawed on two counts. First, rich individuals don't hire anyone. Corporations do. They may be owned by rich folks, but their pools of income are entirely seperate. Unless you are advocating growing the economy by growing the demand for in-home personal servants, giving the rich more money (as opposed to companies more money) by cutting personal income taxes is meaningless. Second, giving the rich money as oppose to the poor is actually harmful to the economy, b/c a) the poor, having less money, are more likely to spend the money immediately, pumping it direclty back into the economy. b) new money going to the rich is more likely to be saved, which helps no one c) when the rich spend money, its more likely to be overseas luxury goods, meaning the money flees the country. This is why the one tax cut I DO support is the EITC, and that's because it puts money into the hands of the poor not the rich.\n \n You then attack me as socialist b/c I say capitalism slants towards the rich. Correction: I believe that a capitalist free market model must be maintained. But I believe that it must be tempered by socialist intervention. A mixed economy if you will. Other than attacking the idea as socialist, you give no refutation to my claim that capitalism slants to rich. Refute it if you will, because I maintain that given two men of equal skills and intellect, but greately disparate income, the richer man will meet with more success in the capitalist model.\n \n Finally, you claim we are \"taxing the rich to death.\" Right now, we are taxing the upper bracket at 33%. If they make 600,000, that means they still have 400,000 left. Imagine my pity, THEY JUST CAN'T LIVE! And that's assuming, of course, they get no tax breaks at all (HA!). The poor, by contrast, might pay no INCOME (as opposed to sales/payroll) taxes, but they are still making $10,000. I maintain they still are at the disadvantage.",

   "I'm really tired of quoting people so I'm just going to comment on what you said. (If I miss anything, let me know.)\n \n First of all, Limbaugh's figures are accurate. He has the excel link to the figures, but I didn't give it to you because I assumed that you didn't have excel. If you do, my apologies. You can go to his website, scroll down to the bottom and click on the link to get the \"accurate\" figures.\n \n Secondly, if everyone was taxed at the same rate, wouldn't that encourage people to make more money? The current system (along with welfare and minimum wage--< but we won't go there:)) is ruining our economy. Those who are \"poor\" are encouraged to stay poor because they are taxed so little. (Let's make one thing clear--< I am not fighting for more taxes for the poor, I am fighting for less taxes for the rich.)\n \n Thirdly, let me re-define the word \"rich\". What I mean by rich is business owners who have worked hard to get to where they are now. (Sorry for the mixup.) They do employ many people, so more taxes for them means less jobs for us.\n \n Last but not least, I did not attack you as socialist. Your post proves that you do, however, subscribe to many of the ideals of socialism. \"The top 50% earn $87 of that amount, while the bottom half earn $13.

Why? Here is a hypothetical circumstance:\n \n My good friend Bob and I both get a masters degree in engineering. I go to work at McDonalds while he goes to work at some huge corporation. I earn a very small income and he earns millions as he climbs up the \"corporate ladder\". We are both educated, we just chose different jobs. What's wrong with that? I could have become a millionaire as well, but I chose not to.\n \n America is a society where anyone with the courage and perserverance can go \"from rags to riches\".

The current system (along with welfare and minimum wage--< but we won't go there) is ruining our economy. Those who are \"poor\" are encouraged to stay poor because they are taxed so little.\n \n \n Why I am eeriely reminded of the Wall St. Journal's \"Lucky Ducky\" comment? If I make $10,000 dollars, my lack of taxation isn't letting me live on easy st. Welfare isn't getting me out of poverty. I still want to live at the point where I am getting taxed. That means I've made it. Even if your $10,000 is tax free, its still 10,000 Dollars! That ain't alot of money, taxed or no. If they are not motivated, it isn't because they have TOO MUCH money.\n \n OK, while not every rich person is a business owner, even if I accept that definition, your logic is flawed. Let's take Bill Gates as an example, and say he has $50 billion dollars. That 50 bil is entirely seperate from microsofts accounts. They can't touch it. They don't see a dime of it. It has no effect on them whatsoever. Its a seperate pool. If the objective is to get businesses more money, then do something with business. Personal income taxes virtually never get into the corperate pool directly. The way they get their is when they are spent, and you never refuted my point that the poor are more likely to spend their money than the rich.\n \n You say that asking for some semblance of income equality (or rather, not such drastic income inequality) is socialist. Maybe, maybe not. That has no effect on whether it is just or not. You through that word around like it ends the argument by default. However, I will be the first to say that some socialist ideals are necessary for capitalism to work justly. That's a mixed economy, and as the soviet union can tell you from the left and the great depression can tell you from the right, neither extreme works without help from the other.\n \n Then you say that it is ok for two people with equal skill levels/intellects to have unequal oppurtunity, b/c its ok for people to make less than others. I agree its ok, but I don't think you adequatly show how the poorer person has the equal oppurtunity to make as much as the rich man IF HE DESIRES TO. Other than asserting \"its called equal oppurtunity,\" you don't show me where the oppurtunity exists. Therefore, the point falls, and my point still stands. UNTIL YOU SHOW ME that two people of equal skill, intellect, and motivation have a fair chance of acheiving similar results inspite of income inequalities, I'll concede that we don't need to check capitalism. The problem with your \"bob\" analogy is that the poorer man CAN'T AFFORD college in the first place. He's growing up in Cabrini-Green, in atrocious public schools, and might get shot as a teen. Even if he gets good grades in school, college still might be out of the question. He doesn't have equal oppurtunity, because he has to work 5x as hard as the rich guy to get to the same level. That is the problem that needs to be solved in capitalism.\n \n You say that 50% paying 96% of the taxes is unequal. Funny, you don't seem to have a problem with 50% making 87% of the money. Equality goes one way huh? You justify this by saying that how much money you make is a concious choice, devoid of any outside influence other than work. HAHAHAHAHA! Excuse me while I laugh. Ok, I'm done. Now I'll wait for a warrent on that unfounded and unsubstantiated assertion.\n \n And do I believe b/c someone CAN pay more, they SHOULD pay more? Well, yes.

   "I never said that. What I said is that they can live comfortably off of a small income and barely pay any taxes on it. Therefore, they don't see the need to make more.\n \n \n Comfortable? 10,000, taxed or no, is still not comfortable. Cabrini-Green isn't comfortable. Harlem isn't comfortable. East LA isn't comfortable. I hardly think that their lack of taxation makes them \"comfortable.\"\n \n \nNow that is not true. Even if it is separate from the Microsoft account, whatever affects Bill Gates will affect his company. If he is making less money, do you think he is going to hire more peole?\n \n \n Sure why not? The money spent by microsoft hiring people doesn't come out of Bill Gates pockets. It comes out of microsoft's pockets. You still seem to think that the money is intertwined, but as a former investment columnist (and current investor in Microsoft) I can assure you it isn't.\n \n \nHave you seen the houses they buy? The cars they buy? The clothes they buy? The jewelry they buy? The servants they hire? The stocks they buy? They pump more money back into the economy than poor people ever will. You just don't \"see it\" happen.\n \n \n Ok, let's examine those product by product.\n 1) Houses. Yep, stimulates the economy. But then again, if they are rich, odds are, they already have a house. Sure they might get another, but at that point we are going far beyond the top 1% here. The amount of people who have enough to buy extra houses in a recession is so small I hardly think it outweighs that being spent by the poor, who spend all their money because otherwise they starve.\n 2) Cars: Most likely imported. Net effect: money leaves the United States, harms economy.\n 3) Clothing: Relatively small expedienture, but Italian suits are...well, Italian. Again, capital flight is a BAD thing.\n 4) Jewelery: Again, likely to be imported. money leaves country.\n 5) Servants: Helpful for sure. But again, in an economic downturn, even with some extra cash, why would they be hiring? as you said yourself, Gates would be a bit iffy on hiring in the current economic environment.\n Bottom line: all these items are luxury goods the rich already possess. Money directed at them is most likely a) going to be saved, b/c they already possess these 5 products b) going to be spent on products that are imported, hence causing capital flight and a net negative impact on the economy. Furthermore, your analysis falters when it asserts that the rich spend more than the poor do. Again, some analysis into that shows its ludicrousness (ludicriousity? nevermind, u know what i mean). Let's assume 99 poor people for every rich person. Let's assume that each of those poor people subsists on 20 bucks a day, for food, water, transport etc. Add on $300 perperson in misc. monthly expenses. That totals up to almost $90,000 spent per month. One rich person, assuming $100 a day, and $5000 misc. monthly expenses, means they spend $8000. Even if I tally in a $50,000 sports car, it still falls quite a bit short, and THATS assuming that the rich will buy one sports car a month in a recession, hardly reasonable. Hence, poor help more AKA the Law of Diminishing Returns AKA the Utility Theory. Economists agree that economies move from the bottom up.\n \n \nYou sound like are saying that everybody should have an equal (or close to equal) income whether or not they EARNED IT. I'm saying that if you don't work your behind off to earn your money then you don't deserve it.\n \n \n And you aren't proving the rich HAVE earned it. I think a teacher on a $35,000 salary has \"earned\" as much as $1,000,000 Ken Lay style CEO, if not more, but it isn't reflected in the money they make.\n \n \nMy point was that it is what you CHOSE TO DO in life that makes you who you are. Not your income level. Did I specify what type of income bob had? No. Let's say (as you pointed out) that he came from some dumpy neighborhood and barely made enough to live off of. If he worked hard in highschool and got good grades he would be elligable for thousands of scholarships, loans, etc. He could even go to college on a full scholarship which would cost him NOTHING. But he would have to WORK FOR IT, and work hard. Socialism causes laziness. Some people would work hard at their \"jobs\" and others wouldn't because the government would be spoonfeeding them anyway.\n \n \n OK, maybe Bob could do all that (assuming he wasn't shot, or otherwise killed, or abandoned, or went to schools so poor that no college would take him regardless of his scores, or couldn't afford the study materials necessary, or had to drop out to work to feed his family...). But even still, a rich person could go to college, get the jobs, with half the effort. If you want effort to dictate success, that's fine, I agree wholeheartedly. But what needs to occur is that equal effort yields equal results, regardless of starting income.\n \n \nThe rich earned their money. They worked hard to be where they are at now. Poor people could make as much money as rich people if they wanted to. Unlike socialist countries which force everybody to have the same income, America allows people to become rich if they are willing to work hard enough. You have not refuted my point that many people have gone from \"rags to riches\". How do you account for these people?\n \n \n I account for them, b/c I acknowledge the possibilty that the poor can become rich. I have to, its there. My problem is that regardless of whether they CAN succeed, they dont have equal oppurtunity to do so. It shouldn't be that only prodigies and super-genius can escape from the ghetto. we have to make it so that everyone gets equal oppurtunity (if not results) and that barriers that inhibit progress inspite of effort (poor schools etc.) get removed.",

It&#8217;s not that the rich should pay most of the taxes, although they do reap more benefits from the government, it&#8217;s that they are the only ones that can afford to pay what the government spends.\n \n Wealth is not a function of how hard you work.

The hardest working people I know are the two Hispanics who take care of my yard.

Yet they can still afford closets full of clothes, a lot of traveling, really good schooling, cars, and nice neighbohood houses - yes housES, plural... etc.)\n \n \n And in response to Calligirl's post a while ago. I'm sorry, but I do have to chuckle at that. People cannot choose how much they make. I'm not sure how you arrived at that conclusion, and I'd kind of like to know. I don't know how much you make, but I'm struggling to pull in $7/hr. (my mom's fighting to pull in $10/hr) Then again I'm 18 and living in a small town. Oh yeah, and I work HARD..... and unfortuantley today, education has something to do with it. Your's was a bit if a biased statement if you don't mind me saying so.\n If people could choose how much they made we wouldn't have poor people.\n \n \n Also, you're missing one major factor: prestige. And if you disagree, I'll argue. If your family deveolpes a 'rich' reputation, you're more likely to get hired into a well paying job. If you grew up in a poor family, companies know that you'll settle for less, and hire you for less. \n America (although nice) is NOT equal. From your comments, I'm going to assume that you come from a well-to-do family. Congrats, then, if that's the case, your's is one of the few. \n \n \n \n My point was that it is what you CHOSE TO DO in life that makes you who you are. Not your income level. Did I specify what type of income bob had? No. Let's say (as you pointed out) that he came from some dumpy neighborhood and barely made enough to live off of. If he worked hard in highschool and got good grades he would be elligable for thousands of scholarships, loans, etc. He could even go to college on a full scholarship which would cost him NOTHING. But he would have to WORK FOR IT, and work hard. Socialism causes laziness. Some people would work hard at their \"jobs\" and others wouldn't because the government would be spoonfeeding them anyway.\n \n What about the hard worker that doesn't get good grades?\n We wouldn't have many janitors, and garabage truck loaders - if the choice was up to them. Despite what they say, you cannot simply do anything you set your mind to. The stories you hear are of people who have SUCCESSFULLY done it. Many strong willed people go out there to grab the 'bull by the horns' .......and get skewered.\n\\\n \n Wit: You make some good observations. The only problem I have with it is that redistribution of wealth is part of the definition of communism. It is not something I subscribe to. I do admit that our form of government engages in what would be called social control and it is mostly against the poor. However, that would be true of all governments. It is one of the primary purposes of government. While the US does not have true equal opportunity, it is likely better than any other place on the planet. After all our immigration problem is not that people are trying to leave.\n \n It does take hard work to get anywhere. I do think there are a multitude of opportunities. Not everyone gets them. But with financial aid, anyone can get a student loan and go to college. Of course you'll be paying 300 a month for 15 years to repay it, but you will more likely have a job that can afford it.",

   "If you increase taxes, yes, you will make people less willing to work, because take-home wages would be less if incomes were taxed more. So indeed, from that consideration alone companies might be expected to raise salaries if all else were equal. But not all else is equal. If you increase taxes, people have less money to spend on goods and services, so aggregate demand decreases, which should cause companies to cut back on production and hire fewer workers at lower salaries because of increased competition for what little demand there is. This latter phenomenon would appear to more-or-less counteract the preceding phenomenon. If so, you must conclude that increasing taxes is deflationary because deficits cause the government to have to print more money or to sell bonds at a higher interest rate, behaviors that in themselves are obviously inflationary in the short and long run respectively. In the short run, the government which decreases taxes can stave off inflation by selling an overabundance of bonds to take in cash from the economy, but of course that tends to cause inflation or higher taxes later as a result of the bonds and the interest on the bonds having to be repaid.",

They run the company. The engineer wouldn't even have his job without the executive. Crunching numbers and making big decisions isn't as easy as people like to believe.\n \n\n \n True, to an individual company an executive is quite important--more important than the engineers, perhaps. The success of an organization comes from the top down. But the importance of an executive to a company is different from the importance of an executive to society as a whole. Executive skills are more commonplace than engineering skills, and executive failures are often mere failures to compete determinedly that are not of much consequence to society as a whole. If an executive fails, the people under him can usually go elsewhere as the company loses money or goes bankrupt.\n \n Let me use a football analogy to make my point. Clearly if football players were more unskilled than they are, the quality of play would suffer in proportion. Football players are the most important people in determining how well football as a whole is played. But suppose now that general managers (who draft players, sign free agents, etc.) were less skilled than they are. General managing is not rocket science. Some of the substitutes and marginal starters would be different, but since it is so obvious to even casual fans who the really talented players are in the college and pro ranks, the important players playing professional football would be pretty much the same, and so the quality of the football played would be pretty much the same as well. Yes, having a good general manager can make all the difference in the world to a team's success, but the quality of general managers in the aggregate is not important to how well professional football as a whole is played--it's the quality of the players that more determines that. And if a team's general manager is unusually poor, the upshot of that will not be that the superstars he underappreciated won't play football, but just that they will play for another team--so the quality of football as a whole won't suffer much.\n \n I guess someone will argue that the quality of coaching in the aggregate is more important than the quality of general managing. But then coaches must have full acquaintance with the technical details that their players must understand to perform well. So a coach is more like a chief engineer or a teacher than a high level manager. I doubt whether most managers are like Bill Gates in having much technical understanding of what their employees are doing. Though I'm no expert, my impression is that most of them probably have more studied business administration than science or engineering.\n \n I do think that executives, who tend to make the most money, are not as important to society as scientists, engineers, teachers, etc., who get paid less. Certainly the former are overpaid on the whole. Thus, taxing more the highest incomes makes income distributions more fair.",

But that's another thread.\n\n \n I made no attack on socialism, just defined it. Socialism is an economic system with government owning some things. it also basis much of its economy on the idea that the wealthy have a right to be wealthy but they must pay for those who are not. Communism is no one has a right to be wealthy and takes the money and completely redistributes it to all to make it even. They are economic systems, not social systems at their core.\n \n The quote you provide from Jesus is out of context. Jesus is not against wealth. The story is that a rich man came to him and said lord, I keep the law and do all that I am supposed to do. What do I need to do to be saved. Jesus said, sell all that you have and come follow me. The rich man went away sad for he had much. Jesus then said it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter into the kingdom of heaven. \n \n His teaching was on the fact that the rich man felt that his wealth was more important than God. Jesus did not say money is the root of all evil. He said the LOVE of money is the root of all evil. The issue is not that money is a bad thing but what priority we place on it. \n \n None of that, however, has diddly to do with whether the poor should receive bigger tax breaks. The point being that the rich get more money back because they put more in. It is not unfair. We are speaking of what a government should do not what an individual should do.",

The poor would get no taxes back as they paid no taxes. Otherwise, what one has is socialism which is a redistribution of wealth.\n\n \n Yeah, I've heard that too. We were talking about the death tax in my sociology class one day. There used to be a limit on how much one can inherit without being taxed. Rich people claimed that this tax was hurting the farmers, and they wanted there to be no limit on the number of $$ one could inherit. Actually, most farms were worth less than the previous limit, so removing the limit really did nothing to help the farmers... it just helped the rich. At least that's what I was told, but I have heard similar stories. The problem is, politicians say all of these things without showing facts. So much for the people having a say.\n \n People are also arguing that redistribution of wealth is communism. Then again, everyone has a different definition of communism. I think some redistribution is necessary to keep things in check, otherwise pretty soon the rich would own everything (kind of do already) and would that really be a democracy?

My intent was to talk about the people that owned Wal-Mart, not Wal-Mart the company. And yes I screwed up the math also.\n \n Income taxes are on profits. As a result, they cannot exceed the cost of a product as long as the manufacture is making a profit. It just reduces the amount of profit. Not that that is not important, just pointing it out. Crude oil is a component of a product. Some of the cost can be absorbed if necessary to maintain market share, but at some point a rise in crude oil will wipe out all the profit so the price must be raised at some point. That is different from everyone raising prices to maintain profits.\n \n Now all that being said, I&#8217;m in favor of tax cuts in general. But not when the government is in debt as that is not a tax cut, but a tax deferment. At some point it must be repaid and it falls on our children. That I am opposed to.",

   "The quote you provide from Jesus is out of context. Jesus is not against wealth. The story is that a rich man came to him and said lord, I keep the law and do all that I am supposed to do. What do I need to do to be saved. Jesus said, sell all that you have and come follow me. The rich man went away sad for he had much. Jesus then said it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter into the kingdom of heaven. \n \n His teaching was on the fact that the rich man felt that his wealth was more important than God. Jesus did not say money is the root of all evil. He said the LOVE of money is the root of all evil. The issue is not that money is a bad thing but what priority we place on it. \n\n \n I&#8217;m not sure you can make a case that Jesus was against wealth, but I think you could make a strong case that Jesus taught that wealth interfered with your relationship with God and him. There are several verses in the Bible that could be used for that argument. Beginning with Luke 12:33.\n \n \nNone of that, however, has diddly to do with whether the poor should receive bigger tax breaks. The point being that the rich get more money back because they put more in. It is not unfair. We are speaking of what a government should do not what an individual should do.\n\n \n The rich also receive more benefits from government than the poor. But I don&#8217;t believe that is the point either. I think the point is that we are giving tax breaks when we are in debt. That creates huge deficits that must be paid in the future.",

   "Yeah, I've heard that too. We were talking about the death tax in my sociology class one day. There used to be a limit on how much one can inherit without being taxed. Rich people claimed that this tax was hurting the farmers, and they wanted there to be no limit on the number of $$ one could inherit. Actually, most farms were worth less than the previous limit, so removing the limit really did nothing to help the farmers... it just helped the rich. At least that's what I was told, but I have heard similar stories. The problem is, politicians say all of these things without showing facts. So much for the people having a say.\n \n People are also arguing that redistribution of wealth is communism. Then again, everyone has a different definition of communism. I think some redistribution is necessary to keep things in check, otherwise pretty soon the rich would own everything (kind of do already) and would that really be a democracy? They may not be elected 'leaders' but they would sure have sway.... Where's the line?\n\n \n Wit:\n \n You seem to be mixing electoral systems with economic systems. There is a definition for communism. It is an economic system. In it there is a \"beneveloent dictatorship\" that takes all of the money from everyone and redistributes equally to everyone based on simple egalitarianism not on merit. At least in theory. The problem is that absolute power corrupts absolutely so there is no such thing as a \"benevolent dictatorship.\"\n \n Democracy is a one person one vote thing. This doesn't work that well either unless you are a completely undivided nation. The US is not. That is why it is a republic. This prevents \"favorite sons\" from getting elected in just the Largest states. California and NY would have all the presidents, perhaps texas.\n \n Capitalism is the US economic system. There are some socialism structures (welfare and the like), but they were not intended to be a redistribution of wealth. They were intended to help in a post traumatic experience. \n \n As far as taxes go, sure the rich should carry more burden. They do. They should also receive more breaks when breaks come.\n \n Hank:\n \n I don't think wealth was the issue. Reread my post. The point I am making is that the \"LOVE OF MONEY\" is the problem. Some people are given more money by God simply because God wants them to give it away. There are several people of whom this is true. It is those that love money more than God that interefere with their relationship. Not the money itself.",

The key to Christ's teachings is that of choice. To have the government redistribute is a matter of removing choice from the individual. That is exactly what Jesus died for. So that people could choose. \n \n Now we are moving from a tax discussion to a theological discussion. I do not wish to engage in that on this thread. The answer I have given should suffice. \n \n Simply put Jesus never taught that money was evil, only the love of money, and that he wants people to give from a cheerful heart not out of obligation.

   "I did not just tell you that you incorrectly interpreted. I also told you the correct interpretation and the context. If Jesus had wanted to say that the way to follow him was to sell everything he would have said and the bible as a whole would have said The way to salvation is to go and sell everything you have. Instead, Paul says, \"by grace you have been saved, through faith, and that is not of yourselves but is a gift from God so that no man may boast.\" In the remaining context (the chapter and verses 13 to the end in particular) Luke is saying just what I said he is saying. That the LOVE of Money (not money itself) is the root of all evil. Read it.\n\n \n Is there some reason you think I haven't already read it? I did read it. It just doesn't change what Jesus said. I'll repeat myself and say again that I never said anything about salvation. I said that Jesus commanded his disciples to sell what they had and they did. There is nothing in the Bible that teaches that Jesus did not command his disciples to sell what they had. If there is, I'm sure you could point it out to me. And if Jesus didn't command them to, why did they?\n \n Even though I look at the teachings of Jesus, and not Paul as I don't think there is any comparison between the two, I understand that Christians believe everything in the Bible has equal weight. However James tells a different story than Paul about salvation. Not that I personally equate what James said to what Jesus said, but James is a part of the Bible also. James 2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?\n \n In fact that whole section of James is talking about how faith does not save someone.

   "Nick,\n You have a better ideas and more knowledge than the poster who is going for a Master's in Political Science. Florida and Texas have no icome tax. Florida does have some unintelligible definition of income as it is only a excerpt from the IRC. Most of the states which do have income tax piggy back on the federal definition of income tax (referring to 26 USC) making those definitions unconstitutional (those states are effectively trying to give up their constitutionally protected powers and thereby nullifying the definition of income).\n \n Just to set some things straight, the \"income tax\" is an excise tax. To read up on the definition of income as it applies to ALL income tax acts of the US Congress look up US Supreme Court case [USSC] 255 US 509 [just enter \"255 us 509\" into Internet Explorer's address bar].\n \n The federal withholding started as part of the victory tax during WWII-- under martial law, and was repealled after the war. Unfortunatelly the withholding continued under false pretenses. In the U.S.A we do not have a federal tax on domestically earned wages or salaries-- find the non existing law if you disagree (26 USC 1, 61, and 63 ain't it).\n \n George\n \n P.S. \"Social Security\" is nothing but a ponzi (pyramid) scheme and we have proof positive evidence that there is NO \"social security trust fund\", it all comes and goes out of the general fund. \n \n \n \nHaving read and scanned many of these posts on taxation, as a Brit I have found it rather depressing. There are so many Socialist assumptions in your postings that I have to conclude most of you guys have lost the plot. Income tax did not exist in the US till I believe the early part of the 20th century and America has been sliding inexorably towards Socialism, Communism ever since. Taxation is unconstitutional and un American and should be slowly phased out. \n \n Altruism appears to be the thread running through most of the postings: not individual discriminative altruism, but State organised, which by any objective standards has been nothing short of disastrous for your country. The moral degeneration and corruption of welfare recipients with successive generations dependant on handouts has been catastrophic socially and economically. How can you be so willfully blind to all of this?\n \n New Hampshire has no income tax I am told. That is a template for the rest of the Union. And how it was all over till the Socialists staged a coup without a shot being fired. Taxation is the tool of tyranny and it is kind of odd that a Brit has to remind you yanks of that don't you think?\n \n Nick \n \n Uk\n",

   "Well, we could look at taxes (and the implicit benefit thereof) as a product and then observe the marketplace.\n \n Yes, the more money you make, the more you experience diminishing return on your gross income due to taxes. Here are the Federal Income Tax Rates in Canada, for instance:\n First $35,595 : 16%\n $35,595 to $71,190 : 22%\n $71,190 to $115,739 : 26%\n < $115,739 : 29%\n \n That's income tax. Capital gains are about half as much.\n \n When you factor in Provincial tax, it ranges from 22% to 46%. (I live in Ontario, so that's the numbers for here.)\n \n So, for every dollar I make beyond $115k, I know I'm only going to make $0.54 after taxes. If I use that money to buy stuff, there's a federal sales tax of 8% and provincial sales tax of 7%, so my purchase power drops just below $0.47 on the dollar for those particular earnings. (Remember that the aggregate still ends up being lower, because it includes those lower rates for the lower income brackets.)\n \n If that was really too much tax, you'd think I'd not worry about making the extra money and spending it, wouldn't you? I mean, if it was 99% tax instad of 53%, I wouldn't really burn too much midnight oil past the $115k mark, would I? But, at 53%, I'm still quite interested in the difference between $115k and $200k.\n \n I recognize that I'm pretty lucky to be having that internal debate, before anyone calls me on that issue.\n \n Yes, I could make less money and pay less tax, but I choose not to. Most people make that same choice to the degree to which it's in their power to do so. This suggests that most people think the extra effort involved in those higher-taxed dollars is still a good deal.\n \n One reason for this is that the stuff you get to buy with your $0.47 post-tax dollars is generally WAY better than stuff you get to buy with your $1.00 tax-free dollars you get in the first $8k you earn every year. That first $8k buys your Kraft dinner, rent on your ###### basement apartment, toilet paper, etc. Sure, the 20th $8k buys you $4,240 in Government, whether you like it or not, but the remaining $3,760 gets you a rather decent weekend in Vegas, a dozen decadent dinners for two, a very nice bottle of wine or a 36-hour massage.\n \n If taxes on the rich were really too high, people in your top tax brackets would work less and take more time off, rather than grinding away at those half-eaten bucks. For the most part, they don't.\n \n Becasue, given the choice between $0.47 on the dollar and $0.00 on the dollar, they'd rather take the cash.\n \n And those are Canadian tax rates, yours might be lower.\n \n C",

   "Who pays the most is a bad question. Income tax rates are higher for the rich but they also tend to know the tax code more so they exploit it via 179 deductions or capital gains which are taxed at 15% normally. In fact, for awhile they had some people making over 100,000 paying no tax which is partly why they started the AMT (alternative minimum tax). Then you gotta look at ability to pay. Taxes are harder to swallow for the poor but not too bad for the rich. This might not be the case though for someone making 100,000 with 6 kids all in college. Then you gotta factor in other taxes such as personal property, social security etc. Social security is only taxed up to 97,000 (or something close to that).

Lower income earners, and the poor, are generally more apt to be involved with police for sure, the fire department I would presume as well. Just look around, look at the \"bad neighborhoods\", where are the police and fire departments spending most of their time and effort?\n \n Lower income earners are the majority of public transport users. That's purely funded by the taxpayer, and in the vast majority of cases, is a major money loser for the city/municipality. Also, taxes are collected on those cars, and on new developments, tax refunds are given to public transport users and taxes generally aren't collected, at least not to the same extent, on used vehicles.\n \n I guess they fly more, but if the average public isn't flying, they see no benefit from it.\n \n Yes and no. The poor person's vote has every bit as much power as the rich person's, however, there's no doubt that money can provide influence.\n \n I think I've pretty much deconstructed your case.

A person that makes 100000$/per is taxed at about 44%/yr fed and state combined. That is 44,000$/yr that still leaves them 66000$ per year. So who comes out the winner? Depends on how you look at it.

This is not really a flat tax rate. This is a progressive tax rate. If you make 31 000 dollars in a year, you`ll pay 300 dollars in tax. That would be an effective tax rate of roughly 1%. If you make 60 000 dollars per year, you would pay 9 000 dollars in tax. That would be an effective tax rate of roughly 15%. And to finish of my example, an income of 200 000 dollar per year would mean 51 000 dollars in taxes per year. That would be 25,5% of the yearly income. How can this be called a flat tax rate when it is really a progressive tax rate?\n \n Furthermore I would like to point out that a lower tax rate is not inherrant in a flat tax. In fact, a flat tax rate could raise just as much revenue (or more) as a progressive tax rate. To claim that a flat tax is about lowering the tax rate for anyone is a bit dishonest (not that you are dishonest, but I think you get my point :)), unless you are talking about a specific reform. At which case the actual reform is about lowering the tax rate and the flat tax is a component in that reform. The only thing that can be certain (or is inherrant) about a flat tax rate is that the relative tax rate between high income and low income is evened out. In most cases this will mean a relative lower tax for the rich and a relative higher tax for the poor even though it is theoreticly possible that the initiative is taken in regressive tax rate system, at which point the opposite effect would be the case.",

It then puts more of a burden on middle income families. combine that with a high initial start up cost and it is just a bad idea.
