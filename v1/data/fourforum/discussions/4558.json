   "Come on, you guys had to expect this.\n \n I got banned from a yahoo group a couple years ago fro suggesting that ANWR drilling was inevitable, and that we should open it immediatly, but with stringent regulation, since if we opened it as an emergency measure, there would be virtually no regulation.\n \n Guess what, now we have opened it, and there is virtually no regulation.\n \n Some realitiies of the ANWR drilling:\n \n 1. We have no diea how much is there. What has been approved is exploratory drilling to figure this out. There are not even good estimates as far as how much might be there at this point.\n \n 2. If we do find vast reserves, we could theoretically have them in use in under 6 months, not 10 years. The 10 year figure people like to use is the result of figuring pipeline construction to add to the current pipeline. This would be unlikely to happen in any even, more likely, the pipeline would run to a good location on the coast and the oil would be transported by tanker.\n \n 3. You will never know it is there. Seriously. Have you ever been to alaska? There is plenty of room up there. The current oil facilities are kind of nice. The pipeline gives good access to the interior. It looks like a well maintained, even painted, pipe going through a 40 ft wide streip of grass. There are no dead, oil soaked animals around it. The joints do not leak. \n \n \n As to duos #4, \n \n \n4) why are we enforcing behaviors that led us to do such irrational behaviors?\n\n \n What would you suggest? The US is a power hungry country, and currently oil is the fuel that drives us. ROEI on hydrogen is abysmal, wind power is unreliable and expensive to implement, ROEI on solar is also rediculously high, not to mention the environmental impact that comes with building PV panels. Even turning turkey guts into crude turns out to be a looser int he long run.\n \n The only off the shelf technology we have is either nuclear, or biomass gasification, and both of those come with some pretty serious drawbacks.",

The Exxon port is built on the south shore of Alaska for a reason: there isn't any other decent location for such a facility. That would mean the pipeline would have to join up with the prudhoe bay one for the cheapest and fastest possible shipment. So the 10 year figure may actually be very accurate, which then questions the intelligence of such a act in long term energy policy. \n \n \n3. You will never know it is there. Seriously.

It seems merely like a big industry kickback, since most of the moderate republicans voted no.

Article is at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10004-2004Oct5.html\n \n I could not find the EIA reprt they reference that shows the 45% number. They do have a brocure online at:\n \n http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/brochure/gas04/gasoline.htm\n \n That states:\n \n \nThe United States consumes over 20 million barrels (840 million gallons) of petroleum products each day, almost half of it in the form of gasoline used in over 200 million motor vehicles with combined travel over 7 billion miles per day. \n \n \n This seems to loosely corroborate the article. \n \n The numbers in your article are a virtual impossibility. Oil is not generally cracked, it is basically distilled, much like alcohol. Only about 25% of it distills out to a motor fuel (if you include jet fuel as a motor fuel). In order to increase that, you generally thermally crack the petroleum. This is expensive.\n \n \n \nThere are ways to reduce our dependency slightly without much of an impact, namely blended fuels. Just this AM, I filled my Z28 with Sunoco Ultra 94 which had 10% Ethanol in it. It was still $2.56.9 per gallon, though. emoticon_mad \n \n \n It could be worse. The federal government subsidizes ethanol blended gasoline at a rate of 54 cents per gallon. This is because ethanol is MUCH, MUCH more expensive to produce than gasoline using oil. Currently, we use more than a gallon of gas (or diesel) to produce each gallon of ethanol. The only reason that it is financially viable at all is the fact that in addition to subsidizing the fuel, we also subsidize the corn in the field that we make most of our ethanol for, as well as the ethanol production facilities. Overall, ethanol for vehicle use is subsidized at nearly $1 per gallon, PLUS the 54 cents per gallon on the gas. \n \n Theoretically, we could develop countercurrent hydrolysis technology, which would result in a savings of 30 cents per gallon (of ethanol) by 2015. Enzymatic hydrolysis could lead to a savings of 60 cents per gallon in that same time period, if we could get past the scalability problems, and figure out what to do with the byproduct, which is millions of gallons of dirty sulphuric acid. Of course, this all assumes cheap energy availability. You either need cheap oil to grow corn, or ULTRA cheap fuel for the other methods, since they both rely on transportation of huge amounts of low density feed stocks. \n \n This is the same problem with large scale gasification. While gasification is a GREAT idea if you happen to be a lumber mill and are spewing out a constant feedstock on site so all you have to do is pick it up and put it in your hopper, if you actually have to transport that same feedstock 20 miles, you LOOSE money. \n \n \n \nThere are some places that have as much as 15% ethanol in their gasoline. If everyone used blended gas, it'd save up to 20 Billion gallons of oil/year with the added benefit of increasing domestic corn production tremendously and creating a host of jobs in the field of fermentation chemistry and production.\n\n \n Except for the fact that, as outlined above, we would loose our butts, this is a good idea. Growing corn to make fuel is a WAY BAD, loosing proposition. It is anothoer one of those pie in teh sky schemes that sounds great, until you get down to the nuts and bolts of it and realise that without cheap oil to begin with, you can't afford to grow the corn, you CERTAINLY cannot afford to transport it.\n \n You have to consider the upstream and downstream on things like this. If your feedstock requires a large investment of petro, and does not yield a positive ROEI, you are loosing. If we increase corn production in order to produce ethanol, we use MORE oil, not less.",

Where did you find your numbers?\n \n\n If one desires a truly scary scenario, look at some of the forecasts of US and Chinese oil requirements over the next five years. China has already negotiated contracts for their future oil requirements without firing a shot.\n\n \n We should be building a pipeline from Russia to Alaska instead of Russia building one from Russia to China. emoticon_mad The 20 year projection for oil demand that I've heard scares the hell out of me. I'm hoping to be long retired before the entire oil/petrochemical industry world-wide falters and implodes.\n \n\n We're still spending billions daily to 'stabilize' the ME. If those costs are added into our delivered price of oil with future interest costs (that's all borrowed money), as they should be, we have to look really stupid in the eyes of the rest of the world. And we're after a measly 4% of total requirements? Another masterful, deceit driven public refocus.\n\n \n If oil was our only goal in Iraq, then I would agree that it wasn't a fiscally-sound move.",

No one will know actual production capability until drilling takes place, but 4% of total US requirements are generally considered maximum, could be far less. Even if one doubled the maximum, 8% would not make the US independent of foreign oil. Unless, of course, one is using government accounting or is a politician.",
