   "Uh! Antis! You suffer from hype and a severe lack of knowledge. emoticon_smile Civilians cannot own the armor pearling round! \n \n Did anyone else notice the amount of wounded? That is because this cartridge is a terrible pistol round! \n \n   The 5.7x28mm \"Cop Killer\" Cartridge Myth \n It is important to remember that the 5.7x28mm velocity and energy figures were derived from a 10.35 inch (sub-machinegun length) test barrel and that the Five-seveN pistol barrel actually measures 4.82 inches in length. Realistically, we can anticipate a substantial velocity loss of about 20% when the 5.7x28mm cartridge is fired from a pistol. This would mean an actual MV of approximately 1560 fps and ME of 216 ft. lbs. for the 5.7x28mm 40 grain bullet when fired from a handgun. Because it starts a heavier bullet at lower velocity, which maximizes energy and minimizes velocity loss, this should be the most effective load for a 5.7x28mm pistol.\n \n A comparison of the performance of the .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR), introduced in 1959, and the 5.7x28mm is interesting. The .22 WMR shares the same bullet diameter (.224\") as the 5.7x28mm cartridge and their muzzle and energy figures are actually rather similar.\n \n Winchester's Supreme .22 WMR loaded with a 34 grain jacketed hollow point bullet has a muzzle velocity of 2120 fps and muzzle energy of 339 ft. lbs. from a (presumably 24\") rifle barrel and a muzzle velocity of 1690 fps with 216 ft. lbs. of muzzle energy from a 6.5\" pistol barrel. (That is just a hair over the 20% velocity loss that we postulated for the 5.7x28mm.)\n\n \n A regular 45 APC or a 357 magnum would have been much more devastating and produced more killed then this anemic, underpowered, handgun round! \n \n   Winchester Ranger 230-Grain .45 ACP \n Winchester Ranger ammunition is loaded to pressure levels that are on the high end. The Ranger 230-grain SXT .45 ACP load leaves Winchester's five-inch test barrel doing 985 fps, while developing an impressive 495 ft-lbs of muzzle energy.\n\n \n I don't know, but perhaps you should consider that!

   "GunCite-Gun Control: \"Cop-killer\" Bullets\n Posted in full for comments and illustrative proof:\n \n \"Cop-killer\" Bullets\n \n \n By Mike Casey[*]\n Knowledge is power. As a police officer I strive to acquire as much knowledge as possible regarding the potential threats I may have to face. Obviously the threat posed by an armed criminal is high on my list of concerns. In researching that potential threat I've learned that the public perception and media portrayal of the matter is far from realistic. The subject of so called \"Cop-killer\" bullets is a prime example. The inflammatory headlines aren't hard to find; \"Deadly Teflon Bullets Blast Through Police Vests\"; \"NRA Opposes Cop Killer Bullet Ban,\" etc. Likewise, the misleading scenes in television crime dramas and in movies are numerous. A memorable scene in one of the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies had Mel Gibson's character firing \"Cop-killer\" bullets through the blade of a bulldozer! The real story is significantly less dramatic. \n In the mid 1960's, Dr. Paul Kopsch (an Ohio coroner), Daniel Turcos (a police sergeant) and Donald Ward (Dr. Kopsch's special investigator) began experimenting with special purpose handgun ammunition. Their objective was to develop a law enforcement round capable of improved penetration against hard targets like windshield glass and automobile doors. Conventional bullets, made primarily from lead, are often ineffective against hard targets especially when fired at handgun velocities. In the 1970's, Kopsch, Turcos and Ward produced their \"KTW\" handgun ammunition using steel cored bullets capable of great penetration. Following further experimentation, in 1981 they began producing bullets constructed primarily of brass. The hard brass bullets caused exceptional wear on handgun barrels, a problem combated by coating the bullets with Teflon. The Teflon coating did nothing to improve penetration, it simply reduced damage to the gun barrel. \n \n Despite the facts that \"KTW\" ammunition had never been available to the general public and that no police officer has ever been killed by a handgun bullet penetrating their body armor, the media incorrectly reported that the Teflon coated bullets were designed to defeat the body armor that law enforcement officers were beginning to use. The myth of \"Cop-killer\" bullets was born. \n In January of 1982, NBC Television broadcast a sensationalist prime time special titled \"Cop Killer Bullets.\" Law enforcement officials had asked NBC not to air the program as the use of body armor by police officers was still not common knowledge and the \"KTW\" ammunition was virtually unheard of outside law enforcement circles. The safety of law enforcement officers took a back seat to ratings at NBC however and they not only broadcast the show, but re-broadcast it again six months later. \n \n Following significant media hype and widespread misconceptions, Congress got into the act and proposed legislation that would have outlawed any bullet based on its ability to penetrate certain bullet resistant material. The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and other forensic experts cautioned that the proposed ban was too vague to be enforceable. The NRA opposed the proposed law since it would have banned not only the controversial armor piercing handgun rounds, but nearly all conventional rifle ammunition as well. (Most rifle ammunition will easily penetrate the most commonly worn protective vests.) \n The NRA proposed alternative legislation based upon the actual design and construction of the bullets. The final, approved version of the bill (H.R. 3132 passed in 1986) prohibited the sale of armor piercing ammunition [which may be used in a handgun] other than to law enforcement and the military. Representative Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) the original bill's sponsor, stated that the final legislation \"... was not some watered down version of what we set out to do. In the end there was no compromise on the part of police safety...\"  My NOTE: MARIO BIAGGI IS NOW A TWICE CONVICTED FELON!\n Gun control advocates and the news media jumped on the NRA's opposition to the original, vague and ineffective proposal. They ignored the NRA's contribution to the final legislation insisting to this day that the NRA wants \"Cop Killer\" bullets to be available to the public. \n \n Here are the facts: \n \n - \"Armor piercing\" ammunition is only legally available to law enforcement agencies and to the armed forces. \n \n - Rather than opposing the ban on \"armor piercing\" ammunition, the NRA was in fact instrumental in crafting the law that Congress ultimately passed. \n \n - When properly wearing the appropriate body armor, not one law enforcement officer has ever been killed by a handgun bullet penetrating their vest. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) certifies three levels of body armor. The most commonly worn, Level IIA, offers realistic protection against all .22, .25, .32, .380, and .38, caliber handgun ammunition, against most 9mm, .357 Magnum, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and .44 Magnum handgun ammunition and against 000 buck shotgun pellets. Level II and Level IIIA armor protects from even greater threats including 12 gauge shotgun slugs and the \"hottest\" .44 Magnum rounds. \n \n \"Cop-killer\" bullets are a myth born from media hype and nurtured by unrealistic Hollywood portrayals and the deliberately misleading claims of the anti-gun lobby. An objective, rational look at the facts quickly separates the myth from the reality. Knowledge is power. \n \n MY NOTE: In tests it was proven that teflon actually hindered penetration in kevlar vests because of the gripping tendandcies of the teflon exactly as it reacted to glass to keep from being deflected!\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n [*] Mike Casey (a pseudonym) is currently a Patrol Officer, Firearms Instructor and Field Training Officer in a municipal police department in Maine.

   "The Black Rhino ammo hoax:\n \n NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service\n \n \nAnnotation: This article describe an apparent hoax perpetrated by Signature Products Corporation, an ammunition manufacturer. \n Abstract: In late 1994, the news media reported that Signature Products had applied for a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to produce Black Rhino ammunition, purportedly able to penetrate a bullet-resistant vest and then suddenly turn frangible and virtually explode on contact with soft flesh. Generally, however, bullets are either hard enough to penetrate armor or have a soft or hollow point and a design that produces a mushrooming effect that allows them to pierce the human body. Signature Products, in response to criticism about the Black Rhino bullet's capabilities, announced it had delayed production. This article compares the publicity over Black Rhino to previous scares over so- called Teflon cop-killer bullets and plastic guns. \n Main Term(s): Criminology \n Index Term(s): Ammunition ; Technology ; Armor piercing bullets\n",

   "http://rkba.org/antis/rhino-hoax\n \n Seems the only charge they forgot was suborne perjury :)\n \n [OUOTE]Rhino Ammunition is a Hoax and a Criminal* Conspiracy!\n \n A) A former defense contractor, not previously in the ammunition\n manufacturing business, decided to create two types of \"new\" ammunition. \n One is fragmenting, the other supposedly armor-piercing and both are for\n handguns. Before these are even marketed, the manufacturer (Signature\n Products Inc.), sent advance press releases to Handgun Control Inc. and\n Congressman Charles Schumer and, later, sent press releases to the major\n news services telling how one of the rounds would defeat the ballistic\n armor used by police\n \n B) In fact, one of the \"new\" rounds is apparently a revisit of the\n 1970's Glaser Safety Slug (or of the MagSafe round) while the other is a\n 1930's vintage design upgraded with plastic to get around current - and\n poorly written - laws restricting armor-piercing ammunition.\n \n It is extremely doubtful that the armor-piercing design has the advertised\n expansion of the fragmentation round. Martin Fackler MD, President of the\n International Wound Ballistics Association and the Retired Director of the\n US Army Wound Ballistics Laboratory stated that the claims made by Keen\n regarding his Black Rhino - that it penetrates Kevlar and then fragments\n in softer tissue - is ludicrous. Even if David Keen, CEO of Signature\n Products, were able to demonstrate that his product could penetrate\n ballistic armor, it is important to pay attention to how the test is\n conducted. Kevlar in ballistics vests works by distributing the force of\n impact. A rigid backer prevents the distribution of force and so make it\n easy to defeat the vest - but bears no reasonable relationship to the real\n world.\n \n Of either of these rounds, the facts aren't being given out by the\n manufacturer and nearly all of the news media is either far too lazy to\n dig up the truth or is deliberately practicing political advocacy\n journalism.\n \n C) The fragmenting cartridge has never been noted for its ability to\n penetrate body armor vests. Furthermore, it is a far safer round to use\n in buildings and populated areas because it does not ricochet or penetrate\n walls effectively.\n \n Note that the first \"cop killer\" bullets were created by the request of\n police departments to penetrate hard surfaces (like glass and metal) at\n oblique angles and for dealing with criminals wearing body armor. The\n \"cop killer\" armor-piercing design is very ineffective and, because of its\n expense, has rarely, if ever, been used to shoot at police officers There\n appears to be no case in which a police officer was actually shot with a\n so-called \"cop killer\" bullet. \n \n D) Because of the expense of armor and armor-piercing bullets, neither\n has been used to any significant extent by criminals. \n \n E) One week before the new congress starts its session, the manufacturer\n gives unlimited interviews to pro-gun control reporters before his \"new\"\n products are even released and makes no effort to show that either of his\n copy-cat rounds will penetrate armor or that they have ever been\n significantly used by criminals.\n \n F) The manufacturer's CEO (and a chemist), David Keen of Huntsville,\n Alabama, admits that he is pro-gun control and is a member of Handgun\n Control, Inc.\n \n G) The news media confuses the issue more by presenting TV pictures of\n the fragmenting bullet load while telling viewers it is the armor-piercing\n bullet. Again, the manufacturer apparently makes no effort to undo the\n confusion and disinformation.\n \n H) A pro-gun control activist congressman, Rep. Schumer, just happens to\n have a bill to ban this ammunition ready to go for the first day of the\n 104th session of Congress. \n \n Although the new bill is being covered by the news media as a way to keep\n the \"new\" \"cop killer bullet\" off the streets, in fact, as the bill is\n currently written, it would also ban a lot of existing handgun cartridges\n and almost every rifle cartridge (since nearly all of these will defeat\n most of the body armor vests currently worn by police).\n \n I) The manufacturer then decides not to manufacture the body armor\n piercing cartridge, but to go ahead with the other round with the false\n implication that they had, at some point, been either on or ready to go to\n market. In fact, the manufacturer is still waiting for his federal\n license to manufacture any type of ammunition.\n \n J) ABC actually exposes the truth about the Rhinos on Thursday's\n (12/29/94) Nightline (hosted by Chris Wallace). Nightline went out to get\n their own ballistics tests on these rounds in both ballistic gelatin and\n on Level IIIa body armor.\n \n The results, which were discussed by some of the ballistic experts of H.P.\n White Laboratory Inc. (who performed the testing for Nightline, is one of\n the premier ballistic labs in the country, and is recommend by the FBI and\n BATF) gave the inescapable conclusion that the Rhino Hoax is appropriately\n named. The standard Rhino's were touted as being able to penetrate 9\n inches of ballistic gelatin leaving a 4-5 inch diameter permanent wound\n cavity. Test results: 3-1/2 inches of penetration (less than half that\n was advertised) with less than a 2 inch permanent wound cavity (less than\n half that was advertised). In fact, the round is nothing more than the\n Glaser Safety Slug revisited and exhibited considerably less penetration\n than a standard .45 caliber full metal jacketed ammunition. \n \n Black Rhino's are supposed to be able to not only penetrate body armor,\n but also deliver the same wound which was to \"explode like a grenade.\" The\n Rhino round (non-penetrating) did not penetrate the vest, and it's depth\n of penetration was only 2mm deeper than standard .45 caliber full metal\n jacketed ammunition. The experts concluded that this difference was\n insignificant. The testers expressed skepticism about the claim that the\n Rhino bullet would have caused extensive broken ribs, as claimed by the\n developer. (BATF experts also have examined the ballistic gel patterns of\n the Rhino ammunition and have states that it's no different than any other\n bullet of the same expanding type. Furthermore, the BATF doubts that the\n Black Rhino penetrating ammunition even exists.) Chris Wallace likened\n the armor piercing Black Rhino to the mythical Unicorn; there is no known\n evidence that it exists.\n \n The testers also noted that the three (or four) Rhino rounds tested had\n such different muzzle velocities (by 30%) that probable malfunction in a\n semi-automatic would occur. Also noted was that most of the parts used in\n constructing the round were obtained from Winchester.\n \n On the show, Congressman Schumer immediately distanced himself from the\n Rhino Hoax, saying that the Rhino's \"...aren't the issue\" and also\n referred to David Keen as a \"charlatan.\"\n \n David Keen, the manufacturer's CEO, declined a request to appear on the show.\n \n K) David Keen has declined comment (or been entirely\n unreachable) since 12/29/94.\n \n L) In early January '95, the BATF announces that it approves the Rhino\n round for sale to the public soon, finding it to be no more impressive\n than any other hollow point on the market, and will license the\n manufacturer within 60 days.\n \n *****\n \n Does any of this sound fishy? Doesn't it sound just like a hoax and a\n criminal* conspiracy of which the news media is a willing criminal*\n accomplice?\n \n Will the news media have the \"ethics and courage\" to admit to the hoax and\n the crime* on prime time and the front pages?\n \n *****\n \n *Criminal and civil violation of Title 42, U.S.C., Sections 1983, 1985, &\n 1986 and/or Title 18 U.S.C., Sections 241 & 242 for attempting to deprive\n \"citizens of rights, privileges, or immunities\" secured by the U.S.\n Constitution.[/QUOTE]",

   "So youre saying no bullets exist that can go through body armor.\n Im calling bull on this one because its already been tested and shown it can be done. ]\n I think what Doc is trying to get through that head of yours is any bullet is capable of killing a cop it's the myth of the cop killer bullets thats B.S. .And had you read the article GunCite-Gun Control: \"Cop-killer\" Bullets you would see that plenty of bullets exist, mostly in the form of rifle bullets that will defeat it.As far as your cop killing handgun bullets go,this is where you must have gotten bored or saw your cause was lost.\n \n When properly wearing the appropriate body armor, not one law enforcement officer has ever been killed by a handgun bullet penetrating their vest. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) certifies three levels of body armor. The most commonly worn, Level IIA, offers realistic protection against all .22, .25, .32, .380, and .38, caliber handgun ammunition, against most 9mm, .357 Magnum, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and .44 Magnum handgun ammunition and against 000 buck shotgun pellets. Level II and Level IIIA armor protects from even greater threats including 12 gauge shotgun slugs and the \"hottest\" .44 Magnum rounds.\n\n \n So they didnt oppose the ban but why would the NRA want a ban on something that you already said was a myth?\n So now here again your not reading or just misunderstood(granted I read that part twice but the thing is I did).\n \n The NRA opposed the proposed law since it would have banned not only the controversial armor piercing handgun rounds, but nearly all conventional rifle ammunition as well. (Most rifle ammunition will easily penetrate the most commonly worn protective vests.)\n The NRA proposed alternative legislation based upon the actual design and construction of the bullets. The final, approved version of the bill (H.R. 3132 passed in 1986) prohibited the sale of armor piercing ammunition [which may be used in a handgun] other than to law enforcement and the military.\nemoticon_smile\n \n What a tangled web you weave when you try to decieve.\n\n \n So far you seem to be the one tangled up.emoticon_hb",

   "Tim, I have a great deal of experience with the fn 5.7mm pistol, not some guesswork such as the antigun.orgs poop out. I have shot quite a few predators and varmints as well as targets so I have firsthand knowledge about what works and what doesn't work and also see the hen scratching you and your ilk have posted that is not anywhere near the truth.\n \n I can tell you this as a CHL and instructor: I would hesitate to use this firearm in a self defense situation if anything else was available such as even a .380 or what I consider also anemic, the 9mm. I have owned and still do, the 5.7 pistol and the best use I have found for it is for the grandchildren to use to shoot grackles out in the corn patch even though they prefer the .22 long rifle cartridge. \n \n It may be fine for NATO troops to use since they don't do much shooting in enemy combat where it is preferable to wound as it takes a support team and you tie up at least 10 other people who could otherwise be engaged in combat that are taken away to tend the wounded from marginal hits. I know the dimunitive .22 long rifle has a better track record of lethality :)",

A shot in the femorral artery area (groin/leg) can bleed out before the ambulance arrives. A shot in the head is usually fatal as is a shot in the neck.

Surely not. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Hasan was military. He had to go through weapons training just like the rest of us. He already had weaponry knowledge. Fyi: ANYONE can research a weapon. \n \n Do you also want to outlaw bows and arrows? You do know archery is a growing sport. My pistol grip compound bow (38 lb pull) will kill a person real quick. How about we outlaw all knives too? Bowie knives can be real lethal or didn't you know people use knives to committ murders? Outlaw common household cleaners? You are aware simple explosives can be made from them? \n \n Some of you appear to live in an insular world. Absolutely no reality in your arguments. Pretty darn scarey too.

   "I can't believe you Anti-Constitutionalists are still trying to demonize the 5.7 pistol as a terrible killing weapon of extraordinary killing power when we have a military trained officer who was only able to wound 30 of his unarmed victims instead of managing to kill them. \n \n I am just glad this jehadist didn't have a 45!\n \n As to a 200 yard pistol hit, I would dearly love to see one of you pull it off! Heck, I have been shooting handguns for 45 years and I wouldn't even try such a ridiculous shot! The energy bleed off at 200 yards from a pistol would be so severe, that the bullet would likely bounce off of a person at that distance. That is IF you could actually pull of such a miraculous shot off hand. \n \n Like I said before, you guys suffer from lack of knowing what you are talking about.

They intended full exercise of all rights and the first 8 Amendments were reserved from any interference from any branch of government. Says so in the preamble and also in the Federalist Papers.

   "\n Sen. Carl Levin [D-MI]: The legislative director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers Steve Lenkhart called the Five-Seven \"an assault rifle that fits in your pocket.\" A recent memo by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement supports this assertion. The memo reportedly states that the Five-Seven has the capabilities of a carbine or rifle but weighs less than 2 pounds when fully loaded. The FN Herstal Web site lists the overall length of the handgun as only 8.2 inches, making it small enough and light enough to be easily concealed by criminals.\n \n\n \n \n\n Then give me the name of the original person who went on record and made this claim.

   "Hey, brady, isn't this the same Union that condemned your president who your .org is trying and relying on to get anti gun legislation passed? :) He called them STUPID. :)\n \n http://www.ibpo.org/pdf/ObamaLtrReGates.pdf\n \n \n \n The President \n The White House \n Washington, D.C. 20500 \n \n Dear Mr. President: \n \n I am deeply disturbed by your comments on national television Wednesday night relating \n to the Cambridge police and the incident with Harvard scholar Dr. Henry L. Gates Jr. I \n encourage you to clarify how the \"Cambridge police acted stupidly....\" \n \n Your campaign for the presidency tried to transcend race relations in America and \n claimed to support a new America based on equality. We learn early in life that calling \n anyone stupid is an exercise in poor judgment, but when you said the \"Cambridge police \n acted stupidly...,\" you not only used poor judgment in your choice of words, you \n indicted all members of the Cambridge police department and public safety officers \n across the country. \n \n None of us knows the facts of the incident, which is true. \"Skip\" Gates is your friend, \n which is true. But are you asking us to believe that the police officer's account of the \n incident is wrong because Mr. Gates is your friend - and a Harvard professor - while the \n other party to this story from your eyes is merely a working class police officer? \n \n There is always a sharp contrast between reality and actuality. Reality brings each of our \n prior perceptions and biases into any event or encounter. I am sure that the life \n experiences of Dr. Henry L. Gates Jr. and the police officer who responded to the call \n vary greatly. Actuality is what happened, without the perceptions and biases, and \n something none of us will ever truly know. \n \n Do you have any idea what it is like to be a police officer on the streets, especially during \n these trying economic times? The police officer involved has an impeccable \n professional reputation and is an outstanding member of his community. \n \n I am president of a labor organization, SEIU/NAGE, and through our affiliate, the \n International Brotherhood of Police Officers, we represent rank and file officers from \n Atlanta, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, North Carolina and Virginia in the South, \n California, Colorado, and Idaho in the West, and throughout New England. \n \n If the Cambridge officer on duty did not respond to the call, it could be alleged that \n Cambridge police do not treat seriously the property rights of African-Americans. If the \n officer's account of the story is accurate, it could be alleged that famous people who live \n in expensive homes receive different treatment under the law. \n \n -more-\n\n \n Not a good situation here brady :)",

   "Missed signals cleared the way for suspect to board plane - CNN.com\n \n \nWashington (CNN) -- To understand how the suspect in the botched terror attack was able to board a plane, you have to understand how the counterterrorism system that President Obama says failed is supposed to work.\n \n The president says the clues were there, and that a fuller, clearer picture of 23-year-old Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab would have emerged if all the bits and pieces had been shared and put together.\n \n \"The warning signs would have triggered red flags, and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America,\" Obama said.\n \n The president has ordered a top-to-bottom investigation of the failed terrorist attack on Christmas Day. The preliminary report is expected Thursday.\n \n One of the key questions is why wasn't the suspect's visa revoked.\n \n The suspect, a Nigerian national, was supposedly on the terrorist watch list. Six weeks ago, his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria that his son was becoming radicalized and had gone to Yemen.\n \n The father provided the embassy with his son's name, birth date and passport number. That information was sent in a routine, unclassified cable known as a visa VIPER to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington.\n \n The details in the cable were \"insufficient for this interagency review process to make a determination that this individual's visa should be revoked,\" State department spokesman Ian Kelly said.\n \n In the aftermath of the attempted attack, the State department is directing embassies to include information on whether a person has a U.S. visa when it sends the visa VIPER cables to Washington, a state department official said.\n \n The change was prompted by the preliminary reviews Obama ordered due to him Thursday.\n \n The information the father provided the embassy with was just one of hundreds of reports, and often vague tips, coming in each day. Analysts from the CIA, FBI, Justice Department and other agencies are supposed to evaluate such tips side by side, running them through databases, comparing them with other clues agencies have gathered, and those still coming in. The purpose is to make sure the even seemingly insignificant dots get connected.\n \n The U.S. also had intelligence that between August and October of this year, extremists in Yemen were talking about operations. Someone known as \"the Nigerian\" was mentioned, and they had a partial name -- Umar Farouk.\n \n \"At any point along that chain, people have the responsibility for making sure that they are accurately and fully reporting what they've learned. And then there are going to be some judgments that have to be made about whether and what action ought to be taken, based on the information,\" said Michael Chertoff, former Homeland Security Secretary under President Bush.\n \n But in this case, with no urgency attached, the father's warning was treated more as a missing-person report. With nothing else alarming coming up, the analysts put the suspect on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) list, along with 550,000 other suspicious people.\n \n And that's where the warnings stopped.\n \n To go on to the next step and put someone on a no-fly list or subject them to a secondary screening, there has to be a \"reasonable suspicion\" of a link to terrorism.\n \n Under the NCTC rules, the evidence against the bombing suspect wasn't there. No recommendation was made to the State Department to revoke AbdulMutallab's visa.\n \n The threshold for taking action is being looked at in the review ordered by the president. The threshold could be made less restrictive to allow a quicker trigger for action such as revoking a visa, according to a source briefed on the review.\n \n There was \"not a lack of information collected, but a lack of understanding of what to do with that information,\" the source said.\n \n Chertoff said that during his time in the job, there was a \"very good information-sharing system.\"\n \n \"I think what the current administration is going to be looking at is, was there human failure, either in the initial reporting or in the initial decision about what would be sent up the chain of communication, or in the ultimate determination by the intelligence community about whether this was significant enough to warrant preventing this person from getting on an airplane,\" he said.\n\n \n Considering all this information, I think it's not only safe, but also fair, to say that even if Hasan had been on the secret terrorist watchlist, there's no way his actions could have been either predicted or stopped. Even if there is a law that revokes a person's 5th and 14th Amendment rights and bars them from gun ownership based on secret watchlist status, there's no way to guarantee that they'd actually be denied a purchase.\n \n The FBI, CIA and other organizations dropped the ball with this Nigerian terrorist, even without the Tiahrt Amendment supposedly \"preventing them from sharing sensitive information\". What are your excuses now?",
