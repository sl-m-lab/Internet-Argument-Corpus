By the way, my name is Jason, 28 years old, originally from Alabama, lived in Australia and California, and I'm a graphic artist. Graduated from Cal in 2003.\n Hi, Jason, and welcome to 4Forums! Hope you enjoy your stay.\n \n There IS a \"getting-to-know-you\" forum somewhere on the site for people to introduce themselves, btw, if you hunt around for it, but I don't know how many people actually avail themselves of it so maybe your way is best.\n \n My name is Michael, gay, atheist/rationalist, liberal , pro-choice, 58, UCLA grad, life-long SoCal resident, used to be primarily a writer (produced & published plays, aired TV shows, one published novel, many unproduced -- and one produced--screenplays), still write but now do graphic arts myself in the form of Flash, PowerPoint, Illustrator, etc. to survive. One son, 16. Live in L.A. Absolutely trust in science, incl. evolution, natural selection, biological sources of homosexuality, global warming, etc. and disdain supernatural sky-pixie-based explanations. Smoke grass on occasion, think it should be legalized. Interests: old movies, MST3K, British humor, Nabokov, Lewis Carroll, logic, vodka, games & puzzles, gay rights, lucid dreams. Heroes: Jefferson, Paine, Madison, Einstein, Stoppard, Anthony Burgess, Desmond Tutu, JK Rowling, Richard Dawkins.\n \n Again, welcome!",
