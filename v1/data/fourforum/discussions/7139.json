   "What is the American government doing to Iran right now? My country, Russia, is offering to build another facility that is \"for nuclear power\".\n But come on. Lets lay our cards on the table here. We all know that the Iranians are trying to build nuclear warheads. You got a thug as president, a bunch of supported terrorist organizations through out Iran, and a country of chaos. Seems obvious what they are trying to do.\n The president of Iran is allegedly one of the suspected men who had part in the Iranian take over of our embassy. Most people are sure of it. We got a man in power that is not really a terrorist, but a person that supports it, and hates the US, and Isreal.\n What are we doing to prevent a major disaster? We are threatening with sanctions, and so on. But, they don't care. They passed a bill of some sort, and continue to tempt the government of the U.S.\n Now, a couple weeks ago, they said that Isreal will be wiped off the map. I would be worried. An easy way to wipe them off the map is with weapons. Would they do it? I have my doubts. But, anything could happen.\n The president of Iran said the Holocaust did not happen. Hell if it did not. My grandfather who is dead now, helped liberate a camp. Now, anyway. The holocaust did happen. The arab world thinks we all made that up to give Israel back it's ancient country. Israel was their country. They think we made that up.\n Now, that is not true. 6 million jews died cause of the facist regime of Adolf Hittler. I say, screw Hitler. I had to learn about the Holocaust once in school, and I have taught it when I subed at schools, and it is real sad. I am a man, and I still cry when I hear the stories of the holocaust. Many were starving, and dieing. But, it did happen. The Russians and the Americans destroyed Germany and resulted in a wall, and lots of chaos. \n My father and I, whie I was growing up, knew a survivor of the Holocaust. He is dead now. But, it is really tragic. \n I wonder what the government is going to do about the Iranians. That government needs a change. They need to stop supporting terrorism, not build nuclear weapons, and not taunt the world like North Korea is doing now.\n How do we deal with this? I don't know either. I think this is going to result in the use of war. Reason being, is, the Iranians would never allow inspectors to come in, and would never dismantle it's program. So, we could very well end up in war. What do you all think as to this post?\n John",
