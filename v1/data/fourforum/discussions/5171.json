Pay particular attention to the servile, unpatriotic and treasonable part: \n \n \"The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else.\"",

   "Have them funded the terrorists or provided arms? Or provided shelter in their own homes? No?\n Then its not aiding or comforting, if we are saying that capmaigning against the war counts as treason why shouldn't the arrogance in the statements of those for the war not count as its driving far more people to sign up with the terrorists. Or those who can only see black and white who then alienate the US from its allies and create yet more enemies?\n\n \n You obviously don't understand the definition of giving \"aid and comfort.\" Here, let me help you.\n \n \"A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly against the city. But the traitor moves among those within the gates freely, his sly whispers rustling through all alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears no traitor; he speaks in the accents familiar to his victim, and he wears their face and their garments and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation; he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city; he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared. The traitor is the plague.\" - Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman Orator - 106-43 B.C.\n \n \"Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.\" - The Bible: New Testament, Matthew, 27:3.\n \n -------------------------------------------------\n \n How do you destroy the enemy's morale and will to fight? It's simple, really.\n \n First, you call into question their mission. Make them question why they are fighting. Make them question whether they are doing the right thing. Soldiers unsure of their mission question their orders and hesitate to act when quick action is most necessary. In combat, you're either quick or you're dead.\n \n Second, call into question their leadership. Make them question their commander's skill and honesty. Make them question the motives of the political figures that made the decision to go to war. Soldiers unsure of their leadership may refuse to follow their orders or take direct action against their leadership. In combat, failure to immediately follow orders usually gets soldiers killed.\n \n Third, make them homesick. Point out how miserable they are; remind them how long they have been away from home; how much their loved ones miss them; accentuate the bad and ignore the good; tell them there is no foreseeable end in site (no, you won't be home by Christmas). Homesick and depressed soldiers are not effective soldiers. Ineffective soldiers often become dead soldiers.\n \n Fourth, make it all about them. Point out that the war is not in their personal best interest. \"Hey, you can lose an eye (or worse), doing that.\" This last step, converting the soldier back into the psychological equivalent of a civilian, is the most deadly. Soldiers who start thinking only of themselves stop acting as members of a team. A soldier concerned only with his own safety stops watching his buddy's back. Unit cohesiveness breaks down. Desertions and insubordination becomes rampant. Casualties mount higher.\n \n Conversely, the same propaganda that can destroy enemy morale can boost the morale of friendly forces, and vice-versa.\n \n For propaganda to work, it must be based on truth, or at least the perception of truth in the mind of the recipient. Propaganda that does not adhere to this rule generally falls on deaf ears. During the first Gulf War, the Iraqi radio announcer known as Baghdad Betty failed in her attempt to demoralize U.S. Troops when she said: \"While you are away, movie stars are taking your women. Robert Redford is dating your girlfriend, Tom Selleck is kissing your lady, Bart Simpson is making love to your wife.\" If only she had consulted with Sean Penn or Ms. Garafalo before the broadcast.\n \n But carefully crafted lies can, if repeated often enough, still have some effect. If continued long enough, they can alter perception, and perception can become reality. In Mein Kampf (1926), Hitler described what would become known as \"The Big Lie\":\n \n \"Through clever and constant application of propaganda, people can be made to see paradise as hell, and also the other way round, to consider the most wretched sort of life as a paradise.\"\n \n http://ice.he.net/~freepnet/kerry/staticpages/index.php?page=20040412133057507\n \n \n ",

   "This is not what I am talking about just to be clear. What I take great umbrage with are the individuals who block traffic, disrupt commerce, issue outrageous and unfounded allegations that the war is \"immoral\" or that sort of thing. Almost without exception these people are part and parcel of the crowd that in its heart of hearts want America to be defeated. Such individuals would be the types such as Ward Churchill, Noam Chomsky, Ramsey Clark, Michael Moore and those who repeat mindless leftist gibberish. Imagine how our troops take this as they are all on the internet and see the news as we do. How would anyone feel going into war having that doubt that what they were doing was the wrong thing and they were somehow doing the devil's work. \n \n To me this is a \"slam dunk.\" I really do believe that one is either with us or they are against us.\n\n I think a lot of the animosity about the war is not entirely due to the war itself but also importantly the feeling of utter inevitability about it (especially here in the UK), whilst there was a massive amount against the war it still happened despite protesters doing what they were supposed to do to get the government to notice and recognise the large amount of opposition to it.\n The feeling of being completely ignored by the government that was being purposely missleading in places and the feelings on the war itself combine together to encourage even more outrage and extreme response. Essentially they have tried protesting and debating and it did nothing.\n \n 'Mindless leftist gibberish' is drastically oversimplifying, whilst bearing in mind that the people you mentions job is to entertain people pretty much, I hardly think you can say the war was a clean cut thing. If it were the debate wouldn't still be raging on now.\n Problem is that there are a lot of serious questions that need to be asked about it, but one side is convinced that the other isn't going to listen anyway so yells louder and the other side refuses to listen because they are shouting.\n \n I think the closest you are going to honestly get from those 'wanting to see america fail' is the vindication you get from being right when no one listened rather than actual desire for harm to come to it. \n \n As for the troops, ours at least seemed to be as divided as the nation was at the start of the war. Its verging on dangerous ground here - yes its all well and good limiting them to only hearing the good things, but if they had any feelings of their own against the war and saw that these feelings at home were being supressed I think they would have a far worse crisis of faith - being sent out to do a mission you don't believe in whilst at home the people who represent you are prevented from airing your thoughts.\n \n For this reason its important to seperate the troops and the mission - the troops don't all support the mission themselves. The reporting here seemed to reflect this quite well, even in those papers against the war, it was essentially 'the war is wrong, but at least we can be proud our troops are doing better than the Americans' (Being more experienced and not having Baghdad to deal with admittedly).",

I wish it were possible that Bush and Blair would be able to share with the general population the strategic plan that underlies this war. If we live long enough I think we will eventually know. But as you know, being a Brit, it took 45 years for the Bletchley Park operation to be fully declassified. It won't happen overnight. \n \n Perhaps in the fullness of time the war will be seen by future historians to have been a collosal blunder. If that is so, then I have to wonder why Blair has hung tough all this time. No one, to my knowledge, has ever accused him of being a Texas cowboy who was stupid and inarticulate. He was given the opportunity to opt out if he needed to do so for political considerations. Blair chose not to do so. I believe there is a reason he made that decision. I do not see a man who is torn by conscience that he made an error in judgment.\n \n I would say one more thing. When the U.S. finally entered WWII it was only after Pearl Harbor. We went from an \"isolationist\" nation with 85% opposed to entering the war to a nation that was virtually 100% behind the war effort and we knew to the last man and woman it would be a bloody affair but everyone stepped up to the plate and did their part. In this war we don't have the galvanizing impact of a Pearl Harbor where the Japanese Empire and Hitler's Nazis have declared war on us. We have a bearded fanatic somewhere in Pakistan who hit us hard one time and we eventually drifted back into our same old political habits that I knew at the time would inevitably happen. \n \n Ask yourself one question and think about it. Suppose you awoke tomorrow morning and London was incincerated by a nuclear bomb and 1,000,000 dead Brits were lying in the streets. That's a possibility. Chances are it won't happen and we can all pray that it won't happen, but ask yourself how you would feel and what would you want done about it. You don't need to respond now; just think about it.",

Barry McCaffrey, an NBC News analyst.\n \n Cash incentives increased\n In a desperate attempt to recruit volunteers, the Army has increased cash incentives. Signing bonuses are up from $8,000 to $10,000. College scholarships have been raised from $50,000 to $70,000.\n \n But it's an uphill battle. A decent economy is steering many potential volunteers into private sector jobs. And concerned parents who don't want their sons and daughters going to war are convincing them to not sign up.\n \n In fact, new recruiting commercials are aimed not at recruits, but at their parents.\n \n But the current problem with recruiting could have long-term ramifications on America's ability to take on other potential conflicts.\n \n \"This raises questions about whether the all-volunteer force can really cope with a long war,\" says military analyst Loren Thompson.\n \n Appeal to 'sense of duty'\n In an appeal to the nation's patriotism, the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. Richard Cody, warns this issue is about far more than military service alone.\n \n \"This recruiting problem is not just an Army problems, this is America's problem,\" he said. \"And what we have to really do is talk about service to this nation - and a sense of duty to this nation.\")\n \n Military officials remain cautiously optimistic that they will meet their recruiting goals by the end of the year, but until the war in Iraq eases, and large numbers of American troops start coming home, it will remain a tough sell.\n \n More than 40 percent of the ground troops in Iraq have been from the Army's National Guard or Reserve - and Guard officials warn that by the end of this year they're going to run out of additional troops with the right skills to send to Iraq. \n \n Recruiting alone is not going to fill that need so the regular Army, already stretched thin, is going to have to come up with the numbers.",

If that is our focus we have already lost the war on terrorism. No one in their right mind could possibly believe that wars will be antiseptic and tidy affairs.

   "I certainly do not. I do not agree with him, but he has every right to say it. Thats what this little document called the Constitution says. \n \n You seem intent on comparing the War on Terror to WWII, why this I cannot fathom, but as I've said, it's apples to oranges. Figthing in North Africa reduced Hitler's armies, and secured a strategic area, from wich the invasion of southern Europe could procede. Invading Iraq 60 years later has done nothing but create an upsure in support for radical islamic terrorists, and killed thousands of people, inlcuding our own troops.\n\n \n Let me help you out. The war in Iraq has several different aspects and in large part is a diversion in order to draw in bin Laden's troops to kill them there. This is commonly known as the \"flypaper strategy\" \n \n (http://andrewsullivan.com/main_article.php?artnum=20030906)\n \n although that will never directly be referred to by the Bush administration. In this respect the war in North Africa was quite similar to our efforts in Iraq.\n \n And as I said in another thread or post, all wars are the same. There are winners (the ones who remain alive) and the losers (the ones who are dead.) I choose to be on the side that remains alive. Bin Laden has openly stated that he wants to kill a minimum of 4,000,000 Americans and 2,000,000 American children in order to even the score. I take him at his word. If we do not fight him in Iraq we will surely fight him on the streets of America and quite likely after a nuclear attack on a major American city. If we don't take terrorism seriously now I can assure you that we will take it seriously then but we will have to step over the bodies of yet more innocent Americans because the left will have won the propaganda war.",

Obviously the British and Japanese people survived as nations. However, they lost sufficiently on the battlefield to throw in the towel. That's what I was talking about.\n \n He's in Pakistan but he is having to expend his trained forces to fight us in Iraq. He would much rather be using his forces to concoct new terror attacks; possibly in some high profile European city. You may not like the flypaper strategy but it is something that caused me to change my views of the Bush policy. This was an editorial I had written in another forum just prior to reading the analysis by Sullivan on the flypaper strategy.\n (Obviously I no longer hold to these views.)\n \n Bush's Waterloo\n \n by Missouri Mule\n \n Published: April 12, 2004 \n \n After 9/11 George Bush was riding high with the support of most Americans and much of the world. There were some who felt that peace at any price was necessary, even in Afghanistan, but most felt it was a worthy cause. Then the Bush administration made the case for Iraq and that Saddam was a threat and a danger. We were told that a nuclear cloud was bound to come quickly if Saddam were to remain in power.\n \n I remember the lead-up to Iraq hoping that it could be averted somehow but supported the war if it came to that for several reasons.\n \n 1. We couldn't very well remain in place forever with our troops on trigger alert.\n 2. The weather was getting much warmer.\n 3. Our Arab allies said to either do it now or leave.\n 4. We would be able to leave Saudi Arabia.\n 5. We wanted to free the Iraqi people who were anxious to be freed from the iron grip of Saddam.\n 6. The starving children would be fed.\n \n When the war began I was supportive but had the uneasy feeling that we might be getting into something that we hadn't fully planned for. Nevertheless the daily Pentagon briefings seemed to confirm this was the right and necessary war.\n \n Fast forward to today a full year after the war began and almost as long as it was stated \"Mission Accomplished.\" Bush's poll numbers were sky high and many of us took vicarious comfort in seeing him land on the aircraft carrier. We assumed it was about over and we could look to welcoming our brave soldiers home to a hero's welcome.\n \n How things have changed in the past year. We now find that the \"Real War\" is only now beginning and the arbitrary handover to civilian authority is at hand. No one believes that this will happen. The leaders in Iraq are at each other's throat and we are losing more soldiers during the so-called occupation than were ever lost during the actual war before the regime fell.\n \n What to do? I am not a military expert, but it seems to me that we cannot continue in this fashion or we will suffer the death of a thousand cuts, and this cannot be sustained with the volatile American opinion polls. Throw in the election cycle and we have an unholy mess that no one seems to be able to solve. Most believe we can't leave and tuck tail. But inevitably it will happen as it did during Vietnam. Meanwhile the war on terrorism becomes lost in this fog. Does Bush deserve the blame? He deserves a good deal of blame but not all the blame. The blame ought to be shared by the United States Congress who refused to abide by their constitutional duties. They should have thoroughly debated this and given an up or down vote on a formal declaration of war and then kept their traps shut.\n \n We are now caught up in endless political discourse for the next seven months. We were divided before the war began. We will be divided further still. On balance, I believe if Bush cannot bring a solution to this within the next 90 days then I will urge my friends and relatives to vote to remove him from office. I make this with a heavy heart, but I can't see sacrificing young American boys to someone's blind political ambitions. I hope that John Kerry is up to the task. I have even less confidence in him than I did in the war but I see no other choice.\n \n ",

That presents a clear and imeadiate danger, as people will now panic. \n \n Calling the victims of 9/11 Eichmans, while insensitive and crass, is perfectly legal. \n \n Honestly, it seems like you and MM are the ones who should really be on trial for treason here, you really do seem to hate the Constution.",
