   "Apparently Newt Gingrich is a racist for calling the president the \"food stamp president\". \n \n I read this and was reminded about our friend Poet and how anything said that even had the same letters as the word \"racism\" is, in fact, racist. I've been hearing this \"racial undertones\" my entire life. I've concluded that it is basically people trying to either 1)Find a way to take down someone or 2)make themselves feel better about their own failings. \n \n It's cr*p like this that makes people ignore true racial and social issues. \n \n Newt Gingrich Calls President Obama a ?Food Stamps President? | News | BET\n \n Shame on you David Gregory and Chris Matthews.",
