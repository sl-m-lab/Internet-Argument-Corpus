   "During the Texas State Board of Education hearings on science standards for Texas schoolchildren, BoE member and staunch creationist Barbara Cargill decided that the age of the Universe was up for vote. Oddly enough, I had some issue with that. You may vote on issues all you want, and you can even vote on morality if you'd like, but scientific reality is not a matter of opinion and cares not for the majority vote.\n \n The National Center for Science Education has video of the moment where it becomes clear that Ms. Cargill, not happy enough to destroy biology for students, proposes an amendment to creationize astronomy as well:\n \n YouTube - Cargill: The universe isn't expanding\n \n Listening to her gives me the heebie-jeebies. About the astronomy standards, she says \"...there are different estimates [of the age of the Universe]... they will be taught about 12 - 14 billion years ago, but this leaves it open a little bit to discuss how many billions.\"\n \n It is absolutely clear from what she is saying that she is deliberately trying to weaken the teaching of the old age of the Universe. Another member queries her specifically, asking if this will open up astronomy to the teaching of literal Biblical creationism. Cargill then completely dodges the question, saying she is simply taking the language of the recommendations. But that language is clearly saying the Universe is old, and there is a small amount of uncertainty (actually, only about 120 million years) in the age estimate of the Universe.\n \n What she did, to put it simply, is a crock. It is perfectly transparent what she wanted: to wedge open the door to allow the teaching of young-Earth creationism in the classroom, using the standard \"strengths and weaknesses\" creationist propaganda tactic.\n \n Need I say it? Her amendment passed, 11 to 3.\n \n I honestly feel bad for any child entering the Texas public school system over the next ten years, and I sincerely hope that the Legislature of the Lone Star State is able to take away the ridiculous amount of power the BoE has. They are flaunting their violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United State of America (not to mention bending or breaking that pesky \"false witness\" Commandment), and their influence reaches well beyond their own state borders.\n\n Texas is only 6000 years old! | Bad Astronomy | Discover Magazine\n \n Ahh yes.\n When \"voting\" over-rules scientific standards and determination in education...",

   "Texas is only 6,000 years old? So that explains why you find human footprints along with those of dinos only at Paluxy Texas. It all makes some strange kind of sense now.emoticon_xclown\nYeah, it does. I wrote this almost 10 years ago after my first visit to Glen Rose.\n \nAs we drove north, my wife and I talked about how the sea during the Cretaceous period (65 to 144 mya) came further inland than it does now. The area where we were headed was laid down during the the late Cretaceous, 113 mya according to the Dinosaur Valley State Park Brochure. During that time, the sea made several advances and retreats. Specifically, the particular formation we were going to see was most likely a coastal wetland during a period of retreat. \n \n As we got closer to Glen Rose, the sedimentary nature of the underlying rock became obvious. The country side was quite hilly and the horizontal banding that is so typical of sedimentary rock was clearly visible in many of the hillsides. This rock is also very light in color, making the soil almost white wherever it showed through the vegetation. This is in sharp contrast to the dark tan soil of our home on the coastal plain. \n \n I had done my homework before this trip by reading Impact No. 35 and Impact No. 151 by John Morris of the ICR. It should be noted that each Impact article ends with the following statements: \n \n All ICR staff members adhere to a Statement of Faith in the form of two documents: \"Tenets of Scientific Creationism,\" and \"Tenets of Biblical Creationism.\" (see Impact No. 85)\n We believe God has raised up ICR to spearhead Biblical Christianity's defense against the godless dogma of evolutionary humanism. Only by showing the scientific bankruptcy of evolution, while exalting Christ and the Bible, will Christians be successful in \"the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ\" (Disclaimer on all ICR Impact articles)\n \n Just those statements should lead you to doubt the scientific intent and competence of these people. However, if you read Impact No. 85, there will be no doubt in your mind that their purpose is not science. In fact, they don't even know what science is. \n \n But I digress. Impact No. 35 tells of John Morris' study of the Paluxy river tracks. He begins with a brief history of the site. Under the guise of \"The Geologic Time Frame\" he doesn't deal with the geologic time frame but with his perceived problems with the \"evolutionists\" position, complete with quotes from \"uniformitarian scientists\", admitting the weakness of the scientific position. \n \n He then launches into the \"Proper Identification\" of the tracks. Much of this section is correct in that it deals in differentiating between tracks (of unspecified source) and erosional effects. And of course, \"seldom does one find a perfect footprint in the Glen Rose formation...\" \n \n He then discusses the fraud tracks that were sold during the depression. I find it strange that these frauds do not weaken the creationists opinion of these tracks while they frequently hold out the Piltdown man as evidence of how evolution is false. Creationist reasoning forever baffles me. \n \n The \"Formation of the Tracks\" section has more to do with the geology (that wasn't really covered in the geology section) and yet more problems with the \"evolutionist\" position. \n \n This is followed by a section on the \"Proper Interpretation\" of the tracks, complete with Biblical citations and a story of how the men and dinosaurs were running for the Llano uplift, basement rock that Morris claims was being uplifted during the flood. \n \n He concludes with information of how more tracks of men are being discovered almost continuously. \n \n In contrast, to the 8 1/2 pages of text that make up Impact No. 35, Impact No. 151 is 3 1/4 pages. It is a justification of why his interpretation had been wrong and why the \"man-tracks\" are actually dinosaur tracks. It seems that over the 15 years that the tracks had been exposed to erosion, the trails had not degraded but had improved due to the erosion of the softer infill. Morris lists six \"mysterious points\" that caused his error. While I won't list his six points, I think his conclusion is interesting. \n \n Even though it would now be improper for creationists to continue to use the Paluxy data as evidence against evolution, in light of these questions, there is still much that is not known about the tracks and continued research is in order. We stand committed to truth, and will gladly modify or abandon our previous interpretation of the Paluxy data as the facts dictate. (From Impact No. 151)\n Let me translate. 'I was wrong - dead wrong. But rather than admit that my incompetent twisting of geology and paleontology to conform to my preconceived notions when I am shown to be wrong - dead wrong - I will pretend that there is still the possibility that human tracks may be present and must be investigated, even though not one of these so called \"man-tracks\" can be shown to be anything other that that of a dinosaur or an erosional effect. I will claim that I am interested in the truth rather than the interpretation of the evidence according to my personal understanding of the Bible - in other words - my personal interpretation of the Bible is the truth.' \n \n Armed with this knowledge my wife and I progressed toward Glen Rose and the Paluxy. About a mile from the entrance to Dinosaur Valley State Park we came upon the \"Creation Evidences Museum.\" \n \n This is a 40 x 14 portable building at present, but a new facility, financed by donation, is being built. [update: May 5, 2003. Almost 4 years later the \"Creation Evidences Museum\" is still in the same portable building. The new building does have glass in the windows now, but the inside is just unfinished concrete. The eves are just dirty plywood. But inside the new building is a huge hyperbaric chamber. More below.] Inside is a laugh. Running almost the entire length of the left wall is a painting that depicts the creation according the Baugh. On the right are the books for sale. The rest is made up of pictures (a few) and some casts of paluxy tracks, and some dinosaur models. It is ironic that none of the dinosaurs depicted in the museum are those that made the tracks in the river. Of course, these casts are \"man tracks\". \n \n One of the casts I recognized immediately from Baugh's web site. It is described as a human track (a giant, by the way). The big toe is clearly visible and the other four toes are turned under, probably because he slipped. I did some experiments, and to turn one's toes under in that way, especially while walking would be quite painful. Besides, there was no impression of the underturned toes, only the outline. I'll come back to this later. \n \n At any rate, the museum \"tour\" consists of a 45 min. video of Carl Baugh talking about each of his exhibits. Most of the time was Mr. Baugh talking about the series of globes in the painting on the left wall, which is his story of creation. It is laughable at best and directed at scientific illiterates. Some of the \"high\" points (or low points - depending on your point of view).\n \n Mr. Baugh claims that we learn from paleontology that \"everything in the past was bigger.\" \n \n Mr. Baugh states that quantum mechanics tells us how God stretched the firmament. \n \n Mr. Baugh claims that the stretching of the universe means that time runs faster at the edges than at the center (the earth) and this explains why stars appear so far away. \n \n The best part was when I went back to examine the hyperbaric biosphere (it looked like a diver's decompression chamber to me). Mr. Baugh claimed that the snake inside underwent physiological changes because of his chamber - which proved something - I'm not clear on what and there was no one to ask. When I looked in side, I found that it was a different snake (and one that I could not verify was real). But as I was wondering how they fed that snake in the hyperbaric chamber (since I could see no pressure lock pass through, I noticed that the door was open slightly. That cleared up a lot. \n \n Also there were two Pacu Piranha (one of the vegetarian species of Piranha). Baugh claims that although they are known to grow as large as his in nature, his grew faster because of his increased magnetic field (because everything was larger in the past and the magnetic field is decaying). I noted that not one of Baugh's \"experiments\" had any semblance of a control whatsoever. \n \n It was a good laugh. My wife kept hitting me on the arm because I kept laughing and getting dirty looks from the fundies present, most of whom seemed to suck it all up. My wife told me later that she could tell that I wanted to shout \"that's bullroar\". \n \n I've gone on and on and haven't even got to the interesting part - the real tracks in the river. At one point I looked down and found that I was looking at a track that was almost identical to one of Baugh's \"man-tracks\". As I carefully examined the series of prints of which this \"man-track\" was a part, it became apparent that it was the track of a Pleurocoelus (a sauropod), one of the three types of dinosaurs who's tracks have been found. Following the same path were the prints of an Acrocanthosaurus (theropod carnosaur). \n \n It was hot and dry, but loads of fun. The river was quite low which made track viewing quite easy. And by chance I discovered why Morris and Baugh were fooled. They spent their time looking down at the tracks and failed to look up. Above the meander of the Paluxy are steep walls that are 60 to 70 feet high in places. These deposits were laid down during the flood according to creationists. Then how does on account for the several layers in which the tracks have been found? What about the layers below? It seems that at several times during the flood year the flood waters receded while dinosaurs and men ran about. The Llano uplift story doesn't fill the bill. Why is there more than one stratum with tracks? \n \n A neat day that makes me able to discuss Paluxy and Baugh and his museum with some first hand knowledge. If you ever go to Glen Rose and you find that time is limited, Baugh's museum is somewhat like paying $2 to see the fat lady at the side show while your friends go to the circus and see the flyer do a quad. It just doesn't compare. During the dry season, pick the river over the museum every time.\n",

   "What is YEC?\n\n \n You ask good and fair questions Steamroller. I will attempt to explain the disagreements between it and evolution to you in response to your specific questions. YEC is Young Earth Creationism which is NOT a scientific theory but is the SPIRITUAL acceptance that since God is the great I AM with no beginning or end, that His explanation for our existence and how everything came into being according to the Genesis account is correct, even though we can't prove it according to scientific standards. Although creationists attempt to explain the Genesis account by explaining the observable evidence, that isn't what we rely on in order to believe as we do.\n \n \nWhere is Glen Rose?\n\n \n Glen Rose Texas is near Paluxy where these images of Dinos and humans laid down tracks in soft mud while that mud was still obviously fresh. This means they traveled near to each other within hours of each other according to the impressions. Here is a photo with zoom capability for a close up look at the evidence. http://www.bible.ca/tracks/taylor-all-14.jpg It seems unlikely that the dino tracks remained malleable for 65 million years until man came along and walked through the same mud.\n \n \nWhen did the \"theory of evolution\" become conclusive fact?\n\n \n Plainly said, it hasn't been proven conclusively at all. But secular humanists have learned that if you tell the same lie enough times and insist that it is the truth, then that lie becomes true. This controversy is all about interpreting the same evidence differently and the massive assumptions which evolutionists must accept as facts in order to believe as they do. \n \n In virtually every aspect of evolutionary science, the accepted facts are unprovable and unverifiable according to the absolute laws of physics and the required scientific methodologies which every legitimate science relies on. Just consider what I say objectively; this pseudo science proposes to tell us what occurred approximately 4.5 BILLION years ago when they have no hope of confirming or verifying any of this through reproducible experiments which is required for coming to absolute scientific conclusions in every other field of science.\n \n They will claim that the existing symbiotic chain of life which is an organized food and ecosystem of animal hierarchy from plants up to the apex creatures in every environment came to be by accident and random mutation. They have no way of proving any of this absolutely yet they claim these assumptions are absolute conclusions based on verified evidence, which is an absolute lie according to even these very scientists when pressed for the facts. \n \n \nExactly what part of the Biblical account of creation has been conclusively proven to be false?\n\n \n It is impossible to prove that the biblical account of Creation is false. It is only possible to insist that it doesn't fit with the evolutionists interpretation of the available observations in the natural world. I admit that we must trust in the creation account by faith. But evolutionists claim they know what is actually unknowable regarding what occurred starting with the so called big bang 14+ BILLION YEARS AGO, and ending with the random and accidental emergence of life 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, according to their fairy tale. \n \n It takes as much or more faith to accept the evolutionists beliefs than it does to accept that everything we see was created by an intelligent God when one looks at the reality of how this world works with an objective eye. \n \n \nMy questions are not rhetorical, I'm seriously in search of the answers. I've read alot of insults and belittleing of one another over differing views, however I have not been able to decipher answer to these questions.\n \n Thanks in Advance\n\n \n I hope this explanation helps you to understand the issue, from the Creationists perspective at least. I am dealing with a school of thought which is sanctimonious and condescending in that you will now get responses which insult my intelligence and claim my commitment to ignorance and denial of the facts rather than actually produce any undeniable and verifiable facts at all. \n \n Here's what I mean. Every bit of so called evidence they produce which speaks about fossils from millions to hundreds of millions of years old, when we see the result of murdered bodies which were dumped, found after six months, and which were consumed and carried off by animals in the wild on the daily news. To billions of years of alleged cosmological observations as if we have all of the existing facts which would have or could have occurred at that time in order to come to these conclusions.\n \n Here's an experiment which follows the decomposition of a piglet in dry and protected conditions which prevents its corpse from being carried off, which defies real world conditions. But even though, you will see through pictures and video how bizarre the claims are that these fossils have survived many millions of years when this pig was pretty much consumed by nature between 50 and 365 days in pristine conditions. \n Decomposition: Stages of Decomposition",

That is why I specifically asked if evo. could be positively proven, and if creat. could be \"dis\"proven.\n \n The result is, again, as I suspected. On the face of it, both seem to require a substantial component of faith. I also agree with you that evolution requires far more blind and unsubstantiated faith, then creationism does, and more specifically Christianity.\n \n My conclusion is that evolution is basically a given set of \"facts\" that point in a direction. The student is then required to \"believe\" the \"facts\" are beyond reproach, and that the coinciding \"theory\" that is used to fill in the gaping holes between the \"facts\", is absolute.\n \n Sounds like faith.\n \n Creationism, (Christian), is basically an historical account of our existance based on documents dating back as far as 1400 BC. Given in a \"story\" form, the accounts leading up to the birth of Jesus, are a set of \"facts\" that can neither be proven, or disproven.

As a creationist, it's not important for me to commit to a belief in whether the earth is old or young, since I'm not a geologist or biologist. Something I don't see referenced much in these discussions is the possibility of earth consisting of old material, while while being in orbit around the sun for a relatively short time.

Decay rate has not changed\n 2. Initial parent/daughter ratio is known\n 3. Daughter/parent isotope has not been lost.\n \n 1. Radioactive elements have always decayed at the same rate (and the speed of light has remained the same) - this is proven by the fine-structure constant.\n \n 2. The initial daughter/parent ratio is irrelevant when you are using techniques such as the isochron method, which works out the initial ratio as part of the calculation.\n \n 3. You can see if any of the daughter/parent has been lost/gained by doing methods such as uranium-lead dating, where two dating methods are carried out simultaneously and the results compared - so anomalous results are quickly made obvious.\n \n You've brought this up a great many times - and the response has been the same every time, at which point you have either quit the thread, cut/pasted an article which supports you and then quit the thread when it, too, is debunked, or made non-specific, unfounded claims (remember the \\'five different ages\\' claim, anyone).\n \n Oh, and as I'm here - direct proof that light from a star has taken <150,000 years to get here.\n \n EDIT: As to your response about how YEC is necessary for Christianity to have any point - firstly, could you respond to my post in the 'YEC=Christianity' thread? As you may have noticed, it's kinda relevant.\n Secondly, I don't think that it's necessarily the case. The Pope certainly doesn't see a problem...\n When approaching Genesis from a metaphorical point of view, you get the following factoids:\n 1. God created the universe.\n 2. Man has the ability to disobey God. (free will)\n 3. When Man disobeys God, he sins.\n 4.

   "Sort of true, but the 'faith' that you need for evolution is the same 'faith' that you need to believe that the sun will rise tomorrow - it's based on the near-overwhelming evidence that you have gathered so far. You just can't prove it for sure.\n \n A more precise analogy would be that it's the same 'faith' you need in order to believe in forensic science, only not as much, because there is a lot more evidence. Evolution is just one case, and a lot of people have devoted a lot of time trying to crack it. Furthermore, we can observe evolution happening today - the recent 'swine flu' outbreak alone is proof of this.\n \n I'd recommend having a look at Omphalos. If it interests you enough, have a look at a post numbers #1 and #9 in this topic. I gave a fair amount of though to the subject a while ago - I still welcome any input you may have.\n\n \n \nRegarding the bolded above, balderdash!!! Forensic science is based on confirmable and reproducible science which takes no faith at all to accept since it's DNA which either exonerates or convicts the accused. If evolution was based on such absolute outcomes we wouldn't be having this discussion. That you have the audacity to compare evo to forensic science and then claim forensics requires more faith than evo when you can't confirm even one assumption you hold as true in evo with any absolutely proven evidence which could only have occurred as you claim it did shows your blind bias and prejudice in favor of this pseudo science.\n \n Here's my response to your \"this topic\" link. I'll let that answer stand as to why the two belief systems are untenable. http://www.4forums.com/political/312909-post13.html\n\n First let me respond to the fact that you completely ignored my challenge to you that a good analogy for evolution is forensic science, but forensic science requires more faith than evolution does.\n \n \nWhen you say 'you can't confirm' - you mean 'every time you've done so I've ignored it'.\n\n \n No, I mean that there are many scientific evidences which I have posted which have shown the inconsistency in the various dating methods. Evidence which shows that the claimed consistent decay rates have been affected or influenced by either natural or unknown events in the past that can only be guessed at causing these discrepancies in decay rates. Also, go back 4.5 billion years and prove that not only did these decay rates exist exactly as they do today, but that all of the radioactive elements existed then.\n \n \nLet's take your favourite - radioactive dating.\n Your three 'unprovable assumptions' are: \n 1. Decay rate has not changed\n 2. Initial parent/daughter ratio is known\n 3. Daughter/parent isotope has not been lost.\n\n \n Radioactive dating isn't my favorite at all. It is just one of the sciences which can't be relied upon to say that the earth is 4.5 billion years old or that fossils are anywhere from millions to hundreds of millions of years old. The flaws and assumptions in this method of dating goes much deeper than just decay rates so you have only touched on one aspect of its flaws which lead to the questionable and unreliable outcomes science relies upon to determine how long life on earth has been here.\n \n \n\n EDIT: As to your response about how YEC is necessary for Christianity to have any point - firstly, could you respond to my post in the 'YEC=Christianity' thread? As you may have noticed, it's kinda relevant.\n\n \n Post a link to it.\n \n \nSecondly, I don't think that it's necessarily the case. The Pope certainly doesn't see a problem...\n When approaching Genesis from a metaphorical point of view, you get the following factoids:\n 1. God created the universe.\n 2. Man has the ability to disobey God. (free will)\n 3. When Man disobeys God, he sins.\n 4. Free will is inherently sinful.\n \n From 4, we now need someone to come along and solve this problem - remove the 'inherently', and just leave everyone with the sins they choose for themselves, rather than having the choice itself be a sin. Enter Jesus, stage left.\n\n \n Since when do I or any real believers base their theology on the pope or the corrupted doctrines of the Catholic church? And since when have I ever condoned approaching Genesis from a metaphorical point of view? And why should I take anyone seriously for a rational debate when they have such little comprehension of spiritual issue that they can believe that free will is inherently sinful? \n \n Now, deal with the fact that evolution claims we evolved from lower animals. This negates the creation account which states that God created us in His image. And if man evolved from lower animals over millions of years, how did we end up in the Garden with only one rule to abide by which we broke and fell from grace because of? I saw no account in evolution which included a personal relationship with God anywhere. Evolution preaches that we came about by completely natural processes through random mutation. Purely by accident according to your religion of evolution.\n \n So how do you now inject God, the genesis account or Jesus later death for our sins into your theology which doesn't allow for any of it in the foundation of our origins? Can you explain that inconsistency iangb? Here's the problem, when what you rely on for a main theology is a fairy tale as evolution is, you can compromise and fill in the gaps with anything which will hopefully silence the opposition. But I can't and wont compromise the truth I KNOW in order to marry it with the lies you rely on.",

   "\n The result is, again, as I suspected. On the face of it, both seem to require a substantial component of faith.

Minor mutations occur in individuals over generations. If these mutations are beneficial, the animal has a slightly better chance of survival and passes the mutation on to its off spring. (For example, a slight mutation that makes the animal run slightly faster may mean that it can better escape being eaten by predators.) Over time these mutations lead to animals evolving that cannot inter breed with each other &#8211; a new species has evolved.Basics of Evolution - Info Barrel\n \n The word BASICS implies the fundamentals of evolution, so don't claim that the original claimed events which resulted in the alleged first single celled organisms isn't fundamental to the Theory of Evolution.

Are you that simple, or were you being dishonest again?\n \n \nThat's the point tq\n\n Your point is that it doesn't support your assertion that abiogenesis is part of the ToE?\n \n \nthe link clearly states this: The theory of evolution teaches that the complex life forms on Earth that we see today (mammals, birds, insects, plants) evolved over millions of years from much simpler life forms (bacteria, single celled organisms) via a process called natural selection.\n\n Which, again, and as you agree, says nothing about abiogenesis being part of the ToE.\n \n \nThat life evolved from single celled organisms\n\n OK, so we agree on one thing that the ToE says.\n \n \nand it also says this: \"Evolution\" can help explain how life first appeared on earth:\n\n and that would be wrong.\n \n \nThe origin of life remains very much a mystery, but scientists have learned how primitive building blocks of life (nucleic acids, amino acids etc) could have formed and organized themselves into simple life forms (self-replicating, self-sustaining bodies).\n\n And that is correct. But linking abiogenesis to the ToE is not.\n \n \n If this isn't attributing the process of abiogenesis to evolution, then I don't know what does. But your denials, squirming and blustering will continue as usual as you attempt to support and defend the lies which your false religion represents.\n\n OR, and I'm going to go out on a limb here, I could be right and your source could be wrong. Seeing as how I and everyone else here has been telling you for years that the ToE has nothing to do with how life arose, I'm going to guess that's the correct explanation. But of course, you're going to ignore what we've all been actually stating and insist that you're inaccurate source is what we're actually arguing, even though we're flat out telling you that it's incorrect.",

   "Like I said, here's the post you linked to: http://www.4forums.com/political/353146-post26.html Show us where he said what you claim. I asked that last time and yet again all we get is cheap lip service and unsupported insistence that you're right. And you even redacted the evidence (LINK)which could have proven your point.\n\n \n Come again? Where did I do anything of the sort? \n \n \nNow show where he uses the words abiogenesis or the big bang in that post.\n\n \n Don't need to. He specifically mentions the creation of matter and how the secular view of it requires more faith in the context of evolution. \n \n \nAhh, but you did by implication. You never referred to his posting history, but to his postings.\n\n \n Come again? That's the same thing.  Do you suffer from a mental disability that reduces your ability to understand the written word? \n \n \nAs it turns out though you still need to prove that claim since the post you quoted doesn't support your assertion.\n\n \n I'm not sure that means much from a person who declared math to be atheism. \n \n \nBecause he didn't lump anything together. He was commenting on a debate between evo and the creation account. Only in your small mind does that mean he is making a purposeful statement linking the big bang, abiogenesis and evo together since you must read into what someone says and can't comprehend what they actually say.\n\n \n Except when he discussed the origin of matter, how life arouse and how it got here all in one post and then declared the religious view of it to require less faith. Huh. Sure he didn't lump them all together. He just talked about all three as one view point and why the opposing one of Creationism is more believable. Right........No lumping there. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nSorry, I didn't allow for your birthday, you're 20 now, huh! And how sad is it that you deny your own name. What are you afraid of anyhow?\n\n \n Uh...I call cashburn and that new guy Yankee Fan because I actually know it's the same guy. His postings are nearly identical sans the reduction in insults and his tactics are verbatim. Who is Patrick and how am I any similar besides disagreeing with you (which, btw most people here do)?\n \n \nHow can it be refuting anything if it wasn't a part of the discussion in any way schmuck?\n\n \n Who gets to decide it wasn't part of the discussion? Faith by definition has no evidence. No evidence has no tangible scientific foundation. No foundation means to derivable tangible uses. Therefore, something that has no tangible uses compared to something that does is actually faith based opposed to the thing that HAS tangible uses. \n \n If I can make a product from evolution, that ain't faith. If I can't make it from creationism, that's faith. Not hard. \n \n \nWhat does this statement have to do with products allegedly derived from evolution? Answer: [NOTHING AT ALL. IT IS YOU COMPLETELY IGNORING HIS STATEMENT AND CHANGING THE SUBJECT OUT OF THE BLUE WHICH I SAID 2 POSTS AGO!!!\n\n \n Incorrect. I was merely proving his statement on faith is not valid as the facts, principles and foundations of evolution have led to a variety of commercial, tangible products. Creationism has produced nothing but propaganda. No drugs, no foods, no management tools, no geological products, nothing of use. Evolution is not faith as its foundation and evidence produce goods that directly contribute to GDP. Creationism cannot even attempt to come close. So which is more faith based, the thing that makes goods or the thing that cannot? \n \n \nSEE? More diversionary off topic attacks which don't deal with what is being discussed at all. At least you're consistent Pat, a consistent putz that is... emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n It was merely pointing out you're a hypocrite. \n \n \nSo you're admitting that it has been discussed already and you fell back on that debate subject thinking it was a place where you would have an advantage rather than responding on topic to the point Steamroller made which is quoted in bolded above, right? You admit that you are a coward who must redefine debates when you have no intelligent response to another poster.\n\n \n See above. I was pointing it out because faith based ideas produce no tangible products where non-faith based ideas do produce products. You falsely claimed evolution produced nothing. So I cited the thread where we had at least 15 different goods and services. Very simple. \n \n \nYou mean arose, don't you?\n\n \n Technically no one knows. A better phrase would be \"life came from non-life.\" \n \n \nPlease learn the basics of the language before attempting to sound intelligent beyond your means. And this is an easy request and maybe it will shut you up from lying and categorizing this evolution whenever it suits you when you know very well that it often encompasses the process of how original life began. I quote the first paragraph in the link titled\n\n \n The irony is that everyone else has pointed out how you've completely failed here. I do find it amusing you look for anything you can hit us with when you cannot even understand TOE. \n \n \nThe theory of evolution teaches that the complex life forms on Earth that we see today (mammals, birds, insects, plants) evolved over millions of years from much simpler life forms (bacteria, single celled organisms) via a process called natural selection.[/U\n\n \n Thanks for proving that your statement was wrong. That life came to be by natural selection and not just random mutations as you previously stated.\n \n Arch Wrong as usual.\n \n \nThe word BASICS implies the fundamentals of evolution, so don't claim that the original claimed events which resulted in the alleged first single celled organisms isn't fundamental to the Theory of Evolution.\n\n \n Except that your own paragraph does not talk about how that cell came about.\n \n Where in the basics does it say that life came from non-life as argued by abiogenesis in that? \n \n Show me. You claimed that evolution talked about the origin of life. Where does it say that? Or are you lying again? You're already wrong in your statement that just random mutations were the cause and your own link states so. So are you going to fess up and admit you're wrong about abiogenesis as being part of evolution? \n \n Abiogenesis is not fundamental to evolution. Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. How can evolution CARE about things that don't have alleles much less talk about them? Does Finance talk about paint strokes? No. At some point paint strokes may become vaguely important to finance in a business, but Finance does not talk about the finer points of Art. In the same way, abiogenesis is not part of Evolution.\n \n You have utterly failed to show that abiogenesis is a part of evolution.\n \n \nSo note the underlined. Gee, they must be confusing abiogenesis with evolution little child.\n\n \n Where? All your quotes say is that evolution started on the first cell and then over time through NATURAL SELECTION (which you omitted in your original statement) that life came to be as we know it. It says nothing about how life first came to be. \n \n Your capacity to understand the written word is quite disturbingly low.",

   "Don't need to. He specifically mentions the creation of matter and how the secular view of it requires more faith in the context of evolution.\n \n \n Just to clear a few things up, Obviously ToE and Creationism do not answer every question an inquisitive mind may ask.\n \n My belief, is that God created the world that way, specifically the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob. To take God at his word, is to understand that He \"breathed\" matter into existance. He \"breathed\" life into Adam. He \"spoke\" light into existance. Therefore evolution, adaptation or Abiogenesis, are all His creation and in the end, anything we can \"create\", \"manipulate\", prove or dis-prove are all done with the toys He has allowed us to play with.\n \n I asked the questions I did \"IN THIS THREAD\", because it sounded as if ToE had been unquestionably proven, and I wanted to know more. \n \n \n \nExcept when he discussed the origin of matter, how life arouse and how it got here all in one post and then declared the religious view of it to require less faith. Huh. Sure he didn't lump them all together. He just talked about all three as one view point and why the opposing one of Creationism is more believable. Right........No lumping there. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I may very well have lumped them all together. It seems to me that if you want to discuss the origin of life, and it is argued that life \"accidentally\" occurred from some kind of primordial mass, then you must discuss the origin of the original soup. I don't know, call me silly!\n \n \n \nWho gets to decide it wasn't part of the discussion? Faith by definition has no evidence. No evidence has no tangible scientific foundation. No foundation means to derivable tangible uses. Therefore, something that has no tangible uses compared to something that does is actually faith based opposed to the thing that HAS tangible uses. \n \n If I can make a product from evolution, that ain't faith. If I can't make it from creationism, that's faith. Not hard.\n \n \n If you're asking, I would say that my faith is actually based on evidence. I would also offer that Mother Thereasa was a pretty good example of a life of unquestionable faith and that the results of that faith is, in itself \"evidence\". \n \n I know that I am getting dangerously close to a circular argument but as I read your statement above I fel that it is dangerously close as well.\n \n \n \n \nIncorrect. I was merely proving his statement on faith is not valid as the facts, principles and foundations of evolution have led to a variety of commercial, tangible products. Creationism has produced nothing but propaganda. No drugs, no foods, no management tools, no geological products, nothing of use. Evolution is not faith as its foundation and evidence produce goods that directly contribute to GDP. Creationism cannot even attempt to come close. So which is more faith based, the thing that makes goods or the thing that cannot? \n\n \n I think your assumption of proving my statement wrong with \"facts\", is pretty bold.\n \n Your entire quote above is based on the premise that, \"the facts, principles and foundations of evolution\" are infallible and yet this has not been conclusively proven to be true.\n \n \"Evolution\" in and of itself can not produce anything, and as you argue, niether can \"Creationism\". However, I would agree with you that the \"belief\" in evolution and the manipulation of the \"facts\" as we know them to be, can certainly produce tangible and intangible results. The \"belief\" in Creationism, and in God also produces tangible and intangible results as well.\n \n \n \nSee above. I was pointing it out because faith based ideas produce no tangible products where non-faith based ideas do produce products. You falsely claimed evolution produced nothing. So I cited the thread where we had at least 15 different goods and services. Very simple.\n \n \n If you have ever accomplished anyting that was outside of your comfort zone, you first had to have faith that it could be done before you ever started. We may just have faith in different things.\n \n In conclusion: Folks, I don't pretend to know everything about anything. I don't come to this forum to make you believe as I do, and there are certain areas that you will not convince me to believe as you do.\n \n Through His word God has proven to me that what He inspired to be written is in fact true and infallible. (not to be confused or interpretted that \"Christians\" are infallible),The evidence comes in a variety of ways not the least of which is through prophesy.\n \n If you are truly interested, read Josh McDowell's \"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\". He proves, in my opinion, conclusively that Jesus was and is who he says He is. Josh provides evidence that shows that the odds against one man fullfilling just 60 of the over 400 prophesies concerning Jesus stand at over 1 to the 19th power.\n \n This is not \"theory\", it is tangible proof. Don't argue with me take it up with God.;)\n \n Symantics prove nothing. The Baptist's prove that, with the arguement \"once saved aways saved\" and if you backslide you were never saved in the first place. The athiest asks \"if God can do anything can He make a rock so big that He can't lift it.\" \n \n I have learned much from this thread, now I have to go find another one so I can tell somebody that the UAW sucks!emoticon_xagree",
