   "I'm constantly watching news on people begging for this wonderful thing, the 'lectric car. \n \n Does anyone ever really think this stuff through?\n \n Looking for answers here.\n \n 1) If we get plug-in cars, do we hook them to our houses for juice? Or, will there be filling stations?\n 2) How long will it take to recharge them? Will it be quick or will I end up whinnying over being late all the time because I forgot to 'charge the old hoopty'? \n 3) Will these things be easy to fix or will I need a rocket scientist and NASA equipment to repair my hoopty?\n 4) If I have to plug these things into my home to charge em up, how much will that cost in terms of seeing my next 'lectric bill? Will this increase in DEMAND cause my power bills to go up severely over time since ALL the XXXXXX out there will hook their hoopties up too? What about fire hazards to my home...you know, the 'fire was caused by electrical problems' thingy?\n 5) With this increase in demand, how the HELL is our wimpy power infrastructure going to handle it? Already there are black outs, brown outs and even 'rolling power outages' in some areas where demand is high. And all the mothers out there have a NIMBY attitude to new power plant construction. If they do make more power plants in or near cities to help out, will this off-set the pollution savings many think electric cars will cut back on? What kind of power plants would be best for juicing up these magic 'clean' cars?\n 6) Will having one of these things get me laid? Just asking. I'm actually more concerned about the evil 'rays' they may emit that would render people infertile or mess with their brains and make em paranoid. 'Lectricity does stuff like that. I don't want to drive around in a giant bug zapper with my jewels at risk much less have 'grave concerns' over getting it on in the back seat. \n And, what about the 'rays' affecting baby development? Will I have to have a special car seat with tin-foil hat for the kids to prevent their development from being affected? \n 7) Could I hook my 'lectric car up to bicycle pedals to have some sort of recharging method? That way all on board could pedal as we drive to keep the car juiced up cheaper? When doing so, can I be barefoot and wear a tiger skin shirt? Can I call my passenger Wilma? Going on that, could I attach a trailer to the car's hitch and fill it full of cycle pedals so that my indentured servants can assist in keeping it powered up with me...or for me?\n 8) Since I doubt new power plants will be made to help power these things, is it okay to propose that we should return to some form of Semi Legal Anti-Voluntary Employment policy so the unskilled masses can be used to help me get to my Tennis, Golf and Hop-Scotch matches? I figure I can stack half a dozen S.L.A.V.E.'s in the back trailer with some kibble and water and let them peddle for 18 hour days to keep my lectric car charged. Their waste can be recycled too since it's all organic.\n \n \n Okay, any answers?\n Well, at least to some of my questions?\n \n Will the next generation of 'lectric cars be a litter...with the sports models haveing track shoes on their bearers?\n If Detroit goes under like it should, 3 million litter bearers coming to the market should help make that a reality.",

   "1) you can plug them into a normal 13 amp socket overnight for a full charge, or a filling station with a 200 amp socket can deliver an 80% charge in around 10 minutes (these figures are for the Tango, Commuter Cars which is not yet in production), some places are also working on swappable batteries, so you go into a filling station and pay to have your empties replaced with charge batteries.\n 2) covered\n 3) most electric cars have a motor on each wheel, and otherwise use pretty standard wheels, bodywork etc. Electric motors are electric motors, I don't know but I'd guess for most people if a motor goes you just swap it out.\n 4) estimates vary, but significantly less than petrol, figures quoted suggest anything up to 600mpg equivalent cost. Most charging is expected to be done overnight when demand is otherwise low. If they become really popular then you will start to see an end to off-peak electricity rates.\n 5) renewables are obviously best, not least because fluctuations are less of an issue when you're charging a battery so charging stations for batteries (the aforementioned battery swap idea) will be able to trickle charge batteries over time and make use of extra power on windy and sunny days.\n 6) Ever sat with a laptop on your knee? If so your balls have probably had it already.\n 7) onward: never mind.",

   "1) 10 mins is a long time to charge relatively speaking...but, in some cases no so much. Being the uber nerd (yah Warhammer) I recall a game called Car Wars printed in the 80's set in todays time where the cars were 'electrically' run. Some of the answers given seem to reflect that. I would be interested in seeing how a batter swap thing works. What would happen if the service station gave you a busted battery (one that doesn't keep a charge). Things like that. And, who will change the battery? Is it something I can do in a 3 piece suit? Something a little old wimpy lady can do? Or would they have to be man-handled by a service guy...for a possible fee. Like the good ole FULL service stations of olden days. If the batteries are easily removed will this eventually lead to a new style of theft?\n 3) Just today, I covered a news segment on the NAIAS in Detroit. At the Auto Show, they had a 'cut away' of one of the new electic cars with the battery stuff running along the center of the car...on appearance, it looked very star-treky. Already, many auto repair people have been complaining about difficulties in getting information on repairing standard cars (too much computerization and copy-right protection IIRC) IMO, it'd appear that electric cars would be the same...only more so. To the point where you have to take it to the dealer to get it fixed. I personally prefer the local Jo. Recently I took my current car to the actual dealership and they didn't even have the parts on hand for simple repairs. They were also more expensive and less accurate...PLUS, I was bombarded by the salesmen to 'upgrayedd' (with a double D for a double douse of them trying to pimp me) to a newer car...when mine isn't all that old to begin with.\n 4) I'd like to eventually see some figures for this. A 600mpg equivelent would be nice but, I really don't think the US infrastructure could deal with it in the short term. Hopefully, it'll be gradual transitions (like often happens in real life) and the infrastructure will be built up as demand increases...but, I do have doubts. Mostly in high population areas of the US like the West Coast and North East. \n 6) Nah, I avoid all things that have 'rays' in them. I don't trust the gubment. LOL\n \n On 7), I think adding on such a device could help out a bit. Run out of juice in the middle of nowhere and you can just decide to peddle power it to get you to a filling station or keep your heat/AC running until help arrives.\n Plus, I think the Fred Flinston image might have marketing appeal.\n I'm sure that peddling will be bery ineffective but, beats doing nothing in an emergency.\n *runs off to see about marketing and producting such a device...so TM that baby*",

   "The battery swap idea is, I think, still in its infancy. There is some suggestion that standardised battery packs and compartment doors will make the process fairly automated, to the point where a small forklift will take out the battery pack and replace it. Given the weight of the batteries, it would take quite a while as a manual operation. That said, we're not talking somewhere that needs to be greased or oiled, it's just several hundred laptop batteries stuck together, so there's no reason you'd get particularly dirty doing it. I also imagine the compartment would be locked, much like the boot of the car.",

   "Forklift is right for a battery swap, most electric vehicles have the chasis of a tank to support the weight. And weight means more power needed to push forward reducing range, which is the major downside of electric vehicles.\n Fine for a city runabout perhaps, but some of us actually have to travel large distances and would run out of charge in the middle of nowhere. You've got to be looking at 60 - 100 miles range as a minimum for a viable vehicle. As such nothing cuts the mustard yet.\n Of course the weight also has significant issues for handling, ie; brakeing distances, expect to see a lot of rear end shunts/pile-ups/knocked down pedestrians if these get onto the road.",

   "I think my main concerns are those who's cars end up being roughly worn (the hoopty) and dilapidated after a few years and how that may affect the electric car's performance.\n Currently, most of those driving hybrids and such now, tend to be anal-retentive snobs who see their purchase as much as a status symbol as it is practical in saving on gas. Akin to the techies who have to have the latest, updated gadgets...for me, the guine-pigs of the world who end up wasting their money on betamax's.\n \n I also am concerned over the power drain a LOT of these types of cars will hve on the power grid when they end up more mass-marketed. Sorry, some large population areas are barely supported by the current power grids as it is.\n Couple that in with weather and other related power outages can lead to a massive freeze as the cars people need to travel about in, have no source of power to recharge off of over night. In my area (north KY, southern IN) we had residual hurricane winds that knocked most everyone off of electricity back in Sept. While such freak weather conditions are rare, it is possible that global warming will increase it. In my area, power outages due to XXXXXX knocking over power polls are not uncommon meaning a night or so without electricity.\n Often, some people hook up a GAS powered generator to run their lights. fridge and such during these events. While I don't think a bunch of gas powered generators used to power up residential cars and homes will negate the enviornmental savings of electric vehicles, I do think they will pose more fire, theft and carbon monoxide poisoning risks (I cover CO related problems a lot in the news). I do see a possible boom for those who invest in generator making companies. And, as such, gas stations selling gas will be needed for a while to come. So, weening ourselves off of petrolium will be a long time in coming.\n \n I'm also concerned over the long term environmental poisoning the manufacture of electric batteries will have. Is it worse than gas refineries or the manufacture of current cars?\n I know a lot of people have the new LED light bulbs that contain a bit o' mercury. We're instructed to recycle those things in a controlled manner...but, seriously...most people don't follow those mandates. And in the end, all that mercury vapor adds up and can pose a serious health risk and environmental contamination in a generation or two.\n I've already covered some news where playgrounds and other sites (homes for example) are built on top or near landfill sites that often are later to be found contaminated and leaking toxins into the soil and water.\n \n In the end, I just wonder if these 'improvements' are really going to be such...or just a massive sleight of hand trick that presents something worse behind a facade of awesomeness and razzle-dazzle with all the details not discussed or hidden in some obscure place in ultra fine print.\n \n Although, with clever marketing and adaptations people psychologically tend to make over long periods of time where you just end up accepting things as 'always being that way' and 'things in the past were faaaar, faaaar worse!' I'm probably just a tempest in a tea cup.",

Tesla Motors - how it works\n Charge At Home or On the Road\n Plug your Tesla Roadster into its at-home High Power Connector unit, and you'll be fully charged in about 3.5 hours. But we consider this a \"worst case\" for someone starting with a completely dead battery. Even after a 100-mile trip, you can be completely charged in less than two hours.* And should you need to charge on the road, packed away in the trunk is an optional Mobile Connector that lets you charge from most standard electrical outlets while away from home.\n This thread caught my attention when the Tesla came up because I'm considering buying one.",

   "Perhaps, but you can refill a fuel tank in minutes.\n Ultimately a family car will have to do a fully loaded (2 Adults, 3 children, 2 weeks luggage) annual run from Manchester to Paris via Dover-Calais. In a conventional car that means a 5:00am start, 2 stops for fuel and arrive in in Paris just after rush hour. With Electric you're going to be looking at doing that in one powerpack, perhaps you could use some sort of auxiliary powercell but that cuts into your luggage space (Try persueding your wife she doesn't need that many clothes changes...:P).\n The case may be moot, the Tesla uses Lithium cells, that compares with the new Zinc-Air cells developed by Energizer which have 3X the power:weight ratio of Lithium and the much vaunted Hydrogen Cells which have 10X power:weight ratio of Lithium.\n Electric cars have been coming for as long as I can remember but ultimately they still aren't here yet.",
