   "Zionists Want to Evade Blame for Coming Iran War\n \n The largest Jewish newspaper in the United States, the Jewish Week, has expressed concern that Americans are learning the truth about the Jewish political and media influence driving America toward war with Iran. Here is how the article begins: \"President Bush is risking a backlash that could injure the Jewish community -- and his own cause -- by repeatedly citing Israel as his top rationale for possible U.S. military conflict with Iran, Jewish leaders and Middle East analysts warned this week.\"\n \n Of course, the entire plan for an Iran War is about Israel and not the United States. Israel is behind it, the neocons are behind it, and the Jewish extremists that have such disproportionate influence in the media are behind it.\n \n But the extremist Jewish political and media powers continue to push for a war with Iran that could well drive the price of oil into the stratosphere, unleash terrorism across the globe, and usher in worldwide economic and military Armageddon.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=8833\n \n \n \n .",
