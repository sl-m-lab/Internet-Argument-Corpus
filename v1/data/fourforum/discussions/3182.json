Without survival, nothing else has meaning. And America is not willing to sit idly by and let anyone else EVER threaten our survival. If we do not jocky into position, someone else will, without a doubt. So we stay at the front of the pack and we never, ever give it up. Who deserves the power of choice? The country that strives the hardest. It's not only our duty to our country, but to the rest of the world, to set the example. Think of the chaos the world could have been in if Russia and triumphed? Relatively speaking, they weren't doing as well as a nation then, and certainly aren't now (splintered). We can never know, but I would venture a guess our way of life wouldn't be what it is today.

It's why no matter whether you see democrats or republicans in office, we still set aside about 1/2 of our revenue for military spending. No matter how anti-war...we still put half into our military machine...because we made this country by taking our destiny into our own hands, and we'll continue to do so until everyone else get's their **** together ;) One day there will hopefully be a more homogenous culture, but for now it's still game time.\n \n We did some pretty evil things in every war we've been in, but with reason.

Notice when he began to interrupt him, and you'll see that it was right after the kid accused him of exploiting 9/11. \n \n But, like Jim's Trucking pointed out, Liberals tend to point out only the part of the interview that makes them look good. If interrupting a guest is so rude, why didn't PNAC point out the hundreds of other guests O'Reilly has interrupted? Why did he choose to only show a victim of 9/11? Because he took advantage of an idiot kid whose father died on 9/11 to make O'Reilly look like some hateful, demeaning person. O'Reilly has acted that way on many occasions, and this surely wasn't the first\n \n If he wanted to show a rude host who interrupts his guests, why didn't he use Chris Matthews or Alan Colmes?",

We actually assume they all are, all the time. I have no doubt our intelligence agency observes every major player's dirty tricks, just as they get wind of some of ours. Only surprising to the public, certainly not to those in the appropriate public service positions.\n \n Interestingly enough, this could be part of the reason why we are lied to as the public, regardless of the fact that this is \"our\" country. When our government wants to pursue it's win-at-all-costs strategy, it just puts up a facade.\n \n 1. We're going to war to defend ourselves from terrorists (official reason sort of).\n 2. We're going to war because Iraq has and is preparing to use WMDs\n 3. We're going to war because Iraq is linked to terrorism, specifically 9/11.\n \n While these have been shown to be ridiculous reasons on the face, they serve the purpose of not showing our cards to the international community. The real reasons remain viewed by the media and by the public as \"attacks\" on republicans by liberals, rather than legitimate reasons. Sort of convinient isn't it? It's like that southpark episode. We can do one thing, while saying another, and everything is \"OK\".\n \n I agree that in the game of earth, the huge population and fast growing economy of the Chinese can put them in the running. This is a concern, no doubt. As is the European union, also poised to pass us if they finish the union they started (getting a better flow of commerce and information between each country that makes up the union with English as the common language). I also think this is a direct reason why we don't care about how many immigrants come flooding in, or how many illegals we have here. We need to keep the population increasing if we're going to keep pace. Europe faces a strugle up ahead since in many of their countries, they have little or negative population growth (births - deaths). \n \n I think as long as we have Europe as an ally, we have a little less to fear of China in the short-term. But both are certainly capable of equaling or surpassing the US if they play their cards right and we don't send them back to the starting line.\n \n This doesn't mean that the US won't go down swinging either. In fact, if it becomes obvious we aren't going to get the gold medal, we will certainly put on our best smile and offer our hand...in friendship. Can't beat'em, join'em sort of thing. \n \n I think though that we aren't so hostile towards the major powers because they major powers are capable of fighting it out economically rather than through killing in most cases, and that's a win-win for both sides. Which is exactly what we would prefer. The end-game has got to be some global economy and culture, I don't see the end-game being a shoot-out between the US and any other big player. We could very well be owned by another country though. \n \n -Mach",

They aren't looking out for the interests of the average american. They are interested in feeding the military-industrial complex so that the US will be a \"global leader.\" Their philosophy is one of global American hegemony (similar to the British Empire.)\n \n The problem with this is that no other country wants to be \"led\" by the US or to become a colony or satellite of the US (except maybe Liberia). You can stay \"ahead of the pack\" without 'fighting and winning multiple wars in multiple theaters.' Actually by doing that you will anger every other country who will want to defend themselves against the US. The US would be seen as an imperialist agressor (and it would be.)\n \n The idea that we \"triumphed\" over Russia and that Russia could have \"triumphed\" over us in some way through the cold war is an illusion at best. Russia's government splintered and its economy tanked. Did we \"triumph\"? Was that our doing? Were they ever a rival economic power? Nah. Are they still pretty capable as a military power? You bet. I can't see where anyone \"triumphed.\" This has nothing to do with PNAC anyway.\n \n As for setting an example: What example do we set by systematically eliminating our rivals by force? Is that how the next superpower will eliminate us? \n \n PNAC is all about overthrowing regimes around the world that aren't so friendly to our values, those values being American economic dominance.\n \n These, so far, are just arguments against PNACs overt philosophy. The one that they publish in the open. Their actions behind the scenes are quite suspect. \n \n Here is what they say in the open:\n From:http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf\n Things like this make you go hmm:\n \nFurther, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor.\n \n Well, they got their new Pearl Harbor. Now the \"transformation\" can take place. We have already started with Iraq, our new colony.\n \nControl of space and cyberspace. Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce - defined global powers in \"international commons\" be a key to world power in the future. An\n America incapable of protecting its interests or that of its allies in space\n or the \"infosphere\" will find it difficult to exert global political leadership.\n \n\n I have problems with the words \"control\" and \"exert.\" Especially when it comes to cyberspace. It has a Big Brother ring to it.\n \n Anyway, they talk like they are simply for preserving American military preeminence, but they throw in \"exerting global leadership\" as a bonus. Unfortunately, to \"exert leadership\" we have to bomb people. The more we \"exert our leadership\" on countries that do not want it, the closer we get to ww3.\n \n To answer your question as to why I am opposed to PNAC, it's because they are espousing a philosophy of American imperialism/colonialism. It goes against everything America was founded on.",

   "I never pay attention to the threads once they move down the list, so I missed this one.\n \n PNAC is not about survival. It is about domination. They aren't looking out for the interests of the average american. They are interested in feeding the military-industrial complex so that the US will be a \"global leader.\" Their philosophy is one of global American hegemony (similar to the British Empire.)\n\n Domination in this context ensures survival. One and the same. And who is doing the dominating? The senate? The house? The presidents who get the boot after 4-8 years? The public servants at the pentagon who get median salaries? No, we all benefit from the safety it provides and the status it bestows. I think the philosophy is a \"democratic\" hegemony. Our government is well aware that a signficant portion of this country is owned, in debt to, or otherwise dependant on other nations. Thats' on the rise, not the decline, as your \"global dominion\" would imply.\n \n \nThe problem with this is that no other country wants to be \"led\" by the US or to become a colony or satellite of the US (except maybe Liberia). You can stay \"ahead of the pack\" without 'fighting and winning multiple wars in multiple theaters.' Actually by doing that you will anger every other country who will want to defend themselves against the US. The US would be seen as an imperialist agressor (and it would be.)\n\n So...survival vs making someone else angry at us. OK, can I vote on this because it seems an easy choice. You can choose to be loved or feared...both can be effective, but feared is usually more efficient.\n \n \nThe idea that we \"triumphed\" over Russia and that Russia could have \"triumphed\" over us in some way through the cold war is an illusion at best. Russia's government splintered and its economy tanked. Did we \"triumph\"? Was that our doing? Were they ever a rival economic power? Nah. Are they still pretty capable as a military power? You bet. I can't see where anyone \"triumphed.\" This has nothing to do with PNAC anyway.\n\n Russia's decline was in large part due to the pressure we applied during the cold war. They made the choice to stretch themselves too thin to compete, and it feel apart. Sure it has to do with the philosophy of PNAC, it's about smacking down anyone who opposes our foreign policy.\n \n \nAs for setting an example: What example do we set by systematically eliminating our rivals by force? Is that how the next superpower will eliminate us? \n Probably. What in history would lead you to another conclusion?\n \n \nPNAC is all about overthrowing regimes around the world that aren't so friendly to our values, those values being American economic dominance.\n\n Yes, this is consistent with the aim to be the leader in the world, to ensure our survival and to bring about a better overall global civilization.\n \n \nThese, so far, are just arguments against PNACs overt philosophy. The one that they publish in the open. Their actions behind the scenes are quite suspect. \n \n \n \nHere is what they say in the open:\n From:http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf\n Things like this make you go hmm:\n\n \n What they say in the open makes me go insane with anger. They list out all these ridiculous weapon systems that aren't necessary for dominance yet Bush can't send our troops to Iraq with good body armor. XXXXXX. I'm all for military spending..but I have never entertained the notion that they spend it wisely.\n \n \nWell, they got their new Pearl Harbor. Now the \"transformation\" can take place. We have already started with Iraq, our new colony.\n\n Exactly, and I drive a Japanese auto, which is a better car than any american built car....courtesy of the american rebuilding process which sent some of our finest quality control experts to japan, where they put it all into practice and lived it...and rebuilt their nation...quite a success story IMO. I could only WISH Iraq could end up like Japan. Heck, I wish parts of America could end up like Japan (parts!). \n \n \nI have problems with the words \"control\" and \"exert.\" Especially when it comes to cyberspace. It has a Big Brother ring to it.\n\n Choose someone else's big brother or our big brother, there is no other option. I choose the US big brother.\n \n \nAnyway, they talk like they are simply for preserving American military preeminence, but they throw in \"exerting global leadership\" as a bonus. Unfortunately, to \"exert leadership\" we have to bomb people. The more we \"exert our leadership\" on countries that do not want it, the closer we get to ww3.\n\n You have a point here certainly. I don't know who to blame though. I think the rush into a woefully unplanned war was all Bush's administration. I think with a better leader in this country we could meet our requirement for global dominance, but in a much more inspiring and noble way. Bush isn't big on inspiring, working overtime, reading...really isn't big on anything that you might normally attribute to a great leader. Blow, booze, and bullying are more his style. The policies are just a reflection of that attitude to some degree. What did we expect? He's a rich kid who partied. Who would ever dream of placing someone like that at the helm of our great nation?\n \n \nTo answer your question as to why I am opposed to PNAC, it's because they are espousing a philosophy of American imperialism/colonialism. It goes against everything America was founded on.\n\n \n I disagree wholeheartedly with that last statement. This country was founded by destroying almost completely the native americans, colonizing, killing anyone who stood in our way including our own countrymen (the english), and in general, killing ever since when something didn't go our way or when someone else was waiving a big stick a little too menacingly. That's how this country forged. Mixed in of course with some philosophically sound forefathers who actually read the history books and applied the knowledge (take notice Bush). The willingness to defy and to kill for our beliefs...that's why we're hear discussing it.\n \n It's the second part that drives the first. We don't seek dominace because it's enjoyable or fun or matches our idealistic views...it's a REQUIREMENT that allows the world's compasion and ideals to flourish.\n \n -Mach",

   "This is typical of most Liberals. You take some quote out that makes a guy look bad, and don't explain anything about it or what caused it. \n \n If you listened to the interview, O'Reilly actually said he respected his opinion and said it was sincere, but marginal. But the guy continued to interrupt O'Reilly, who is the HOST of the show. The guy also accused O'Reilly of exploiting 9/11, and O'Reilly pointed out how he had given so much to their families, and responded \"Keep your mouth shut\", because the guy blatantly lied about him exploiting the victims. O'Reilly offered the guy numerous instances of uninterrupted time. However, the guy would not let him speak. \n \n This guy is an absolute idiot. Just because his father died in 9/11 does not mean we need to treat him above everyone else. I sympathize with him about his father, but I could care less about his radical beliefs and would have personally told him to shut up as well.\n \n And the guy was against going into Afghanistan because he didn't want to \"brutalize and oppress the Afghanis.\" Is he serious? I bet his father turned over in his grave when he heard that.\n \n O'Reilly said \"In respect for your father...\" and continued to get interrupted, repeatedly, and told him to \"Shut up\". He again tried to say, \"Your father worked for the Port Authority, and in respect for your father...\" and was interrupted again, where he then told producers to cut his mic.\n \n I suggest that, from now on, you give a brief synopsis of the events instead of pointing out what you want to point out to make someone look bad. If you want to do that, I have plenty of quotes to give you.\n\n \n Why bother? O'Reilly's show is his job, and probably to some degree, his LIFE. His success isn't measured by his truth or falsity, or his keen insight or his conservatism or liberalism. He's a multi-millionaire who has forged his career in pseudo-journalism and he's obviously doing quite well in that regard. That's the context O'Rielly belongs in.\n \n \n -Mach",

Once they were defeated, it was our responsibility and in our interests to make sure they had a stable government that was friendly toward us. This does not mean that we should get pro-active and start wars with countries so that eventually every gov will be on our side, buying our products, selling us theirs. Not starting a war is not giving up.\n \n \n\n But not practical IMO. I'd like it to, but I'd have to have \"no crime whatsoever\" to agree to it :(\n\n Thoughtcrime is death. How could I forget. Whenever BB decides you have committed thought crime, or any other \"crime\" then you too will be hauled off.\n It's only practical.\n \n \n \nBush is the commander in chief. He calls the shots by defnition. No shrugging that off. He appoints his cabinet too, if you suspect that's who he listens to.\n\n Bush is commander-in-chief. That is pretty sad isn't it? \n And while he did have the final say in who the members of his cabinet would be, the decision was made with heaps of advice and PRESSURE. He originally wasn't going to go the neocon route. He passed over Dick Perle and Wolfy the first go round. They got ****** and eventually W got talked into it. I think he picked Colin Powell and Condi Rice himelf (who knows). Poor Colin Powell. \n He went to Dick Cheney for advice on who to pick for VP(of course not a cabinet position). After sorting through a pile of candidates, the only one that Cheney seemed to come up with as the best choice was.. himself. Anyway, this is neither hither nor thither.\n \nI agree, if that's the only motivation and it turns out to be the reality, it will not have been necessarily a good thing for the global community. However, even Machiavelli has said that it's the rulers task to get into power by any means, maintain power through any means, but to also pursue the greater good with that power.\n\n I would count off the dictators through the world again that adhered to that philosophy. The problem is that they (and our fearless leaders) may not (and do not) give a poo about what Machiavelli said about the greater good. Power and control (and the struggle for wealth) is about all that matters. If a greater good comes from it, then great, but that wasn't the motive of those in power. \n \n \nThe unfortunate reality is this. In a random system like we have, if you have \"good\" and \"bad' groups, one group will become dominate.

On the global scale, I'd say we need to be both feared and loved.\n . \n \nI don't know if you were trying to say that Machiavelli was a saint or something. emoticon_confused \n Is Mach short for that? I thought it was from Ernst Mach, the physicist.\n Anyway, that philosophy of his applied to princes and monarchies, and could be appiled to dictators (same difference).\n\n No, I view his works as neutral. He didn't kill millions in concentration camps...big difference to associate with one or the other...I'd prefer to keep it neutral if we rely on associations.\n \n \nMany fronts? We are talking \"proxy wars\"? I count Korea (stalemate, did nothing to hinder USSR), Vietnam (we LOST, if anything it drained US). Then there was Afghanistan. That war did drain them militarily, like Vietnam drained us, but that wasn't the cause of the collapse. Vietnam didn't cause the collapse of the US. Pressure or no pressure, the Soviet Union was destined to fail. It was crumbling from within for a long time.\n\n I was thinking of war in multiple theaters on the drive home today, and as much as I think taking the opposite side is a good exercise...I can't figure out who we need to fight multiple wars against either. It all feels to me like a trained boxer picking fights with 14 year old kids. I think teaching and discipline are far more effective at that \"age\". Maybe someone else can come up with a good reason to support PNAC in that regards.\n \n \nActually we have a republic (based on democracy). But, that would mean that at least a majority of American citizens would have to favor world domination. We'd have to have a vote. Yes, for world domination. No, for no domination. I haven't seen the world domination prop on the ballot.\n\n No, democracy isn't straight vote by the people. The people only vote the leader in, the leader doesn't need to check with us on his/her actions. In some cases they get congressional approval, otherwise, they are \"in charge.\" I think that's the only way we could get things done.\n \n \n \nGive up what? Give up wars of agression? Uh, yeah.\n\n Not necessarily aggression...for the greater good. Making the middle-east more stable is a long-term goal that requires short-term pain.\n \n \n \n \nBush is commander-in-chief. That is pretty sad isn't it? \n And while he did have the final say in who the members of his cabinet would be, the decision was made with heaps of advice and PRESSURE. He originally wasn't going to go the neocon route. He passed over Dick Perle and Wolfy the first go round. They got ****** and eventually W got talked into it. I think he picked Colin Powell and Condi Rice himelf (who knows). Poor Colin Powell. \n He went to Dick Cheney for advice on who to pick for VP(of course not a cabinet position). After sorting through a pile of candidates, the only one that Cheney seemed to come up with as the best choice was.. himself. Anyway, this is neither hither nor thither.\n\n :) Yep, poor Powell. \n \n \nI would count off the dictators through the world again that adhered to that philosophy. The problem is that they (and our fearless leaders) may not (and do not) give a poo about what Machiavelli said about the greater good. Power and control (and the struggle for wealth) is about all that matters. If a greater good comes from it, then great, but that wasn't the motive of those in power. \n \n It was for early America..wasn't it?\n \n \nExactly. Where is our peace? Where are our morals? Maybe you are agreeing with me that the bad group has swooped in and taken control. \n \n I hope it's as \"random\" as you say. Skull&Bones may disagree.\n\n I was trying to say, take ANY competitive situation. Handicap one and leave the other without the handicap. Have them play enough times to be statistically relevant. The handicaped side always loses in the end. This is why America cannot handicap itself with things like the UN, like \"no torture\" agreements, like the Kyoto treaty, etc. The second we abide by the handicap, some other country will ignore it, and could take advantage of our hands being tied behind our back. That's a for instance.\n \n \nI'm not sure what you are saying here. \n Reason and rationality cannot necessarily be extended to all humans. We all have the capacity for these things, but they are always in a battle with culture and theology. Reason may not always win (I direct you to the evolution forum.)\n\n \n I think what I was getting at there was that it seems that governments based on things that aren't \"universally accessible\", will not persist. A theocracy is inflexible and isn't accessible to everyone (those not of the faith for example). Dictators don't allow others to replace them while they hold the power, etc. \n \n -Mach",

   "We, and the international community if Bush doesn't tick them off...again..can provide guidance...training wheels until their rolling.\n\n Hopefully it will really be guidance and not coersion.\n \n\n That's human nature, let's not associate it with cruel dictators. I didn't say fear is more effective, I said it's more efficient..in some cases. On the global scale, I'd say we need to be both feared and loved.\n\n It would only be advantageous for those who oppose us to fear us if the fear doesn't translate into desparate acts of violence (like suicide terrorist missions).\n \n\n No, I view his works as neutral. He didn't kill millions in concentration camps...big difference to associate with one or the other...I'd prefer to keep it neutral if we rely on associations.\n\n Well, you brought up fear as a control mechanism. The world leaders who used that mechanism the most tended to be the ones that were also more physically brutal as well. \n \n \nNo, democracy isn't straight vote by the people. The people only vote the leader in, the leader doesn't need to check with us on his/her actions. In some cases they get congressional approval, otherwise, they are \"in charge.\" I think that's the only way we could get things done.\n\n Ok, we have a representative democracy. Sometimes it shows its weaknesses. I think the Iraq war is an example of this.\n \n \nNot necessarily aggression...for the greater good. Making the middle-east more stable is a long-term goal that requires short-term pain.\n\n Well, when you forcefully invade a country, that's aggression by definition. If it's aggression for a perceived greater good, it's still agression. By colonizing a country, it may make it more stable or it may destablize it. Long-term stability of the middle east is definitely a worthy goal, but invasion and colonization doesn't sound like solution based on any greater good.\n \n \nIt was for early America..wasn't it?\n\n Ah, good example. \"Greater good\" is in the eye of the beholder, I guess. If you want to be cynical about it, you can say that the American Revolution was started by a bunch of slave owning white aristocrats that didn't want to pay taxes to the King of England. They set up a system that allowed them to be free of the crown. Their slaves didn't profit from the greater good. \n \n \nI was trying to say, take ANY competitive situation. Handicap one and leave the other without the handicap. Have them play enough times to be statistically relevant. The handicaped side always loses in the end. This is why America cannot handicap itself with things like the UN, like \"no torture\" agreements, like the Kyoto treaty, etc. The second we abide by the handicap, some other country will ignore it, and could take advantage of our hands being tied behind our back. That's a for instance.\n\n Are morals and justice handicaps? How is the UN a handicap to us? It hasn't kept us from defending our homeland. It did try to stop us from colonizing Iraq, though. How is not torturing people a handicap? A tortured person will give you any information, not necessarily true, just to stop the torture. \n \n According to this, a free and open society is a handicap (and it is).\n It's a handicap I am willing to live with. \n \n \n \nI think what I was getting at there was that it seems that governments based on things that aren't \"universally accessible\", will not persist. A theocracy is inflexible and isn't accessible to everyone (those not of the faith for example). Dictators don't allow others to replace them while they hold the power, etc. \n\n Ah, ok, and.....?",
