Schoo health classes need to teach not only about homsexualtiy, but about safe sex and homosexuality. This way kids learn a young age what homosexuality is and that it is nothing to fear or make fun of. It also teaches young gay kids safe sex before they start having it! \n \n I will say this because I believe it to be true but knowing that I am about to raise the christian level of craziness.\n \n If kids are taught about homosexuality young, and that it is just a part of life and no big deal, there will be some big bonuses.\n \n 1) young gay kids will grow up with better self esteem and less isolation. The thinking that I am alone and no one else is like me. This improved self esteem will result in less drug use, better sexual health. Overall healthier kids.\n \n 2) As straight children learn that it is just a part of life that will learn to accept their fellow gay and lesbian humans. resulting in less gay bashings and violence to gay youth.\n \n 3) the suicide rate for young gays teens is still high. Although recent reports show that youth suicide rates have decreased in the past ten years and attribute that to gay tv and higher acceptance of gays over ht last decade. ( I will find that study on the CDC website if you ask, but I am feeling kinda lazy with this yucky cold I have had for 9 days and counting, but getting better)\n \n Teach tolerance young!",

Just as it was assumed that teaching children about their bodies and what to expect during puberty was thought to actually encourage children to experiment sexually. Kids are naturally curious creatures. That's how they learn. But when their only source of information is from peers and lockerroom epitaphs that is what leads to misconceptions. \n \n Although I wouldn't hold my breath on any kind of sexual orientation information being added to public school health classes until gay marriage is a legal reality. \n \n Sadly things like that have always been done in the most backwards of style in the United States.

   "Oh me of little faith...I thought you all would pooh-pooh the idea but alas, the point is debated wonderfully.\n \n Although it is a bit ironic to teach about homosexuality in schools because one of the misconceptions I hear is that if people are exposed to gay anything, they will be influenced and could become \"gay\" themselves. One of the many misconceptions I hope would one day be held to light for it's falseness.\n \n It sad that it took the rising death toll of AIDS victims for schools to consider mentioning anything in schools about condoms and safe sex, and even then I'd hear \"I don't need a condom, I'm not gay\". This is why I brought up this topic because this misconception could and has deadly consequences.\n \n Cyber slap me, but I think this topic needs to be covered in classes. We teach all kinds of things in school to enlighten people so that could go out into the world feeling a little safer, a little more free to make educated decisions and with this, comes more freedom.

It's right up your alley. \n Ugh, there are really only two substancially investigated transmission trails. One camp says it came from \"bushmeat\", which was when a African bushmen ate chimpanzee flesh that was infected with the SIV (Simian Imunodificiancy Virus). \n The other leans towards infected OPV (Oral Polio Vacine) which was cultivated in SIV infected chimp cells and later used to vacinate Rowandan, Burundie and Congo children. \n NEITHER OF THESE THERORIES INCLUDES ANYTHING ABOUT SEXUAL CONTACT WITH CHIMPS! You sicko!\n \n You really have some perverse mind set. You're absolutely obcessed with homosexuality and your attempt to compair it to as well as find a connection with beatiality. \n How you get from Humans with Humans to Humans to lower beasts is quite a stretch. \n \n The mere fact that you would rather believe the idea of humans having had sexual relations with chimps over humans eating Bonzo for diner actually makes me question your diviant mind set. \n \n What's even more amazing is that it's usually HETEROSEXUALS who are the ones with the sexual perversions. \n BS/SM, fetishes, Partner Swapping, Beastiality, Child molestation, \"snuf\" acts which include but are in no way limited to sexual asphixiation...etc. \n Maybe you need to check yourself, especially before you go pointing that finger....GOD KNOWS WHERE IT'S BEEN!\n\n \n OKay, now you see that this is not just a mere obsession with homosexuals for Jaaaman. What causes someone like this to say such terrible things about his fellow humans Justin? Do you think perhaps he was molested or had like super religious parents that spiritually abused him in some way, or perhaps is he himself gay? I think seriously though, this dude needs some major counseling or something.",
