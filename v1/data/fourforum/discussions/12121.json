   "Long live the people of France. Long live Robespierre!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n YouTube - The French Revolution 1/9\n \n Remember what Mark Twain said comparing the Terror of the French Revolution with the Terror of the Monarchy which preceded it:\n \n There were two \"Reigns of Terror,\" if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the \"horrors\" of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror -- that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.\n \n Mark Twain, writing about the French Revolution, \n in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Chapter XIII",

   "One good thing is worthy to note about the French Revolution. Namely, it was largely the fear of having their people revolt as violently as the French revolted that drove monarchs throughout Europe to instigate various democratic reforms. If not for that threat and their fear, then the old style of monarchy might have survived much longer. \n \n Similarly, the fear of the introduction of Socialism influenced elites in the West to allow passage of many of the reforms to the capitalist system that let it continue and thrive in a way that not only enriched the owners but also greatly improved the lives of most of the workers.",

   "The French revolution was followed by Emperor Napoleon and later the restoration of the monarchy.\n \n Marx, Engels and others were a reaction to untrammelled capitalism. The capitalists in every country never reformed, the reforms were pushed down their throats by the unions and the social minded elected politicians.\n Never but never in history, the privileged ones yield one inch to the dispossed even if by behaving this way they just pave the way to revolution (reform the hard way) or changes in the law (reform the easy way)",
