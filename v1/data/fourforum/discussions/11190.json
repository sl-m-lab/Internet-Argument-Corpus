   "Move over \"Gay Agenda\".\n The Fundies have tactics they are employing to insert their own religious beliefs into Science...\n (It goes WAYYYY beyond \"intelligent design\"...)\n The Wedge strategy is a political and social action plan authored by the Discovery Institute, the hub of the intelligent design movement. The strategy was put forth in a Discovery Institute manifesto known as the Wedge Document,[1] which describes a broad social, political, and academic agenda whose ultimate goal is to \"defeat [scientific] materialism\" represented by evolution, \"reverse the stifling materialist world view and replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions\"[2] and to \"affirm the reality of God.\"[3] Its goal is to \"renew\" American culture by shaping public policy to reflect conservative Christian, namely evangelical Protestant, values.[4]\n \n The wedge metaphor, attributed to Phillip E. Johnson, is that of a metal wedge splitting a log and represents using an aggressive public relations programme to create an opening for the supernatural in the public&#8217;s understanding of science.[5]\n \n Intelligent design is the belief that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not a naturalistic process such as natural selection. Implicit in the intelligent design doctrine is a redefining of science and how it is conducted. Wedge strategy proponents are dogmatically opposed to materialism,[6][7][8] naturalism,[7][9] and evolution,[10][11][12][13] and have made the removal of each from how science is conducted and taught an explicit goal.[14][15]\n \n The strategy was originally brought to the public's attention when the Wedge Document was leaked on the Web. The Wedge strategy forms the governing basis of a wide range of Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_strategy\n \n To view the document, go here...\n http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf\n http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html\n \n The \"Discovery Institute\" doesn't deny authorship of the document. Instead, they try to spin it to pretend it doesn't mean what it clearly outlines.\n \n But I ask you this.\n If a scientific organization had ever released a document outlining a similar strategy, swapping the words \"science\" and \"religion\", do you think that religion would think it benign? \n emoticon_xdonno\n \n Let the obfuscational defense begin...",

What we do though, is ask questions based on the numerous assumptions that science makes regarding the origins of life on Earth. And your science never answers those questions at all but reverts to attacking us as ignorant for asking the questions. And I will prove that right now by asking a question that reveals a specific inconsistency in your preconceived notions about the origins of life on Earth.\n According to theory of Evolution, our Sun derives energy by the thermonuclear conversion of hydrogen into helium, deep inside its core. There is convincing evidence that the Sun is getting at least half of its energy by this method. Such a thermonuclear source could power the Sun for nearly 10 billion years. Most scientists think that the Sun (along with the rest of the solar system) is about 4.6 billion years old, which means it would have exhausted approximately half its 'life'.\n \n Over the Sun's lifetime, the thermonuclear reactions would, according to theory, gradually change the composition of the core of the Sun and alter the Sun's overall physical structure. Because of this process, the Sun would gradually grow brighter with age. Thus, if the Sun is indeed 4.6 billion years old, it should have brightened by nearly 40% over this time.1\n \n Evolutionists maintain that life appeared on the Earth around 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, the Sun would have brightened about 25%,2 though there is some uncertainty in that figure.3 This would appear to present a temperature problem for the evolution of life and the Earth. With the current hand-wringing over global warming, one would expect that such a large difference in the solar output would have greatly increased the Earth's temperature over billions of years. Yet most biologists and geologists believe that the Earth has experienced a nearly constant average temperature over the past 4.6 billion years, with perhaps warmer conditions prevailing early on.4 The problem of how the Sun could have increased in brightness while the Earth maintained a constant temperature is called the 'early faint Sun paradox'.\n \n Just how great is the problem? A simple calculation can be made assuming that, over time, there has been no change in the Earth's reflectivity or the ability of the Earth to radiate heat. While this approach is almost certainly unrealistic, it is useful to illustrate the problem. With these assumptions, we find that a 25% increase in solar luminosity increases the average temperature of the Earth by about 18\u00b0C. Since the current average temperature of the Earth is 15\u00b0C, the average temperature of the Earth 3.8 billion years ago would have been below freezing (-3\u00b0C). Thus when life supposedly was just beginning, much of the Earth would have been frozen.\n Even with such a low average temperature some tropical portions of the Earth may have remained ice-free. Naturally, evolutionists could argue that life developed in the warmer areas and then held on until the Earth warmed. However, there are at least two problems with this.\n \n Most geologists seem to insist that over the past 3.8 billion years the average temperature of the Earth has not changed that much. If anything, temperatures before 2.5 billion years ago would have been warmer.\n If the Earth had ever been mostly covered with ice year round, then its average temperature would have been even cooler than the -3\u00b0C mentioned above. The increased ice cover would increase the reflectivity of the Earth, reducing the heat absorbed from the Sun. This is a common problem with the popular idea of multiple ice ages-once one commences in earnest, the increased reflectivity due to additional ice cover leads to decreased solar heat absorption that is difficult to reverse toward a warmer climate. (The Oard model of a single post-Flood Ice Age caused by warm oceans and volcanic dust in the atmosphere does not have this problem.5 As the volcanic dust eventually dissipated, the oceans provided the heat to melt back much of the ice cover.)\n \n Planetary scientists think that while the Earth and Venus are very similar, Venus' closer proximity to the sun gave that planet an initial temperature higher than that of the Earth that led to a runaway greenhouse effect. As a result, today Venus has the hottest surface temperature in the solar system. Conversely, Mars is a very cold planet today, yet there is abundant evidence that, early in its history, liquid water once flowed on its surface, indicating that Mars was much warmer. Most researchers say this happened about 3.8 billion years ago. However, at that time the Sun would have been 25% fainter than today. Therefore, the early faint Sun paradox provides a very different problem for Mars: why was that planet much warmer when the Sun was at its faintest?\n \n With the obviously disastrous results on our nearest planetary neighbours, how did the Earth avoid a similar fate? How did the Earth's atmosphere manage to evolve in such a delicate fashion? One possibility is that it just happened that way. The geological and biological processes removed greenhouse gases at exactly the same average rate to compensate for the increased solar luminosity. What would be the probability of this happening by chance?\n \n Because the evolution of such a delicate balance is so improbable, some have suggested that the Earth's biosphere behaves as a giant single organism. This pantheistic idea, seriously proposed by scientist James Lovelock, has been dubbed the Gaia hypothesis, after the goddess of the Earth. Repelled by the teleological connotations, many scientists reject the Gaia hypothesis, opting for the appeal to chance.\n \n Of course, another logical possibility is that the solar system is only thousands of years old. In this case, there is no paradox to explain because the Sun has not been around long enough to increase much in luminosity. Many may object that we know that the Sun is 4.6 billion years old, but that is not true. There is no direct way of measuring the age of the Sun. Our understanding of the Sun's structure does not permit a precise calculation of how bright a 'zero age' Sun should be compared with a 4.6-billion-year-old Sun. All that we can conclude is that the older Sun should be brighter than the younger Sun. The 4.6-billion-year age comes from the alleged age of meteorites, and it is assumed that the Sun is the same age. Of course creationists reject the billion-year age for meteorites as well. Now this is just one of numerous contradictions and inconsistencies regarding how science concludes how life came to be on Earth. It strains credulity that conflicts like this question of the young Sun has been ignored by the community that seeks objective confirmation of its theories and claims that all the pieces must fit before promoting a theory publicly. This question is taken from the very ignorant and dumbed down AIG, so it should be very easy to answer for you enlightened evolutionists, right? And I expect a straight and concise answer if that is at all possible. \n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v15/i2/faintsun.asp",

That's a humorous touch.\n \"Global warming\" involves MAN-MADE changes to the atmosphere, so bringing it up here BEFORE mankind reached the industrial age is just plain nonsense.\n This whole discussion presumes the atmosphere hasn't changed in billions of years, which is NOT a good assumption.)\n \n \n \nYet most biologists and geologists believe that the Earth has experienced a nearly constant average temperature over the past 4.6 billion years, with perhaps warmer conditions prevailing early on.4 The problem of how the Sun could have increased in brightness while the Earth maintained a constant temperature is called the &#8216;early faint Sun paradox&#8217;.\n\n And you can bet dollars to donuts that the ACTUAL RESPONSE to this issue is never realistically addressed in this article...\n Nope.\n \n So I'll quote it here:\n The tension between the two hypotheses stems from the incorrect assumption that atmospheric gas concentrations in the past were the same as today. First, before the advent of abundant life the atmospheric oxygen concentrations were orders of magnitude lower than today. In the presence of oxygen methane breaks down to carbon dioxide, so in the absence of oxygen the methane concentration could be much larger than currently observed. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so the relative abundance of atmospheric methane throughout Earth's history must be considered when modeling the temperature.\n Further, the inorganic version of the carbon cycle can be expected to provide negative feedback towards an Earth with liquid water. Carbon dissolved in liquid water can form carbonic acids, which can then interact with calcium to produce calcium carbonate. If rainfall were to cease and the oceans froze over, then this part of the inorganic carbon cycle would shut down. Periodic explosions from volcanoes would then cause a net increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels with no liquid water to absorb these emitted gases. Eventually the concentrations would become large enough that the surface temperature would rise due to the greenhouse effect. When the surface temperature became large enough for the oceans to melt and rainfall to resume the other half of the inorganic carbon cycle would turn on and moderate the greenhouse gas concentrations.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_sun_paradox",

The 40% figure is irrelevant because life wasn't around then anyway.\n \n You don't even read these things, do you.\n You just toss out quick replies off the cuff, without regarding the validity of the comment made.\n \n \n \nI mean, it's your secular science that promotes the cooler young Sun Peeling so you can't have it both ways. And as usual, you completely ignored the very obvious problem with your science claims that Mars was warmer 3.8 billion years ago and had flowing water even though it is further from the Sun than Earth is. How is that possible if the Sun was cooler then?\n\n Do you realize when you have completely jumped the track of discussion, and moved onto something completely different?\n What does this have to do with evolution?\n \n Does a question of water on Mars actually impact evolution at all?\n NO.\n \n But to address the question at hand, you assume that only the sun is involved in heating, and that factors like planetary thermal heat, or the atmosphere, are to be disregarded.\n Here is one discussion on the issue.\n Under either the warmer-and-wetter or the always-cold scenario, Mars must have had a thicker atmosphere in order to support water that flowed on the surface even only occasionally. If the planet's atmosphere became thinner, liquid water would rapidly evaporate. Over time, carbon dioxide gas reacts with elements in rocks and becomes locked up as a kind of compound called a carbonate. What's left of Mars' atmosphere today is overwhelmingly carbon dioxide. \n On Earth, shifting tectonic plates are continually plowing carbonates and other minerals under the surface; heated by magmas, carbon dioxide is released and spews forth in volcanic eruptions, replenishing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Although Mars has no known active volcanoes and there are no signs of fresh lava flows, it had abundant volcanic activity in its past. However, Mars appears to have no tectonic plates, so a critical link in the process that leads to carbon dioxide replenishment in Earth's atmosphere is missing. In short, Mars' atmosphere could have been thinned out over many eons by entrapment of carbon dioxide in rocks across its surface. \n http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/why.html\n \n \n \nSo rather than mock me and my sources, why not just objectively consider the problems with your world view and seek a truthful answer?\n\n A \"truthful\" answer would question why your article claims \"exactly the same average rate\" is required.\n There is no reason to require \"exactly\" at all.The geological and biological processes removed greenhouse gases at exactly the same average rate to compensate for the increased solar luminosity.",

Points 1, 2 and 3 (incidentally, I updated while you were replying, to add more detail) apply nothing more than straightforward logic to the figures you cited. Remember, you're claiming inconsistencies within old-earth theories - all I need to do in reply is show that they are internally consistent. I don't need to go trawling off around the web finding all the original scientific papers. And do I really need to prove life can live three metres below the surface of the ocean?\n \n Point 4 - meh, if you aren't going to accept multiple independent evidences of the age of the solar system, it's hardly worth my while linking you to the scientific investigations establishing the rate of cooling of the earth. :)\n \nIf AIG is not an acceptable source, then neither is TO which is simply dedicated to opposing anything that refutes or questions the evolutionist belief system.\n\n Did I say your source was unacceptable, or criticise it in any way?

Please desist.\n \nwith your science claims that Mars was warmer 3.8 billion years ago and rad flowing water even though it is further from the Sun than Earth is. How is that possible if the Sun was cooler then?\n\n 1. 'Warmer' is relative; we're not talking Earth-warm here.\n \n 2. Mars is literally bulging with evidence of long-dormant vulcanism - the very process which fills the atmosphere with a variety of greenhouse gasses. Because Mars is much smaller than Earth it cooled a lot quicker and became less volcanically active more quickly. Greenhouse gasses are absorbed into surface silicates or, thanks to mars's lower gravity, lost into space - if you don't replenish them, they will not continue to trap the heat of the sun or the radiant heat from within the planet. Thus Mars's 'warm, wet' period was comparatively brief.",

This will also answer some of the stuff below.\n \n If the sun has a useful life of around 10 billion years (before entering its red giant transformation stage), then that does not mean that 4.6 billion years is its half-life (half its life is different from its half-life). The 'half-life' of the sun (the time it takes to use up half its fuel) would be much shorter than that.\n \n Imagine 4.6 billion years ago the sun started out with 100 'units of fuel' (unspecified units for this calculation). One half-life later it would have 50 units left, then 25 after 2 half-lives, 12.5 after 3, 6.25 after 4 etc etc.\n \n The reason I bring this up is that your article seemed to think that if the sun were 4.6 billion years old out of its 10 billion year life then it would have brightened by around 40% (making the assumption that it used up 40% of its nucler fuel). But that would only be true if it were using that fuel in a linear fashion (ie 10% in the first billion years, 10% in the next billion, 10% in the next etc). It wouldn't!\n \n So, if the sun has used up half its life, it will have used up far more than half its fuel. The rate at which your article claims it will be getting brighter will be wrong. If it brightens as it uses up its fuel, then its rate of brightening will decrease over time (as there is less fuel to get used up).\n \nIf you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life.
