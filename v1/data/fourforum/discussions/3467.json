You have centripetal force acting on the water, pushing it away from you at the axis of rotation, and holding it against a solid object, the bucket. \n \n The rotation of the earth actually forces the water away from the center, ie out into space. Fortunately for us, the power of gravity is greater than the centripetal force generated by the rotation of the Earth, so the water stays here.:p\n \n Here's a little experiment you can try to understand the workings of centrifugal force. Take a ball and soak it in water, now spin the ball quickly on an axis. Where does the water go?

   "A simple school experiment i learnt when i was in 2nd grade at school. Take a bucket and fill it half way up with water then begin to swing the bucket around in the air, tell me what do you have?\n\n \n OMG that's one of the funniest things I've seen. That's almost as bad as the person who thought that the magnetic field is what kept everything on the ground.\n \n The reason that the water stays in the bucket has more to do with inertia than with gravity. When you begin to swing the bucket, it and the water would tend to move in a straight line. The rope that is attached to the bucket that you are pulling on is exerting a force, called centripetal force that is pulling the bucket and water inward. The water stays in the bucket because the bucket is changing directions and the water is trying to still move in that straight line and is slammed up against the bottom. It has nothing to do with gravity. The force is similar to the normal force that counters Earth's gravity and prevents us from falling through the ground toward the center of Earth's gravity.\n \n \n\n Its a mighty statement to call a theory like evolution a fact..\n\n \n It's called the Theory of Evolution.\n \n \n\n You may think you have the facts to back up the theory of evolution, when in actuall fact, without time these facts just turn into kids nusery rimes, just like when the princess kissed a frog to create a prince.

   "Whilst I doubt \"stormboy\" is the sort that is prepared to learn, I thought it worth trying one more time with him. Therefore I have addressed each of his supposed examples of \"perfect order\" below\n \ninfants teach themselves to cry when they are hungry or hurt\nI'm not entirely sure how this is supposed to be an example of order, but it is false anyway. Human babies are born with a crying instinct; they do not learn to cry. As any first time parent will know, adults don't have instinctive \"cry translation\" skills and not knowing why your baby is crying can be very stressful for both baby and parents. Perfect order? No chance.\n \n \nthe earth tilted itself so we get seasons.\nAgain it is unclear why this is an example of perfect order, but let's ignore that. Do we get regular, predictable seasons because of that tilt? Well for starters, the tilt isn't fixed. It rotates like a kid's spinning top (known as the precession of the equinoxes) and each rotation takes around 26,000 years. In addition the andle of the tilt varies by a couple of degrees every 11,000 years or so. The Earth's orbit about the sun wobbles too. In 13,000 years time, the northern hemisphere will be in summer in December. Of course if you believe in a 6,000 year old Earth that is in its end times, then this is moot. If you aren't such a deluded person though, it means that long term prediction of when seasons will occur (and how intense they will be) is very difficult. There is a phrase used to describe such a situation: a choas system. Perfect order? Nope.\n \n \nWithout magnetic poles man would be unable to navigate the trackless oceans of water and air.\nHmm, \"stormboy\" clearly doesn't keep up with modern technology. We navigate using time these days using systems like GPS. Magnetism doesn't come into it. But again ignoring this lack of knowledge by someone we already know to be ignorant of simple science, are the magnetic poles the pefect order we are after? A quick search of the web would reveal that the north pole is moving. See http://www.geolab.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/northpole_e.shtml for where it was when surveyed over the last few years. Note that it's position had to be surveyed each time: it isn't moving in a predictable fashion. No \"perfect order\" here, sorry.\n \n \nHow about the sugar thermastat in the pancreas?, it maintains a level of sugar in the blood sufficient for energy, without it all of us would fall into a coma and die!.\nAh homeostasis. Now this must be an ordered system? It's a \"thermostat\" right? Wrong. Like any biological system, it doesn't fight to maintain an equilibrium, it is a dynamic system that remains in constant fluctuation to better cope with constatntly changing demands. It has been found that a blood sugar level that returns to equilibrium after a meal is a sign of an unhealthy person. Homeostatis is dead: long live the chaos of homeodynamics. Perfect order? \"Perfect order not found. Please check your spelling and try again\"\n \n \nThe human heart will beat for 70 or 80 yrs without faltering...\n\n Garfinkel A., Spano M. L., Ditto W. L. & Weiss J. N. (1992), \"Controlling cardiac chaos\", Science, 257, pp. 1230-1235. Summary: the heart is a choas system. The best way to restore a \"regular\" beat to a heart in arrhythmia is to apply an irregular kick to it. Works far better than a regular \"ordered\" beat.Perfect order? Nein.\n \n \nA kidney will filter poisen from the blood, and leave the good stuff alone. How does it know one from the other.\nA kidney filters everything from the blood then reabsorbs the stuff that the body wants. It doesn't need to know about the \"poisen\" to pick them out. What about water regulation though? Chaos system, soz.\n \n \nWho gave the human tongue flexibility to form words, and a brain to understand them, but denied it to animals.\nIt has nothing to do with the flexibility of the tongue: it is due to the position of the larynx in the throat. All mammals, including newborn humans have a larynx high up in the throat: it lets them breath and swallow at the same time. As a human grows, the larynx moves down the throat and the ability to breath and swallow at the same time is lost, ut the ability to create a side range of noises required for speach is gained. We speak because the system that allows breathing and swallowing to occur together has been broke. Perfect order? Only if you are really desperate.\n \n \nWho showed a womb how to take a fertilized egg and keep splitting a tiny ovum until, in time, a baby woul have the proper number of fingers, eyes, and ears, and hair in the right places, and come into this world when its strong enough to sustain life!?\nWho? I think you meant what. human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is what is responsible for \"showed a womb how to take a fertilized egg and keep splitting a tiny ovum\" as you so inelliquently put it. A wide variety of hormones and other signaling/ gene expression control chemicals are responsible for \"...until, in time, a baby woul have the proper number of fingers, eyes, and ears, and hair in the right places...\" and a series of things are responsible for \"...and come into this world when its strong enough to sustain life!?\", including:\n 1. A reduction in progesterone (progesterone inhibits uterine contractions)\n 2. Decreasing progesterone levels stimulate the synthesis of prostaglandins, which may initiate labour.\n 3. The stretching of the uterus and cervix by the baby's head stimulate the release of oxytocin which stimulates uterine contractions. \n \n Chances that \"stormboy\" may be saved at last by human development within the uterous being \"Perfect order\"?

A religous person is some one that is bound by rules and regulations. Were as with authentic christianity, its all about a personal relationship with the creator that can only be found in the grace of God. If it was all about how good we can become through obeying all these rules and regulations, then christ died for nothing, its only through what he done for us that can bring us to God, there is no amount of good deeds that will ever take the place of such a loveing act God done for us, by sending his son to be mocked, spat on, whipped and then crucified!, just so mankind can be reunited with him!.\n So really its this relationship that i can proudly say i choose to delude myself in!!!, instead of the wordly vices",

Just as we know that the earth continents are shifting, we do know there is speciation within species, these are facts. The problem is however, who is to say that speciation is all there has ever been since the beginning of time. To say speciation is factual evidance for evolution is weak, because all we know of speciation is that there can be changes within a species but there is no evidance that speciation on its own is evidance for an animal to change into a completely differant animal, this is why the fact can only be used to support a theory and not evolution as fact.\n It is true that there is alot of facts that they use to try and support the whole evolution theory, its just that these facts on there own have no grounds to support evoulution as being fact, until they can come up with some strong archaeologcial evidence, evolution will only ever remain a theory..",

You have no answers because your faith does not provide them and you don't care to actually find answers on your own outside of the bible.

Let me explain, the facts a evolutionists would use to support there theory, are excactly that on there own, they are facts, (eg Speciation, this is a fact, we know there is such a thing as Speciation), its just, when they mix these facts with the faith they have in time can they come up with a theory like evolution.\n The differance with my faith, is that there can be no limits on it.\n Luke 1:37- \"For nothing is impossible with God\".\n As for the fingerprints of God, well speciation is one of the many. All the scientist are doing is trieing to get clarification on the prints.\n I really dont care to much for your statement on the book burners, that is the biggest load of rubbish i have come across on this forum yet!!!!\n To follow that line of reasoning you would have to believe that i would believe the major advances that science has made in medicine deserve to be burnt.

Again are we really presenting this theory to the public in the correct manner!.\n I also want to thankyou for clarifieing a few other facts for me..\n Now i have heard it being said on a numerous amount of occasions in the arguments on the side of evolution \"we do not know for certain, we have not observed it, this is why it is theory\". So lets stop here for a moment and disect this statement.\n 1. This is a clear direction from the very side of the evolutionist, on how we arrive to the term of theory..\n 2. \"We have not observed it\", question, why is it that it has not been observed?, and if its not observable, how is it then that from the \"scientific method\" we can include evolution on the same ball park. quote from the very \"scientific method\" site that you led me to, \"Theories which cannot be tested, because, for instance, they have no OBSERVABLE ramifications, do not qualify as scientific theories\". \n Now if it can be said that testing is enother way of saying experimentation, then evolution needs to stand up under the very next statement from the very same site, \"Further, no matter how elegant a theory is, its predictions must agree with experimental results if we are to believe that it is a valid description of nature\", so from the very arguments from the evolution camp, we can come to the conclusion that the very predictions of evolution cant even go through the experimental process that it needs, to be even called a scientific theory..\n STORMY emoticon_cool",

   "\"New Scientist has just published a controversial pair of articles by John Gribbin and Jeremy Cherfas. Summarizing mightily, it seems that: \n \n There are no fossils that are unequivocally ancestral to chimpanzees and gorillas but not to man; \n Therefore, the only good measure of the time when these three species split from one another is the comparison of genetic material; \n Genetic dating and serological techniques are unanimous in dating the chimp-gorilla-man split at about 5 million years ago. \n \n The conclusion that chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans diverged from a com mon ancestor only 5 million years ago is opposed to the widely accepted 20 million years. This conflict in dating is controversial enough, but Gribbin and Cherfas, after considerable fossil analysis, take one more giant step: they suggest that chimps, gorillas, and man descended from an ancestor that was more man-like than ape-like. Chimpanzees and gorillas in this view are descended from man rather than vice versa.\"\n http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf018/sf018p05.htm\n \n Michel Brunet* discovered a hominid skull in Chad a few years back. This discovery make about 16 hominid species known in Africa between 8 to 3 million years ago. Not one bone fragment has been discovered from the ancestors of any of the 12 species of African ape from this period. With no apes in this period (3 to 8 million yeas ago) the question remains &#8216;what could that mean?

Firstly this statement that you have made reinforces an attribute to the evolutionists that i have found to be true. It starts with the world view he or she has to begin with, before they have even begin to look deep into the theory, they are already set in the mindset that evolution is true, and when the evidence begins to be produced to them they begin to pick and choose from that evidence instead of weighing all the evidence up at the same time. They will take that which is suited to the evolution theory then throw the rest away. The problem here is that its not an honest way of assesing the evidence with an open world view. \n See you say that i am ignorent to science, when in actual fact im not at all ignorent to science, i just choose to be open to all the evidence and from that, with commen sense i can come to an honest conclusion..\n The evolutionists will say that to be a creationists its all about faith and nothing to do with science, this is partly true!. See its only when we first take that step of faith that we can use science to weigh up all the evidence to come to a conclusion.\n Jesus said \"I am the way, THE TRUTH and the life\", its only in the truth (Jesus) can we know the truth.\n I can totally understand how evolution can look to some one that does not have God in their heart, there was a time that my world view was the same, however it was only when i asked Jesus into my life, that everything became more clear.\n You may say you have heard this said over and over again. well then if this is the case, it should be telling you something, after all some one who shares their testimony has nothing to gain, they have only got something to lose, their dignity, which they oftenly do, in a world that does not want anything to come in between it and its selfish desires.\n See this debate is a vital one, a persons eternal destiny rests on it. If evolution is true then all that will happen, is that we will rot when we die, however if there is a creator, well then you will want to hope there is nothing seperateing you from him when you do die....\n So i want to invite all you guys to open yourselves up and ask Jesus into your life and wash away anything that would seperate you from God, and begin to the truth from the truth (Jesus)\n STORMY\n \n emoticon_cool",

Please back up your claim that I'm being dishonest when I referred to your post as being about ape evolution?

In fact, now you undo your own criticism of me with regards this argument you made in post 90, because you claimed it was ONLY about 3 types of apes, and now you suggest it involves chimps and man as well. You now give evidence against yourself (see also your 'critique' about what my post had to do with the subject at hand, above).\\\n So, is it just about apes, with no connection to the thread title, or is it about chimps too, in which case are you going to withdraw your half-thought attack where you think I'm confused about primates. It's a pity you don't bear in mind your own previous 'reotorts'.\n Further, I think you are confused between what you think I believe, and what these citations state. The citations I made state that ape-like ancestors may have evolved from more man-like ancestors. It is superfluous to your honesty whether\n a) I believe it\n or whether\n b) it's 'true' in a scientific sense\n I stated \"This is what they believe....\", you stated that their theory stated something else... just that apes evolved. That is how you re-worked it, by rephrasing what you think they said, in the light of what you believe actually happened. Perhaps it was an honest mistake in not having understood what it was they were saying. And I shouldn't have questioned your honesty. :)",

So is the problem that you do this despite not finding it pleasurable, or do you just take exception to me calling such enjoyment \"sick\"?\n \n \nSure, you say they both lose their temper, so I suppose you're going to suggest that when they do so, they do so politely.\nI have already stated that I've never found him rude.\n \n \nYou're a funny man, Clive14, however, your little attempt at deflection still doesn't answer how you know they are the same.\nI have stated in another thread that I have no intention of telling you how to tell they are the same person. \n \n \nWhich is still a mystery that may or may not have to do with your non-sequitur of citing 'set-theory'.\nNo npn sequitor: just a strawman of your making as my criticizing your lack of set theory knowledge was on a different issue (YECs being XXXXXX in case you get confused again).\n \n \n \nI stated that your re-working was that the citations were ONLY about apes.\nAnd you are the only one who feels the need to keep using the word \"only\" in this context. It's Monty misquoting and misrepresenting again.\n \n \nSo, is it just about apes, with no connection to the thread title, or is it about chimps too, in which case are you going to withdraw your half-thought attack where you think I'm confused about primates.\nYou appear to be implying here that chimps aren't apes. To save dozens more swirming posts, I won't claim you are, just merely claim that you \"appear\" to be doing so. Can you clarify what you mean here therefore please.\n \n \nIt's a pity you don't bear in mind your own previous 'reotorts'.\nI read your childish \"(sic)\" after a misspelling on my part. I then read this line by you. I then remembered that you refer to yourself as a Christian. I laughed at the delicious irony of the whole thing.\n \n \nFurther, I think you are confused between what you think I believe, and what these citations state.\nNo, you have just done your usual charging off down a line of assumption without seeking clarification. I in no way feel that the articles you cite reflect your beliefs as they talk about evolution and you reject evolution as conflicting with your reading of your bible. So I now understand your bit about me being dishonest: you had simply jumped to false conclusions about what I'd said. I'll accept your apology in lieu of you learning humility and explicitly doing so.",

   "Not true. Bees use a language to communicate the whereabouts of nectar rich plants. This hardly sugegst they are intelligent though. Intelligent language implies intelligence, not just language\n\n \n \n Your point is misleading. First, the bee did not \"invent\" the language, and this is really the point. Humans use a system of communication they developed, where as the bee is \"born\" with it. It is instinct. I'm talking about higher level language, the kind of language that you would find in our speech, or in a computer code. It is invented, and then learned, not inherited or provided by instinct, so your analogy is faulty. Besides, the fact that we find low level language in other animals just bolsters the case for a creator - that a code was \"created\" and insterted into the biological machine we call a \"bee\". Where is your evidence that comunication developed \"naturally?\"\n \n \n \nDrivel. DNA is loosely analagous to a language at best because of the convention of writing out sequences along the lines of ATTTACCGGAGAG etc. It can spell out \"CAT\", but that hardly makes it a language.\n\n \n \n Maybe it's drivel to you, but not to those educated in this area of study. Scientists have accepted the fact that DNA is, in fact, a high level language http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Speaking_Language_rDNA.html. The fact that you don't see it that way betrays your need to bend toward naturalism, and is in conflict with modern science.\n \n \n \nActually the question is \"is DNA close enough to conventional codes to justify the term \"code\" being applied. The answer is no BTW. So asking who encoded it is like asking who built a sanddune: no one did, it formed through natural processes.\n\n \n \n Reference the above article. Have you ever heard the term \"genetic code?\" If not, you need to study more. From \"Language and Life Sciences\" science journal - \"1977 Frederick Sanger, a British biologist, developed a method to decode all of the DNA strings in one bacteria. This was the first living organism to be totally decoded. \" http://exchanges.state.gov/forum/journal/genome.htm\n \n \n If you are prepared to state that any computer code written today can occur natrurally, we have nothing further to discuss, as it is obvious you have lost your reasoning skills. I'll assume you're not willing to go that far. If not, then explain how the genetic code we have discovered, which is infinitely more complicated than a computer program occured \"naturally\". You need to decide if you're going to work under the same assumption that Darwin did, that the human cell is not impressive, just a blob of protoplasm, or if you're going to accpet the findings of modern science and realize that you have a problem explaining the complexity of the DNA language.\n \n \n \nActually what they are really doing is ignoring silly irrelevent questions from clueless people with a religious agenda to promote.\n\n \n \n Really, then show me how I'm wrong - without dogmatic statements. I would suggest, given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science, deny obvious facts of reason, and cling to evolutionary theory, that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion. I would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science, and start calling your comments what they really are, personal opinion.\n \n -By the way, is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a \"religious agenda?\" Where have I leaned on religion to make my point? And what makes you think that I need religion to defeat your postion as I have here? I've used science, scientific journals, and good sound reasoning to defeat your comments.

I'm not sure what you mean by my \"religious need to hang on to naturalism\" other than it seems like a nice fancy statement, even if it's meaningless.\n\n \n Actually, I think it's quite pertinent. If I can get you to see that you're in the same boat as those termed \"creationists\" with regard to your \"faith\", then we're one step closer to getting you to see that evolutionary theory is meaningless and empty. What's necessary with most evolutionists is to get them out of the protective shell they've developed, where they've convinced themselves that they have the truth, and no one else does. The best way to do that is to show you that the \"science\" you hang on to, namely evolutionary theory, has other areas of science that argue against it. It doesn't exist in harmony with its peers. The reason for this is that it's not really science at all, but faith.\n \n \n \nI noticed that an S. Ji has done a number of papers in which he links linguistics to DNA. I've also noticed he was the only one. \n \n My observation after spending some time on the link you provided and \"studying\" is that DNA researchers are trying to create a system by which to describe and classify the workings of DNA.

They are attempting to classify the workings of DNA, and in doing so, have adopted common english language terms to aid in their description. \n\n \n You're correct, researchers do associate and describe the workings of DNA to language. This is because language best decribes the structure of DNA and RNA. Why? Because DNA is encoded instruction. And you're also correct in making the correlation with mathematics, which is also an accepted language.\n \n \nI know I'll get strung up for disagreeing with a dictionary defintion, but to my mind, simple computer code such as if-<then, and true<-<false, the type of \"grammar\" referred to by the DNA researchers above, is far from being a language, and certainly doesn't classify as linguisitics.\n\n \n I agree that this may be \"to your mind\" however, that doesn't mean that you're correct. The basic idea of language is that it communicates information by way of signs and symbols that are understood by both the transmitting party, and the receiver. What do we see scientists doing? They're trying to decode the language of DNA. They don't fully understand the meaning of the symbols yet, but they see the results. They admit that information is being transmitted and made use of, they just don't fully understand it yet.\n \n \n Maybe that's my religious need for naturalism blinding me to the truth, but I don't think so.\n\n \n That's something you'll have to figure out. I'm just suggesting that you might want to consider the possibility. \n \n \n \nI can see the workings of language as being analagous to the workings of DNA in so far as the nuts and bolts of language, ie grammar and syntax, basic operators. I can also see the workings of language as being analagous to the workings of mathematics, as it would seem to me that basic laws of grammar/syntax are closely related to mathematics. That doesn't mean that the workings of DNA is linguistics or is mathematics.\n\n \n What I see is that they all have one thing in common - communication of information. An idea implies intelligence. How can mindless decent with modification and natural selection construct an idea? How can it design a template that communicates information? One might be able to make the argument that living things are modified by the pressures of nature, and I'd agree, but we see more than that. We see a template for structural design. We see information. Information imples intelligence, and I'm not willing to give the intelligence card to natural processes.\n \n \nIt's essentially a false analogy. While the workings of DNA and linguistics may be analogous at some level, they are certainly not sufficiently interchangable (to the best of my knowledge) so as to prove your assertion.\n\n \n I'm not looking to prove my assertion. I only ask that you appeal to common sense first, before you accept an explanation blindly. I think you can see what I'm getting at. You need to hold on to your worldview that evolution is true - I understand that. However, there is a real question as to why you feel it's necessary to deny the obvious to do so. If you can give me one example in nature where a natural event produced any type of information that is useful or even detectible, I'd like to see it.\n \n \nFurther to that, the analogy that since DNA and linguisitics are analagous, and linguistics requires intelligence so therefore DNA must require intelligence, is also a false analogy.\n\n \n Here's how I see it. DNA is the \"carrier\" of information. DNA is not living, and cannot reproduce itself - it needs the machinery of the cell to do that. It consists of messages transfered by living things, which were received from prior living things etc..During the transfer of information it (the information), can either stay the same, or degrade through mutational loss, genetic drift, extinction, etc.. It will not increase in any meaningful way, unless another informational source adds to it ( and please don't suggest that nature is intelligent.) Given degradation (we always see information degrade), if we looked back over time over the genetic line of any living population, we'd expect to see an overall pattern of increase of their genetic information. No population can be infinitely old, nor contain infinite information. Therefore:There had to be a point in time in which the first program arose without a pre-existing program. Information and messages arise in the mind or in pre-existing messages. I've never see them arise naturally or through natural processes. Conclusion: The programs that existed in the first living things of all organisms must have orignated not by way of natural processes, but in mind.\n \n \nP.S. I've only been to the talkorigins site a handfull of times in my life, I have however spent a great deal of time trying to educate myself on the rules of logic, both at the introductory level in university, as well as at various sites on the internet.\n\n \n If you have studied logic, then you are familar with the structure of a logical argument. Please review my argument above, and tell me where it fails.",

   "Actually, I think it's quite pertinent. If I can get you to see that you're in the same boat as those termed \"creationists\" with regard to your \"faith\", then we're one step closer to getting you to see that evolutionary theory is meaningless and empty. What's necessary with most evolutionists is to get them out of the protective shell they've developed, where they've convinced themselves that they have the truth, and no one else does. The best way to do that is to show you that the \"science\" you hang on to, namely evolutionary theory, has other areas of science that argue against it. It doesn't exist in harmony with its peers. The reason for this is that it's not really science at all, but faith.\n\n \n Please show me, or demonstrate, how I have \"faith\" in evolution? If you want to get into the meaning of the word faith, check out the Proof of God thread in the Religion forum.\n \n I don't have faith in evolution, I believe based on the available evidence that it is correct. \n \n I find it simply impossible to understand how anyone can make a statement like \"evolutionary theory is meaningless and empty\" or that evolution is \"not really science at all, but faith \" if they have a rudimentary understanding of how science operates and been exposed to the evidence that supports evolution, including a vast amount of DNA research.\n \n You haven't in any way presented other areas of science that argue against evolution or that evolution doesn't exist in harmony with other fields of science. What you've done is created an analogy between DNA and language, connected language to intelligence, and drawn the inference that DNA requires intelligence and is therefore not natural. How does that connect to other areas of science disagreeing with evolution? I already asked you to provide evidence for the study of linguistics being incompatible with evolution, you dodged/ignored the question. What other fields of science, besides the possibility of linguisitics, are against evolutionary theory? \n \n \nYou're correct, researchers do associate and describe the workings of DNA to language. This is because language best decribes the structure of DNA and RNA. Why? Because DNA is encoded instruction. And you're also correct in making the correlation with mathematics, which is also an accepted language\n.\n \n Researchers use terminology borrowed from language in an effort to describe the workings of DNA in the most simple and straight forward manner. You've concluded that DNA is a language or \"encoded instruction\", researchers are simply using the \"language of language\" to describe the workings of DNA, they are not stating that DNA is a language. \n \n \nWhat I see is that they all have one thing in common - communication of information. An idea implies intelligence. How can mindless decent with modification and natural selection construct an idea? How can it design a template that communicates information? One might be able to make the argument that living things are modified by the pressures of nature, and I'd agree, but we see more than that. We see a template for structural design. We see information. Information imples intelligence, and I'm not willing to give the intelligence card to natural processes.\n\n \n What \"idea\" was constructed?\n \n Raw info does not require intelligence. Communication of info does not imply intelligence. Intelligence is not required for the passing on of genetic information nor the mutation of said information. I'm not sure how you arrived at this conclusion or line of reasoning that intelligence is implied required? emoticon_confused \n \n It would seem to me that you are implying that DNA actually has ideas, that it consciously forms these ideas and makes choices. If that's the case, then we're REALLY far apart.\n \n \nI'm not looking to prove my assertion. I only ask that you appeal to common sense first, before you accept an explanation blindly. I think you can see what I'm getting at. You need to hold on to your worldview that evolution is true - I understand that. However, there is a real question as to why you feel it's necessary to deny the obvious to do so. If you can give me one example in nature where a natural event produced any type of information that is useful or even detectible, I'd like to see it.\n\n \n To be honest, I don't really see what you're getting at. I don't accept evolution blindly, I accept it based on the overwhelming amount of evidence that supports it.\n \n What obvious am I denying?\n \n Check out this month's National Geographic, there are plenty of examples in it of how genetic mutation has led to a useful, easily detectible, and beneficial adapations, in effect increasing the available information to future generations. I suppose one could then argue that the genetic info was already there, it was just put together differently. Fair enough.\n \n Depending on what you consider \"natural information\", it would seem to me that just about everything that humans, as well as all other animals and plants, have learned and adapted to is based on info derived from nature. \n \n \nHere's how I see it. DNA is the \"carrier\" of information. DNA is not living, and cannot reproduce itself - it needs the machinery of the cell to do that. It consists of messages transfered by living things, which were received from prior living things etc..During the transfer of information it (the information), can either stay the same, or degrade through mutational loss, genetic drift, extinction, etc.. It will not increase in any meaningful way, unless another informational source adds to it ( and please don't suggest that nature is intelligent.) Given degradation (we always see information degrade), if we looked back over time over the genetic line of any living population, we'd expect to see an overall pattern of increase of their genetic information.

Information and messages arise in the mind or in pre-existing messages. I've never see them arise naturally or through natural processes. Conclusion: The programs that existed in the first living things of all organisms must have orignated not by way of natural processes, but in mind.\n\n \n This one requires some thought and additional research on my part, perhaps some others with greater knowledge of the subject will step in. It is a fallacy to suggest that all info degrades or cannot increase. I've seen it explained several times, and IIRC, it has to do with the continued input of energy into the system.\n \n It's also a question of whether everything has a beginning and an end.\n \n Ultimately, what you're getting at is taking the debate purely into the realm of philosophy. The theory of evolution does not deal with philosophy, it deals with the change in allele frequencies in a population over time. \n \n It would seem to me that your argument fails based on its reliance on a number of premises - that all info degrades, that additional info is not produced, that everything has a beginning and an end, and that change requires new information.\n \n Waxy",

   "These questions and assertions just seem ludicrous to me, but at the same time they do provide a challenge, one which, unfortunately, though it is quite a completable task, I don't have the time to undertake. Forgive me if I simply reverse the onus -\n \n How does the evidence of low level language in other animals bolster the case for a creator?\n \n Where is your evidence that communication was inserted by a creator?\n\n \n All I'm saying here is that the better explanation is that language originated with a creator. It's the better of the two explanations, because it answers the question of the complexity of language, while natural processes, by their very definition, do not.\n \n \n \nIMHO, communication between organism is a fundamental ability for survival, it is inherent in all living organisms in some form or another for that reason. Humans have certainly developed it to a higher degree than other animals, but that development is not restricted to humans. \n\n \n \n Agreed. However, in the case of the bee, where we see communication being as you put it \"inherent\" is instinct. How did the bees agree on common symbols and movement to give direction? What would be the natural mechanism for this capability? \n \n \nYou're asking me to prove a negative, prove that a creator didn't create communication among animals. I'm sure you're aware of the fact that you're asking me to do the impossible.\n\n \n I'm not asking you to prove anything. I'm suggesting you consider the possibility that a creator could have created an animal with communication capability hard wired into its being, rather than it develop by a process that has no conceivable way to prodcue this ablity for the animal naturally.\n \n \nYou seem very eager to take a very simplified analogy, even as stated by the authors of the above article \"This highly simplified description of rDNA technology does not fully convey the enormous complexity and awesome economy and efficiency of genetic processes.\" and pass it off as thought the two are equivalent.\n\n \n How are they not? Granted, my analogy to language is simply stated, but this is more a result of my limited ability to communicate the idea, and not a weakness of the assertion. As simple as it is, it's gotten you to consider seriously what I'm talking about, and even prompted you to try and turn the conversation in another direction.\n \n \n \nLanguage has - Letters, Words, Sentences, and Books \n \n \nDNA has - Nucleotide Bases, Codons, Genes, and DNA which are like Letters, Words, Sentences, and Books.\n \n Therefore DNA is a language. \n \n Dogs are carnivorous, have fur, have four legs, and they're mammals, just like dogas, cats also eat meat, have fur, have four legs, and they're mammals, therefore dogs and cats are the same.\n\n \n They're not the same, but they do exhibit common characteristics. They are both carnivorus. They both breath, reproduce, and have limited thinking ability, but they are not \"the same\"\n \n Likewise, while language and DNA are not the same, the have similar characteristics. They are both made up of special building blocks, they both contain information, they are both vehicles for communicating information, and they both transmit ideas.\n \n \n \n \nI have a couple things I have to point out. \n \n Firstly, computer code is a purely artificial contruct of man, it has no biological or physical purpose. It is not subject to any form of modification that is equivalent to evolution - ie the change in allele frequency in a population over time. There is no mechanism by which to create computer code \"naturally\", nor is there any influence on computer code that drives it to change.\n\n \n Inert computer code - yes. \n \n \n \nSecondly, the fact that our current understanding of the workings of DNA is incomplete or the fact that the workings of DNA are complex do NOT in any way prove that the workings of DNA are not natural.\n\n \n No, it doesn't - but it also doesn't prove that they're not metaphysical in orgin, correct? And since DNA contains information, and our human experience dictates that information cannot arise naturally, isn't the best explanation that DNA originated from an idea, and that idea originated in a \"mind?\"\n \n \nAs for the fact that modern computer language could be created \"naturally\", I'll say that yes, it can. Is that unreasonable?\n\n \n Yes - given the fact that your prior statement above was \"There is no mechanism by which to create computer code \"naturally\", nor is there any influence on computer code that drives it to change.\"\n \n Which is it?\n \n \n \n IMHO, no. Given all the components, sufficient time, and a mechanism by which to act, pure statistics would dictate that it is not impossible, it may not be likely, but it's not impossible.\n\n \n Outright denial of the possibility would be illogical.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. At least you dropped the \"at all costs\" and \"true scientist\" stuff.\n\n \n Stating something might be true because it might be possible is not always the best position to take. It's also possible that God created the earth, you, and all that's in it - right? The question is, what explanation BEST explains the existence of DNA? As far as time goes, it is irrelevant to the creation of information. There is no know mechanism available to create information naturally, nor is there a plausible explanation of how that could happen. There is also no mechanism explained in natural selection or decent by modification that can explain DNA. So, you're left with quite a problem.",

You show me a machine, any machine, that is as complex as the human body. That can think, reason, create, self repair, and at the same time experience emotion (something evolution has yet to explain), and I'll start taking you seriously. You state that raw info does not require intelligence. I might as well say that living things are made by God, simply because I say so. Do you hear yourself? Can you see your faith?

If that's the case, then we're REALLY far apart.\n\n \n Now I see your problem, you simply don't understand. No, DNA doesn't have ideas, it's simply the carrier of the information. DNA is used as a vehicle to communicate the blueprint of the living organism. This is also by design.\n \n \nTo be honest, I don't really see what you're getting at.

I could just as well say to you \"look at the manuscript, archeological, prophetic and statistical evidence in the Bible that points to creation\" and you'd laugh. Just as I look at what you call evidence and doubt it. However, you don't look at ALL the evidence, because if you did (such as the DNA problem you have) you'd produce a cognitive friction that you can't cope with. If you were to be honest with yourself, you'd start to see that the information problem is insurmountable for evolutionary theory.

   "A more accurate statement would be that you believe in evolutionary theory inspite of the evidence (such as DNA information).\n\n \n Unreal. \n \n There is abundant research being done right now using DNA that meshs perfectly with the theory of evolution, it's also providing new data that is challenging the theory and leading to its refinement.\n \n Are you going to take my word for that or do I need to provide links.\n \n You haven't dealt with the actual science of genetics or DNA at all, despite my repeated requests for it, you've simply posed a philosophical question.\n \n \nThe better question is, what other areas of science are for it? When it comes to evolutionary theory, it stands alone, on its theoretical, dogmatic platform, claiming it has the truth, while all along more and more evidence comes out against it. Evidence in the fields of genetics, physics, and medicine have all had issues with evolution, but you don't. That's what I \n mean by faith. \n \n \n You've proven that you don't understand the T of E or it's basis. It doesn't stand alone, that absurd. It's the combination of numerous fields of science. Geology, biology, genetics, paleontology, etc...\n \n What evidence has come out against it. It's a simple question, ANSWER IT. \n \n All you've provided is a philosophical point regarding the origin of DNA.\n \n \nThat's your opinion. However, you've yet to show me how I'm wrong, and you ignore the citations I gave earlier where scientists are clearly claiming that DNA is an encoded language. The question is, who encoded it?\n\n \n They didn't say it was an encoded language, they compared it to language. There's a difference there Milo.\n \n Why did someone have to encode it? That's a blatant logical fallacy.\n \n \n \nUnbelievable, but I'll answer. The human body. You show me a machine, any machine, that is as complex as the human body. That can think, reason, create, self repair, and at the same time experience emotion (something evolution has yet to explain), and I'll start taking you seriously. You state that raw info does not require intelligence. I might as well say that living things are made by God, simply because I say so. Do you hear yourself? Can you see your faith? Explain to me why information does not imply intelligence? Can you give me an example of where it does not?\n \n \n After this and the quip about National Geographic, I'm having a real hard time taking you seriously.\n \n Again, your simple position is that because the human body is complex it must have been designed and created by a supernatural creator. You are making that statement, and I'm supposed to accept, simply because you say so.\n \n Where's the faith? I've asked you to demonstrate it. You either can't or won't.\n \n Information is just that, information. It doesn't walk, it doesn't talk, it doesn't grow, it doesn't shrink, it just is.\n \n Are numbers on a page intelligent?\n \n \n Here's some information-\n \n 0012365\n 0165438\n 3658463\n 1236786\n 2146984\n 5465438\n \n Where's the intelligence in that information?\n \n Explain to me how information = intelligence.\n \n \nNow I see your problem, you simply don't understand. No, DNA doesn't have ideas, it's simply the carrier of the information. DNA is used as a vehicle to communicate the blueprint of the living organism. This is also by design.\n\n \n That's likely due to the very poor job you've done of making your point.\n \n Where does the intelligence and the ideas come in then?\n \n \nYou accept evidence that I see as faulty. I could just as well say to you \"look at the manuscript, archeological, prophetic and statistical evidence in the Bible that points to creation\" and you'd laugh. Just as I look at what you call evidence and doubt it. However, you don't look at ALL the evidence, because if you did (such as the DNA problem you have) you'd produce a cognitive friction that you can't cope with. If you were to be honest with yourself, you'd start to see that the information problem is insurmountable for evolutionary theory. The only other answer is a creator, and you can't accept that.\n\n \n Again, you've clearly demonstrated that you don't understand the T of E. You are arguing the philosophical, the existane of a creator, not the the T of E.\n \n The T of E does not deal with the origin of life, or the origin of \"information\". That's the ultimate strawman.\n \n \nI can't believe you get your information from National Geographic. Are you serious? That's like me getting my arguments from the Vatican Weekly.\n\n \n I'm not sure what to make of a comment like that. National Geographic is but one source, I listed it because it's current and aimed at those with only an elementary understanding of the T of E. I believe it represents a well respected and researched scientific publication. If you disagree, show me where they have been proven to be otherwise and I'll accept it.\n \n \nIf you're claiming there's information in nature, where did it originate? \n \n \n Don't know.\n \n \nGive me an example. Remember, my statement is that information, left to its own-degrades. I will concede that if it is added to by another information source, it can continue, but that only leads to another information source, which wouldn't prove your point.\n\n \n Like I said, I'll have to look into it.\n \n \nIt doesn't fail within the context and scope I presented it. If we use your argument, we can't look at DNA, because it might not of had a beginning. The fact is that DNA is real, it's here, and it begs an explanation. if you're asserting that science can't deal with that, then I question what relevance today's modern science has to mankind. If evolution can't help answer questions like how we got here, and what's our true nature, then it's no better than a fairy tale.\n\n \n Do you listen to yourself?\n \n Waxy",

Turnabout is fair play I guess, but you certainly failed to provide any proof, let alone evidence to support your assertion.\n \n IMHO, simply stating that because language is complex it must have come from a creator is ridiculous. \n \n I'm not a linguist. However, I'm quite certain that a linguist could indeed explain to you in a very reasonable manner how language could have (and has ;) ) devoloped to its current state of complexity. \n \n If you choose to accept that a creator snapped his fingers rather than the scientific explanation provided by a linguist, that's your perogative, but claiming that it's a more reasonable or better explanation is a whole different matter IMHO.\n \n As an aside, it would seem to me that language itself is an ever changing and \"evolving\" entity. \n \n \n \n I honestly don't know the answer to those questions, I'm not sure science does either at this point. \n \n Hopefully someone here can provide some insight.\n \n \n \n Other than your assertions, I haven't seen any evidence that indicates that animals, or even organisms, are not capable of developing language, or the tools (information) that enable us to develop and use language, naturally.\n \n Why attack evolution, and science, if your sole purpose is to have someone consider the possibility that all the findings of science are the work of a creator? I don't understand the mindset. \n \n I don't understand your reasoning unless it is strictly to point out that something is a possibility.

There is nothing \"intelligent\" about this transmission that I'm aware of.\n \n \n \n Science doesn't deal with the metaphysical, nor more than it can prove a negative.\n \n Again, perhaps it's my \"religious faith in naturalism\" but I fail to see how invoking the supernatural is the best explanation, let alone how DNA is an idea originated in a mind.\n \n \n \n The reason I made the initial statements was to demonstrate the error in the question you posed, it could not be answered as it was written. My answer was purely hypothetical based on a situation in which that mechanism did exist.\n \n \n \n Right.\n \n Perhaps, again, I will have to defer to someone with a greater understanding of DNA than myself.\n \n Again though, you are arguing for the existance of God, not for or against the veracity of the Theory of Evolution.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. It's one of my pet peeves when debaters selectively pick and choose what points they counter. I try to address everything you put forth, I would appreciate if you extended the same courtesy. At the same time, please let me know if you feel I've ignored/dodged a point that you feel is important.\n\n I have the perfect example to clarify the point that i have been trieing to make, and it has everything to do with when Waxy stated that he doesant understand Milos mindset\n See the reason for this, is that creation and evolution has to differant foundations, and because of this they have also got to differant presuppositions. \n \n creation (creator) / evolution (chance and random process)\n \n The presupposition is the mind set we place ourselves into before we even begin to translate the evidance that is presented to us.\n Now the example i have is, is of a scenerio that a college professor found himself in, with some students.\n \n A young man approached me at a seminar and said, \"well i still believe in the \"big bang\", and that we arrived here by chance and random processes. I dont believe in a intelligent designer\". I answered him \"well, then obviously your brain, and your thought processors, are also the product of randomness. So you dont know if it evolved in the right way, or even what right would mean in that context. Young man, you dont know if you are makeing correct statements or even if you are askeing me the right questions\".\n The young man looked at me and blurted out \"what was that book you recommended?\". He finally realized that his belief undercut its own foundations, such reasoning destroys the very basis for reason.\n \n On another occasion, a man came to me after a seminar and said, \"actually, im an athiest, because i dont believe in an intelligent designer, i dont believe in absalutes, so i recognize that i cant even be sure of reality\". I responded, \"then how do you know your really here makeing this statement?\", \"good point\", he replied, \"what point\", i asked. The man looked up at me, smiled at me and said \"maybe i should go home\", I stated, \"maybe it wont be there\", \"good point\", he replied, and i said, \"what point\".\n \n This man finally got a understanding of the two differant presuppositions.\n If their is no intelligent designer (creator), ultimately philosophically, how can one talk about reality?, how can one even rationally believe there is such a thing as truth, let alone decide what it is?...\n STORMY emoticon_cool",

   "Your point is misleading. First, the bee did not \"invent\" the language, and this is really the point. Humans use a system of communication they developed, where as the bee is \"born\" with it. It is instinct.\nFair point.\n \n \nI'm talking about higher level language, the kind of language that you would find in our speech, or in a computer code.\nComputer code is no more a \"higher level language\" that you would find in speech than bee \"language\" is. The two do not stand up to direct comparison beyond a cursory level.\n \n \nBesides, the fact that we find low level language in other animals just bolsters the case for a creator - that a code was \"created\" and insterted into the biological machine we call a \"bee\". Where is your evidence that comunication developed \"naturally?\"\nHang on, you are the one that just made the asserion here. where is your evidence that bee comunication was '\"created\" and insterted into the biological machine'? \n \n Whilst you avoid this question by just walking in illogical circles, I'll run through the two main pieces of evidence that it evolved:\n \n 1. The enthusiasm of the dance is inversely proportional to the distance away from the nest. In other words a bee that finds nectar near the hive dances about enthusiastically and one from a long way off makes little effort. This makes sense evolutionarily as the further a bee has flown, the more worn out it is and so the less energy it has to dance. In design terms, it's an example of bad design as it isn't scalable: zero effort equates to some arbitary large distance, so there is then no way to design a bee to communicate a larger distance without adding a bodge to it or redoing the design from scratch.\n \n 2. Temperate climate bees in hives use \"up\" to represent the direction of the sun. Shine a light inside the hive and they abandon this behaviour and use the light source to orientate instead. Not suprisingly, related species of tropical bees don't need hives to keep warm and use the sun to represent the direction of the sun in their open nests. There is no need to look for a complex explanation of how bees \"agreed\" that \"up\" was the direction of the sun either: many species of insect that navigate by the sun or moon will switch from orientating themselves to a light source to the vertical if the light source is blocked or turned off. This is likely a quirk of their sensory \"wiring\", much like synesthesia in humans.\n \n \nMaybe it's drivel to you, but not to those educated in this area of study. Scientists have accepted the fact that DNA is, in fact, a high level language http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Speaking_Language_rDNA.html. The fact that you don't see it that way betrays your need to bend toward naturalism, and is in conflict with modern science.\nOdd, I suggest that DNA can be seen as analogous to language and you suggest that this betrays a need to \"bend toward naturalism\" because of a link that blatantly states \"...One popular approach to discussing DNA is to use the analogy of language...\". It doesn't say \"Scientists have accepted the fact that DNA is, in fact, a high level language\" as you falsely cliam, it blatantly states \"...One popular approach to discussing DNA is to use the analogy of language...\" (emphasis added just in case you still can't see it).\n \n So as stated: you were talking drivel. DNA is not a language, but it is possible to construct a language analogy to describe DNA.\n \n \nReference the above article. Have you ever heard the term \"genetic code?\"\nYes. It's an analogy. People re-use existing words to describe new things. We do it all the time. Further we use anaology and metaphores too. Examples: a concert program and a computer program have nothing in common beyond being a sequence of events. \"Computer timetable\" would have been just as valid a term. Programming languages use the word \"grammar\" to describe their syntax structure. The word is loosely analogous to human languages only as there are no verbs, pronouns etc in programming languages. In the phrase \"images are carried on wings of light\", there are no little feathered light particles carrying bits of an image between them.\n \n \nIf you are prepared to state that any computer code written today can occur natrurally\nThey cannot occur naturally, but they most certainly can be evolved using \"natural selection\" algorithms. Our recent discovery that the best way to design things is by using evolution is the final nail in the coffin of YECs. YOur last ditch attempt to avert the long overdue burial - ID - is dead: long live Evolutionary Design. If there is a creator, he clearly used Evolutionary Design to create life. He even left the evidence laying around for us to find it. \n \n \nIf not, then explain how the genetic code we have discovered, which is infinitely more complicated than a computer program occured \"naturally\". \nStrawman. DNA is not \"infinitely more complicated than a computer program\". Windows XP for example contains around 40 million SLOC, whereas there are roughly 20,000 genes within the human genone. What we are discovering is that the \"generic code\" is actually stupidly simple: too simple for it to be the full story. It is RISC carried to the sublime. Until we understand regulation of gene expression better, we won't begin to understand it as we cannot construct a \"state machine\" without that knowledge.\n \n \nYou need to decide if you're going to work under the same assumption that Darwin did, that the human cell is not impressive, just a blob of protoplasm, or if you're going to accpet the findings of modern science and realize that you have a problem explaining the complexity of the DNA language.\nThe problem we have in explaining the complexity of the DNA 'language' is that it isn't complex enough...\n \n \nReally, then show me how I'm wrong - without dogmatic statements.\n\n OK.\n 1. You make assertions that ID is fact without offering any evidence to support it.\n 2. You confuse analogies with similarities.\n 3. You quote sources that say the complete opposite to what you are claiming\n 4. You falsely claim that evolution has no evidence to support it and is unscientific and ignores scientific evidence that contradicts it\n 5. You accuse anyone who doesn't subscribe to your beliefs in your creator as \"ignor[ing] science\", \"deny obvious facts of reason\" and \"clinging to evolutionary theory\" without offering any evidence to back these cliams up.\n 6. You express ill informed opinion as fact and then criticise others by accusing their presentation of facts as \"personal opinion\"",

   "I'm not a linguist. However, I'm quite certain that a linguist could indeed explain to you in a very reasonable manner how language could have (and has ;) ) devoloped to its current state of complexity. \n\n \n You're \"certain\"? Why? If you haven't heard an explanation yet, why would you be \"certain\"?I think it's because your \"faith\" tells you that there must be a scientific answer to the question. After all, science is what you rest your worldview on. I would expect this.\n \n \nIf you choose to accept that a creator snapped his fingers rather than the scientific explanation provided by a linguist, that's your perogative, but claiming that it's a more reasonable or better explanation is a whole different matter IMHO.\n\n \n I have no scientific explanation by a linguist or should I say \"priest\"), and neither do you. If and when I get one, I'll consider it.\n \n \nAs an aside, it would seem to me that language itself is an ever changing and \"evolving\" entity. \n \n \n Yes, but that evolution is not \"natural\". It occurs because we make it occur. We change it, not \"nature\". We change it in a purposeful way. It doesn't evolve by natural means.\n \n \nOther than your assertions, I haven't seen any evidence that indicates that animals, or even organisms, are not capable of developing language, or the tools (information) that enable us to develop and use language, naturally.\n\n \n You also haven't seen any evidence that nature is capable of producing such a thing - and you wont. The fact is that they do commuicate. If science is going to claim that these capabilities came about naturally, then it needs to show how this could be. Otherwise, our experience tells us that this behavior is too complex to appear by natural means. My statements aren't as much assertions as they are questions, questions that you can't answer. If I were you, I'd dig deeper, and maybe you'll come to see that evolutionary theory has some real problems that appear the more we discover about our world.\n \n \nWhy attack evolution, and science, if your sole purpose is to have someone consider the possibility that all the findings of science are the work of a creator? I don't understand the mindset.\n\n \n I'm not attacking science. I like science and I think it is valuable and necessary to mankind. What I AM doing is questioning evolutionary theory, which, it can be argued, is not science - but pseudoscience.\n \n \nI don't understand your reasoning unless it is strictly to point out that something is a possibility. The whole argument of communication is really superfluous if that is your intent.\n\n \n Isn't the aim of evolutionary theory to point out that something is possible? If it were fact, it would be classified as fact. It's not fact, it's a theory, therefore, by its very definition, it seeks to show the possibility of what it asserts. This being the case, the assertion of evolutionary theory is superfluous. But that's not what I'm doing. I'm giving you an example of something that exists - the DNA informational problem. It's not a possibility, it's real. It begs the question \"Who or what encoded the DNA\". If you're going to insist that naturalism is a good explanation for our origin and human development using evolutionary theory, then that's your burden.\n \n \nThe foundation of your argument is that language and DNA are sufficiently similar that anything you can apply to language you can apply to DNA, including \"intelligence\". I disagree.\n\n \n The foundation of my argument is that DNA is an information pattern. Not only is it a pattern, but it's a pattern that is coded in a special way, the same way that a computer code written by a programmer would not just be a random jumble of characters, but a code that communicates an idea - an intent. It's purpose is to provide the infomation to create a living thing. \n \n \nInformation and ideas are not interchangeable. DNA doesn't have ideas, nor does it transmit ideas. They simply transmit data or information. There is nothing \"intelligent\" about this transmission that I'm aware of.\n\n \n Once again, you either misunderstand, or mischaracterize. I'm not saying that DNA \"has ideas\". I'm saying that DNA is the vehicle that carries the coded information. The ideas come from another source, and that source cannot possibly be \"nature\". In the case of DNA, the design it produces can be thought of as an idea. If you're going to say that nature supplied the information, then you're going to have to show how nature supplied the orgainizational \"ideas\" that make up living things. How did nature provide the \"idea\" for the circulatory system - a system that is needed for every living thing for it to exist, even the most primitive animals? When posed with this dilemma, (and it's a dilemma because you can't say that mindless, non-directed nature created organization out of chaos) most evolutionary \"scientists\" wind up with something like \"Well we're here aren't we, that proves evolution is true!\". This demonstrates my point: evolutionary theory must survive at any cost. Since evolutionary scientists have been raised and educated believing the theory from the beginning, it's virtually impossible for them to consider that it's not true. It's their worldview. It's who they are, the foundation of their belief system, and their belief that it's true becomes more their religion than any scientifically based opinion.\n \n \nScience doesn't deal with the metaphysical, nor more than it can prove a negative.\n\n \n Agreed. But that doesn't mean that the possibility of metaphysical influence should be excluded. The truth may lie there. If science states, as it does, that it cannot address this possibility, then it is self limited, and should not assume the role of truth giver - as it does. If science doesn't claim it has the truth, why should we listen to it?\n \n \nAgain, perhaps it's my \"religious faith in naturalism\" but I fail to see how invoking the supernatural is the best explanation, let alone how DNA is an idea originated in a mind.\n\n \n I'm not \"invoking the supernatural\". What I'm saying is that there are other explanations that better fit the problem. With regard to our origins, you have two choices, naturalistic creation, or a creator. The information problem is explained better by the creator theory. Ultimately, the goal of science is to provide man with the best explanation to the problem presented. Science attempts to do this strictly within natural boundries. This is fine, but if the explanation confounds the theory, as the information problem does with evolution, the explanation may lie elsewhere. Science should admit that it can't give an answer - not insist that we believe in a theory that's full of holes. If it doesn't, and tries to make a square peg fit into a round hole, it becomes pseudoscience. In the case of DNA information, the information is a problem for evolutionary scientists that is insurmountable. Evolutionists should admit this, instead of trying to make the problem \"fit\" the natural explanation that evolutionary theory provides.\n \n \n \nThe reason I made the initial statements was to demonstrate the error in the question you posed, it could not be answered as it was written. My answer was purely hypothetical based on a situation in which that mechanism did exist.\n\n \n Please review the question - I'm not sure which one you're talking about. Most likely the question wasn't written poorly, its just that evolutionary theory has no answer.\n \n \nRight.\n \n Perhaps, again, I will have to defer to someone with a greater understanding of DNA than myself.\n \n Again though, you are arguing for the existance of God, not for or against the veracity of the Theory of Evolution.\n\n \n Wrong - I'm not arguing for the existance of God. What I'm trying to do is get you to see that there are only two reasonable answers - evolution or a creator God. If you can see that evolutionary theory is bankrupt, then you might see that you're left with only one choice, but that's not me arguing for a creator God, thats me presenting you with a problem you'll have to work out for yourself. It's too easy for you to dismiss my argument by stating that I'm advocating God.\n \n \nP.S. It's one of my pet peeves when debaters selectively pick and choose what points they counter. I try to address everything you put forth, I would appreciate if you extended the same courtesy. At the same time, please let me know if you feel I've ignored/dodged a point that you feel is important.\n\n \n I do address everything you put forth. Take this post - I address all of your points. Please show me where I may have missed one, and I'll address it. I may not answer it in the way you'd like, but I'll answer. The problem I encounter is that most advocates of evolutionary theory can't answer my points, so they change the subject, as you do, and completly ignore my questions. They then proceed to tell me that I don't answer their assertions. I believe I've addressed your questions fully. If you mean that I didn't answer you because I didn't agree with you, well, that's another story.",

   "Fair point.\n \n Computer code is no more a \"higher level language\" that you would find in speech than bee \"language\" is. The two do not stand up to direct comparison beyond a cursory level.\n \n Hang on, you are the one that just made the asserion here. where is your evidence that bee comunication was '\"created\" and insterted into the biological machine'? \n \n Whilst you avoid this question by just walking in illogical circles, I'll run through the two main pieces of evidence that it evolved:\n \n 1. The enthusiasm of the dance is inversely proportional to the distance away from the nest. In other words a bee that finds nectar near the hive dances about enthusiastically and one from a long way off makes little effort. This makes sense evolutionarily as the further a bee has flown, the more worn out it is and so the less energy it has to dance. In design terms, it's an example of bad design as it isn't scalable: zero effort equates to some arbitary large distance, so there is then no way to design a bee to communicate a larger distance without adding a bodge to it or redoing the design from scratch.\n \n 2. Temperate climate bees in hives use \"up\" to represent the direction of the sun. Shine a light inside the hive and they abandon this behaviour and use the light source to orientate instead. Not suprisingly, related species of tropical bees don't need hives to keep warm and use the sun to represent the direction of the sun in their open nests. There is no need to look for a complex explanation of how bees \"agreed\" that \"up\" was the direction of the sun either: many species of insect that navigate by the sun or moon will switch from orientating themselves to a light source to the vertical if the light source is blocked or turned off. This is likely a quirk of their sensory \"wiring\", much like synesthesia in humans.\n \n Odd, I suggest that DNA can be seen as analogous to language and you suggest that this betrays a need to \"bend toward naturalism\" because of a link that blatantly states \"...One popular approach to discussing DNA is to use the analogy of language...\". It doesn't say \"Scientists have accepted the fact that DNA is, in fact, a high level language\" as you falsely cliam, it blatantly states \"...One popular approach to discussing DNA is to use the analogy of language...\" (emphasis added just in case you still can't see it).\n \n So as stated: you were talking drivel. DNA is not a language, but it is possible to construct a language analogy to describe DNA.\n \n Yes. It's an analogy. People re-use existing words to describe new things. We do it all the time. Further we use anaology and metaphores too. Examples: a concert program and a computer program have nothing in common beyond being a sequence of events. \"Computer timetable\" would have been just as valid a term. Programming languages use the word \"grammar\" to describe their syntax structure. The word is loosely analogous to human languages only as there are no verbs, pronouns etc in programming languages. In the phrase \"images are carried on wings of light\", there are no little feathered light particles carrying bits of an image between them.\n \n They cannot occur naturally, but they most certainly can be evolved using \"natural selection\" algorithms. Our recent discovery that the best way to design things is by using evolution is the final nail in the coffin of YECs. YOur last ditch attempt to avert the long overdue burial - ID - is dead: long live Evolutionary Design. If there is a creator, he clearly used Evolutionary Design to create life. He even left the evidence laying around for us to find it. \n \n Strawman. DNA is not \"infinitely more complicated than a computer program\". Windows XP for example contains around 40 million SLOC, whereas there are roughly 20,000 genes within the human genone. What we are discovering is that the \"generic code\" is actually stupidly simple: too simple for it to be the full story. It is RISC carried to the sublime. Until we understand regulation of gene expression better, we won't begin to understand it as we cannot construct a \"state machine\" without that knowledge.\n \n The problem we have in explaining the complexity of the DNA 'language' is that it isn't complex enough...\n \n \n OK.\n 1. You make assertions that ID is fact without offering any evidence to support it.\n 2. You confuse analogies with similarities.\n 3. You quote sources that say the complete opposite to what you are claiming\n 4. You falsely claim that evolution has no evidence to support it and is unscientific and ignores scientific evidence that contradicts it\n 5. You accuse anyone who doesn't subscribe to your beliefs in your creator as \"ignor[ing] science\", \"deny obvious facts of reason\" and \"clinging to evolutionary theory\" without offering any evidence to back these cliams up.\n 6. You express ill informed opinion as fact and then criticise others by accusing their presentation of facts as \"personal opinion\"\n\n Creation (intelligent designer) / Evolution (chance and random process)\n Lets get down to the two differant presuppositions, then look to where they will lead us.

   "Unreal. \n \n There is abundant research being done right now using DNA that meshs perfectly with the theory of evolution, it's also providing new data that is challenging the theory and leading to its refinement.\n \n Are you going to take my word for that or do I need to provide links.\n \n You haven't dealt with the actual science of genetics or DNA at all, despite my repeated requests for it, you've simply posed a philosophical question.\n \n \n \n You've proven that you don't understand the T of E or it's basis. It doesn't stand alone, that absurd. It's the combination of numerous fields of science. Geology, biology, genetics, paleontology, etc...\n \n What evidence has come out against it. It's a simple question, ANSWER IT.\n\n \n \n You state several fields of study that you say support evolutionary theory. Let's take a few: Geology - this field supports the fact that the top layer of the earth is sediment, an observation that would support the Biblical explanation of a world-wide flood. This field also supports the young earth theory better than it does the old earth theory - we find rivers that fill the ocean bed at their outlets, yet they are not choked off, as they would be if \"millions\" of years of flowing into the basins had taken place. BIOLOGY - This field finds evidence for creation - the simple flagellum, which is essentially an electric motor used by the animal, complete with rotar, bearings, and all other parts needed to swim through the water to survive, speak to a creator, since this mechanism had to have existed as fully functional from the begining (no time to evolve) for the animal to survive at all. Genetics - I've already spoken on this extensively (yet you need more proof) Paleontology - this is an interesting field, since evolution boasts that it has much evidence. I argue that most of it's \"evidence\" is weak if not totally faulty. For instance \"Peking man\" was found to be comprised of animal bones, not human, but was for years touted as evidence for evolution. \"Piltdown man\" was found to be a hoax cited for over 40 years as evidence for evolution, and taught in our schools to influence future evolutionists. Most recently, Archeoptryx, which was found in sedimenatary layers that also produced fully formed birds. I could go on but space does not permit.\n \n \nAll you've provided is a philosophical point regarding the origin of DNA.\n\n \n Not anymore.\n \n \n \n \nThey didn't say it was an encoded language, they compared it to language. There's a difference there Milo.\n\n \n Not really. They would tell you it's a code, and they have. Maybe not in that article, but I think that was more taken as a given than a point against it. Besides, you'd have to give me the article again, and I'd have to look at it again. I can't respond if you don't reference it.\n \n \nWhy did someone have to encode it? That's a blatant logical fallacy.\n\n \n Because it's a code, and by the very difinition, a code must be \"encoded\". Encoding requires information, information produces design, design implies a designer.\n \n \"In 1928, Frederick Griffith performed an experiment using pneumonia bacteria and mice. This was one of the first experiments that hinted that DNA was the genetic code material\" http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio104/dna.htm\n \n \"The strand of DNA that contains the genetic code  is called the anti-sense.\" http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/DNA/dna.htm\n \n \"Study by Israeli scientists provides insight on DNA code\"\n http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=13207\n \n \n \nAfter this and the quip about National Geographic, I'm having a real hard time taking you seriously.\n\n \n That's fine. I have nothing to loose by you ignoring the issue - you do.\n \n \nAgain, your simple position is that because the human body is complex it must have been designed and created by a supernatural creator. You are making that statement, and I'm supposed to accept, simply because you say so.\n\n \n Not just that it's complex, but that we've now found out how and why it's complex. The information contained in DNA provides that answer.\n \n \nWhere's the faith? I've asked you to demonstrate it. You either can't or won't.\n\n \n The faith is in your tenacity in holding on to your belief that evolution is true in the face of an insurmountable problem.\n \n \nInformation is just that, information. It doesn't walk, it doesn't talk, it doesn't grow, it doesn't shrink, it just is.\n\n \n Agreed. But it doesn't need to walk, talk, or grow, to imply that it's origin is from an intelligent source, not nature.\n \n \nAre numbers on a page intelligent?\n\n \n No. but every time you see a number on a page, you assume they came from an intelligent source, correct?\n \n \n \nHere's some information-\n \n 0012365\n 0165438\n 3658463\n 1236786\n 2146984\n 5465438\n \n Where's the intelligence in that information?\n\n \n Well, let's see. The numbers represent characters that communicate ideas. Those ideas represent quantity, or are a measure of something. They follow an agreed upon form and meaning. I can see that you are not communicating emotion or feeling, because you're giving me characters that don't spell that out. Now, the numbers themselves could mean anything, but they are numbers, and they are communicating, and they are passing on ideas, even if you have given me them in a random order. If you were walking down the beach and saw these numbers written in the sand, would you assume that a wave washed up on the shore and created them? How many years do you think it would take before that wave finally washed up and wrote them in the sand? if you were honest, you'd admit that someone drew them in the sand and that the wave would never produce them. INFORMATION IMPLIES INTELLIGENCE.\n \n \n \nExplain to me how information = intelligence.\n \n See the last several lines above. If you can give me an example of some information that does not imply intelligence, please do so.\n \n \nThat's likely due to the very poor job you've done of making your point.\n \n Where does the intelligence and the ideas come in then?\n\n \n Obviously - I haven't gotten though to you.\n \n That's for you to persue. I can tell you where it DOESN'T come from, and that's mindless nature. I have a hard time with evolutionists claiming that mindless nature guided development of living things, and then have them come back that nature is capable of producing information.\n \n \n \nAgain, you've clearly demonstrated that you don't understand the T of E. You are arguing the philosophical, the existane of a creator, not the the T of E.\n \n The T of E does not deal with the origin of life, or the origin of \"information\". That's the ultimate strawman.\n\n \n I see this alot, and it comes in when the evolutionist feels he or she has lost the argument. I realize that evolution doesn't deal with origins directly, that's abiogenesis. However, it does deal with origins indirectly, because if true, it eliminates the need for a creator - you know that. The origin of information is not a strawman, because it speaks to the question of how complex carriers of information and the information itself could come to exist by way of natural means. Is nature intelligent? It would have to be to produce the information we find encoded in living things. Yet evolution claims that mindless processes produced living things - a quandry to say the least.\n \n \n \n \nI'm not sure what to make of a comment like that. National Geographic is but one source, I listed it because it's current and aimed at those with only an elementary understanding of the T of E. I believe it represents a well respected and researched scientific publication. If you disagree, show me where they have been proven to be otherwise and I'll accept it.\n\n \n I make the comment because I've been accused before of using sources that were not scientific. So now, I try to get the information from sources scientists can't argue with - journals and the like. You should be held to the same standard. National Geographic is a for profit publication, and as such, has other interests that it may follow. I have shown you how scientists, the people you really respect, have in other fields produced evidence that militates against evolutionary theory. Maybe they don't notice that they disagree with evolution, or maybe they don't care, but they do disagree.",

Where did the dance originate, and if a bee decided it would communicate by do a communication dance, how did it communicate the meaning of its moves and dance to the other bees? You explain here how it \"could\" be done, but not actually how it was accomplished. You assume too much in your explanation, and you give no plausible mechanism for its orgin nor develpment.\n \n \n2. Temperate climate bees in hives use \"up\" to represent the direction of the sun.

The fact that they may be \"fooled\" into following another source is a non issue. The fact is that they use the ligt source most proment and most obvious for them to use. All you're doing is speaking to the bahavior, and not to the way it originated, or to the fact that they are communicating by way of coded signals that only they understand.\n \n \nOdd, I suggest that DNA can be seen as analogous to language and you suggest that this betrays a need to \"bend toward naturalism\" because of a link that blatantly states \"...One popular approach to discussing DNA is to use the analogy of language...\".

In the phrase \"images are carried on wings of light\", there are no little feathered light particles carrying bits of an image between them.\n\n \n It's an analogy because it best fits the form and substance of its character. Your comparisions above do nothing to weaken my argument. You say that \"Programming languages use the word \"grammar\" to describe their syntax structure.\" This is exacly what DNA scientists use to describe the sytax structure of DNA. That doesn't mean it is. or is not, not a language. The opposite could be said - some languages in the world do not make use of the definate article as the English language does. Does that make them any less of a language? Chinese makes use of coded symbols, and does not make use of many of the elements of the English language. Does that make it any less of a language? Likewise, the information contained in DNA is not classified as a language because it resembles any other language, but because it communicates ideas and thoughts via orgainzed symbols that we understand (at least for the most part), and these characters and symbols are made use of in the development of a living thing by the receptors of that information.\n \n \nThey cannot occur naturally, but they most certainly can be evolved using \"natural selection\" algorithms.

YOur last ditch attempt to avert the long overdue burial - ID - is dead: long live Evolutionary Design. If there is a creator, he clearly used Evolutionary Design to create life. He even left the evidence laying around for us to find it.\n\n \n I'm not arguing that there are certain natural forces that can modify living things. But that's a far cry from what evolutionary theory states, with macro evolution and PE. It's all a fairy tale. The information contained in DNA is capable of producing fully functional complete living things. We have seen that these fully functional living things, such as the bacteria that makes use of the fully functional flagellum - and have done so over time, must have been complete from the get go, with no time to evolve. That means that the code for its structure had to exist from the beginning. Where did it come from?\n \n \n \nStrawman. DNA is not \"infinitely more complicated than a computer program\".Windows XP for example contains around 40 million SLOC, whereas there are roughly 20,000 genes within the human genone. What we are discovering is that the \"generic code\" is actually stupidly simple: too simple for it to be the full story. It is RISC carried to the sublime. Until we understand regulation of gene expression better, we won't begin to understand it as we cannot construct a \"state machine\" without that knowledge.\n\n \n How do you know. We don't even fully understand it. In fact, recent discoveries have shown that there are far fewer genes in the human than was predicted, confounding scientists. But you digress - we're not talking about the human genome, were talking about the information contained in the DNA carrier. If you want to talk genes, we can.\n \n \nThe problem we have in explaining the complexity of the DNA 'language' is that it isn't complex enough...\n \n \n OK.\n 1. You make assertions that ID is fact without offering any evidence to support it.\n 2. You confuse analogies with similarities.\n 3. You quote sources that say the complete opposite to what you are claiming\n 4. You falsely claim that evolution has no evidence to support it and is unscientific and ignores scientific evidence that contradicts it\n 5.

I can give you references, but why? You're aware of it.\n 2. I disagree.\n 3. Where? I refuted that claim above.\n 4. I don't claim that evolution has no evidence, I claim that the evidence that is presented has been shown to be a) a lie (as in piltdown) b) a mistake (as in peking) c) misleading (as in archeoptryx) or it doesn't show macro development at all. I'd venture to say any evidence you provide on evolution will only include evidence of adaptation within localized gene pools. I defy you to present any true macro transitional form.\n 5. Show me where I'm wrong.\n 6. I provided links to reputable science journals and universities - have you? Where is your \"proof\", and how do you explain how the sources I give are not dependable?\n \n No- what's really going on here is that you've run out of steam. You now need to turn to ad hominem attacks to change the subject, which shows me it's time to go. When you start working to discredit me with false accusations, instead of defending your position with good arguments, it's over.\n \n Good luck to you. I hope you find that your position is dead. If you're really a thinker, and if you can let go of your religion, I think you will find (as more and more scientists are finding) that good, modern science refutes Darwin's antiquated theory.",

   "Milo, you didn't even address all the points in this post, that's plain to see.\n \n Here's a list of questions I've posed and points I've raised that I feel you've ignored or chosen not to answer. They are all direct quotes from my above posts, I added emphasis where context might be lost -\n \n Please give me an example of \"evolutionary theory\" (a blatant misuse of the term) \"stepping out of the accepted norms of science and crucifying any idea that stands in its way\".\n\n \n OK- this is my last post, because it's going to be a full time job arguing with all of you. I'll answer these questions, because (even though I think I have) it's more efficient than going back through all my other posts.\n \n \nHow does the evidence of low level language in other animals bolster the case for a creator?\n\n \n My main argument was for the information contained in DNA. Someone else brought up bees. However, my answer is not that the presence of communication skills in bees is evidence for a creator, as much as it begs the question of how the bees came up with the idea of communicating using symbols and movements? Pheramones yes, dances and patterns played out for other bees to intrepret - no. This had to be handed down from an intelligent source. Bees just don't possess the cognitive skills to create and intrepret such a system of communication. It's information, and information doesn't evolve naturally. There is no \"evidence\" that I'm aware of that this behavior came from a creator, however our knowledge of information and how it's generated and transmitted suggests that bee communication did not come about naturally.\n \n \nWhere is your evidence that communication was inserted by a creator?\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nPlease show me, or demonstrate, how I have \"faith\" in evolution?\n\n \n If you don't then why do you defend it? Why would you speak up for something that you don't believe is true? This is faith, the belief that something is true usually because you have been shown evidence that you accept as being true. You might be assuming that faith relates only to religion, and you'd be wrong. The first man on the moon attempted it because he had faith that he'd get there and back safely, and it's reasonable to assume he based that faith largely on the scientific efforts that went into the project. It's unlikely that he would have attempted the flight on a rocket that he had no faith would leave the ground, regardless of his relationship with his creator.\n \n \nYou haven't in any way presented other areas of science that argue against evolution or that evolution doesn't exist in harmony with other fields of science.\n \n What other fields of science, besides the possibility of linguisitics, are against evolutionary theory?.\n\n \n Yes I did. You must have missed it. See my prior post 157.\n \n \nWhat obvious am I denying? (In reference to evidence against evolution.)\n\n \n How did information evolve? Provide the mechanism of how natural forces could have originated and propagated the coded information contained in DNA - the coded information that the scientists you so greatly admire still don't fully understand after years of study.\n \n \n \nA more accurate statement would be that you believe in evolutionary theory inspite of the evidence (such as DNA information). What other evidence? You haven't even made a solid case for DNA information.\n\n \n I think I have. If you don't think so, that's your right. I would say however that your statement that I haven't made a solid case for DNA would be better received if you showed how I haven't. So far, you've given me nothing but questions, and no evidence as to how I'm wrong. Bombarding me with questions without answering any yourself, is a dead giveaway that you've lost the argument.\n \n \n \nWhy is it a better explanation? (top of post 143, why is ID the better explanation?)\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean here.\n \n \nWhat evidence has come out against evolution? It's a simple question, ANSWER IT. (repeated again in post 146)\n\n \n I did answer it in post 157. But it's obvious you don't read my answers, which is why I'm writing them again here. It's also the reason why this is my last post. If you're not going to read my responses, this is pointless.\n \n \nWhy did someone have to encode it?\n\n \n I can't answer why it was done. Maybe you can ask with you meet Him.\n \n \nWhere's the faith? I've asked you to demonstrate it. You either can't or won't. (repeated again, post 146)\n\n \n See above where I answer the question of your faith.\n \n \nFurther to that, the analogy that since DNA and linguisitics are analagous, and linguistics requires intelligence so therefore DNA must require intelligence, is also a false analogy.\n\n \n I stated that the information contained in DNA is addressed by the science of linguistics in that it resembles a coded language. My points are obvioiusly not making sense to you, because you either recharacterize them incorrectly, or take them out of context. I suggest you read my comments carefully before you consider them.\n \n Well that's it, it's been fun. I hope I've at least given you something to think about, and if you really love science as you claim - you will not only think about it, but you'll try to look past your faith as you do. You shouldn't be afraid to do this, that is if your faith in science is really that strong.\n \n Cheers!",

   "You state several fields of study that you say support evolutionary theory. Let's take a few: Geology - this field supports the fact that the top layer of the earth is sediment, an observation that would support the Biblical explanation of a world-wide flood. This field also supports the young earth theory better than it does the old earth theory - we find rivers that fill the ocean bed at their outlets, yet they are not choked off, as they would be if \"millions\" of years of flowing into the basins had taken place. BIOLOGY - This field finds evidence for creation - the simple flagellum, which is essentially an electric motor used by the animal, complete with rotar, bearings, and all other parts needed to swim through the water to survive, speak to a creator, since this mechanism had to have existed as fully functional from the begining (no time to evolve) for the animal to survive at all. Genetics - I've already spoken on this extensively (yet you need more proof) Paleontology - this is an interesting field, since evolution boasts that it has much evidence. I argue that most of it's \"evidence\" is weak if not totally faulty. For instance \"Peking man\" was found to be comprised of animal bones, not human, but was for years touted as evidence for evolution. \"Piltdown man\" was found to be a hoax cited for over 40 years as evidence for evolution, and taught in our schools to influence future evolutionists. Most recently, Archeoptryx, which was found in sedimenatary layers that also produced fully formed birds. I could go on but space does not permit.\n\n \n I've also really neglected my work the last couple days, so I'll be keeping this short and only be replying sporadically.\n \n That being said, it's a good thing that we're stopping this here, because my jaw hit the floor when I read this paragraph. It's obvious that you are unwilling to accept science in any form, regardless of the evidence that supports it, IMHO, due to an extreme lack of understanding of the issues at hand coupled with a desire to be purposely naieve. \n \n I laughed out loud at your explanation of geology.\n \n Flagellum needing to simply \"appear\" fully developed? Peking man is animal bones? Archeopteryx is found in the same sediment as fully formed birds? This is either pure ignorance or intentional deceit.\n \n \nBecause it's a code, and by the very difinition, a code must be \"encoded\". Encoding requires information, information produces design, design implies a designer.\n\n \n No, it's LIKE a code. No implications.\n \n \nThe faith is in your tenacity in holding on to your belief that evolution is true in the face of an insurmountable problem.\n\n \n The problem is far from insurmountable, and you haven't in any way invalidated the T of E.\n \n \nNo. but every time you see a number on a page, you assume they came from an intelligent source, correct?\n\n \n Maybe, depends who wrote them. ;) :p\n \n \nWell, let's see. The numbers represent characters that communicate ideas. Those ideas represent quantity, or are a measure of something. They follow an agreed upon form and meaning. I can see that you are not communicating emotion or feeling, because you're giving me characters that don't spell that out. Now, the numbers themselves could mean anything, but they are numbers, and they are communicating, and they are passing on ideas, even if you have given me them in a random order. If you were walking down the beach and saw these numbers written in the sand, would you assume that a wave washed up on the shore and created them? How many years do you think it would take before that wave finally washed up and wrote them in the sand? if you were honest, you'd admit that someone drew them in the sand and that the wave would never produce them. INFORMATION IMPLIES INTELLIGENCE.\n \n See the last several lines above. If you can give me an example of some information that does not imply intelligence, please do so.\n\n \n Numbers are defined BY HUMANS to represent ideas and quantities, they don't inherently represent anything. They're completely artificial. Information alone is meaningless without definition or interpretation.\n \n Does the way that sand grains on a beach are orientated by waves equal information in your mind? \n \n I say it does. There's a lot of interpretation I can gather from that. Wave strength, orientation, current strengths, tidal ranges, etc... It happens all the time and it's repeatable. However without my interpretation, they're just grains of sand on a beach.\n \n You've elevated the interaction of DNA, how organisms at the cellular level interpret DNA and act on the information it contains to form life, to a level of artificial intelligence equal to that of a human. There's no basis for that. Nature doesn't act in the realm of the abstract, or in the \"mind\". It acts based on the laws of physics and chemistry. \n \n \nThat's for you to persue. I can tell you where it DOESN'T come from, and that's mindless nature. I have a hard time with evolutionists claiming that mindless nature guided development of living things, and then have them come back that nature is capable of producing information.\n\n \n I have an equally hard time with someone stating that a divine creator is responsible for all life and \"information\" on Earth. \n \n What is this creator? \n \n How do we test for its existance? \n \n Where did it originate? \n \n Where did it get the information?\n \n \nI see this alot, and it comes in when the evolutionist feels he or she has lost the argument. I realize that evolution doesn't deal with origins directly, that's abiogenesis. However, it does deal with origins indirectly, because if true, it eliminates the need for a creator - you know that. The origin of information is not a strawman, because it speaks to the question of how complex carriers of information and the information itself could come to exist by way of natural means. Is nature intelligent? It would have to be to produce the information we find encoded in living things. Yet evolution claims that mindless processes produced living things - a quandry to say the least.\n\n \n I see this a lot when \"creationists\" don't understand the T of E, and seek to undermine it because they view it as a threat to their religion and faith. I see it as people of weak faith attempting to justify faith with reason. The two are incompatible IMHO.\n \n I don't see it as a real quandry. I don't see the need to attribute the workings of nature to a higher power simply because I don't fully understand it. To my mind, that's a cop out.\n \n \nI make the comment because I've been accused before of using sources that were not scientific. So now, I try to get the information from sources scientists can't argue with - journals and the like. You should be held to the same standard. National Geographic is a for profit publication, and as such, has other interests that it may follow. I have shown you how scientists, the people you really respect, have in other fields produced evidence that militates against evolutionary theory. Maybe they don't notice that they disagree with evolution, or maybe they don't care, but they do disagree.\n\n \n Like I said, I figured a nice simple article on science in layman's terms was appropriate to this discusssion. National Geographic is certainly not the only source I use.\n \n You think you've demonstrated that, but you haven't. It's nowhere to be seen. You've merely presented your opinion, supported by a loose analogy between DNA and language. Nothing more, even when it was requested of you.\n \n Waxy",

I dont believe in a intelligent designer\". I answered him \"well, then obviously your brain, and your thought processors, are also the product of randomness.

Young man, you dont know if you are makeing correct statements or even if you are askeing me the right questions\".\n The young man looked at me and blurted out \"what was that book you recommended?\".

I responded, \"then how do you know your really here makeing this statement?\", \"good point\", he replied, \"what point\", i asked. The man looked up at me, smiled at me and said \"maybe i should go home\", I stated, \"maybe it wont be there\", \"good point\", he replied, and i said, \"what point\".\n \n This man finally got a understanding of the two differant presuppositions.\n If their is no intelligent designer (creator), ultimately philosophically, how can one talk about reality?, how can one even rationally believe there is such a thing as truth, let alone decide what it is?...\n STORMY emoticon_cool\n\n \n Try as I might stormboy, I can't figure out what your point is. emoticon_confused\n \n Waxy",

Creationism cannot argue its own points without attacking evolution with claims such as the moon dust argument which to the educated world is very, very, very flawed. Creationism is a lie that has no merit whatsoever. \n \n \n \n Last time I checked, Genesis says that God created all of the animals, yet we know that all of the animals specified in Genesis aren't the ones we have found, and nor do they include the number of species we have seen evolve before our own eyes, such as the number of fruit fly species found in Hawaii.

   "I've been following this sub-debate, and am intrigued. I have placed all the relevant statements from the exchange here first. Then I will attempt to summarize at the bottom of this post, so that we can possibly obtain clarity around the issue.\n \n Montalban's first post here was titled: \"In Keeping with the Title of this Thread.\"  He then posted a link (http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf018/sf018p05.htm) that discussed chimps, gorillas, man, and apes.\n \n Clive14 responded with, \"Try as I might I can't see how details about the evolution of three ape species has anything to do with \"monkeys to man or man to monkey.\" \n \n Montalban: \"Anyway...\n a) If only it were about three ape species, unconnected to any other statement\n b) So, when the thread is about monkeys to man or man to monkeys, and I post some 'stuff' about primates evolving in such a two-way manner, you can't see any connexion?\"\n \n Montalban (again): \"... Not only do you ignore the previous post (to your statement), which showed your own non-connected reasonings (you couldn't understand what a 'two-way evolution' thread title about primates had to do with citations in a post about 'two-way evolution\" about primates)... [I deleted some non-relevant stuff about projection and lurch here.] ...Or making some claim that I didn't ask you a question and then introducing some concept of 'set-theory' with no connection to how it fits in anywhere, other than the 'just-so' statement that if anyone understood it, they'd be able to fill in the blanks (amounting to about 90%) of statements that you make.\n \n Note too, I pointed out the dishonest reappraisal you gave regarding the posts I made (you stated it was something only about apes evolving). Maybe, and this is just me guessing now, you didn't read all the post - and only looked at the sources as the bottom of it. Get back to me when you're prepared to actually read what you respond to.\" \n \n Clive14: \"You messed up and got confused between apes and monkeys. Why not... just [admit] what was after all just a tiny mistake?\"\n To which Montalban responded in the next post: \"Wishful thinking. The title of the thread is monkeys, AND men, I mentioned apes AND men, AND I also stated the connection is primates.\" \n \n And Clive14, in direct response to this statement by Montalban, \"Note too, I pointed out the dishonest reappraisal you gave regarding the posts I made (you stated it was something only about apes evolving).\" stated this:  \" What? Are you claiming that [a statement from Monty's link above that discussed chimps, gorillas, and humans] has nothing to do with apes evolving? If not, what are you on about? ... Perhaps you can point out where either you or your three links refer to evolution of something other than apes?\"\n \n Montalban: \"I stated that your re-working was that the citations were ONLY about apes. Post 90 you stated,\" (Clive14)\"Try as I might I can't see how details about the evolution of three ape species has anything to do with \"monkeys to man or man to monkeys\".\n Montalban continues:  \"You are suggeting that it has nothing to do with anything other than 3 ape species. In fact, now you undo your own criticism of me with regards this argument you made in post 90, because you claimed it was ONLY about 3 types of apes, and now you suggest it involves chimps and man as well. You now give evidence against yourself (see also your 'critique' about what my post had to do with the subject at hand, above).\\\n So, is it just about apes, with no connection to the thread title, or is it about chimps too, [emphasis placed by Clive14] in which case are you going to withdraw your half-thought attack where you think I'm confused about primates.\"\n \n Clive14: \"You appear to be implying here that chimps aren't apes. To save dozens more swirming posts, I won't claim you are, just merely claim that you \"appear\" to be doing so. Can you clarify what you mean here therefore please.\"\n To which Montalban responded: \"No, you are the one who asks what's it got to do with anything but 3 sets of apes. If you believe chimps are apes, then you've just admitted what I wrote, (and what you've been going on about) is pertinent to the thread.\" (Along with a bunch of other stuff about pontificating morality, projecting, etc.)\n Clive14 responded: \"Monty, You appeared to have got a little carried away and forgot to answer the one thing I was interested in knowing:\n Did you mean to claim that chimps were not apes?\" \n \n  Montalban: \"Are you confused? You said the posts were about apes, then mentioned chimps yourself. Then questioned why I'd post what I did, and when I stated that the connection was primates, you pretended that I might have thought something else. I never said that chimps were not apes, and thus you saying that my post was about apes, and asking what relevence was the post to the title, is still a mystery... it seems you are confused.\n \n What I said is that if you accept chimps are apes, then what problem do you have with a post on apes (according to you) on a thread title mentioning monkeys. Please explain.\" After which he posted a definition and a link (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ape) that clearly states that a chimp is considered an ape.\n \n Clive14: \"Very confused. So we have established that you accept that chimps are apes. But you seem to be now saying that chimps are monkeys too. Is this correct, or are you simply incapable of expressing yourself clearly?\" \n  Montalban: \"No, as I said at the very beginning, when you asked... I said the link was 'primates'. You said that this was some kind of cover-up... based on your own gut feeling and/or set-theory.\"\n \n \n \n MY SUMMARY\n We have Montalban stating that he is keeping with the title of the thread \"Monkeys to man or man to monkeys?\" by posting a link that discusses the evolution of certain apes, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and man. When pressed by Clive14 what is the relevance of Monty's link to the title of the thread, Montalban responds that the connection is primates. Clive then suggests that Monty just perhaps confused apes with monkeys (which is certainly possible).\n \n My favorite part is when Monty states, \"So, is it just about apes... or is it about chimps too .\" This, to me, clearly implies that the author of the statement does not understand that chimps ARE apes. Which is not a big deal... there are a lot of people who aren't aware of the distinctions among different primates.\n \n Then Monty states, \"If you believe chimps are apes, then you've just admitted what I wrote is pertinent to the thread.\" The only antecedent to \"what I wrote\" that makes any sense to me is the original post by Monty claiming that the evolution of apes is relevant to \"Monkeys to man or man to monkeys.\" Yet, the only way I can see that this would be relevant is if chimpanzees were, in fact, monkeys. (They are not. By definition. How's that for a just-so statement?)\n \n When this conclusion was postulated by Clive, Monty responded vaguely that \"the link was 'primates.'\"\n \n Had the thread been titled, \"Primates to man or man to primates?\" I think Monty would have a valid point. But as it is, apes (including chimps) are not monkeys... and therefore, I still fail to see how a link about apes is relevant to a thread that is purported to be discussing monkeys.",

Sorry you missed it! :)\n See post #115 of \"Out of China\" and Post #145 of \" Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution\" for scientific method, note the later I responded to questions you'd asked.

But that's arrogance for you!\n Your own 'authority' talkorigins (your's because you've cited them for evidence) disagrees with your assumption on both points. :)\n \n However in relation to this particular sub-debate the very first post that I responded to I said it was about primates, and about two way evolution.\n \nThe thread title is \"monkeys to man or man to monkeys?\" suggesting that either path-way is possible.\n\n \nThe title suggests that either pathway is possible. Yet no evidence has been presented to suggest that either pathway is possible. You presented a piece of evidence that suggested that perhaps it could be (in simplified terms) \"apes to man or man to apes.\" Apes are not monkeys. Monkeys are not apes. Both are primates.\n\n So? Both are suggesting primate two-way evolution. Hence 'connection' is established.\n \n My point is essentially for clarification here. I suspect Clive14 had a similar intent. In a post about monkeys, talking about apes is a little confusing.\n\n I said in my first answer the connection was 2 way, and primate.\n \nEspecially for anyone who is not aware of the distinction between the two primates. They are not interchangeable, and your original post did not make that clear.\n\n Then what you've done is assumed that I'm confused on the issue. Why not just state what you think is the facts with regards to primates/apes/monkeys ?\n \n Clive14 tried to suggest that even in that response I mucked up about confusion between apes, primates, chimps, man, etc.\n\n \nI'm sure that Clive14 can clarify this for him/herself,\n\n Really? You've sought to intervene so far. Why stop?\n \nbut I don't think that's what Clive14 was suggesting. S/he stated explicitly, \"You messed up and got confused between apes and monkeys.\"\n\n But I didn't. I established the connection in my first answer the connection was primates. If I'd have said \"Apes\" then you'd have something to work with. You don't. He just assumed I was mixed up. And even when I answered him about what the connection is, he still just went on assuming this.",

Likewise just because we find a fossil surrounded by a material of consistent structure, that all dates to the same age and that shows no signs of having been disturbed, we cannot say with absolute certainity that the surrounding rock and fossil are the same age. Even if we find thousands of them, we still can't say it with absolute certainity.

   "Now when i say this i really do mean it, but Waxy im sorry, but i dont believe you do see my point. What i would like you to do, is to kick back and go over why it is you feel you can see my point for a while.\n One of the reasons why i have the presupposition, besides the very fact of haveing God in my heart, is the mysterys we have in the world. The Ejyption pyramids being built, why is this a mystery?. Have a think about it, and tell me why you feel it is a mystery, thats if you dont believe it to be a mystery and know exactly how they were built. When you do this, i will share with you why i think it is a mystery..\n\n \n I know what point you're trying to making, you believe I have a predetermined attitude about science. I do. You believe that you're right, that God is the obvious answer, and you can't understand how I can be so blind and stubborn about the proof that you're showing me. You think I need to step back and throw away my preconceived notions and really look at the evidence for God. You think that my life is empty and pointless, left to random chance with the belief in a Creator. Well, guess what, THE FEELING IS MUTUAL. The same frustration you feel, I'm feeling when it comes to dealing with you, likely more so.\n \n I've done what you're suggesting that I do, and I'm very comfortable with where I'm standing. \n \n I do have an open mind to new evidence, that doesn't mean I go looking for things where they don't exist, but I'm willing to re-examine my position on things in light of new evidence. I think part of the problem is that you're really late to this party, everything you've brought up has been dealt with in great detail already. It's been refuted by the most basic of science.\n \n The pyramids -\n \n Firstly, it is and isn't a mystery.\n \n It's a mystery because we don't have any detailed written records of exactly how the Egyptians built them. Therefore, we have to interpret how they were built based on the available materials and technology that we know were present when the pyramids were built. \n \n It isn't a mystery in that scientists have determined where the rock used for th pyramids was sourced, and they have proposed a theory as to how the pyramids were built, and have even done recreations of the event to test the theories. The nuts and bolts basics of how the pyramids were built is really no longer a mystery, and it isn't any real great feat of human engineering, just a lot of blood, sweat, and tears.\n \n I'm all ears for your explanation though.\n \n As for your other posts on the topic - the Grand Canyon, fossils, dating methods, etc..., I could go into great detail on this stuff, I'm a professional geologist, however, and I don't mean to be offensive, but I feel it would be rather wasted on you. I don't think you have a basic understanding of science upon which to build, and more importantly, I don't think you're in any way willing to accept the explanations, no matter how rational, logical, or supported by evidence they may be.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. If you truly are willing to examine the science behind your claims, simple Google searches on fossilization, the Grand Canyon, introductory geology(there are actually several university introductory geology courses available for free on the internet if you look around), or radiometric dating will provide a good starting point for your reading.",

   "Because rocks contain elements that are radioactively unstable.\n \n Neither. We cannot even say that you, I or the rock absolutely, without doubt, exist. We make assumptions: we assume that we and the universe exist and that we aren't simply glorified Sims in some giant computer game. Likewise we make assumptions for dating rocks. We can, and have, cross checked the results and so we can say with a very high degree of confidence that we have it right. To ever claim \"without a doubt\" is to slip into the realms of faith though. \n \n Please read http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens.html. This covers just about ever question you, as a Christian, could have regarding how we know the Earth to be old.\n \n Because the chemistry of the fossil rock and the surrounding rock are completely different and because we have no reason to think that one could \"decompose\" to the other.\n \n And how can we say for certainty that the rock found besides the fossil is the same age?[/quite]If you found a man in a room locked from within, with a bullet hole in his head, a gun held in his hands aimed at his head, one bullet missing from the gun, could you say for certain, absolute certainity, that he had shot himself? Likewise just because we find a fossil surrounded by a material of consistent structure, that all dates to the same age and that shows no signs of having been disturbed, we cannot say with absolute certainity that the surrounding rock and fossil are the same age. Even if we find thousands of them, we still can't say it with absolute certainity. But we convict people and give them the death penalty on evidence many many times weaker than dating evidence.\n \n Because we do not date the fossils directly, we date the rock containing the fossil\n \n No, for the conditions have to be just right and they very rarely are. Most of the time, it's the proverbial compost heap, rather than the museum self, for the organism.\n\n So what are the chances of the organic food in the animals mouth to fossilize as well?. And how do we get a clam to stay shut for the time it would take it to fossilize?\n Why cant this be evidence for a sudden catostrophic incident, lets say like a flood that buried the animal with the food still caught in its mouth, or for the clam to be trapped suddenly by the sediment to follow?\n \n \" To ever claim without a doubt is to step into the realm of faith\"?.

It sounds like there is alot of meat behind that, it has created interest, let me check it out. Ill be back\n\n Let me offer a place to look - the walls of the Grand Canyon.\n \n Of course, the canyon couldn't have been cut out in 40 days - however, the flood of Noah lasted about a year. There might have been considerable deposit of sediment in that time, but not enough to form the canyon. And the deposits from a single flood of only a year would not have produced the great variety of strata found in the canyon wall.\n \n Further, the carving of the canyon in only 4,500 years or so would require that the walls be very soft. Creationists claim that they were deposited in the flood and then carved quickly by the draining of some imaginary lake. But if the walls were soft enough to be carved in only a few years, then they would have collapsed. And the flood proposal does not explain the sediment layers at the bottom of the canyon that are significantly tilted. That would require deposit, lithification, uplifting, followed by more deposits. How could that have happened and what is the source of the tilting of the bottom strata.\n \n There is also the coconino sandstone. At the Museum of Natural Science we have a slab of coconino sandstone from the wall of the Grand Canyon. This slab is marked by wind ripples and across the entire slab are several reptile trackways, as well as infilled burrows of land dwelling animals. There is no doubt that the coconino sandstone is an aeolian deposit - i.e., deposited by the wind.\n \n The problem is that it isn't at the top of the canyon. Below the coconino sandstone is the Hermit Shale that contains fossils of ferns, conifers and other plants, as well as fossilized tracks of reptiles and amphibians. Shale is fromed by the consolidation of clay, mud, or silt and has a finely laminated structure. Shale is not the result of a flood.\n \n Above the coconino sandstone is the Toroweap Formation, which is limestone. This is a marine deposit. No fern fossils or tracks of reptiles here. There are lots of fossils of marine animals in this layer. This would be near the end of the flood, and yet below it are layers that were deposited in a desert, a marsh, and then other marine environments.\n \n That just doesn't make sense in the context of a global flood. How could there have been ferns, conifers, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as worms making burrows in the middle of the flood?",

   "Pand, you sparked my interest about the flood and Noah's ark.

   "Pand, you sparked my interest about the flood and Noah's ark.\n\n Good. I think that it is a good thing to become interested enough in a topic to actually look for the facts.\n \nI went in search of a bible to check what you said about the bible stating that the earth was flooded for a year and this is what I've found:\n\n Be careful in making claims as to what others have \"said.\" If you read carefully you will see that I actually didn't mention the Bible or what it said. My actual words were, \"...the flood of Noah lasted about a year.\" You didn't start reading soon enough. You should have started here:\n \nGen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n\n That marks the start of the flood and the beginning of the various time periods mentioned (40 days, 150 days, 150 days, 40 days, 7 days, and 7 days). In addition to this, the 7th month 17th day, the 10th month 1st day, and 601st year 1st month 1st day are mentioned in the narrative. It is confusing and difficult to sort out how long all of this took.\n \n But a careful reading yields the following as the time when Noah is supposed to have left the ark:\n \nGen 8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.\n \n So Noah entered the ark when he was 600 y, 2 mo., 7 days and he left the ark when he was 601 y, 2 mo., 27 days. That's \"about a year,\" 10 days more than a year in fact.\n \nOk, so, that's the flood part explained in context.\n\n Right. It amazes me how often I encounter creationists who aren't aware that the flood lasted more than 40 days. It's bizarre.\n \nBut, wait, there's more! The bible clearly states in chapter 8, verse 19 that \"All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds - everything that moves on the earth - came out of the ark, one kind after another.\"\n \n What intrigued me the most about your statement is that you didn't think that worms or other kinds of insects would have been in the ark, too. They would have been carried in, or they could have been carried into the ark via food, dirt, etc.\n\n It seems that you read my statement with about as much care as that you devoted to a reading of Genesis. I commented that the record of the strata of the Grand Canyon don't make sense in the context of a global flood. Creationists usually claim that the sediments were deposited during the flood and that the canyon was carved in a short period after the flood. But creationists don't explain how the granite and schist at the bottom of the canyon were soft enough to be cut into so quickly and later be subjected to the forces that changed sandstone, limestone, and shale into schist. Creationists don't explain how the first nine or so sedimentary layers at the bottom of the canyon were tilted and eroded during the flood so that the horizon cut through several of these layers. Creationists don't explain how marine environments could be followed by coastal mudstone, followed by desert deposits followed by more mudstone and more marine deposits. And were did the tracks of animals in the upper strata of the canyon come from? Where did the ferns come from? Where did the burrows come from? These layers were in the middle of the flood according to creationists.\n \n I don't understand. Perhaps you can explain, Believer.",

   "I would like to know your thoughts of this site?\n\n It is drivel. It is written for the ignorant. Consider the following:\n \nFor many years creation scientists have taught that the Grand Canyon was formed rapidly when a large lake on the northern border of the Colorado Plateau broke through its barrier and eroded the canyon rapidly.\n\n Have you ever seen a \"creation scientist\" offer any evidence for the existance of this imagined lake? Where was it? Where was the barrier? The funny thing is that we know exactly the effects that would be produced by a large lake breaking through a barrier would look like. One such lake was Lake Missoula and the effects were the Channelled Scablands of Washington State. There are no large canyons in the area and there are no indications of terraine similar to the Scablands anywhere near the Grand Canyon.\n \n In order for the canyon to have been cut as quickly as creationists claim, the walls would have had to have been soft. If that were true, then why were they subsequently lithified? Cuting the canyon removes the forces that would have turned them to stone. Moreover, if they were soft enough for the water to cut the canyon in the time span claimed by \"creation scientists,\" the walls would have collapsed because they were too soft. This is evident from the \"canyon\" at Mt. St. Helen's where there are several examples of the colapse of the soft volcanic ash where the channel was cut too deeply.\n \n Another point is that there are meanders in the Colorado River in the canyon. One beautiful example is Horseshoe Bend near Page Arizona. This formation is above the Grand Canyon itself. However, if the strata were soft enough to be cut by the rush of water in the time claimed, then the wall between the two sides of the meander would not have been strong enough to have survived. A fast river with lost of water flowing carves a relatively straight channel. Meanders are formed by slow flowing rivers over relatively flat land. Check out the meanders that are evident in the Mississippi Delta, where the channel changes frequently.\n \n Even more surprising is the variety of strata in the walls of the Grand Canyon. None of them are typical of flood deposits. There are several places in the world where flood deposits along rivers are evident in the strata. Floods deposit a mismash of homogeneous deposits. The Grand Canyon has shales, limestones, and sandstones, not to mention the metamorphic schist and granite at the bottom of the canyon. What is even more problematic for creationists is the bioturbation and paleosols found in the canyon walls. Every layer has fossils, some more than others. But doesn't it seem strange that brachiopods, coral, mollusks, sea lilies, worms and fish teeth are found in the top layer of the canyon when the flood is supposed to have wiped them all out?\n \n Consider the coconino sandstone. We have a 3' by 4' slab of it in the Museum of Natural Science. The wind ridges are quite evident. Ridges in blowing sand are different from those produced in sand by the action of waves. Not only that, across this slab of fossilized dune there are several trackways of lizards. This is in the layer that is the third from the top of the canyon.\n \n If you are really interested in this sort of thing then I recommend that you read:\n \n Strahler, Arthur N. Science and Earth History: The Evolution/Creation Controversy. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1987.\n \n I think that the book is now out of print but you might be able to find it in a good library. It is clearly written for a layman and addresses the issues from the point of view of a geologist. It is also a good introduction to science, what it is and how it works. Strahler does cover the Grand Canyon and several other bogus claims of creationists and why they are bogus.",

Perhaps you can fill us in on where they have went wrong in their science? \n \n With reference to the Grand Canyon, how do you know that it wasn't just a lot of water over a short period of time that formed the Canyon, as opposed to a little bit of water over a long period of time? Also, modern geology is based on what evolution says about geology, i.e. things have been going the way that are for eons of years. Does not Mt St Helens disprove this? Rapid local flooding occurs in many countries. Earthquakes change the Earth's geological features in minutes and hours with such force that should be the \"slow and steady\" evolutionary method take eons of years. Earthquakes, floods, volcanoes all contradict what evolution says about geology (i.e. slow and steady) by showing that the Earth frequently changes it's geology over short periods of time.\n \n Also, you appear to have totally rejected the Bible and Noah's Flood, and already appear to believe that evolution happened. Therefore, your starting assumption is different to a creationist's and after looking the same evidence will come to the opposite conclusioin to the creationist, i.e. that it took a long time to form.",

Woops, an innocent mistake on my part! emoticon_emb Sorry, let me correct myself, I got it around the wrong way and should have said that the slow and gradual belief overtook geology more than 150 years ago. It rejected the Bible's account of catastrophe as the main factor in Earth history, and replaced it with teh belief that present day processes, such as rivers slowly eroding and laying down sediment, were responsible for building the Earth;s crust over millions of years. This influence Darwin and laid the foundation for biological evolution to further undermine the Bibe in people's thinking. \n \n \nYou demonstrate a lack of knowledge of both biology and ecology with this comment.\n\n \n I don't know how biology or ecology came into this. How did you come to that conclusion? Let me give you an example of what I mean by using Mount St Helens. In 1980, Mount St Helens (a volcano) exploded in the USA's Washington state. The initial blast was as big as 2,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs. This volcano caused geological features to form, within only a few weeks, that most geologists think take long periods of time.\n \n Mount St Helens caused landslides, mudflows and ash flows. The force of the explosion pushed the water out of a massive lake nearby, and giant waves ripped out millions of trees from the surrounding country side, resulting in major erosion. In 1982 the mountain erupted again while there was snow in the crater. This time, the melted snow caused a colossal mudflow. That mudflow, in only one day, eroded out a canyon 30 metres deep! It's like a model of the grand canyon. The layers seen in the sides of canyons don't mean long ages. At Mount St Helens, we've seen 183 metres of sediment build up since teh explosion. A small cliff of layered sediment, 8 metres high formed in less than one day! Had no one witnessed these events, many geologists would claim that the eroding out of a canyon 30 metres deep would have taken a long time - not in just a single day!\n \n Providing the natural forces are big enough, there's never been any reason not to believe that geological things can occur in a short time. The \"Fathers\" of modern geology all believed that the facts fitted with the Biblical description of Noah's Flood. Mount St Helens also shows that coal can be formed quite quickly too. In fact, researchers at the Argonne national Laboratories in Chicago heated wood, clay and water to ony 150 degrees Celsius and formed coal in just two t eight months!\n \n The bible is an interesting document. Some of its stories appear to have been based upon real events. Others are pure flights of fantasy. Noah's flodd is one such pure flight of fantasy.

   "Nu Leader,\n \n You are seriously out of date with your ideas on geology. Back in the 18th century, there were arguments between supporters of Neptunism and Plutonianism over how sea fossils got to the tops of mountains. Crudely put, the former believed that a series of floods carried them there, the Plutonians argued that that was daft (after all where did the water go between floods) and that God had made the mountains that way. This battle died away in the 19th century due to the father of geology, Hutton, who pointed out that mountains erode and that therefore they must be uplifted by some force from sea beds. Later a new battle flaired up between supporters of catastrophism and uninformitarianism. These are the two camps of geology that you refer to. Cleric geologists like Buckland were keen supporters of catastrophism as it allowed them to have the Noah's flood story play a part in the Earth's history. Lyell is the most famous of the uninformitarianism supporters. The latter has largely won out, but to suggest that modern geologists are uninformitarian supporters is to ignore 200 years of geological advancements. These days we understand that it is a mixture of the two (mainly steady change with occasional bursts of abrupt change caused mainly be volcanism) that gives the true picture of Earth's history.\n \n Whitby is a town in Yorkshire (in England). It has a long geological history and it took nearly 150 years for geologists to work out how the rocks around the harbour formed.
