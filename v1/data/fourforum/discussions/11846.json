   "describe the view from your window next to where you (usually) use your computer or laptop.\n \n My backyard...i will always look around first to see where the dog is. I can't see where she is all the time, but if she's in view I'll take a look at what she's doing. Usually nothing, lol.\n \n The most impressive thing in my backyard is the 60 ft red wood tree. owls will sometimes make their nests there. squirrels wil plunder the nearby walnut tree and then run on to the redwood tree and climb very high and eat until their bellies are full. there are two sheds, onewhere chickens used to be, now used for storage and another used for tools. There are many flowers and vegetables growing near the fence and beyond my backyard are the hills and more trees.\n \n It's a nice view. :)",
