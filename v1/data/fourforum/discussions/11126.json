   "Tampa, Florida - Hillsborough County Commissioner Brian Blair is warning parents about the \"Day of Silence.\" \n \n The \"Day of Silence\" is an annual event created by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network to bring attention to name-calling, bullying and harassment of gay students. On April 25th some students will wear buttons or t-shirts to to observe the day. Others may even put tape over their mouths.\n \n In an e-mail from the District 6 Commissioner, Blair encourages parents to contact the Hillsborough County School District to object. Blair notes an Internet list of schools that are alleged to be participating on April 25th. The list includes Tampa Bay Technical High School, Riverview High School, Wesley Chapel High School and St. Petersburg High School.\n \n Here are excerpts from the Brian Blair e-mail:\n \n Commissioner warns of homosexual \"social and sexual agenda\" - Tampa Bays Local News\n \n 1) If anybody seriously wants to put \"sexual orientation\" in the same category as \"religion\", I welcome it.\n Religion is protected by our constitution and numerous laws across the land.\n Putting \"sexual orientation\" in the same category as \"religion\" would forbid the discrimination against it, guaranteeing equal rights.\n \n By the same token, it would invoke restrictions as well. \"Separation of church and state\" issues would apply.\n But quite frankly, the amount gained would be paltry compared to \"separation of church and state\" applying to homosexuality.\n \n 2) I am amused at the mentality Brian brings forth. I've seen it repeatedly.\n He claims to support \"equal treatment\", yet then he invokes the propagandic words of \"social and sexual agenda\".\n Does he not realize that the \"agenda\" IS \"equal treatment\"?\n \n 3) If Brian would stop and think for a minute, he'd see the real comparison here.\n The school may be forbidden from ORCHESTRATING a \"minute of silence\", but there is NOTHING that forbids the students from doing it themselves.\n No law which forbids Christian students from praying in school. (\"As long as they continue to give tests, there will always be prayer in school.\")\n \n On the flip side, I see no school official ORCHESTRATING the \"Day of Silence\".\n Students are free to follow it if they want, or ignore it.\n It is not a school \"policy\".\n \n It is obviously conceivable that ANY Christian organization could advertise a voluntary \"Minute of Silence\" on their own like some gays have advertised for the \"Day of Silence\". A Christian organization could come forth and proclaim: \"For any who wish to silently reflect, please remain silent for minute 12:05\" (or some other minute).\n \n But as I have pointed out in the past, the way that SOME christians pursue the issue, insisting on SCHOOL SPONSORSHIP rather than individual voluntary action which is typically how religion works, demonstrates some rather bizarre ulterior motives...\n \n 4) \"Surgical strike\"?\n Another phrase which demonstrates that this man's proclamation of \"tolerance\" is anything but. Lip service to try to pretend he isn't what he demonstrates that he is.\n If you want to enact a \"Day of Abstention\" in a similar way that the \"Day of Silence\" is held, go for it.\n Just be prepared for a lot of questions by people who will expose the motivation behind such a move for what it truly is...",

However, it doesn't take much to see some problems that might arise. School sometimes requires talking. If a teacher asks a question in class to a student on the day of silence (e.g. \"Tommy, what is the answer to question #18?\") who is observing it, is that student still encouraged to be disobedient to the teacher by not responding? Would people who support this day of silence want the student to ignore the teacher or break the silence? Just curious, and just food for thought.",

   "And the attorney argues that schools cannot legally threaten or punish students who do not want to participate in the celebration of homosexuality. \"Clearly they can stay home from school,\" he continues. \"They don't have to go to school and they can't be punished [for doing that].\"\n But Staver says if schools do try to punish these students then \"they need to contact us so that we can resolve the matter.\"http://onenewsnow.com/Legal/Default.aspx?id=77026\n \n I can't believe these anti-gay people. Absolutely amazing.\n \n They tell kids to SKIP SCHOOL, and then insist that the schools cannot punish the kids who do SKIP SCHOOL based on this junk. emoticon_xdonno \n \n Furthermore, the \"Day of Silence\" is NOT a school sponsored event.\n There are NO schools out there that \"legally threaten or punish students who do not want to participate in the celebration of homosexuality\".\n (Anybody who can find one, please prove me wrong...)\n \n This is an event that students, INDIVIDUALLY and INDEPENDENT of the school, decide to participate or ignore for themselves.\n \n I am routinely amazed at how \"honesty\" is not only NOT a \"family value\", NOBODY who endorses \"family values\" seems to care...",
