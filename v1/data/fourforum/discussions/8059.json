   "Georgian officials attend to do away with information discrediting the leadership of the country. It's well-known that some of high-ranking officials were occupied with other work before Saakashvili's coming to power. Well, not long ago Georgian Ministry of State Security worked over archives cleaning and arrested undesirable eye-witnesses but now it reached to journalists who communicated with them once.\n And most striking example is Georgian Minister for Conflict Resolution Georgy Haindrava's movements. The fact is that in 1992 he gave interview to French journalist. He said that Georgia wanted to annihilate Abkhazians gene pool - 15 thousand of young men (80 thousand is total number of Abkhazians) - and Georgia had everything for it. After article publication in Le Monde Diplomatique he refuted all his announcements referred to the fact that journalist didn't understand him. \n Well, in praesenti the article author is lost; I think that he is hiding himself from possible punishment of Georgian Special Services. Or he had been killed. It's well-known that Georgian Ministry of State Security will not stop at anything to save the reputation of its officials.",
