My ambition is to encourage new leadership that will start setting a good example of how to be a good neighbor. \n \n My first step that I have taken was to join membership with my peer group managers. I was anticipating that my peer group managers would in kind be a good neighbor to me.\n \n It is sad for me to report, that not a single group manager has signed up for my group.\n \n We dare to wonder why our world has become cynical and hateful. Our leadership has broken Christ's Golden Rule: \n \n Luke6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.",

There are machine operator jobs where no amount of bonding will increase productivity but there are many creative design efforts where a good party every now and then takes the pressure off and rejuvenates the drive. I think that's the whole purpose behind the \"weekend\" where you are able to bond with yourself...to rejuvenate the weary worker. A little bonding session where one finds out that so-and-so is not really a worthless POS can be beneficial...and no company driven bonding gathering I ever attended had any religious content imposed...just common sense considerations of other people.",
