   "I had an extensive debate about this soft tissue discovery on another forum.\nOne can only doubt how extensive such a debate actually was. Given your demonstrated knowledge of the topic and your unwillingness to learn, it couldn't have gone into much depth. If the answers you got were anywhere near the quality of the answers you have received on this forum, then any failure to understand is your fault, given your penchant to scoff in an elitist manner at anything that you don't understand.\n \nThe opposition was unable to reasonably explain how soft tissue survived 60 million years when it is reasonably expected by scientists that any fossils that survive that long would be petrified. So what do you evo apologists say to explain this 60 million year old soft tissue ?\nFirst, it was 68 million years. Second, as has been explained, it isn't really \"soft tissue\" but only remnants of organic materials. obvious_child has already given you two links that explain it. The \"organic materials\" happened to be heme, an organic iron compound, and what has now turned out to be 7 short amino acid chains that are typical of collagen.\n \n This case in unique. This particular fossil was the remains of an intact T. rex femur, a very large bone. To find such large bones intact is rare and presented a unique problem; how to extract it from the very remote excavation site in one piece. They couldn't so they cut it into two pieces. This afforded the opportunity to study the interior of the fossil. Previously, such studies were conducted on already broken fossils.\n \n Hopefully you are aware that this fossil bone is actually rock (I am doubtful because in another thread you thought carbon dating a rock was legitimate). It was formed by the replacement of the organic compounds by minerals dissolved in ground water. As that was done, it occurred from the outside in. As that was done, the outside became less and less permeable to ground water. In effect, this sealed the interior of the bone and allowed some organic remnants to survive. That is one hypothesis that I have seen.\n \nAnd do you really believe any excuse given to explain it ? I'll tell you right up front that I dont.\nSo you think that new knowledge is an excuse? This is something that was not known and has been a surprise to paleontologists. Funny how you are willing to believe the excuses involved in inappropriate dating by inappropriate methods but think that something new to science is an excuse.\n \nI will buy 5,000 years maybe, under the right circumstances. But never 60,000,000 years. I can safely say that it is virtually impossible.\nAnd I can safely say that it is virtually impossible for a bone to become fossilized in only 5000 years. Of course, you actually think that the universe in only 6000 years old, so that must have something to do with your date.\n \nCan anyone direct me to a link that shows how deep under ground this fossil was excavated from ? Thank you in advance for that info.\nSure. The image attached to this message is a picture of a paleo site in the Hell Creek Formation. I don't know if this is the actual site from which this fossil was recovered, but it will give you an idea of what the country side looks like. Notice that the K-T boundary is visible in the side of the hill above the side. The KT boundary has been dated by several methods to be about 65 million years old.\n \n I have also linked a picture of Pompey's Pillar, an exposed part of the Hell Creek Formation not too far from the site. This is very close to where I grew up. Notice that you can also see the K-T boundary in the side of Pompey's Pillar. This landmark is famous because of the signature of William Clark and the date, July 25, 1806 (Lewis & Clark Expedition).\n \n Now that we have covered that, is the site of the fossils the bottom of the flood? I've asked you to tell me where I might see this before and you haven't been able to do it. If the fossil site is it, how do you explain the sedimentary rock below the site? Where in that hillside is the top of the flood?\n \n Pompey's Pillar",

   "I most definitely agree. I'll buy up to 10,00 years ago - anything more than that is just an absurd fairytale.\nYou do? The you should answer the questions that Archy ducked. Where in those pictures is the bottom of the flood, and where is the top? If those pictures aren't good enough, then please indicate the bottom and top in the walls of the Grand Canyon. Is the Coconino sandstone below or above the flood, since that formation preserves desert sand dunes, complete with insect, arachnid, and reptile tracks (no aquatic fossils are present). Be careful now, since I'm going to want to discuss specific strata and fossils wherever you peg the bottom and top. Certainly, the Coconino could not have been deposited during the flood since it is so thick and so vast. Moreover, above it is the Kaibab Limestone and the Toroweap Formation (both limestone) - limestone is always the result of a marine environment. Below are the Hermit Shale, the Supai Formation (shale, limestone, and sandstone), Redwall Limestone, Temple Butte Limestone, the Toronto Group (shale, limestone, sandstone, and some dolomite). Below that the geology is a bit more confusing, with layers of shale, limestone, sandstone, quartzite, lava, schist, and granite, all tilted from the horizontal. Please explain this geology.\n \n Understand that I'm not interested in any just-so story about how a global flood deposited all of these various strata, and how the Grand Canyon was created by rapid drain-off through soft deposits. You need to explain why the soft walls of the canyon didn't collapse. Also, if the dolomite strata are above the bottom of the flood, how they were formed in the first place - not enough time. If those layers are below the flood, please explain how they were formed - not enough time. Please explain the multiple limestone deposits - slow forming sedimentary layers deposited in calm waters. You do understand that limestone is formed from the calcite shells of microscopic marine organisms, don't you?\n \n So you stepped up when Archy tucked his tail and ran. Good for you.
