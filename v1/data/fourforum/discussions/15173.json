   "Why Liberals Want Gun Shows Stopped - HUMAN EVENTS\n \n \nA fundamental principle of a free people is the ability to transfer property to someone else without government intervention. In the case of firearms, it is often a tradition to pass on a gun from one generation to another.\n \n Recently a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, commissioned a poll to determine how the public felt about tightening background checks on people that bought guns. It will come as little surprise that a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns wants additional restrictive legislation on the already restrictive process and they even bought the research that indicates the public agrees.\n \n The target of liberal legislators is the gun show. If you are a licensed gun dealer you hold a Federal Firearms License and are required by law to perform a background check before you can release the gun to the buyer. That makes good sense and often there is a waiting period. A waiting period makes good sense too unless you are someone being threatened or harassed and you happen to need a way to defend yourself. The attacker will be reassured that the government will deny you, the potential victim, an immediate opportunity to purchase a tool to defend yourself. When an attack is going to happen in seconds the police, if called, will respond in minutes to take the crime report.\n \n Here is the controversial aspect of a gun show: the unlicensed seller. This is a person that wants to sell his personal property to another individual. It is the equivalent of you saying \"Mike, you want to sell that .22?\" And then me telling you I'll take 50-bucks for it. We have a deal and I'm the unlicensed seller. But, I don't need a license to sell you my .22. That is the \"gun show loophole.\"\n \n Closing the \"gun show loophole\" enables the government to curtail person to person sales. That is what is really behind the attack on gun shows. Every gun would have to be turned into a gun dealer so that it could be tracked by the Federal Government and then the transfer process would be monitored by the Federal Government. The right you have now to sell your neighbor your shotgun will be gone, forever.\n \n What is even more disturbing is the loss of the right to pass on your gun to a family member. The tradition of passing on grandpa's gun to his grandson will be legislated out of existence. Gramps will have to pass the gun to a federally authorized entity that will then register it and pass it on to the recipient. Often the gifting of the first firearm is to someone thirteen or fourteen years old. Because they can not legally own a gun at that age it would have to be transferred to someone who would then hold the gun until it could be then transferred to the final owner when legal age is reached. That's a lot of red tape to give someone your squirrel rifle.\n \n Anti-gun liberals know that more bureaucracy on law abiding citizens is the easiest form of gun control and hidden under the label of 'common sense gun measures.\" If the government can make criminals out of people that have never committed a criminal act with administrative measures then people will avoid buying, owning and transferring guns altogether. Then they accomplish what they set out to do; stop legal citizens from owning guns.\n \n New York City has some of the toughest gun laws in the United States but they have not eliminated crimes committed with guns. Why? Because going after gang members is dangerous, expensive and more often than not the criminal ends up back on the street. Mayors Against Illegal Guns should take a closer look at those that are committing the crimes and focus on punishing the perpetrators rather than building a bureaucracy that is targeted at legal gun owners.\n \n I remember when I was a teenager walking down the street with an Ithaca Model 37 pump 12 gauge in the rural Adirondack mountain town where I grew up. I had purchased the gun from a friend and there wasn't any paperwork, background check, state or federal government involved. A police car pulled up next to me and the officer asked \"Are you coming or going? I get off in a few minutes and if you want to go hunting together hop in and I'll give you a ride.\" It turns out I was walking home and after I told that to the officer, he just said \"Ok then, next time\" and drove off. To me, that officer exercised common sense gun control. An anti-gun liberal would have had me, the gun seller and probably the officer up on federal charges and locked us up for a long time. It's a pity that the left doesn't understand the relationship between gun ownership and crime but it will be a tragedy if we let the Bloomberg lead coalition erode the gun rights of a free people.\n",

Besides the Thousands of guns the ATF allowed to cross the border, there is this. \n \n  Is it gun shops, gun shows or government that is &#8216;chief source of weapons?' \n Yesterday, a federal grand jury indicted Mayor Eddie Espinoza, Police Chief Angelo Vega, Trustee Blas Gutierrez, all of Columbus, NM, and eight others including Gutierrez&#8217; wife, Eva on charges of gun trafficking. Court documents obtained by this column allege that approximately 200 firearms were purchased by the suspects over a 14-month period, running from January 2010 to this month, and that several of those firearms have been recovered by authorities in Mexico. Authorities in that country are \"distancing themselves\" from the growing scandal over gun trafficking, as reported by the McAllen, TX Monitor\n \n To keep this in perspective, that pales in comparison to perhaps 2,500 guns allegedly allowed to enter the illicit gun trade under the Project Gunrunner/Fast-and-Furious operation in Arizona, an operation that has become the center of a scandal now under investigation by Iowa Sen. \n \n Still, the press seems content to focus on the myth of &#8220;American guns flooding Mexico&#8221; rather than the facts about how a lot of them apparently got there. \n\n So do we think the anti-gun solution will solve this problem?

America is still regarded as a free society. Changing the laws in response to criminal actions to prevent them from being carried out against isn't exactly what a free society does. There's always going to be some form of exploitation being carried out, some loophole that might be abused that will draw your ire, but you have little choice but suck it up. The response of \"there should be a law to criminalize that\" quickly puts you in a corner where you can't do anything without first consulting your attorney and other legal experts.\n \n You don't like that a person can privately buy a gun without leaving some sort of paper trail that the government can follow. Well that's too bad. I don't see any overwhelming evidence that the government has a legitimate interest in tracking every single gun currently in circulation on the civilian market. Nor so I see sufficient evidence to suggest that more illegal transactions are being made than legal ones. Simply because some criminals get their guns from private individuals in a face to face transfer doesn't justify the measures that you support implementing in response. Unless you have evidence of an epidemic I'm really not interested in this ridiculous position.\n \n And not onto some other ridiculous points you've made.\n \n \nDifficult to assess given the fact that untraceable fireams from other states flow freely into CA.\n\n \n I believe this admission is sufficient to undermine the validity and integrity of California's documentation laws. For what purpose is the system maintained if California is alone in its execution of such standards? Being the lone holdout really doesn't accomplish anything good if you have no safeguards to prevent it from occurring. All you end up with a list of honest people obeying the law while the criminals continue unfettered like a covert black ops team that doesn't officially exist. You can't arrest anybody if you can't prove anything. And you can't prove anything with only a list of the law abiding. So unless you can actually arrest a criminal who's illegally possessing a gun you have nothing and are just wasting taxpayer money.\n \n \nOne might expect over time for a diminishing percentage of guns used in crimes to originate in CA. There has not been nearly enough time to gather concrete verification of such a trend. This is what I mean when I say \"comprehensive\". Without a federal law, firearms will continue to move from states with no regulations on secondary sales, carried by criminals.\n\n \n This all sounds like a lot of hypothetical mumbo jumbo with no basis in reality. Keep in mind the Second Amendment is regarded as a fundamental right now. Any recommendation for restriction should be held to higher standards than uneducated hypotheticals that don't take real world instances into account.\n \n \nAs far as the value for LE in an investigation of a recovered gun, I believe somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of traces nationwide lead nowhere since the gun in question was sold in an undocumented secondary sale at some point.\n\n \n How exactly do you arrive at the conclusion that those traces failed due to undocumented sales? Wouldn't the same results happen if they were stolen? If the previous owner was killed and their property stolen you'll have a dead end to deal with. And exactly how many traces are we talking about here? Hundreds? Thousands? Millions? An actual number of events would be nice in this discussion even if it's just a ballpark for comparison purposes. That 90% figure is highly misleading if the number is exceedingly low.\n \n \nI support documentation of the present owner, not a list of previous owners. If legally sold, what business is it who the last seller was?\n\n \n And how exactly do you ensure that the records are kept up to date and previous records are destroyed once they become outdated? And last I checked California was considered broke.\n \n \nIf that person knowingly armed a criminal, yes.\n\n \n And exactly how do you expect to prove a case that the person in question not only knowingly but deliberately armed a criminal? How do you propose showing that their actions were deliberate and without regard to who might get hurt? Do you have a recommendation for showing mens rea in such a case?\n \n Another question would be how far do you intend to push the issue? If you can make a case against a windowed 80 year old woman for selling her deceased husband's war trophy Walther pistol to a later identified criminal are you going to prosecute her for her actions?\n \n \nIf your gun turns up in connection to a felony, the law should be able to find you and ask you what you know about it. Period.\n\n \n I was under the impression that once the money changed hands it was no longer your legal property anymore. Possession is 9/10 of the law isn't it? If you sell me your car and I pay for it in full is it still your car because you were the last previous owner?\n \n \nI embrace and in fact support recent SCOTUS rulings with regard to 2A rights but State laws requiring documentation and background checks on secondary sales that have not been challenged must be presumed Constitutional, practically speaking.\n\n \n Under the strict scrutiny test the law at issue must be considered unconstitutional until the govern in jurisdictional authority can prove otherwise.",

Who you calling uneducated there freindo? Regulation isn't restriction btw.\n \n \n \nHow exactly do you arrive at the conclusion that those traces failed due to undocumented sales? Wouldn't the same results happen if they were stolen?\nNo, you'd find the legal owner from whom it was stolen and hopefully reported. Guess who gets their gun back?

No theft report, no chance of getting the gun back. \n \n \nIf the previous owner was killed and their property stolen you'll have a dead end to deal with.\nRight. And? You're flailing.

   "Is that meant to be an insult? Another provincial rube are we?\n\n \n Not really an insult but it can certainly be insulting to those who are easily offended. That's really the British way of doing business, put an end to something that can potentially be exploited. Would you like to see the case of Britain developing the shatter proof beer glass in response to drunken bar fights?\n \n Or maybe you'd be more interested in the British police trying to outlaw protest marches in response to the student riots regarding the tuition increases. Martial Law: UK Police Chief Mulls Banning Protests\n \n \nRegulated not eliminated. Try buying an armload of cold medicine these days.\n\n \n Nice try but we're not buying the semantics game of regulated/eliminated. Washington DC tried that when they made it law that only registered handguns could be owned, and then they stopped the registration process. So even though handgun ownership was only regulated it was also eliminated through excessive and unjust regulation.\n \n \nLaws don't prevent crime. If we're lucky, they have a modest deterrent effect.\n\n \n And how much of a deterrence is California's laws having on the demand for out of state guns that can't be traced or detected?\n \n \nI disagree with your \"wisdom\". We'd still have slavery if we all thought as you do.\n\n \n Exactly what are you saying here? Are you trying to suggest that with enough regulation and enough government oversight all the loopholes and cracks in the system can be patched and closed up?\n \n \nTry to actually make sense, please. I don't advocate criminalizing selling your firearms.\n \n \n You advocate criminalizing the manner in which I would sell or buy my gun of choice though. You apparently don't like the lack of government oversight in this matter and want to do away with that.\n \n \nThere's those \"sharp\" debating skills again. A trail for LE to follow as part of a legitimate criminal investigation with the appropriate paperwork, signed by a judge.\n\n \n Are there any other standards in which LE is authorized to investigate the last known owner of other types of property?\n \n \nA form on file at a gun shop ain't \"tracking\". It's the same interest served by the same procedures to acquire a new gun right now.\n \n \n No it really isn't. Regardless of your opinions on the matter there's a difference between federally licensed dealers who are in a business to make money, and private individuals who are managing their private property. If you don't like the privacy aspect then that's too bad, the government had the chance to eliminate that standard back in 1968 but they decided not to include it in the Gun Control Act. And since then they've had years to do something about that supposed \"loophole\" and they haven't done jack. No successful action in nearly a half century, that would make most throw in the towel.\n \n \nWhere did I say this?\n\n \n Well unless there's a significant number of transactions being carried out in a true criminal manner than I don't see the justification for changing the landscape of current law to introduce new standards of paperwork and record keeping. If you can't show more than a minute number of instances that can be regarded as criminal then what exactly are you raising a fit about? That sometimes the bad guys win? That sometimes the system can be exploited because it's not perfect?\n \n \nCalling something ridiculous doesn't make it so. It's the law in quite a number of places already.\n\n \n Quite a number of places? How many exactly? Isn't it only 7 states that follow the example of record keeping that California thought was such a great idea? How exactly is that \"quite a number of places\" when there are 43 other states that don't follow the illogic?\n \n \nCA is not alone and a bill has already been introduced in Congress. We'll lead, you'll follow. Like always.\n\n \n And how many times have similar bills been introduced in congress only to be relegated to the dustbin?\n \n Before the last midterm election the democrats held a house and senate majority that was sufficient to pass obamacare into law. And yet even then they still failed to mandate a universal background check system for all secondary gun sales. That doesn't inspire much confidence in the success of the movement.\n \n You still didn't answer the question though. What exactly is the justification for maintaining your sales recording standards if they're so easily defeated?\n \n \nWe do that now. But next we could investigate who the gun legally belongs to and see if it was lost or stolen(and unreported) or if this person might be trafficking in guns.\n\n \n I'd like to call into question the validity of those cases. And since you're the Californian who's making this case about the effectiveness of your state's system you'd likely have access to the information.\n \n In the most recent year for which the data was available, how many arrests did the state of California make that involved gun-related charges? Of that number how many of the gun charges were successfully prosecuted for state law violations, how many were forwarded to federal court for constituting violating of the National Firearms Act (sawed off shotguns, illegal silences, short barreled rifles, etc.) and how many were removed as part of a plea deal for reduced charges and lighter sentences in order to obtain a conviction?\n \n \nYou're pretty good at mumbo jumbo yourself. Who you calling uneducated there freindo? Regulation isn't restriction btw.\n\n \n That would depend on the extent of the regulation wouldn't it? Maybe you'd like to have a discussion regarding California's legal standards regarding the sale of the AR-15 series of rifle?\n \n \nNo, you'd find the legal owner from whom it was stolen and hopefully reported. Guess who gets their gun back? Of course if they bought it second hand(undocumented) the gun trace wouldn't lead to the present owner. No theft report, no chance of getting the gun back.\n\n \n If the gun were reported as stolen, is it standard police procedure to return a gun to the previous known owner if it was used in a case of felony murder?\n \n You're still not making a sufficient argument here. Exactly how much good comes from a paper trail of second hand sales? How many cases can you present that rely on this paper trail and couldn't survive without it?\n \n \nRight. And? You're flailing. No trace system can be expected to produce 100% results.\n\n \n You accuse me of flailing in my argument? You're the one who can't seem to address presented shortcomings of the system you hold in such high regards. There are so many things that can potentially go wrong and undo such a delicate structure, not the least of which is the felony offense of obliterating the serial number. You can't track something that has no number to it can you?\n \n \n\"Each year, the NTC traces hundreds of thousands of recovered crime guns for law enforcement\"\n http://www.justice.gov/jmd/2010justification/pdf/fy10-atf.pdf \n \n \"Crime gun tracing indicates that about 89 percent of crime guns traced in 1999 changed hands at least once in the secondary market before recovery by law enforcement as crime guns.\"\n USDOJ: United States Department of Justice Archive - StrategyJan16PM\n\n \n Interesting read. You didn't feel this was relevant to begin with when you presented the 90 percent figure for consideration?\n \n I'm still not seeing the case for paper trails connected to secondary sales. A more effective strategy would be to try and stomp out those that are producing the demand that actually keeps the arms trade continuing. Demand is the whole reason supply exists in the first place. Somebody doesn't peddle \"illegal guns\" just for the fun of it they do it because they feel there's a sufficient market to make them rich. California would be better off finding those within its territory who are ordering in the guns and busting them rather than trying to keep tabs on the entire population of gun owners.\n \n \nWhen all else fails claim we can't afford to do a better job even if we could. Man you got skills.\n\n \n Are you claiming that the man hours necessary to keep up to date records is an expense the state of California can easily afford? That the increased paperwork requirements aren't a significant hurdle for the people to face? That the entire process is streamlined and simple and the complications are minute?\n \n A better question. How would secondary sales records on a national level follow the record keeping rules set out by the Paperwork Reduction Act?\n \n \nWhat's the chance it was a one time thing? A case is built based on surveillance of their subsequent actions. \n\n \n And if you only have one count of a violation of the paperwork requirements what do you do about it? Do you go ahead and prosecute the single count? Do you let it drop and take no further action?\n \n \nThe senility defense is my favorite. Let's give her probation, shall we? Would you suggest we make all laws with uninformed or forgetful octogenarians in mind?\n\n \n I'm asking a serious question that reflects facts of the real world. If you don't wish to answer with legitimate responses then just say so.\n \n \nYou're not making sense again.
