   "WASHINGTON - The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are preparing broad new rules that would force banks to rein in practices that made multimillionaires out of many financial executives during the housing bubble, officials said.\n \n The rules depart from the hands-off approach that dominated bank regulation for the last three decades, but are not as strict as proposals from some European leaders and suggestions from some members of Congress angered by the financial troubles of the last year.\n \n .... the rules are intended to restrict pay plans that encourage reckless behavior by rewarding only short-term gains.\n \n .... The Obama administration opposes strict caps on pay, arguing that the size of the bonuses are not as important as the risk to the financial health of the bank that bonuses linked to performance can create.\n \n \"The simple proposition should be that you don't want people being paid for taking too much risk, and you want to make sure that their compensation is tied to long-term performance,\" said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, in an interview by telephone.\n \n Coming at a time of fierce political debate about the Fed's failure to rein in reckless mortgage lending, the rules may have the side benefit of helping the agency improve its image in Congress as it considers whether to trim or expand the Fed's authority.\n \n The draft rules, which are expected to be introduced in the next several weeks, would apply not just to the pay and bonuses of top executives but also of traders, loan officers and others. The biggest and most complex institutions, roughly 20 companies, would have to present their compensation plans to bank regulators, who could then demand changes.\n \n Fed officials do not plan to impose specific rules on how those banks structure their pay plans. Instead, they are expected to spell out ways in which banks can reduce incentives for excessive risk-taking.\n \n For example, examiners will be looking to see whether banks defer bonus compensation for several years, allowing enough time for risks and potential losses to surface....\n \n Examiners are also expected to look for banks to link the size of performance bonuses to the riskiness of particular businesses. And they will support \"clawbacks\" that would enable companies to reclaim money if profits turn out to have been illusory after an executive has been paid.\n \n .... Bank executives said they welcomed the Fed's efforts, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Some executives, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize lawmakers, said they hoped that the Fed's efforts would dissuade Congress, many of whose members were furious over bonuses paid to American International Group, from passing much stricter limits on pay.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/business/economy/19pay.html\n \n Of course, these were nice \"white collar\" thefts, not your common breaking into your house or robbing you at point of gun.",
