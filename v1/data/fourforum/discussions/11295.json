   "I see that it is time for the Truthsayer to re-appear a(and not a moment too soon, I might add.)\n \n I will try to be brief.\n \n As we all know the price of gasoline at the pump is on everyones mind and it has become a political issue regarding this years election.\n \n So here it is, in a nutshell, from someone (me) who doesn't have a dog in the fight.\n \n Both McCain's and Obama's plan is simply propaganda designed to appeal to your vote.\n \n We'll start with Senator McCain. \n \n McCain is endorsing political ads that blame Obama for the oil crisis. An objective person would know this to be absurd. Obama has been in the senate only since 2005. McCain has been in the senate for 25 years. The problems today lay squarely on the shoulders of those in power for the last 15+ years, for not having the foresight to address this problem before it became a national delimna. Republicans and democrats alike. It's just typical election year mudslinging. Granted, some people actually believe it. And one is born every minute. If there is anything positive at all, (from a McCain perspective,) about this propaganda is that it might sway the less informed to vote for McCain. But the learned mind will not be impressed.\n \n McCain wants to \"drill now\" to solve the problem (and mostly get your vote.) That is music to the ears of the simple man feeling the pain at the pump but the truth is that this should have been addressed years ago as more oil production now could only help many years from now and even then it will only be a drop in the bucket. The common misconception amongst the simple minded is that the oil we drill here will stay here and be cheaper than the oil we would otherwise have to buy from the Middle East. That simply is not true. The oil market is global and this miniscule \"drop in the bucket\" addition to the global oil trough would not affect the prices we pay at the pump today or even 10+ years from now, to any significant value. Myself, I see no problem with drilling now. We should have begin that 10+ years ago. (Not that it would make that much difference though.) So, in short, McCain's \"drill now\" plan is simply a band-aid offered for our injury and not a cure at all. And it's not even a very good band-aid, truth be known. \n \n Obama wants to focus on getting away from the \"oil solution\" altogether with alternative fuels and forms of energy. He is offering a tax cut to help the ease of the transition. That is music to the ears of the foresighted /progressive folks. The only problem with that approach is that, 100 plus billion dollars later, at best, Obama's plan is a \"R&D\" that may not pan out at all. If the research does not lead to the significant development required, we will be in even worse off shape than we are now. And you can count on the oil industry to fight him all the way on this. It won't be easy, if at all possible.\n \n My opinion:\n \n Myself, I think we should do both. We should drill for more oil. There are already more drilling leases available and taken than we can shake a stick at. More land to drill on is not the problem. It's getting the oil companies to sink some of that profit they have been making into exploration and getting the gov't to allow them to streamline the process. They are making record profits just the way things are now. Don't count on big oil to help us out with this. Why would they? Who, with a capitolistic mind, could blame them?\n \n Meanwhile, we should desperately and aggressively search for ways to make oil as obsolete as we possibly can. Again, don't expect the oil companies to help make that happen.\n \n Do your research folks and get beyond the mud, smoke and mirrors. Don't be a slave to your own partisanship. Think freely and think what's best for the country and let's put our pride on the back burner for a while.\n \n So sayeth the Truthsayer. emoticon_xhoho",

Ethmi, you'd have a lot more credibility here if you did the work and got rid of your biases, look at TS for a model. \n \n I agree that we need to drill, but we need to frame drilling as nothing more then buying time to get off oil. The idea that oil in itself is a solution is backward and self defeating. Oil is nothing more then a crutch, a ladder, a push towards a new power paradigm.",

Gone are the days where we have to punch a bunch of wildcat wells to see what is down there. Now they move in seismic equipment and map the geology and look for likely spots for oil deposits. I can about promise you that they have run their surveys on most of their leased land.\n \n They do not terminate the leases because as long as the lease is active, it stays on their books as an asset. If they declare it a dry hole and give it back, the cost of the lease (which can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars) moves from the \"assets\" column to the \"losses\" column. \n \n Interestingly enough, if they hold the lease until the end and do not ever declare it a dry hole, the cost falls off the \"assets\" column but never shows up on the \"losses\" side. It just magically vanishes. I am not sure how they do this. Oil companies have different accounting rules than the rest of the world. Steeeve might be able to explain how they make this happen.",
