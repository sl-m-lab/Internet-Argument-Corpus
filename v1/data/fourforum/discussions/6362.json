Bush's first thought was to build an ark!! :p \n \n Ahhh....this looks better for Bush on this poll. Only about 6 out of 10 thinks he sucks.\n \n This poll says that he sucks butt too but is a little nicer about it. They probably owe Rove a favor. \n \n Of course, this graph doesn't show just HOW low his ratings have sunk lately but it paints a nice colorful picture of how they have been nose diving since 9/11. \n \n That damn liberal media. What do they know?  emoticon_mad \n \n Don't get anymore objective and unbiased than these guys. OH NO!!  :p \n \n Even worse than Nixon? How could that be? \n \n And I could go on and on and on.......\n \n What's it gonna take to get his supporters to wake up, smell the coffee and help get our nation back on track?",

   "And the hit's just keep comin'. :p \n \n Television reports today that Bush's disapproval rate hits historic low.... (Except for the diehard Bush cultists, of course. emoticon_rolleyes )\n \n It appears that almost 7 people out of ten, thinks he stinks.\n \n I have to ask, just WHAT would Bush have to do to lose the support of the other three? Rape babies? Have an affair with Hillery? Donate to the underprivileged? What? What would it take for these Bush supporters to break ranks?\n\n \n It doesn't matter. It's not a popularity contest and he's not up for re-election. Approval polls mean very little, in the grand scheme of things. Clinton had very high approval ratings, but his VP didn't get his office. Bush has low approval rating right now, but there is no indication there is going to be any sort of 'housecleaning' in Washington anytime soon. The thing is, many people that vote for Bush are principle voters. That means that even though they may not approve of the way Bush is being president, they may still vote for him because the alternative is so unsettling. You could have the election again right now and with some campaigning he could very well win again.\n \n I doubt Bush gives a worry in the least about his approval rating. And that's exactly WHY many would probably vote for him again. Being popular is not a president's mandate--or at least it shouldn't be.",

I never thought Bush ever gave two cents what we Americans wanted or how we felt as long as the oil industry was making money hand over fist. Further, I have to agree that running against Kerry, how could he lose? It was a choice between dumb and dumber. The democrats deserved that last loss. But at least it didn't take the Supreme Court to decide the last time around. I suppose that's a plus. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n You know, Saddam didn't care about his popularity either. :p \n \n Here's some more for you Bush diehards. It's the Zogby poll.",
