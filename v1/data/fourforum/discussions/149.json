   "I think some people need to understand that sometimes war is the only way. Not all people are rational!Saddam is a good example. He has had seventeen chances, and he has broken the agreement each and everytime. He won't leave, he doesn't care about the terms of these agreements, and he's going to do it anyway. What can we do? Pass forty more resolutions while he's working on getting that third part to complete his nuke?\n \n Iraq is about the size of California. There is a major US nuclear laboratory in California. That lab could be split up into pieces all around the country so that it could evade detection from the 100 weapons inspectors. Defectors and our intelligence have shown us that he is developing his nuclear weapons. \n \n I don't see why you are willing to leave him in power to kill thousands more meaningly and develop weapons. When he gets that nuke he'll probably revert to his old habits of invading neighbors and he'll have a bomb to back it up. \n \n You cannot always sit at a table and come to peace with people who don't want peace. Try to think about that. In some cases being anti-war is fine, but on Iraq... Do we want Iraq to be another North Korea? \n \n A lot of times we can and do solve things peacefully, but it can't always be that way because not all people are rational people and willing to stick to peace.",
