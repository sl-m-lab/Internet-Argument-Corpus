At the point where missles start to fly, there is a good chance we could destroy all life on earth anyway.\n\n \n Indeed I see it as highly unlikely that the US will fall in that sense. I think the most sensible caparison is the British Empire. 100, or even just over 50 years ago it appeared that we were in a similar position and yet in a few years that all changed. Empires these days do not fall so much through external invasion and war but instead through changes in ideology.\n \n I feel that the US is increasingly having problems with it's flouting of UN and human rights issues, both from home and abroad. And that eventually it may well be forced to adhere to international law, thus diminishing it's powerbase. There is also growing hostility to the US cultural exports through the world, Macdonalds is loosing profit over here, as are most of the similar chains. While for the moment this is negligible I believe that it is the start of a decline in US dominance.\n \n \nAnd if fall means the loss of America's power, who honestly would there be to step up? And why would they knowing that we will bomb them back to the stoneage...\n\n \n Well the obvious answer would be China, I think that is all the bookies keen favourite for the next superpower. Again this power shift will not be through military might. And should the US try to bomb China if it looks like it is growing to big for itself, well I can think that would be falling on it's own sword to say the least.\n \n \nIt's our job to rule the world...a lesson Germany and Japan will be glad to tell you.\n\n \n What exactly do you mean by that?\n \n edit: grammar",

It seems that when a nation steps up to take on more power, the US is always there to put them down. In all reality, look at Korea and Vietnam. They were really both wars against the Soviets and China more so than against Vietnam and Korea. WWII was all about power also. We did not even know of the extermintion of the Jews until very late in the war. Most people think that this is why we fought WWII. In reality, had Hitler just taken Poland and Holland and then stopped, we probably would have done nothing. He got gready and ran too far into Americas sphere of influence. Same with Japan. If they had taken a few islands in the Pacific, we would have ignored them. They threatened to become to big of an influence throughout the world, and left unchecked, could have taken the place of the US in the \"management\" of the world.
