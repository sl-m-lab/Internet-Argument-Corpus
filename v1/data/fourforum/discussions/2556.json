   "Greetings to All:\n \n The Apostle Paul writes to us Gentiles (Rom. 11:13), saying, \"For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.\" Rom. 12:4+5. And again, \"Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.\" 1Cor. 12:27. While I can provide you with numerous verses like, \"because we are members of His body\" (Eph. 5:30), I cannot give you one verse where Paul says we are the 'bride of Christ.' Paul simply never uses the word even once in his Gentile Epistles. NASB.\n \n Israel of the flesh, however, is identified through prophecy (OT) and the fulfillment of prophecy (NT; Hebrew Epistles) as the 'bride.' First we are to recognize the Lord God (YHVH Elohim; Gen. 2:4, etc.) as the 'Lord of the Sabbath,' (Matt. 12:8), as the Lord of this seventh day period, i.e., as our Lord Jesus Christ. He says, \"I will betroth you [Israel] to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion, and I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD.\" Hosea 2:19+20.\n \n Jesus Christ came along after John the Baptist who appeared from the wilderness to Israel of the flesh (Matt. 3:3). Note carefully the wording of the OT Text. \"A voice is calling, \"Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.\" Isaiah 40:3. You and I know that Jesus Christ is the Lord who followed this messenger, and the OT prophecy verifies that this Person was the Lord God Himself. The same is true for Malachi 3:1-3. \n \n In the New Testament (outside of Paul's Epistles), we have several examples where Christ and others describe Him as this bridegroom seeking His bride. \"And Jesus said to them, \"The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.\" Matt. 9:15. \"And Jesus said to them, \"While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.\" Mark 2:18-20 (19), See also Luke 5:34+35.\n \n John the Baptist bears witness, \"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.\" John 3:29.\n \n The Book of Revelation describes the future marriage of the bride to the Lamb, \"Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.\" Rev. 19:7. Then later on, this bride is called his wife. \"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, \"Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\" Rev. 21:9. Then, in unison, \"The Spirit and the bride say, \"Come.\" And let the one who hears say, \"Come.\" And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.\" Rev. 22:17.\n \n Many professing Christians today wish to distort these things and make us (the Gentile Body of Christ) into the 'bride of Christ,' instead of His body. Some among them believe, since Israel rejected Christ and demanded His crucifixion (Matt. 27:23), that God's promises to Israel, as His Chosen Race, have been given to the Gentiles. What does Paul say? \n \n \"For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \"THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB. THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\" Romans 11:25-27.\n \n Peter, James, the writer of Acts and the Prophets are in full agreement with Paul, that a period will pass, then all Israel will be saved. James said at the meeting in Jerusalem (OT Text in Caps), \"Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name [the body of Christ; that's us]. With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, 'AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT, SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,' SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO.\" Acts 15:14-18.\n \n While the OT Prophets saw the bride of Christ (Israel joined in marriage to the Lord God; Rev. 19:5-10), they did not see that the Lord God would have a 'body of Christ' prepared beforehand. Our gospel is according to the revelation of the mystery (Rom. 16:25) which was not seen by any of the prophets. Our Lord Jesus Christ is called the \"Lamb\" in regards to His bride, because the ceremony includes all the members who have been baptized into His body (that's us 'in' Christ; 1Cor. 12:12-14) on the cross (Rom. 6:3+4) at Calvary. \n \n While Israel's joining to Christ is future and governed by the legal aspects of marriage, we are members of the Lamb already, being baptized into His body and seated in the heavenly placed 'in' Christ. Eph. 2:4-7 (6). Those who believed the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) are waiting in anticipation of the marriage supper of the Lamb to be joined with Him. Those who have believed Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25; describing 1Cor. 15:1-4) are members of His body already.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

The Church is the Body of Christ and it is the Bride of Christ\n\n \n Further to that Jesus annointed a very few of His followers to teach - see Acts where although many baptise, only the Apostles confer the gift of the Holy Spirit... clearly Jesus appointed bishops.\n \n Acts 8\n 14\n When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.\n 15\n When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, \n 16\n because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. 17\n Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. \n \n That is, some had taken faith, and had been baptised, but had not received the gift of the Holy Spirit until it had been conferred upon them through Christ's Apostles; Peter and John. This too is surely a sign of the unity of Christ with God. For Christ was able to confer such a commission onto men, that they might be able to confer God's Holy Spirit upon others.\n \n It is in fact why that particular book is called \"Acts of the Apostles\" it is both about the Apostles, and the works that they did. Otherwise it'd be called \"Faith of the Apostles\" or \"Faith of the Followers\"\n \n In one of the earliest Christian works (by St.Ignatius) we see bishops in action...\n Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 5\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n It is in line with St.Paul's cries to various Christian communities to be uniform in faith. He never says \"Okay dudes, you've read the Bible, now go read it for yourselves and do your own thing.\"\n \n They are the keepers of the faith, for not everything was written down...\n John 21:25\n Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\"\n In other words, the Bible doesn't cover everything.\n \n Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you (I Corinthians 11:2)\n \n ?Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle?\n (II Thessalonians 2:15)",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus writes << If you don't believe that Paul refers to the Church as the bride of Christ then read Ephesians 5 \n \n Terral's reply << Should we read the whole chapter or would you care provide us some guidance as to the point of your theory? Paul writes, \"Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children, and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.\" Eph. 5:1-3. I am not seeing your point . . . \n \n Paul does teach that we are members of His body, saying, \"For no one ever hated his OWN FLESH, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also {does} the church, because we are members of HIS BODY.\" Eph. 5:29+30. If Paul ever intended on teaching that we are the bride of Christ, then this was his perfect opportunity. Instead, what Paul teaches in Ephesians 5 is exactly what he told the Romans and Corinthians. \n \n \"For just as we have many members in ONE BODY and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are ONE BODY in Christ, and individually members one of another.\" Rom. 12:4+5.\n \n \"For even as the body is one and {yet} has many members, and all the members of the BODY, though they are many, are ONE BODY, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into ONE BODY, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. For THE BODY is not one member, but many.\" 1Cor. 12:12-14.\n \n Maximus adds << and 2 Corinthians 11:2. \n \n Terral's reply << Thank you very much for bringing this verse of Scripture to our attention. This single verse of Text is the subject of my correspondence with the Lockman Foundation. Please allow me to share part of that letter here:\n \n Verse in question: 2 Cor 11:2 For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I [betrothed] you to one [husband], so that to Christ I might present you {as} a pure virgin. \n \n Requested changes: [betrothed] to (joined), [husband] to (man).\n \n Here is the problem, and the source of many errant definitions and interpretations in this area. This word betrothed (harmozo, #718) is derived from (harmos, #719), which means \"a joining; joint.\" Holman's Exhaustive Concordance. Both of these words are also used only one time in Scripture (harmozo in 2Cor. 11:2, and harmos in Heb. 4:12). The root of which is \"harma\" which is literally \"a chariot.\" The meaning of all these words is tied to the traditional meaning and action of joining a chariot to one or more horses. The regular Greek word for \"betrothal\" (like \" . . . Mary had been betrothed to Joseph\" Matt. 1:18) is mnesteus (#3423). \n \n When you boil all of this information down, it becomes painfully obvious that this word 'betrothed' in 2Cor. 11:2 has been translated incorrectly by the Lockman Foundation scholars, and most everyone else. To make matters worse, they used this preconceived notion to defile the translation of another key word in the verse. Let us look at it again, \"For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one [Husband], so that to Christ I might present you {as} a pure virgin.\" 2Cor. 11:2. This word husband is (aner, #435), which is the primary NT word for 'man.' This word is translated over 150 times in your Bible as a form of 'man.' Aner can be translated 'husband' IF the context warrants. The translators used 'betrothed' to alter 'man' into 'husband.'\n \n Many people have the errant idea that we are the 'bride of Christ,' because of the wording of this one passage of Scripture. Paul is not saying that we are a bride betrothed to one husband. Paul is saying, \"\"For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I joined you to one Man, so that to Christ I might present you {as} a pure virgin.\" 2Cor. 11:2. \n \n We are the members of the body of Christ (Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14), \"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself {being} the Savior of the body. Eph. 5:23. Betrothal implies a future marriage and our position to Christ as that of a bride. When we take this forward to Revelation 19, and the marriage supper of the Lamb, then many wish to make the Gentile 'body' into the Jewish 'bride.' This is not what the Holy Spirit is teaching. Christ here is called the Lamb, because His identity includes all the members of His Body (that is us) who were baptized into His body. We have been joined to the Head already, and seek no future joining to Him through any marriage ritual. It is through this marriage supper of the Lamb that the two groups ('both' Eph. 2:14) are joined into One. The marriage supper is about Israel being joined to Christ, after the coming Kingdom Dispensation is complete. The members of the body of Christ are joined to Him, even now. \n \n Paul is saying \"joined,\" because our participation in the gospel and our joining to Him is in the past. Saying that we are 'betrothed' infers that our joining to Christ is future. These recommended changes work to restore the continuity of Paul's teaching pertaining to the body of Christ being joined to the Head to form the New Man. The removal of 'betrothed' also removes the implication that we are waiting for some future joining, when that process was performed the moment we heard (Romans 10:17) and believed (Eph. 1:13+14) the message of truth, and were baptized into His body (1Cor. 12:13+14) to become a member. 1Cor. 12:27 (Romans 12:4+5, Eph. 5:30, etc.).\n \n Maximus << The fulfillment of Israel's matrimony to Christ as the bride is in the Church's matrimony to Christ as the bride--with Jew and Gentile as members with no distinction between them. The Church is the Body of Christ and it is the Bride of Christ\n \n Terral's reply << This is the common interpretation from the denominations who have mixed Kingdom doctrine (for the bride) with Grace Doctrine (for the body) to create a form of false doctrine. When Paul, Titus and the other members of the body of Christ met with Peter, John and James (Acts 15, Gal. 2), the Holy Spirit brought together the members of the bride (Peter's group) and the body (Paul's group). This 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) is about the gathering together of the members of the body of Christ. The 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14) is about the gathering of the members of the 'bride of Christ.' Let's look at the differences:\n \n The bride of Christ is the subject of Prophecy. Scripture says, \"I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion, and I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD.\" Hosea 2:19+20. Remember that the seventh day began with the forming of Adam and the Garden. \"Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven. Gen. 2:3+4. \n \n The verses before this were about Elohim (God) and His work, while the verses that follow are about YHVH Elohim (that is, Jehovah God, i.e., Jesus Christ) and His priestly work on this seventh day. It is for this reason that Christ said, \"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\" Matt. 12:8. Jesus Christ is the Lord God of the Old Testament. As it is written, \"Behold, I [Jesus Christ] am going to send My [Jesus Christ] messenger [John the Baptist/Elijah], and he will clear the way before Me [Jesus Christ]. And the Lord [Jesus Christ], whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming,\" says the LORD of hosts.\" Malachi 3:1.\n \n All of the above being true, Jesus Christ is the \"Lord\" of Hosea 2:19+20 who came to betroth Israel to Himself. John the Baptist is the 'messenger' sent to prepare His way. John the Baptist testified, saying, \"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.\" John 3:29. Note carefully that Peter, John and James were called the \"attendants of the bridegroom.\" \"And Jesus said to them, 'While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.'\" Mark 2:19+20.\n \n Again, everything pertaining to Israel as the bride of Christ was seen by the OT prophets, and is definitely a part of PROPHECY. Many professing Christians believe that Christ came for everyone from the beginning, but that is not true. At the start, John the Baptist, Christ and the Twelve came ONLY for Israel of the flesh. Then, after they accepted the Messiah and the Kingdom of heaven, then all the Gentiles were to be blessed through His life. What did Christ tell Peter and the Twelve to preach? \"These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: \"DO NOT go in {the} way of {the} Gentiles, and DO NOT enter {any} city of the Samaritans [half-Jews]; but rather go to the LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL. And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Matt. 10:5-7. Note that Christ's instruction to the Twelve mirrors His own preaching in Matthew 4:17 (23), and John the Baptist's preaching in Matthew 3:1-6. Again, to be certain, \"But He answered and said, \"I was sent ONLY to the LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL.\" Matt. 15:24.\n \n Today, we all know that Israel of the flesh rejected Christ as the Messiah/King and that they demanded He be crucified. As it is written, \"Pilate *said to them, \"Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?\" They all *said, \"Crucify Him!\" Matt. 27:22. God the Father offered the Kingdom to Israel through John the Baptist (\"sent from God\" John 1:6, \"He who sent me\" John 1:33). Jesus Christ offered the Kingdom of heaven to Israel as the Son (Matt. 4:17 (23)). \n \n Note that the very first question from the Twelve to the risen Christ was about the Kingdom. Acts 1:6. Holy Spirit offered the Kingdom to Israel in Acts. Starting in Acts 2:1-4. Scripture uses the example of the stoning of Steven to mark the beginning of the end of the offering of the Kingdom to Israel of the flesh. Acts 6:8 - 7:57. Only then do we see the first mention of Saul/Paul. Acts 7:58. While Paul would finally give up on Israel in Acts 28:28, he would continue to offer the kingdom to Israel throughout Acts. HOWEVER, it is between Paul's conversion (Acts 9) and the end of Acts that Christ would reveal 'our gospel' to Paul. \n \n Paul's gospel is absolutely NOT part of prophecy in any way, shape or form. Paul writes, \"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to MY GOSPEL and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY which has been KEPT SECRET for long ages past, but NOW is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, {leading} to obedience of faith.\" Rom. 16:25+26. \n \n The fact that the Lord was to have His bride is part of Prophecy. The fact that the Lord would have a Gentile Body is the subject of the Mystery. Satan saw everything relating to prophecy, and he did everything to stop Israel from accepting her Messiah/King/Husband. That is why the devil entered into Judas in the first place (Luke 22:3). However, Satan had no idea at all that God would offer us the good news of Christ's death, burial and resurrection in the form of what Paul called \"my gospel\" (Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.). And this right here is the aspect of our gospel for today that many professing Christians cannot see. The gospel of the Four Gospels is the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), etc.) that was rejected by Israel. 'Christ crucified' is a totally separate good news message, that is independent of the gospel of the kingdom, with its own set of precepts. Water baptism is part of the gospel of the kingdom, and has nothing to do with Paul's gospel. 1Cor. 1:17. Those who have it wrong have included precepts of the gospel of the kingdom into Paul's gospel. Thus, they have added works to a gospel that is based upon faith apart from works (Rom. 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9). They have defiled the simplicity of the cross, and are perishing. 2Cor. 4:3+4.\n \n Today, God is gathering together the members of the 'body of Christ' through this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2). That is the subject of James' words in Acts 15 during this meeting between the leaders of the bride (Peter, John and James) and body of Christ (Paul). James says, \"Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people [Gentile Body] for His name.\" Acts 15:14. Then James quotes OT Scripture (Caps are OT Text) saying, \"AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT, SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,' SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO.\" Acts 15:16-18.\n \n This current period in Bible history marks the time that God is building the body of Christ. Then, \"AFTER THESE THINGS\" God will continue to build the members of the 'bride of Christ' through the coming Kingdom Dispensation, which will start again with the appearance of Elijah (\"is to come\" Matt. 11:14, \"Elijah is coming,\" Matt. 17:11, \"prophet\" Acts 3:22+23). Paul's letters represent God's personal mail to members of the body of Christ living through this 2000 year period. The remaining Kingdom letters represent the personal mail to the members of the bride of Christ living through the coming 1000 year Kingdom Dispensation. To rightly dividing the word of truth, we must recognize the difference. \n \n We have thousands of denominations of Christianity in the world today, because so many have taken the marching orders of God to both groups and have mixed them all together to create their own form of false doctrine. The mother of apostasy for this period is the Roman Catholic Church. Remember what Paul writes to we who are called 'Gentiles,' saying, \"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize {this,} he is not recognized.\" 1Cor. 14:37+38. And also, \"For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, on the day when, according to MY GOSPEL, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.\" Rom. 2:14-16.\n \n The body of Christ is being fashioned according to Paul's gospel, which is according to the revelation of the mystery. Rom. 16:25. Are you ready for your secrets to be judged according to Paul's gospel? Or the gospel of the kingdom? I can assure all of you who hold the 'one gospel' view do not know the difference, and are perishing. 2Cor. 4:3+4, 2Pet. 3:14-16. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n Maximus << I think its pretty evident if you read the whole Chapter. But let me point it out . . . Who cannot see the direct comparison between a husband and wife with Christ and the Church?\n \n Terral's reply << Let me see if I understand you . . . Even though the scholars do not translate any Greek word into 'bride' in any of the Pauline Epistles, you want us to believe that Paul teaches that we are the \"bride of Christ.\" That is really quite amazing. As you quoted, Paul teaches, \"because we are members of His body.\" Eph. 5:30. Israel is the bride of Christ (Hosea 2:19+20, Mark 2:18-20, John 3:29, etc.). They are joined to Christ through marriage at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Rev. 19:5-10. We are 'joined' to Christ already, and already members of His body. Yes, there are similarities to our being joined to the Head, just as the wife is joined to her husband. Paul makes use of the similarities in his commands to husbands and wives here in Ephesians Chapter 5. That does not mean that our being joined to Christ is still future (like Israel's in Rev. 19). We have been raised up with Him and seated 'in' Him in the heavenly. Eph. 2:4-7 (6). Our joining to Him is past, while their marriage to him is future. The 'church' of Ephesians 5 is Gentile dominant (current Grace Dispensation), while the bride of Christ is Jew dominant (future Kingdom Dispensation). \n \n Maximus << You say that Paul is saying, \"For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I joined you to one Man, so that to Christ I might present you {as} a pure virgin.\" 2Cor. 11:2.\"\n \n In Christian teaching the joining of one man with a pure virgin is called marriage. The comparison is obvious.\n \n Terral's reply << The body of Christ has been joined to Christ through the power of the gospel and not through any marriage ceremony. We have been joined to Christ as a pure virgin body, and not as a bride. Paul writes, \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were SEALED IN HIM with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14. However, Israel shall make herself ready through the coming Kingdom Dispensation for the marriage supper of the Lamb. As it is written, \n \n Rev 19:7 \"Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready. It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright {and} clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. Then he *said to me, \"Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'\" And he *said to me, \"These are true words of God.\" Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he *said to me, \"Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.\" Rev. 19:7-10.\n \n Ahhh, the spirit of prophecy. The 'gospel of the kingdom' is indeed according to Prophecy. Isa. 40:3, Mal. 3:1, etc.. Christ is here called the Lamb (Rev. 19), because that includes all the members of the body of Christ, who are already present within Him. We became members of the body of the Lamb, by being established in Him through Paul's gospel, which is according to the revelation of the mystery (Rom. 16:25). Our one baptism (Eph. 4:5) was performed by the Holy Spirit (1Cor. 12:13) the moment we believed, and our life is hidden with Christ in God already. Col. 3:1-4 (3). \n \n Are you joined to Christ already, by being baptized into His body according to Paul's gospel, or are you waiting for the events of Revelation 19:5-10 to be joined to the Lamb? It appears to me that you are indeed waiting for some future event to be joined to Christ through a marriage ritual. After all, if you were already a member of His body, then there is no way you could possibly be teaching our participation in a future marriage to Him. You are waiting for things promised to Israel of the flesh, while those obedient to Paul's gospel are 'in Him' already. Then, when they finally attain to their marriage ritual, your time to accept Paul's gospel will be past. The power of the deluding influence (2Thes. 2:10) is certainly very powerful indeed. \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",
