As a straight man, the only disagreement I have with gay men is where I like to put my penis. And that's not even exactly true.

What are you talking about?\n\n \n The more statistics of gay marriage you have, the better you will be able to judge gay marriage.\n \n \nNo, I am talking not about like, but about lust.\n\n \n Well, gays and lesbians lust after the masculine and feminine, as I believe you indicated straight people also lust after.\n \n \nBut if a gay likes my body and lusts after it, I'd be so repulsed.\n\n \n You are proving my points more with each post. Why do you have such a strong reaction a gay's personal feelings? How are the feelings themselves a perceived threat to you, if they are not a part of you, and if gay men don't have a role to play in your heterosexual life?\n \n \nGuess.\n \n After you say your guess, I will tell you.\n\n \n How a gay man's attraction impacts you? I can't think of a reason it would, or how it would, unless it is your own internalized homophobia, as I believe I explained.",

   "\n But see, to answer your question, and JakeCB's questions, I say, that if a child in a gay couple is not gay (yet see, Jake was talking about a SECURE IDENTITY, but children DO NOT have a secure identity) then he'd RATHER be raised in in a NOT GAY family. You see the point? The NOT GAY child needs a mother and a father, not a father and a father or a mother and a mother, because this won't give him a GOOD model for his NOT GAY identity.\n\n \n What are you blathering about? Just what exactly is GAY or NOT GAY identity? \n \n My son is absolutley THRIVING with a straight mom and a gay \"dad\". \n \n My son's father walked when he was three. He now has a male mentor and has had one for years. This man is extremely dedicated and committed (plans to help him buy fix car, saving for college, etc.) and is also gay.\n \n Let this parent tell you what a kid REALLY needs.\n \n Love. Respect. Discipline. Guidance. Hugs. Compliments. Your time. Good male and female role models. They DO NOT need anyone to guide them in their identities. They come with those, I assure you. They have mind-boggling personalities from day one - that just get richer and richer as they grow. One of the things that they figure out on their own one day is what turns them on. My son has already decided he likes dark-haired girls who can run fast and aren't to silly and giggly. All by himself he decided that.\n \n Kids need to learn how to be good people. To learn about respect, generousity, love, responsibility, hard work, kindness, courage, determination, patience, committment, etc. \n \n The last thing they need is to learn how to fit into some small minded stereotype of whatever being straight or gay means.\n \n I wouldn't trade his loser straight dad for his current gay mentor for a million bucks. Neither would he.\n \n It's funny. Every time I tell this story, the anti-gay crowd just sticks their fingers in their ears.

   "Greetings:\n \n Lady << Why straight men are afraid of gays\n \n Terral's reply << Perhaps you should include the word \"some\" before 'straight\" above. \n \n Lady << I was thinking why straight men hate the idea of gay men existing in our society. \n \n Terral's reply << Ditto. Our diverse society contains some normal folks on their way to gaydom or gay-doom. Those currently straight individuals do not hate the idea of homo's existing anywhere. \n \n Lady << Maybe its because they are insecure of their mascuility. \n \n Terral's reply << Maybe the answer is more simple than you imagine. Personally, I believe that anyone placing tags upon themselves to describe their deviant sexual behavior has a screw loose. For most normal men, the mental image of one man sodomizing another is just abnormal sick behavior. Even the most vile wild beasts of the world have better sense. \n \n Lady << It takes a real man to be touch with their feminity self. A straight man should feel good when a gay man checks him out. It means you are good-looking enough. \n \n Terral's reply << Good looking enough for what? \"My God man! You look good enough to sodomize!\" The natural function of sexual activity is for the bearing of children; for the perpetual replacement of our citizens upon this planet. It is through marriage and this physical/emotional/spiritual union that the two \"become one flesh.\" Genesis 2:24. It should be quite obvious to even the most casual observer that Homos perform their indecent acts for much different purposes indeed. \n \n Lady << Why would a gay man bother with a straight man that looks like a little boy with dirt under his nails and holes in the underwear just like grandpa. \n \n Terral's reply << What motivates a pervert to do anything? The 'in your face' attitude of our growing homo population will play out in many ways. They stalk potential victims along our coastlines in their thongs, annoying fishermen and beachgoers, under the pretense of being out to get some rays. But those who take notice can see the greedy perverted desire within them. Many are predators who victimize the young unfortunate ones among us, who seek some kind of financial security, or some quick fix answer to a seeming futile situation. \n \n Lady << Gay men have money and power now a days. They deserve to marry and adop children. \n \n Terral's reply << I would not know. Practically every person I knew from my youth who turned homo is now dead from aids. Anyone who would turn any child over to be raised by homos does not have the best interests of the child in mind. Every natural person on this planet came into existence through the joining of a father and a mother. Each and every one of them deserves the opportunity to be raised by normal folks. That simple truth should go without saying.\n \n Lady << There is no damage to children if raised by two men. As least they can teach them love and caring instead of bigotry.\n \n Terral's reply << Well then, your Creator is a bigot. Romans 1:20-32. Every word you have written here is based upon a distorted view of reality. All normal people are not the same, and all homo people are not either. There is a spectrum of individuals contained within both groups. In most cases, any child is way ahead being raised by their natural parents. No two homos ever brought a single life into this world by natural processes associated by the joining of their dna. They have no rights over the children of others, unless someone else hands over their very souls to the perverts. \n \n BTW, these depraved individuals have not been out of the closet long enough for you to absolutely confirm that 'no damage' is done to normal children raised by homos. Since God says that they are all \"worthy of death\" (Romans 1:32), then you also believe that raising children outside of a normal Christian home is also quite acceptable. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

He may start hating you for depriving him, you just don't know what may happen later.\n\n \n Depriving him of what? He has a home, support, discipline, and people who love him. Just what am I depriving my son? And what do you know about him or us at all?\n \n Let me tell you about a little five year old boy who cried because he had no dad. Let me tell you about how he was angry about it. Let me tell you how it took more than two years on a waiting list to find a mentor. (Do you mentor or parent? - or do you just rant about how gays shouldn't?)\n \n And let me tell you how much more happy and secure he is now.\n \n Get off your holy cloud, for you know NOTHING - YOU are in NO PLACE  to tell ME about MY SON. \n \n \nThat does not mean anything.\n\n \n Maybe being loving, committed and responsible doesn't matter in YOUR morality, but it most certainly does in mine.\n \n \nNo, not parent, but the child, if he knows. See, sometimes he does not have a choice, and so what he knows and likes is based only on his single-sided experience.\n\n \n What are you talking about, Ask my kid what he needs and he will tell you McDonalds French Fries, video games and Yu-Gi-Oh cards.\n \n If it weren't for the adults knowing and providing what kids need they would die off quick.\n \n \nWhere do you get the female role model if the couple is gay?!\n\n \n Women are all over the place.. Do you think children never leave the house? There teachers, friends, - even gay people have moms and sisters.\n \n \nAnd so the don't need anyone to PERVERT them in their identities.?!\n\n \n Huh. Doing volunteer work, yard work, learning to fish, learning to fix cars, going swimming, shooting archery, going to movies, going bowling, going camping, going biking, getting loved. DANG! I think a lot more kids could use this kind of perversion.\n \n \nThere is a force of gravitation. It's not a stereotype, it's a law of nature. There are other laws that you can't label stereotypes. Male and female roles and identities is not some old school junk. You are just so wrong it this.\n\n \n As a single mother. Let me tell you that you are wrong. I can fish (including baiting my own hook) and fix the breaks on my car as well as I can cook and do a load of laundry. I don't live by your force of gravitation. Biology makes me a woman - not activity.\n \n \nSick logic. There are also losser sucker gays. Or are gays perfect people in fact? Haha -- no way. It's just closing your eyes to the fact that gays can as well be loosers and jerks.\n\n \n Of course gays can be schmucks. I even know some who are. They are just like the rest of us. Some good and some bad.\n \n And why is my logic sick?\n \n My son's father walked (doesn't even call - we don't know where he is), pays no child-support, is a drunk, is extremely abusive, and tried to strangle me (in front of his 3 year old son) the last time I did see him. And you actually think that there is something flawed in my logic because I would rather my son have a loving guide rather than this abusive one? I prefer my sickness to yours.\n \n \nReally? Don't you cover your eyes with your hands? Not want to see the reality? Stick to your perverted lifestyle and protect it, moreover, promote it?\n\n \n It's only perverted to the very narrow minded. \n \n I know for a fact - like I know the sky is overhead - that this man in our life is a miracle. You know nothing about us. You can live the fantasy that my son will hate me and his mentor some day, but that's your little fantasy.\n \n As a matter of fact he has already had to deal with some cruel and small-minded people in regards to his mentor (and himself as my son is Latino). He does not understand it. He does not understand it anymore than he understands people using words like nigger or spic.\n \n I don't teach my son to hate.",

But those who take notice can see the greedy perverted desire within them.\n\n \n Perhaps you see homosexuality within yourself. How are they victimizing you? Is this because they look so tempting to you in their swimwear? I'm gay, and I don't know where these beaches with the gay men you give such a vivid description of, are.\n \n \nMany are predators who victimize the young unfortunate ones among us, who seek some kind of financial security, or some quick fix answer to a seeming futile situation.\n\n \n And some heterosexuals get married to millionaires on reality t.v. programs. \n \n \nI would not know.

That simple truth should go without saying.\n\n \n Why do you assume that gay parents don't have the best interests of the child in mind? Not every heterosexual can provide a loving home. The fact that one was reproduced by a male and a female, does not mean that one will have a good home with that male and female, just because they had sex. \n \n \nBTW, these depraved individuals have not been out of the closet long enough for you to absolutely confirm that 'no damage' is done to normal children raised by homos. Since God says that they are all \"worthy of death\" (Romans 1:32), then you also believe that raising children outside of a normal Christian home is also quite acceptable.\n\n \n Here's a tip, not everyone is a Christian. The Biblical God killed a lot of people, obviously. The Great Flood, the first born of every Egyptian, etc., etc.. Perhaps if Jesus had been completely taken away from his father, Jesus would not have been killed while nailed to two boards, when his father wanted to show his great love. But then, the Christian God only had a son so he could kill that son. And wow, he didn't even have that son in the traditional way by male and female sex, but by using a surogate in a virgin birth! \n \n \nGod bless,\n \n Terral\n\n \n Unless you are gay of course. It's easy to see the damage you could do to a gay son. Being told that this important part of his human sexual identity, he didn't consiously choose, means he is only worthy of death. Being brainwashed to believe your hate, and to internalize that.",

Many of the professional associations listed in the Resources section at the end of this factsheet are able to provide helpful information and local contacts to assist school administrators, health and mental health professionals, educators, teachers, and parents in dealing with school controversies in their communities\n \n\n Bullhockey  \n \n \n The American Psychiatric Association Coup\n \n Homosexuals commonly point to the fact that the 'medical community' and, more specifically, psychiatrists agree with them that homosexuality is a \"normal human sexual response.\"\n \n It is certainly true that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its list of \"mental disorders\" twenty years ago, in 1973. This is a fact that almost always comes up in debates with sodomites.\n \n What the homosexuals do not mention, of course, is that this sudden change in attitude was not based on any new scientific evidence. As described in the following paragraphs, it was a purely political move, induced by a relentless saturation campaign of deception, intimidation, and unethical collusion between the APA committee and activist sodomite groups.\n \n Preparing the Ground:\n \n In 1968, representatives of activist homosexual groups approached leading psychiatrists and the officers of psychiatric organizations and began to lay the groundwork for the reclassification of their perversions as normal manifestations of human sexuality. \n \n These activists correctly recognized that such a move was absolutely mandatory if they were to win public acceptance. After all, society in general would not look very kindly upon the subsequent lobbying done by a group whose members were officially recognized as \"mentally disordered.\" \n \n In the three years during which the APA's Homosexuality Task Force was deliberating, it collaborated actively with several sodomite groups, including the Gay Activist's Alliance, the Mattachine Society, and the Daughters of Bilitis, while completely ignoring organizations with views that contrasted with the homosexuals. \n \n Abram Kardiner, former Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University, revealed that \"A powerful lobby of \"gay\" organizations has brought pressure on the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the category of aberrancy. This is only one facet of the tidal wave of egalitarianism and divisiveness that is sweeping the country....\"\n \n During this unethical collusion, Kinsey colleague Paul Gebhard said that anyone who was known to harbor the view that homosexuality was a disorder was systematically excluded from being a member of the Task Force or from even being able to present his views or evidence to it.\n \n In other words, the sodomites packed this committee in the same manner that pro-abortionist and fetal tissue harvesters do: Only those people with the \"correct\" viewpoint were allowed to voice an opinion.\n \n But the homosexuals did not focus on the APA alone; they intimidated psychiatrists all over the nation. While the APA Task Force ws preparing its report, any psychiatrist or psychoanalyst who dared present documentation that homosexuality was a psychological disorder (anywhere in the country) was shouted down and even physically attacked at public forums or at local and national meetings of mental health professionals.\n \n The APA Caves In:\n \n The years of hard work put in by the sodomites began to pay off in 1972. The \"National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality Final Report\" parroted Alfred Kinsey's proclamation that \"exclusive heterosexuality\" and exclusive homosexuality\" were \"sexual extremes,\" and that most people were basically bisexual.\n \n This report in turn exerted a great deal of influence on the APA. In order to make its final report appear to be scientific, the APA's Homosexuality Task Force sent a letter to all APA member psychiatritst. This letter did not ask whether or not homosexuality should or should not be declared \"normal.\" It was signed by all candidates for the upcoming elections for the APA presidency and urged all members to \"vote\" that homosexuality was thereafter declared to be on a level with normal sexuality.\n \n This view was so voted by a very slim margin. The letter did not, of course, reveal the fact that it was written and funded by the National Gay Task Force. One of the letter's signers, in fact, later confessed that he knew that such knowledge would have been the \"kiss of death\" for a pro homosexual vote. \n \n Subsequently, the APA eliminated homosexuality as a mental disorder from the 1973 edition of its \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.\"\n \n APA member Dr. Henry W. Reicken cut to the heart of the APA's motivation as he wrote a scathing dissent in the appendix to the above mentioned NIMH report entitled \"Detailed Reservations Regarding the Task Force Recommendations on Social Policy:\" \"It is as if they 'the Task Force' said, \"Here is a phenomenon about which we know almost nothing and about which there is a great deal of anxiety and concern; therefore, let us suggest a major revision in public policy for dealing with this phenomenon.\" I cannot escape the belief that this is an utterly unreasonable conclusion to draw from the sea of ignorance and misinformation in which we find ourselves.\"\n \n The Essential Point:\n \n The essential point to be made about this chicanery is that the sudden complete reversal in the APA position on homosexuality was not brought about as a result of a careful regime of scholarly research and study; it was a blatantly political move, a 'vote', of all things, on the status of a mental illness. Furthermore, this vote was undertaken in a climate of deception and intimidation.\n \n At no time before or since has the APA or any other psychological or psychiatric professional group 'ever' addressed a mental health question in this manner.\n \n Behind the Scenes:\n \n It is fascinating indeed to see what psychiatrists 'really' think about homosexuality when they are free of the restraints of intimidation and political pressure.\n \n Almost simultaneously with the 1972 National Institute of Mental Health report, the New York County District Branch of the APA's Task Force on Homosexuality produced a second report. According to APA member Charles Socarides, M.D., the document concluded that \"....exclusive homosexuality was a disorder of psychosexual development, and simultaneously asked for civil rights for those suffering from the disorder.\" \n \n It is even more revealing to examine the results of polls of psychiatrists taken since 1973 regarding the issue of homosexual orientation. \n \n The original \"voting\" letter distributed by the APA Homosexuality Task Force in 1973 was answered by only about one-quarter of the recipients, leading one to speculate that the \"volunteer bias\" ignored by Kinsey in his original studies led to pro-homosexual results. It is quite certain that, if 'all' of the APA members had returned their \"ballots,\" homosexuality would have remained a mental disorder in the view of the organization.\n \n A later series of private surveys which could be answered confidentially and without fear of retaliation showed that two-thirds of APA members psychiatrists regarded homosexuality as abnormal despite the parent organization's switch\n \n More specifically, in 1977, four years after the APA 'switch,' the journal \"Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality\" revealed that it had polled 2,500 psychiatrists on their view of what \"current thinking on homosexuality\" was, and, by a lopsided margin of 69% to 18% (nearly four to one, with 13%undecided). the respondents answered that \"Homosexuality was usually a pathological adaptation as opposed to a normal variation.\"\n \n This is certainly a more accurate poll than the original APA letter because the letter was subject to all of the \"volunteer bias\" that self selected populations exhibit. However, by comparison, the 1977 survey was truly random, and so its results should certainly be given more weight. \n \n \n \n courtesy of: EWTN.com",

   "I have a few questions that I can't seem to get around.\n \n Most people are not gay. This is an undeniable fact. It also is an undeniable fact that it is impossible for two primates of the same sex to produce offspring. It would be logical to conclude that homosexuality is not conducive to reproduction in primates. For example, if all currently living orangutans were homosexual, the species would be extinct in a generation. I have yet to see any explanation as to the benefits of homosexual behavior in primates. (Assuming that all behavior in animals is based upon leading them to their ultimate goal, survival as a species.)\n \n That said, if Darwin is correct then homosexuality would not be a \"naturally selected\" gene. However, the complex social groups found in higher primates may make use of bisexuality as a way to form social bonds between members of the same sex, thus improving the groups chances of survival.\n \n Most major religions have something to say about every aspect of life, including sexuality. In fact, it would seem that sex is so important to many of them, they have very strict rules concerning the participation (or lack of participation) in it. Generally, most religions are simply a mirror of the individual morals and values held by their practitioners. People who disagree with a particular religion simply don't practice it. The whole point of this is that God favors whatever His subjects do, depending entirely on what book they swear by. So, the opinion of God has no bearing on this discussion.\n \n What part does genetics play? I have heard that human homosexuality is a genetic trait. It follows that people who have this gene cannot help but be sexually attracted to their own sex. I also believe that it is entirely possible for people without a genetic predisposition to homosexuality to choose it as a lifestyle. This is probably (in my opinion) due to the inherent need for humans to be part of a social group. While most of us would not choose to have sexual relations with those of the same gender, people will do anything to be part of a group. Catholic priests give up sex altogether to be a part of the clergy, so it stands to reason that a social outcast might choose a lifestyle that is historically very tolerant of individuality. Most of the homosexuals I have been acquainted with were outcasts in school. (Which is a very social environment.) \n \n So, arguing that homosexuality should be accepted behavior on the basis that it is an unavoidable genetic trait has a fatal flaw. It can also be proved that some people are genetically predisposed to criminal behavior. By the same logic, criminal behavior should be excused because they simply \"can't help it\". How do sex offenders play into this? Well, who is to say that a rapist or pedophile can help his or her tendencies any more than a pair of \"consenting adults\".\n \n Basically, gayness will be prevalent as long as society continues to tolerate it. When did we as a society make a distinction between what is \"good\" sexual deviance and \"bad\" sexual deviance? The answer is not so simple. That distinction is of a dynamic nature, and changes to fit social trends. There were a lot less openly gay people in the earlier part of the century, because we were less tolerant of it. In fact, I believe (again, my opinion) that there were less gays back then because those who would choose gayness as a lifestyle (even if they were not genetically predisposed) would be less inclined to do so because of the lack of tolerance.\n \n In conclusion, if you find homosexuality repugnant, then you have a right to be vocal about it. (You do not have a right to harm anyone or infringe their right to do whatever they want in the privacy of their own home, however.) The less tolerant society is of homosexuality, the less prevalent it will become. Those who can't help themselves will always be gay. Those who choose the lifestyle will be pressure socially into rethinking the decisions they have made.",

If there was a situation where women were the only ones attracted to women, and men were the only ones attracted to men, that would be incredible. We haven't seen where all women are attracted only to men, and all men are attracted only to women, despite our deliberate efforts to create such a society.\n Very true. That's why the study of small groups of non human primates is so interesting. I disagree that deliberate attempts are being made to create a strictly heterosexual society, however. On the contrary, I believe (in America at least) there have been deliberate efforts made by special interest groups to promote homosexuality, and they are succeeding largely due to apathy on the part of mainstream society.\n \n Yes, perhaps everyone should be bi-sexual then. However, this doesn't explain the fact that homosexuality exists.\n \n I never denied the existence of homosexuality. I do question it's purpose in the evolution of primates, particularly humans. If it is indeed a genetic trait (and as common as we are led to believe), then there must be some evolutionary purpose for it. I don't believe a single genetic trait constitutes a \"culture\" however. For instance, many of the openly gay people where I live have a different \"dialect\" or way of speaking. This is a learned behavior. No person is born \"flamboyant\", gay or otherwise. Still, the gay culture is historically very flamboyant. It is this culture that I believe attracts people who may not necessarily be genetically homosexual, but are culturally gay and have same sex partners anyway. Perhaps I chose my words poorly. I am not in the least bit offended by genetic homosexuality. I am very offended by the idea that it should be accepted as a \"culture\". \n \n \n But were they outcasted because of their being gay?\n \n This is too much like a chicken before the egg thing, so I'm not going near it. If \"gay\" were not a catch-all explanation for teenage awkwardness, perhaps people would come out if adolescence without wondering who they were supposed to be attracted to.\n \n The issue of consent, harm, and interfering with the freedom of others, are why we don't accept rapists, criminals, pedophiles, and blah, blah, blah. We don't accept these behaviors simply because someone may be predisposed somehow by genetics or even by social environment.\n \n Then genetic predisposition cannot be an argument for going against mainstream society.\n \n You claim it was less prevalent, but also claim that people were less open about it? So how do you know? Maybe that \"old maid spinster\", or that \"eternal confirmed bachelor\", were gay. Perhaps people were pressured into loveless marriages. They were hypocritical and had secret affairs. Is that a good thing?\n \n Well, the divorce rate is certainly up. People are having more secret affairs now. More children are being born to single mothers. Perhaps social pressure to remain in a monogamous heterosexual marriage ain't so bad. You might be right, the very fact that people were quiet about their homosexuality may have made it appear to be less prevalent than it really was. Is that a bad thing? People who are gay are not going to stop being gay because they don't have a \"culture\". What I question is how a sexual orientation qualifies as a culture. You don't see straight pride parades. That's like having a parade celebrating the fact that you have ten fingers and ten toes. So does almost everyone else, so it's not novel enough to warrant celebration. If the world had been 50% straight 25% gay and 25% lesbian and open about it for centuries, I doubt it would be cause for a parade. It would be a commonplace understanding as mundane as being born with the right number of digits. Also, if this were so, there might actually be enough people with the gene to warrant a \"subculture\" within a given culture, but I doubt each culture across the globe would have it's own gay subculture. \n \n Be careful assigning the term \"bigot\" to people. Everyone has their own definition that can differ greatly when a dictionary isn't nearby. I for instance, don't care if there are more gay men than straight ones. That leaves more potential partners for heterosexuals. What I don't like, and am vocal about, is the idea that homosexuality should be explored by confused people. If anything, it should be left for those who know they're gay. If you need to experiment to know, then you are definitely confused.\n \n I do think that if '\"gay culture\" was less prevalent, then people who were not genetically predisposed might not choose it as a lifestyle and as a direct result less people would decide to be \"gay\". This would leave us with less \"social gays\" and the genuine homosexuals would not be affected. How could it be bad to weed out the fakes, so to speak? Would you promote an alternate sexual lifestyle for those who might only be choosing it because of social pressure rather than genetic predisposition? If it is wrong to stifle homosexuality, then it is just as wrong to accept confused heterosexuals into a gay culture.\n \n And if those who didn't choose to be gay are hurt by that, they are just collatoral damage? If there are those who chose it, why do they have be treated badly? Perhaps that's the only thing that will possibly keep them away from their true gay identity? If that's the only thing, they were never straight in the first place.\n \n How are gays damaged? Are you implying that gay people will suffer if those among them who are not truly homosexual suddenly \"switched sides\" en masse? I am not suggesting treating anyone badly. I only suggest that the social acceptance of homosexuality as something more than a sexual preference is directly responsible for potentially heterosexual people choosing it as a lifestyle. The more people that join a particular social group, the more people will want[ to join it. I think there should be a distinction between genetic homosexuality and gay culture. They both exist, but all gays are not necessarily homosexual. For that matter, all homosexuals are not necessarily gay in the cultural sense. Some dress normally, speak normally, carry themselves normally, and make no attempt at in-your-face social rebellion. (For the purpose of this discussion, \"normal\" shall mean that standard by which the majority of society behaves.)\n For those gays who choose to create a false culture by speaking, dressing, talking, and acting different (than normal), I think it would be much easier to just conform, and buy a rainbow for your car's bumper. If you want people to know you're gay, tell them. No need to create a whole new way to interact on every level just because you have different bedroom habits. That's pretty selfish when the rest of us do our best to fit in.",

   "As usual, I see your numbers are a bit off. Reparative therapy is not only BS. It is very dangerous. As for it's success rate? read below\n \n From the available data, four studies reported a \"success\" rate during conversion therapy of 0.4%, 0.0%, 0.0 and 0.04%. That is, conversion therapy has a failure rate in excess of 99.5% during each study. Considering the anecdotal data which indicates a large percentage of extremely depressed and suicidal clients emerging from conversion therapy, it would appear that this form of therapy is worthless.

   "I disagree LadyOreo. We are harming our children's well-being by allowing gay marriages.\n \n Teenagers will also suffer from the effects of homosexuality. When you are a teenager, you want to try everything out. \n\n \n Really? Everything? \n Ok, this only leads me to believe that somewhere down the line of growing up you actually tried everything and were disappointed in it's results.\n \n \n\n You are not very sure of yourself or what is good for you, and you long to be accepted by your peers. When you are not accepted, you start to wonder if something is wrong with you. You begin to explore different things in order to find an answer. Many young men have been led down to the path of homosexuality during this crisis time. The homosexual lifestyle leads to high rates of suicide, depression, HIV, drug abuse, STDs, and other pathogens.\n\n \n Pathogens? Hate to remind you that not all drug use causes death. Not all sexual relations cause death. Many STDs are easily treatable, not to mention are not the sole property of sexual encounters.\n Depression is not a pathogen. Treatment is painful but can be sucessful. \n \n \n Gay marriage may cause children to think, \"I have another alternative if I get rejected from my girlfriend.\" Instead of training our children to resolve conflict and face their problems, we mess up their minds more by saying, \"we accept you and your wrong behavior as being ok.\" Instead of trying to give a child an alternative to solve a problem, we as parents and teachers should be teaching our children problem solving skills. How do you expect our children to be able to work with people if we don't teach them problem-solving skills?\n\n Good question. I would suppose that somehow you may have been taught problem solving skills that tells you to simply hate everything you don't understand. \n \n Oh, sure, there will always be those in the GLBT population which are \"testing the waters\" out of having been rejected by a partner down the line. But in the exact same light there are those Homosexuals who are still living as a heterosexual because they got the silly notion that if they behaved like a heterosexual they will somehow become one. \n The problem here is that just because you behave like one doesn't make it true. \n I could listen to rap, get braids in my hair, wear black face paint, and only date people of African descent. But that doesn't make me African-American.\n It makes me a very confused person and sadly in need of care. \n You see, there are those individuals on BOTH sides of the sexuality fence. Until all people stop judging, start accepting people for who they are, stop instilling fear and misinformation (which in some is indeed equated to hate) into their children. We ALL will continue to damage them. \n \n What you adimately refuse to see is that you just might be wrong. You post supposed information which you cannot and will not back up. You refuse to list your sources. \n Sorry to say, that only makes your credibility questionable at best.",

Their masculinity and femininity matter far too much, as does everyone elses.\n\n \n \n I feel sorry for any offspring you might have. \n Just because a man has femine traits does NOT make them gay. Just because a woman is strong doesn't mean she is a lesbian. \n Just because a man doesn't swing his hips or talk with a lisp, does NOT mean they are straight. \n Just because a woman wears dresses and actually enjoys puting on make-up does NOT make her straight. \n \n You're antiquated ideals on what equals feminity or masculinity are outdated at best. \n \n What would you say to Bill Clinton?

   "Well, I agree that they can raise a child, and that raising by a straight couple does not guarantee bringing up a normal child.\n \n But see, to answer your question, and JakeCB's questions, I say, that if a child in a gay couple is not gay (yet see, Jake was talking about a SECURE IDENTITY, but children DO NOT have a secure identity) then he'd RATHER be raised in in a NOT GAY family. You see the point? The NOT GAY child needs a mother and a father, not a father and a father or a mother and a mother, because this won't give him a GOOD model for his NOT GAY identity.\n\n \n Funny, because most gays were raised by STRAIGHT FAMILIES! \n \n \n \nAs for statistics, see, because you don't have many gay marriages, you don't have much statistics on gay divorce. So if gay marriages ever become many (which I hope will not happen) you will see the true stats.\n\n \n Please, divorce is already the leading cause of fatherless children. No good louses who don't take up their responcibility are the second. \n \n \n \nTo JakeCB:\n \n No, when I say that I hate the thought of a gay liking me (for my body and my masculinity) I am not proving a point, that gays are a threat to my masculinity. Absolutely not. You abuse this argument, it's not based on anything. See, there are two definitions. MASCULINITY and FEMININITY. For straight people masculine in men is liked by women, feminine in women is liked my men. So the prove of my masculinity is not that EVERYONE (both men and women) like me. For gays and lesbians yes, it is a prove, but well, for a zoofile, maybe the fact that a dog likes him, it's good.\n \n\n \n Typical, there you go again using confussion tactics to somehow win your argument. ANIMALS & HUMANS...not really the same thing. Agh...\n \n \n \n To me it's sick, that's it. Yes, I can say I like Brad Pitt. He's got a well built body. Am I a gay because I think so? Do I threaten him (even if he knew me)? I don't think so. So you use false arguments, sir. Just because you want to prove you point, you twist the reality and twist definitions. I don't respect that.\n\n \n Again you confuse issues. Brad Pitt is straight, he is also a well known celebrity. The mere idea that you would even get close enough to him to threaten him is beyond rediculous. \n I get hit on by straight men. Do I lash out? Do I get offended? No. I simply smile and say \"Sorry, not interested. Nothing personal, I'm sure you're a nice person...it's just that I'm not interested.\"\n I certainly don't hate straight men, nor do I secretely look for their approval. Nope, as I said, I'm not interested. They do nothing for me in any, way shape or form. \n I am not indecisive at all. I know what I want. I always have. Even when I was young and confused about social norms and acceptability, I still knew what I wanted. \n Granted, learning to act on what I wanted and what would actually make me a happier person took some learning and growing on my part. \n But it doesn't change the fact that I always knew.",

But then, you are constantly paranoid that gay culture will convert you, I can tell by your previous post on this thread.\n \n This is a common tactic in arguments like this, implying that the other side is a latent homosexual or has a fear of conversion. This makes no sense. How could you convert someone who does not find homosexuality appealing? If your object in this discussion is to make me find men sexually attractive, you are wasting your time. What reactions do you refer to? I told the guy \"Hi\" and went about my business. It wasn't until the nature of the park as a known \"cruising spot\" became known to me that I put two and two together and was able to explain his odd behavior.\n \n I've seen straight people act decadent in parks.\n \n I can honestly say that I haven't seen straight people cruising for anonymous sex during the middle of the day in a public park. Given the fact that most people are straight, and the only people I have encountered doing this are gay, I conclude that a larger percentage of gays do this than straight people.\n \n Straight people cruise too. They cruise all the time and everywhere. What does the straight community propose to do about it?\n \n This is evasive. You offer no solution or explanation for the apparent higher percentage of gay cruisers. Speaking as a straight man (who's opinion of gays you presumably wish to improve), I can tell you that I perceive it as a problem that is more specific to your demographic. Some have laws against certain sex acts which are rarely enforced (except when people are caught in the act in public). Gays like to call this discrimination, when in fact it is a valid solution used for the prosecution of people engaging in public sex regardless of their sexuality.\n \n Decadent is not necessarily a bad thing. Ever heard of Mardi Gras, where women bear their breasts for some cheap tacky beads?\n \n Do you approve of this practice? If not, then why use it as an excuse for the decadence within the gay community. Obviously you don't find women's breasts attractive, so how would you classify their bearing them publicly as a good thing?\n \n There was nothing that made your situation out of the oridnary other than perhaps you've never been the object other men around you desired. Step into a woman's shoes for a week and you'll come to understand that your shocking experience, is no different than any experience someone has when they are pursued sexually by a male.

Log in to a popular chat room with a female name and bio for some therapy on just how aggresive for sex with a stranger that your brothers can be.\n \n \n I don't agree that being the object of sexual desire by the opposite sex equates to what happened to me. When I go out with my friends socially, and get the impression that a woman is attracted to me, I find the experience pleasant. I don't relish the idea of attracting men.\n Allow me to explain the difference. Many gay men adopt feminine mannerisms even to the point of dressing in drag. This makes little sense when you are attempting to attract someone who doesn't find women attractive, unless you are vainly trying to fool a straight man into sleeping with you.\n How a room full of men who are dressed like women but are attracted to men ever wind up together is baffling. \n Anyway, the only other possibility is that gay men really are attracted to women, and that explains why they are attracted to effeminate men. So, if a gay finds me attractive, there is a possibility that he finds me effeminate, a condition I wish to avoid. I'm not trying to attract men, gay or otherwise, so feminine traits will not serve my best interests. If I happen to have some, finding out by inadvertently attracting a man would be unpleasant to say the least.",

   "Maybe the other guy was just looking at you. So what?\n \n Perhaps. But given the circumstances I'd be willing to bet I'm right about his mindset.\n\n \n Why does his mindset bother you?\n \n \nThis is a common tactic in arguments like this, implying that the other side is a latent homosexual or has a fear of conversion. This makes no sense. How could you convert someone who does not find homosexuality appealing?\n\n \n You said in a previous post that some people who are not really gay, find the culture attractive, and go though with gay relationships anyway, for that reason.\n \n [QUOTE=rightcustoms]If your object in this discussion is to make me find men sexually attractive, you are wasting your time. What reactions do you refer to? I told the guy \"Hi\" and went about my business. It wasn't until the nature of the park as a known \"cruising spot\" became known to me that I put two and two together and was able to explain his odd behavior.\n \n \nI can honestly say that I haven't seen straight people cruising for anonymous sex during the middle of the day in a public park. Given the fact that most people are straight, and the only people I have encountered doing this are gay, I conclude that a larger percentage of gays do this than straight people.\n\n \n I've seen straights act out and cruise in public parks, on a beach, on the sidewalk, in a hallway, and everywhere else.\n \n \nThis is evasive. You offer no solution or explanation for the apparent higher percentage of gay cruisers.\n\n \n An apparently higher percentage of gay cruisers, because of the blinders you wear. Cruising is just so accepted in the larger straight world it is not recognized the same way or labelled the same way. Why do I need to offer a solution? I don't see a problem.\n \n \nSpeaking as a straight man (who's opinion of gays you presumably wish to improve),\n\n \n You are not interested in learning about gay people. You are interested in being patronizing and condescending, in moralizing, and in making generalizations and in promoting stereotypes.\n \n \nDo you approve of this practice? If not, then why use it as an excuse for the decadence within the gay community. Obviously you don't find women's breasts attractive, so how would you classify their bearing them publicly as a good thing?\n\n \n It's neither a good nor a bad thing. Because you heard of a gay event called \"Decadence\", any gay person is required to offer some kind of excuse? No. \n \n \nI don't agree that being the object of sexual desire by the opposite sex equates to what happened to me. When I go out with my friends socially, and get the impression that a woman is attracted to me, I find the experience pleasant. I don't relish the idea of attracting men.\n Allow me to explain the difference. Many gay men adopt feminine mannerisms even to the point of dressing in drag. This makes little sense when you are attempting to attract someone who doesn't find women attractive, unless you are vainly trying to fool a straight man into sleeping with you.\n\n \n They don't necessarily do it for the purposes of attracting other gay men. Straight men cross dress as well.\n \n \n How a room full of men who are dressed like women but are attracted to men ever wind up together is baffling.\n\n \n Why do you care? One can tell most drag queens are male. It's not a room full who are all in drag.\n \n \nAnyway, the only other possibility is that gay men really are attracted to women, and that explains why they are attracted to effeminate men.\n\n \n Again, one can tell that most drag queens are male. Many do it to be kitchy or campy, to show off maximum fashion sense, or to be like their favourite star diva. Some are very talented performers on a stage. There are many reasons. We are certainly not talking about the majority of gay men who do drag.\n \n \nSo, if a gay finds me attractive, there is a possibility that he finds me effeminate, a condition I wish to avoid. I'm not trying to attract men, gay or otherwise, so feminine traits will not serve my best interests. If I happen to have some, finding out by inadvertently attracting a man would be unpleasant to say the least.\n\n \n Finding out that you may have more feminine traits is unpleasant? Watch it, you may be revealing a misogynistic side of yourself. Do you think there aren't many straight women who wouldn't welcome some more feminine traits, such as sensitivity? Why do you think many straight women like to hang around gay men? Actually, there are many butch gay men. They even have their own clubs and groups within the gay community.",

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think you misunderstood the meaning of his post, or else I did.\n \n\n \n My post? #1 post was that fear of gay is primarily the negative social stigma. In reality, if your father turned out to be gay, would he be any different other than what he does behind closed doors? No. Same ole dad. So what's the fear? It's social stigma mostly, some is probably power/masculenaty. Not that it's your fault for feeling that way necessarily, but you can rationally overcome your primitive instincts.\n \n Regarding post #2\n Point being your feelings are always validated, you're right, no one can really tell you what you should feel. However, you're taking a very negative stance towards gay men, when reasonably, I think most of us see it as misplaced diapproval.\n Men make women fell the way you describe on a daily basis. Women make men uncomfortable too, and women make other women uncomfortable. \n \n We have sexual discrimination laws now in the workplace, you know why? Yes, inappropriate straight male behavior towards women, in a very inappropriate place (work) (the most likely cause, although it can happen with any combination male/female). What you're not OK with is being \"hit on\", by another man. Well, you can't control what another man might feel towards you, but you can have issues with the way he displayed them in public in a graphic way. It could be a case of public lewdness (such a thing?), and you might have legal grounds there. But I think it's dangerous and unfair for you to direct the anger only at gay men.\n \n I have been hit on by various women before, and you know what generally determined my reaction? If they were hot, I was flattered. If they were very unattractive, I was embarassed or disugsted. (initial reaction, rationally I was flattered either way). If it was in public, it just increased the positive or negative reaction. So what happened to you, in my context, is that you were simply hit on, in a public way, by someone you weren't attracted to, and it was gross and embarassing. We ALL probably feel that way, it's uncomfortable!! But it's not GAY men, it's possible for both males and females, straight or gay (or both) to create this reaction.\n \n Seriously, if it had been a drop dead gorgeous woman who drove by slowly in a convertable, licking her lips and winking at you, you'd be visiting that park every chance you could get ;) Kidding of course on the last part, but you know what I mean.\n \n -Mach",

   "Here's one of my favorites so far... Followed by... In the same post, no less! Which is it? Sex or something else?\n\n \n I probably shouldn't have pointed to that, but I did say sometimes. It will mean many different things to many different people who do this. It is not connected to sexual orientation identity, however. Most crossdressers are straight, and of course, most men in the general population are straight.\n \n \nMany of these cases have involved inappropriate behavior of gay men as well. For that matter, not all women feel that sexual advances in the workplace are a bad thing. Harassment is in the eye of the beholder. If a woman has the right to choose whether an advance by a man is harassment or welcome flirting, so does a man, does he not?\n\n \n If you tell a guy you are straight, he will back off. You were talking about a \"look\", you were given, you only later determined may have been involving sexual attraction on the other guy's mind, when you found out the park was frequented by guys. Most gay men won't flirt with just any guy, in areas known to be generally \"straight\". \n \n \nJust because women deal with unwanted advances, it makes it ok for men to have to deal with it? That's like saying it's ok for you to rob a convenience store because you saw some guy in the news that did it. If it's not ok, then it's not ok. The point is, you can never know who might react adversely to an advance, so keep them to yourself. That's what the sexual harassment laws are all about.\n\n \n It depends on the type of advance, and if the woman makes it clear that it isn't welcome, like any other situation.\n \n \nWhat does he find weird about over the top drag queens? Does the fact that he is gay excuse him from being insensitive to their habits? If a gay guy can find it weird, why can't a straight one?\n\n \n Indeed, some gay men find it \"weird\", and are even more hostile than some straight men. This just shows that it isn't connected to sexual orientation identity, whether you are gay or straight. I don't excuse those gay men if they are being insensitive or hostile. \n \n \nNot at all.

In fact, at first glance, she might look like an intolerant, uneducated, chauvanistic redneck. \n I thought homosexuals didn't like that kind of person, so why emulate one?\n\n \n They could dress like that for comfort. Many straight women go to the men's clothing section, or buy formless, neutral or masculine looking pants, shirts, or jackets. What's wrong with a woman driving a truck? Many straight women in those rural areas do look like that. I don't see what the problem is if some lesbians have short hair, and are not up to date on the latest fashion trends. We know they are not men. Some wish to reject the \"Barbie Doll\" look perhaps, meant to please straight men. There are also highly feminine \"lipstick\" lesbians.",
