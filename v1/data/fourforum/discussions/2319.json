   "Hello again everyone:\n \n I have been missing from the board for awhile. I hope to post more regularly but you never know. I say this as a precursor as you may not be able to debate me directly. I will give as much info as possible.\n \n Two things:\n \n 1) There is evidence to SUGGEST that God exists.\n \n 2) There is no PROOF.\n \n The evidence to suggest is in the lives of those who truly believe. Who's lives have been changed by God. I would say I am one of those. There is also evidence that is more circumstantial that many apologists would be familiar with. I am not an apologist but I will offer a few that I know of. Perhaps others better informed could offer more.\n \n The bible provides some evidence. It was written by the hands of many over a very long period of time with a remarkably consistent theme. That is that faith in God provides for an eternal life with him, and a lack of faith results in an eternal death apart from him.\n \n The earliest christians (those that likely knew Jesus or those that knew the apostles) died horrible and amazing deaths. If this were a known hoax (the ressurrection in particular) then they would have likely recanted, all of them. Yet several Romans write of the remarkable tenacity of the followers of Jesus. Pliny in particular.\n \n Again, this is evidence only to suggest not prove. I cannot prove nor can anyone else. However, to say that there is no evidence even to suggest it is way beyond the realm of logic.\n \n Thanks for hearing my 2 cents.",

I did respond to the question, mostly.\n \n Your argument that a central theme over time can be followed is very innaccurate. People are people and by nature will glorify themselves or attempt to. If there were not an intervening God then the books of the bible would go in all variety of directions. In particular the Gospels but the bible as a whole, do not show God's people from \"their best side\" as it were. \n \n The people of God we see are flawed and demanding and condescending and crude, and even downright mean. However, the bible also shows a great deal of dependence on God for their righteousness. \n \n You are quite correct that there is precious little PHYSICAL evidence to prove the reality of God. I do think there is evidence to suggest it. Suggestion is just that, suggestion. It does not require a preponderance of the evidence at all. \n \n Belief truly is belief and not evidence based. You are correct there as well. I do think there is plenty of reason to believe in God. Where things often go awry is whether or not there is reason to believe, specifically, in one of the many gods discussed in the many religions. They are very different although many will argue for the commanalities, the differences are still quite significant. Christianity, for instance, is the only religion that declares a person justified and sanctified, and glorified purely as gifts of God. All others demand some kind of performance from the individual to acquire \"enlightenment\", \"heaven\" or other alternate realities. \n \n As I said I do not think I was responding specifically to you but an overall response as I have been away from the board for a while and was having to insert again slowly and generally.\n \n Thanks for the discussion though.",

What you describe is sufficient 'proof' for you to believe. Why? Because you believe. Other than the Bible (which is far from being an accurate historical textbook) from where do you obtain the evidence of these prophets and their prophecies? \n \n I am not discussing the God/Person of Jesus specifically. I am not discussing whether or not Jesus is the Son of God, who rose from the dead in atonement for our sins and the sins of the whole world. (Which, incidentally, I believe.) I am discussing the God of the Hebrews (or any other god for that matter). To believe the prophesies of which you speak, one must have faith. To believe that Jesus actually rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, one must have faith. There is no physical evidence that I am aware of to indicate that it did happen the way the Bible said it happened... except for in writings of human beings allegedly inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that those human beings were inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that what they describe actually happened the way they describe it.\n \n What I can say with certainty that cannot be disputed as far as I'm aware, is that whatever happened... happened.

   " I like to call him \"God.\" \n Why does it have to be male? Or god?\n \n \n \n I don't believe you have to be Christian to get into heaven. I don't care what others say. I refuse to believe that a rabbi is going to hell. That's just... stupid. \n\n Stupid or not, that's what the Bible says. It would seem that these days, people just pick and choose what they want to believe from the Bible. I understand that the Bible is able to be interpreted different ways, but people-- come on! It seems that people only believe what suits them instead of taking the whole thing as a package deal.\n \n \n \n Yes. I find it's quite more calming to believe in something, though. You have less a chance of going insane.\n\n Er, I don't quite understand this. Me and my voices here have been wondering what this means, but we haven't reached a conlcusion. Could you help us? ;)",

   "Why does it have to be male? Or god?\n\n \n God has no gender. *shrug* If there's an infinite being of superior intelligence, that's pretty much my definition of \"God.\" Call him what you like.\n \n \nStupid or not, that's what the Bible says. It would seem that these days, people just pick and choose what they want to believe from the Bible. I understand that the Bible is able to be interpreted different ways, but people-- come on! It seems that people only believe what suits them instead of taking the whole thing as a package deal.\n\n \n The Bible says:\n \n \nFrom the Gospel According to John\n 14:6 Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.\"\n\n \n Jesus died to save all people. He didn't pick and choose His followers. He loves us all, and some people just don't know any better.\n \n I'll also point out that in the first century, the entire Bible was rewritten to emphasize Ultimate Paternity. Who knows what else they changed? Quite frankly, I wouldn't put it past them.\n \n \nEr, I don't quite understand this. Me and my voices here have been wondering what this means, but we haven't reached a conlcusion. Could you help us? ;)\n\n \n Sorry, that's my braincell's fault. It hasn't been in the mood for constructing coherent sentences lately.\n \n If you don't believe in something, then you believe in nothing. Which means that you trust nothing. Which means you don't trust yourself. If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust? No one. So you can't believe anything anyone says. Including what you say. So what you say isn't true. And then if you try to take back what you said that was wrong, you must be lying. Because you can't trust yourself.\n \n Just typing that made me feel dizzy. *wanders off to find ice pack*",
