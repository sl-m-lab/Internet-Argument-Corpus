   "How about this 'liberal' bastard who supported the one of the bloodiest terrorist gangs in modern times.\n This is why you and some other ' lefties' make me sick to the stomach with your hypocrisy.\n \n \n \n \n \n IRA sympathiser Ted Kennedy was no friend of Britain - Telegraph Blogs\n \n For years Kennedy was the bang-drummer-in-chief for brainless Irish-American IRA sympathisers, dimwits who shouted \"troops out of Dublin!\" and sang maudlin songs from the comfort of Boston and New York, giving money for strangers 3,000 miles away to murder their neighbours.\n \n For despite the pseudo-Marxist justifications the IRA used, which was obviously lapped up by useful XXXXXX on both sides of the Irish Sea and across the Atlantic, their goal was always ethnic cleansing against their neighbours, the people who Americans still call \"the Scots-Irish\". \n \n Kennedy himself said that Ulster Protestants \"should be given a decent opportunity to go back to Britain\", without in any way suggesting he would give Boston back to the Indians (or the English-Americans, for that matter) and return to Co. Wexford. He compared Britain's presence in Ulster with America's in Vietnam, and later forced Jimmy Carter to ban arm sales to the RUC, blackening the name of that tirelessly heroic band of men, each one of them worth a thousand spoiled Ivy League playboys.\n \n Kennedy spoke out against violence in Northern Ireland while cosying up to IRA terrorists, the cause of the violence, ensuring Gerry Adams could visit the States in 1996 and celebrate that great festival of plastic patriotism and falseness, the American St Patrick's Day Festival. He only later distanced himself from Sinn Fein/IRA after their goons murdered Robert McCartney and the American public woke up to the reality of \"the boys\".\n \n It's bad manners to speak ill of the dead, before his family have got the chance to bury their loved one, but it cannot go forgotten. I'm sure Kennedy was essentially a good man and a servant of his own country, but he was certainly no friend of ours.\n\n \n You're one to talk about hypocrisy.
