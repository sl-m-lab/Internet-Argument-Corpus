   "At what point do church groups stop being about god and start being all just politics? At some point do they not break the rules for being non-profits when it comes to lobbying efforts?\n \n \n \n 25,000 Churchgoers Sign On To Mass. Anti-Gay Amendment\n by Margo Williams 365Gay.com Boston Bureau \n \n Posted: October 3, 2005 1:00 pm ET \n (Boston, Massachusetts) Organizers of a ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage and civil unions in Massachusetts said that a one-day blitz on churches has put it almost half way to collecting enough signatures for the measure to be placed before voters.\n \n Petitions supporting the constitutional amendment were circulated Sunday at all Catholic Churches and at evangelical and other Protestant churches throughout the state. \n \n The amendment has the backing of the state's four Roman Catholic bishops and other conservative religious leaders. \n \n On Monday, Vote On Marriage - the umbrella group behind the amendment - said that it had collected 25,000 signatures. It needs 65,825 signatures by Thanksgiving for the measure to be considered.\n \n The names then would need to be verified by the Secretary of State. The proposed amendment would then go to the legislature where it requires the support of 50 members. The earliest it could go to voters would be in 2008.\n \n Some people who signed by petitions on Sunday said they felt pressured. One woman who did not want to be identified said that others at her church who tried not to sign were harassed by church elders who were circulating the forms. \"I didn't want to be singled out,\" she told 365Gay.com. \"I just signed it and hoped that would be the end of it.\"\n \n LGBT marriage rights group MassEquality was also out in force at a number of churches Sunday, conducting what it called a \"truth squad\". Standing on public sidewalks in front of churches members of the group tried to dissuade people from signing the petitions.\n \n \"We completely respect people's right to worship,\" said Marc Solomon, the group's political director. \"However, we are very concerned that the church hierarchy has made taking away marriage equality -- and replacing it with nothing else -- such a high priority.\"\n \n Former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, one of the petition's chief sponsors, said church officials have an obligation to \"speak out on important issues in the civic arena.\"\n \n \"The marriage petition is not against gays but for children,\" he said. \"We believe that a loving family with a mother and a father is the best environment for children to be brought up in.\"\n \n Last week Vote On Marriage hired a California consulting companied used by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to help it win the amendment. (story)\n \n Arno Political Consultants, of Sacramento was used by Schwarzenegger most recently to help sell his legislative reform package which goes to voters in a special election this November. \n \n The company has been involved in a number of conservative ballot measures nationwide including the anti-gay marriage amendment in Ohio. That measure passed by a wide margin last year. It has also worked for the Republican National Committee to register GOP voters in Florida.\n \n Earlier this month the Massachusetts legislature turned down its own proposed amendment that would have banned bay marriage but allow civil unions. (story) Many of those voting against the measure opposed the civil unions provision and said they would support the Vote On Marriage version.\n \n Even if Vote On Marriage gets its initiative on the ballot there are growing indications it will be rejected by voters.\n \n A new University of Massachusetts-Lowell poll suggests that 56 percent of registered voters oppose the initiative and that 40 percent support it. Among Catholics who have been flooded with church material supporting the amendment the poll shows they are almost equally divided on gay marriage.",

We aren't robots in this world. I myself (along with everyone else) am hardwired to eat, but that doesn't mean I don't have the ability to know when and when not to eat.

And there's nothing wrong with that. If you choose to be insulted everytime someone in life disagree with something you do, you are going to have a very long hard life. People need to learn to dialog and talk without being insulted about such things. I could just as easily say I am \"insulted\" when you take issue with MY behavior of pointing these things out.

You do not hear any messages from evangelicals who state that violence against gays and lesbians is wrong. You don't hear from any evangelicals that it is bad to harass gays and lesbians. You don't hear from any evangelicals that it is okay for gays and lesbians to work or have some sort of basic protections. As a matter of fact, those same people who say that they are against gay marriage because they want to protect \"the children\" turn around and defeat any sort of basic protections, like housing and employment protections for gay and lesbians. \n \n \n If you don't understand the difference between Phelps and the rest of evangelicals, do some research. Start with the fact that Phelps has protested the Southern Baptist Convention.\n \n Night & day: The difference between Southern Baptists & Fred Phelps\n\n \n \n Well, why don't you go out with some of your evangelical friends and have a press conference stating that Phelps, Robertson and all the others don't speak for you all. And when you're done with that, why don't you go and tell the president that he needs to stop listening to them, and listen to people more like you.",

   "What I find hard to believe is that someone, in the year 2005 almost 2006, can still be so afraid of gays and their lifestyle. Most progressive people who have \"actually peeked behind the curtain\" have come to learn that gays are just like anybody else for the most part and are, for the most part, totally harmless to society. These progressive people have no problem, whatsoever, in letting the gays take their rightful place in society with all due rights and privileges afforded to any other, tax paying, law abiding, adult citizen.\n \n In my opinion, regarding the regressives, it's simply a matter of lack of understanding and education and the reluctance to be taught. It's a matter of sticking one's fingers in one's ears and screaming \"LALALALALALALALALA\" I DON'T HEAR YOU!! LALALALALALA\"\n \n As society is evolving and becoming more educated and tolerant towards those of an alternate lifestyle, the people opposed to this acceptance are slowly but surely dwindling away. (Twenty years ago, \"XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy\" would have never been accepted.) The Regressives who adamantly fear this change in society are going to great lengths to anchor their belief and moral system into a constitutional vault to disable our society from evolving further or even considering the issue. Even if their actions are nothing less than facist. I think their take on it is \"Desperate times require desperate measures and if that means facism, then so be it.\"\n \n The only thing is, the gay issues before us all as a society do NOT equate to \"desperate times.\" We have people blowing themselves up, starving, hurricanes and yet some folks focus on gays marrying? What does that say about them? The only people who have problems with gays are the people who LET themselves have problems with gays.\n \n Myself, I'm a breeder. I emoticon_love my women. Well, I'd best say I love my wife emoticon_xlove (she might be reading this :p ) But loving her is MY choice. I will NOT let any government, person, facist, liberal, extremist, tell me who I can or cannot love. I imagine the gays feel very much the same. And they should.\n \n It is arrogant for the Regressives to try to lay claim to love and all the civil laws regarding it. Nobody owns marriage. To deny a couple of any sex that are of legal age and consenting minds any benefits (or penalties) marriage would entitle them is not only regressive but un-American. If the regressives had their way they would make law, \"We are free enough. Liberty stops here. 2005. No more liberties allowed. Deal with it\" Further, their hiding behind \"Love the sinner hate the sin\" excuse doesn't fool anyone. The \"Marriage Protectors\" don't fool us either. These people are homophobic. Pure and simple. The rhetoric and spin doesn't fool anyone. To those who say \"I have nothing against gays, I just don't think they have the right to marry.\" I say, \"So what? Who cares what you think? You do not OWN the country. emoticon_rolleyes If you want to sit on the back 40 listening to scratchy Elvis records, that's your right but don't drag the rest of society down with you. Some of us prefer something a little newer. The 1900's were great but let's see what we can do in the 2000's. Some of us want to progress. We have barely scratched the surface of freedom and liberty in this country. \n \n Some folks seemed to have forgotten that the US is supposed to be the land of the free. Pioneers of liberty. A nation born from rebellion of the status quo. It was once shouted in the streets, \"Don't tread on me!\" Leave the gays alone. Quit treading on them. They are harmless.

   "I suppose being the pup I know you are, it may be hard for you to see the difference between children and adults, but they do exist.\n \n Provide me some compelling evidence that 15 year olds are able to handle the legal responsibilities of adulthood (like a marriage contract) and I will be all for it. It will mean my kid will have to start supporting himself three years sooner than planned!\n \n Your rude comments aside, If I find compelling evidence that gay couples don't make good families would this mean you would rather disallow it? Who are you to say that all 17yr olds can't marry and can't consent but someone of 18 is able? Seems like you wish to make a standard and impose it on others. Yet when I do the same it is tyranny. Interesting contradiction you have.\n \n \n\n Not when soley dependent upon my body functions. \n \n\n So now the standard is dependency. Stop changing the rules. Bodily autonomy seems irrelevant when killing another human in your mind. I feel bad for conjoined twins in your world. Nevertheless, why stop with just body dependency? Why we can't we take it further? At 1minute old you are dependent on someone. Since they are, you should have the right to end their life correct..or maybe even just remove them from your care, say put them in a dumpster? Good luck buddy!\n \n \n\n \n \n Gays marriage will not impact your rights, freedoms or hurt you in way way. You can even hate gays if it tickles your fancy. They aren't demanding you be gay or that you even like gays. You can continue your \"I'm a macho straight guy and think XXXXXX are gross\" lifestyle if you like. They aren't demanding YOU do anything. They aren't imposing ANYTHING on you. That is what YOU are doing.\n \n Plus I would like to point out that we were talking about gay sex and sex in general. Whether or not your pervy butt should be able to vote on the sex lives of consenting adults.\n\n How dare you say what will and won't impact my rights or freedoms or how I feel!! You are trying to make a choice for me!!! Stop trying to impose your beliefs on me!! Please, it is a two sided coin.\n \n \nThis is ridiculous. You're picking at every little thing you can. Your argument is fallacious and childish.\n The point is that we won't live the way you want us to because we are our own people. I have bodily autonomy; I as an adult can enter into a relationship with ANOTHER CONSENTING ADULT and you have no say in this matter. Nor should your bible. Your political views here are reaching dangerously close to fascism.\n\n So because my views are different from yours my views are fascism and yours are right. Tell me something, do you believe a person should be allowed to marry a cow? If not, then why? It surely is his body and his life. Why do you wish to impose your beliefs on other people?\n \n Inconsistenancy is tearing you all up :)",

   "Why should your answer depend upon whether I will change my position on the issue? Either your answer is good enough to challenge my position or it is not. \n \n I am rather disappointed in you. I thought you were better than this.\n I ask not because I want your approve but because I want to see what your standard is. You don't believe others should be able to impact anothers life that might or does hurt them or effect them in anyway. My point is that all laws do this. So the question becomes is this really your standard. If so, then if I find a reason why what you want will effect my life then by your standard you have to be against it. Make sense now?\n \n \nI've answered this before. If the genders are equal under the law, then restricting marriage based on gender is unconstitutional. We restrict many things based on age due to lack of informed consent. Rather than base age restrictions on each individual's maturity level, governments have chosen to set an arbitrary age limit (some places say 16 or younger, others say 18). Now, one could argue that setting an arbitrary age limit is wrong, or that the limit should be younger or older, but that will not change my point, which is that the issue of age limit deals with informed consent.\n We restrict things based on gender as well. Now the purpose of age restrictions are that they represent a difference in a 16yr old in a 40yr old. The purpose of gender restrictions are the same, they represent a differene in a male and female. One example would be that there are laws protecting a strip club to not allow a male worker.",

Some establish long-term relationships with varying degrees of success including physical lifespans. Others, like fundamentalist Mormons, are persecuted in the US for polygamy, a federal crime without consideration for freedom of religion. It took American Native tribes decades of legal battles before the feds allowed peyote to be used in their worship rituals. Gays fight an uphill battle in exercising their civil rights, just has any possible deviation from a WASP society dominated by a majority of believers adhering to a written oracle based on mythology. Higher education would help, but our (US) general public is falling behind on that opportunity to expand our strength. IMO the best strategy for gay rights is business as usual while keeping lawyers well supplied with money, the American way. It could take until the point where Christianity is no longer the dominant US belief system, 2030-2040 depending on whose numbers one likes, but, since several states are already preparing legislation for civil union benefit rights equal to those possessing the magic word 'married' couples, I think perseverance for gay rights will be fully rewarded far earlier than that future date. Keep the pressure on and remember that you're in combat with what advertising and TV writers identify as the lowest common demoninator.",

   "From the Wikipedia overview of Mills' On Liberty:\nTyranny of the majority is far worse than tyranny of government simply because it is not limited to political function. Where one can be protected from a tyrant, it is much harder to be protected \"against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling\". As such, people will be subject to what society thinks is suitable - and people will be fashioned as such. The prevailing opinions within society will be the basis of all rules of conduct within society - as such there can be no safeguard in law against the tyranny of the majority. Mill goes on to prove this as a negative: the majority opinion may not be the correct opinion. The only justification for a person's preference for a particular moral belief is that it is that person's preference. On a particular issue people will align themselves either for or against this issue; the side of greatest volume will prevail, but is not essentially correct. As with every rule, there must be an exception:\"That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\" This is the first mention in On Liberty of the so-called harm principle. The only limiting factor of liberty in Mill's view should be harm, although not just any harm, but specifically physical harm. If a person is harmed then his or her sovereignty over self no longer exists because sovereignty is after all the foundational position of power; this is Mill's justification of the harm principle. Children and those who cannot take care of themselves are allowed to be interfered with beyond the harm principle as they may well harm themselves unintentionally; such children and those who cannot take care of themselves do not, and cannot, have sovereignty over self.\nAt this point he divides human liberty when in private into its components or manifestations:\n \n 1. The freedom to think as one wishes, and to feel as one does. This includes the freedom to opinion, and includes the freedom to publish opinions known as the freedom of speech, \n \n 2. The freedom to pursue tastes and pursuits, even if they are deemed \"immoral,\" as long as they do not cause harm, \n \n 3. The \"freedom to unite\" or meet with others, often known as the freedom of assembly. \n \n Without all of these freedoms, one cannot be considered to be truly free.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority",

You wish to force views on this mans life and cause him all this trouble? Double standard.\n \n \n \n \nWould you vote to further that oppression, though, steve? You've been talking about how if you don't like something then just vote on it, and I'll ask you, would you vote to restrict a homosexual's rights to marry the man or woman he/she loves?\n I'm glad you asked for my opinion. For the marriage thing, I believe we have actually gone over my views on that. Check the thread by that WM guy a few back. As for allowing gay couples to adopt, I have no stance at this time. As for homosexual sodomy (or any for that matter), mixed views but would probably vote to make the choice up to a person...this isn't protected by the constitution though.",

   "Ok, so if the law hurts someone else then it shouldn't be a law or you shouldn't force others to go by it? Very well then, what forms of hurt are allowable? Are emotional forms of hurt allowable? Does it have to be actual cuts? If it is just emotional then a law making gay marraige legal might hurt me emotional. Who are you to say it doesn't? This would be a law hurting someone and thus void by your standard here. Maybe it is \"who gets hurt worse\". Once again, who are you to determine this? I simply vote would solve this problem though.\n\n \n No - hurting your feelings is not a good enough reason to create laws. Can you even comprehend trying to manage laws like that?\n \n \nI'm just showing how your view on abortion is not consistent with your views on gay rights. You state that laws shouldn't hurt people but you are for killing someone. How is killing not a form of hurt? You might say \"it hurts the mother worse\"...which is not really your call, but nevertheless I am not sure how \"financial health\"(for example) is worse then someone killing you. Your standard on abortion needs to be consistent inorder for us to take your seriously. My views on gay rights(which none of you know) and abortion are consistent if you wish to find out.\n\n \n There are two parties who are physically and realistically impacted in a pregnancy. That is not the case with gay marriage laws - only gay people are realistically impacted.\n \n \nWhat? Now you are for 17yr old getting married,\n\n \n I think I said. I DON'T CARE.\n \n \nwhat about 5 yr olds? I guess a 10yr old should be allowed to smoke weed and take some cocaine for his bus ride to school.\n\n \n You are now being ridiculous.
