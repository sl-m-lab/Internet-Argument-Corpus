   "Out Military Gays Serve With Distinction In Iraq\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff\n \n \n Posted: September 14, 2004 11:27 am ET \n \n (Santa Barbara, California) A study of gays in the military released Wednesday concludes that gays and lesbians are serving openly in the Middle East without undermining unit cohesion or the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n When gays are out, they report says \"greater success in bonding, morale, professional advancement, levels of commitment & retention and access to essential support services.\"\n \n The study, prepared for the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military at the University of California, Santa Barbara, also found that \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" has a negative effect not just on gays, but on those around them, by creating an atmosphere of dishonesty and distrust as well as disrespect for the law and the principles of integrity that are essential to military service.\n \n The study, by Dr. Nathaniel Frank, is titled \"Gays and Lesbians at War: Military Service in Iraq and Afghanistan Under 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'\"\n \n It says that the official ban on open gays in the military impairs the capacity of gay troops to develop bonds of trust, minimize stress, prepare for deployment, focus on their mission, advance professionally and access support services, including medical & psychological consultations. \n \n The study is based on thirty in-depth interviews with gay, lesbian and bisexual service members who were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since Oct 7, 2001, as well as on field observations made stateside. \n \n Among the stories included in the study is that of Brian Hughes, a gay Army Ranger who was part of the task force that rescued Iraqi War POW Jessica Lynch. \n \n The Ranger regiment is an elite infantry unit of the Army, which is part of the Special Operations Command. \n \n Hughes took time off from Yale University to join the Army in August of 2000, where he became an E5 Sergeant (NCO). In the fall of 2002, he was deployed to Afghanistan where he did search patrols for personnel and weapons. He then cycled into Iraq for the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he participated in the Lynch rescue.\n \n Research for the study was conducted between February and September, 2004.\n \n \n \n Source: www.365gay.com/newscon04/09/091504gayMilitary.htm\n \n \n \n \n So why do we have a ban on gays in the armed services???",

He signed not only the abominable DADTDHDP policy but also DOMA. All the while, shaking hands with Elizabeth Birch of HRC and lieing to her face. \n (DADTDHDP = Actual name of policy which is; Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Harrass, Don't Persue.) It was meant to protect gays in the military but has done just the opposite. More gays and lesbians have been discharged from military service since its adoption than ever before it was in effect. \n (You will need Adobe Acrobat reader to open this file)\n http://www.sldn.org/templates/dont/record.html?section=42&record=1455",
