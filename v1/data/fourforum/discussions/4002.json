The Roman Empire wasn't a religious cult, it was an empire, wasn't it ? It's true that a large number of pagan religious cults had their followers within the Roman Empire - but if it's just the status of Christianity at that time (which you're referring to), then you need to specify the points (if any) that you want to make.\n \n PS. Shouldn't this thread be posted in the Religion forum ?",
