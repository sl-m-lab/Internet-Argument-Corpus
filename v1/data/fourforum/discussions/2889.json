I really don't understand why any views this as a bad thing? Who's the bad guy in Abu Gharib, Lynndie England or the brave soldier who revealed what his cohorts were doing in Iraq? Breaking the law is not the American way, and Mr. Kerry should be lauded for standing up for what is right and American, which to the best of my knowledge is not about torturing inmates and massacring villages.\n \n c..

I voted to cut every law enforcement, CIA and defense bill in my\n career as a US Senator.\n \n\n misleading, subjective and probably false, false, and false respectively. Kerry takes a nuanced position on Iraq, one which befits a complex issue. I don't like the way Kerry is framing his Iraq vote, and I agree it smacks of pandering. That being said though, I hold a similar position to what I think Kerry really thought: I supported the war, and in principle still do, but I think it was handled extremely poorly and arrogantly.\n I don't know what a \"liberal\" piece of legislation is, or how one identifies it as such, but I think you'd have to do a neat bit of gerrymandering to make Kerry vote for ALL of them.\n Kerry has a plan to help the country, you may disagree with it but it is present. In terms of specifics, its more detailed than President Bush's is. And his tax plan is to repeal the tax cuts for people making $200,000 and up and use it for a national health care plan and to reduce the deficit. You may disagree about the goal, or the principle, or whatever, but the vast majority of Americans will not be affected by this tax hike and it does qualify as a \"plan,\" objectively.\n And to the last, I honestly need a cite on this. I've seen the Bush propoganda on this (though they've never flat out said he opposed EVERY bill), and I also know that many of the votes they hit him on (the vaunted body armor issue for one) concerns bills where the object in question was a RIDER, not the objective of the bill itself. And if you think a senator should vote for a multi-billion dollar farm bill because of a 2 million dollar amendment which should be dealt with seperately, you have a severely distorted view of how congress operates.\n \n These types of articles (and I include the liberal manifestations of these as well) both contribute to the degeneration of political discourse and serve to more deeply polarize the electoral climate such that substantive discussion of issues becomes impossible. It truly saddens me to watch such important topics be seriously debated on the grounds of such innane claims as these.",

He's pretty objective, let me tell you. If you can use him as a source, then I can use Michael Moore as a source. Here is the site that shows Kerry's voting record. But, of course, you probably think it's a conspiracy...(http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0204/022704nj1.htm)\n \n \"After winning election to the Senate in 1984, he ranked among the most-liberal senators during three years of his first term, according to National Journal's vote ratings. In those years -- 1986, 1988, and 1990 -- Kerry did not vote with Senate conservatives a single time out of the total of 138 votes used to prepare those ratings.\"\n \n So, he voted with the liberals 138 times. That is about as liberal as you can get.\n \n The scandal seems to be concocted? I am not going to say that it's true or false (because I don't know), but if it is a lie, why doesn't John Kerry release his war records or do something about it? All he has done is send memos to the TV stations that are airing the ad and threatening to sue them if they don't stop playing the ad. I mean if he knows they are lying, why not do something about it? I think he must have something to hide. And the line \"The problem with \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" is that none of them actually served on a boat with Kerry\" means nothing. True, they didn't serve ON HIS BOAT, but they were around him all the time and saw the things he did. Don't you think they have the right to express their accounts of the story? Just because McCain condemns the ad, doesn't mean that it's a lie. Was he in Vietname at the same place and time as Kerry? No, so he has no authority to judge that. They view the \"atrocities\" as a bad thing because he committed them. And then he comes back and condemns them. But he took a Zippo lighter, and burned down an empty village and killed all of the livestock. He apparently shot a Vietnamese person in the back while they were running away. And then he came back and accused all of the US soldiers of committing war crimes, etc. That is pretty bad to accuse someone of that, especially he was doing the same thing.",

   "I'll say flat out I'm not a fan of the \"Bush resume\" version that is floating around the internet, but that doesn't excuse this piece of ****. In addition to the absolute falsehood already pointed out by Mana'ia (about Kerry's J.D.), the rest is misleading.\n \n The \"most liberal senator\" tag is rhetorically a fun thing to throw out, but as Jon Stewart (of all people!) pointed out no one actually knows what this means, or how it was arrived at. Personally, I'm skeptical of any test that puts John Kerry to the left of, say, Paul Wellstone (if he's included), Ted Kennedy, or Barbara Boxer. Seems rather suspect to me (like the \"media bias\" study which claimed that Drudge Report was the most non-partisan site on the web, more on the flaws of that study here.\n The \"scandel\" over Kerry's war record seems, to me, to be concocted. One of the vets who has criticized Kerry recanted, then recanted his recantation. The problem with \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" is that none of them actually served on a boat with Kerry, they just happened to be in Vietnam at the same time as him (the other problem of course is their close association with far right conservative activists). The people who served WITH Kerry on the boat have been virtually unequivicable in their support of him. And principled politicians like John McCain have condemned the ad (tragically, the label \"principled politician\" doesn't apply to W, who, through his spokesman, refused to condemn the ad).\n Then you (or the real author, since apparently you aren't it) start moaning about how Kerry spoke out against atrocities committed in Vietnam. I really don't understand why any views this as a bad thing? Who's the bad guy in Abu Gharib, Lynndie England or the brave soldier who revealed what his cohorts were doing in Iraq? Breaking the law is not the American way, and Mr. Kerry should be lauded for standing up for what is right and American, which to the best of my knowledge is not about torturing inmates and massacring villages.\n \n misleading, subjective and probably false, false, and false respectively. Kerry takes a nuanced position on Iraq, one which befits a complex issue. I don't like the way Kerry is framing his Iraq vote, and I agree it smacks of pandering. That being said though, I hold a similar position to what I think Kerry really thought: I supported the war, and in principle still do, but I think it was handled extremely poorly and arrogantly.\n I don't know what a \"liberal\" piece of legislation is, or how one identifies it as such, but I think you'd have to do a neat bit of gerrymandering to make Kerry vote for ALL of them.\n Kerry has a plan to help the country, you may disagree with it but it is present. In terms of specifics, its more detailed than President Bush's is. And his tax plan is to repeal the tax cuts for people making $200,000 and up and use it for a national health care plan and to reduce the deficit. You may disagree about the goal, or the principle, or whatever, but the vast majority of Americans will not be affected by this tax hike and it does qualify as a \"plan,\" objectively.\n And to the last, I honestly need a cite on this. I've seen the Bush propoganda on this (though they've never flat out said he opposed EVERY bill), and I also know that many of the votes they hit him on (the vaunted body armor issue for one) concerns bills where the object in question was a RIDER, not the objective of the bill itself. And if you think a senator should vote for a multi-billion dollar farm bill because of a 2 million dollar amendment which should be dealt with seperately, you have a severely distorted view of how congress operates.\n \n These types of articles (and I include the liberal manifestations of these as well) both contribute to the degeneration of political discourse and serve to more deeply polarize the electoral climate such that substantive discussion of issues becomes impossible. It truly saddens me to watch such important topics be seriously debated on the grounds of such innane claims as these.\n\n \n HERE! HERE!\n \n I couldn't agree more about the key point you're making here dsadevil.\n \n This kind of deliberate lying and personal attacks (from both sides), rather than focusing on actual issues that will affect American's lives, is IMHO, the single greatest problem with US politics. There is no honour or intelligence left in the process. It's become purely pandering to the lowest common denominator, a year long \"presidential\" episode of Jerry Springer.\n \n Quite frankly, I find this kind of politics sickening. It has no benefits, it only spreads lies and leads to further extremism on either side. Ultimately, the only result is the breakdown of any meaningful advancement of the country through the political process.\n \n I saw it start to creep into Canadian politics for the first time during our last election, but fortunately, enough Canadians felt the same way I do, and the ads were not well received, though I fear they were rather effective with their target audience. \n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. Interesting that someone so righteuos about political lies/distortion and so vehemently opposed to Michael Moore and his \"propaganda\" would be so quick to endorse and spread the exact same type of lies/distortion and propaganda.",

   "Well, I like to think of Jon Stewart as a non-partisan satirist. Maybe I'm not paying enough attention. But the point he makes is still valid, this charge of him being \"the most liberal senator\" is being made with nary a look at the methodology. So I'd be the first to thank you for giving me the link to the National Journal article, as they do explain how they get to their conclusion. That being said, I think the article is flawed and its conclusions misleading for several reasons.\n 1) It strikes me as infinitely regressive. One is tagged a liberal for voting with other liberals. But how do you know those other people are \"liberals\"? Well, the also voted with other \"liberals\"...which could go on and on. At some point one needs to make an arbitrary assessment here. I mean, is it really \"liberal\" to vote for a Lieberman-sponsered bill to pump up homeland security spending? If that's what it means to be liberal, I'm cool with that.\n 2) Internal bias of the site. All due respect to the National Journal (and I have alot for them, they are a fine periodical), they have a conservative slant. That should make us take their formulations with a grain of salt, especially since they are the ones deciding what are \"key votes.\"\n 3) The actual votes are never shown on the site, so we can't come to a judgment on them aside from bland admonishments that they are \"liberal.\" Indeed, the only time the article gets specific, here's what it has to say:\n \"Kerry was especially moderate in his second term when it came to foreign-policy issues. He opposed the liberal position in key Senate showdowns on missile-defense and intelligence spending in 1993, and on procurement of additional F-18 Navy fighters in 1996. Such votes could provide Kerry with some useful talking points for his presidential campaign. Kerry also voted with President Clinton and congressional Republicans, but against many liberals, in favor of welfare reform in 1996, and he occasionally split from organized labor on workplace issues.\"\n In addition to utterly disproving the above assertion that Kerry always voted against military spending, it also shows that he has staked out moderate terrain in the past. Rather than simply asserting \"he's a liberal, that's evil\" go after specific decisions he's made on bills past so we can debate them.\n \n Then you try and defend SBVFT by saying \"well, they were around Kerry.\" What, you think they were taking notes? If they were paying closer attention to the Lt. on another boat serving downriver than they were to defending their crewmates and ship, that I think reflects more poorly on them than it does on he. The people who served WITH Kerry on the boat (whom I'm sure you'd agree have a far better claim as to his military prowess and actions than anyone else does) say he was a hero. That's good enough for me. The stuff about the zippo lighter is hearsay from people whose credibilty is already shot, and shooting VC in the back is called WAR (although that too is hearsay from people with credibilty problems). And of course, you can't get beyond the fact that he saved his crewmates life (Jim Rassuman). That alone is worthy of labeling him a war hero. I bring in McCain because he knows first hand that it is very easy for political parties to dredge up slime politics to discredit people for their actions in combat, the Bushies did it to him first. I think a basic respect for veterans and servicemen asks that we leave that sort of thing outside of our presidential campaign. There are plenty of substatntive issues to oppose Kerry, why the need to resort to ad homs (and this goes to the Mooreniks out there too)?",

And the man who said he shot someone in the back? He's the one who retracted his statement. Of course, he then retracted his retraction.

You decide.\n And of course Kerry did throw his ribbons over the fence. I've always been confused about why that's a bad thing. It was a powerful symbol of his opposition to the war. Ok, he still won the medals.\n \n The point is that people who opposed Kerry tend to believe the SBVFT folks, and those who support Kerry tend to believe Kerry. When all you have is various forms of hearsay and conflicting eyewitness accounts, you don't have much to go on. In abscence of compelling evidence to the contrary, I default to the assumption that the medals weren't given erronously. I haven't been persuaded otherwise.\n \n Of course, NONE of this reflects on Kerry's record or future plans for America.

   "\"simplified\"? \"I don't own an SUV\" is \"simplified\"? Clearly we have different views as to the meaning of the term.\n \n Also, 1) Future plans are more important than past actions. Yes, his past actions are indicative of what he might do in the future, but as long as they aren't in absolute contradiction to his proposals, I'm willing to give him some slack (although I don't see much of a difference between the past and proposed future, see below)\n 2) The article given by Bush is the Man shows that Kerry has voted for military and intelligence spending. I quoted from it above, but here it is again (From the quite Conservative National Journal)\n \n \"Kerry was especially moderate in his second term when it came to foreign-policy issues.

The vote in question was not on \"A Bill to Provide Body Armor to Troops.\" It was on a larger bill that had nothing to do with body armor that happened to have a rider attached to it asking for more funding for body armor. I doubt that Kerry was thinking \"hmm...this omnibus spending bill looks really good, but if it means that our troops are going to die less often, I'm against it.\" Please.\n \n I don't know if Edwards has released a policy-wonk paper since then or not.

The amendment was approved. I'm not a huge fan of this move, but its certainly not a \"liberal\" vote.\n -Kerry votes YEA on the Levin (D-MI) amendment to shift funding away from interceptor missiles (I assume that's an ABM defense program) and to Homeland Security and combatting terrorism. The amendment was rejected, with every Republican joining democrats Nelson (NE), Nelson (FL), Miller (GA) and Bayh (IN) opposing it.

Today's self professed conservatives love to rubber stamp anyone that opposes defense spending or tax cuts as a \"liberal\". Sometimes you have to say \"no\" to a weapon system if it's not performance proven or if it's just plain too expensive. (Remember Star Wars??) As for tax cuts, I appreciate them as much as anyone but if it means handing off the largest deficit in history to the next administration, does it really make sense. Cutting your revenues while increasing your spending is just plain irresponsible. If you want to engage the country in expensive foreign wars, at least be honest with the people and tell them they have to pay for it. The more you hear posters trying to label politicians, the more you wonder if the old definitions have changed.",

   "Wait a minute...because I look to the site that lists EVERY vote cast, I'm being biased? The other sites you give pick and choose votes to fit their arguments...I picked congressmerge because its simply a list of votes cast, sans political agenda.\n \n \nHow is voting to shift money away from the ABM program a pro-defense vote?\n \n I just told you. Its pro-defense because 1) it goes to homeland security and national defense spending, both of which are far more pressing concerns now than ABM defense is (guess what, the russkies ain't coming anymore!), ABM missile defense doesn't work, and even to the extent that it does, it doesn't respond well to threats its supposed to guard against (our ABM silos are in Alaska, the only country with nuclear missiles that can hit the US is North Korea, which will probably launch them from submarines in the pacific which the Alaska silos are poorly positioned to defend against, and even if they DO manage to get past all that, its relatively easy to deploy countermeasures against ABM systems that render them ineffective. this was all in the article i linked to, im sorry that its subscription only). I thought republicans were supposed to be the ones against throwing money at failed/obsolete programs?\n \nA fetus is a person. Kerry said recently that he believes life begins at conception. How can he justify this vote to not punish someone who murders a fetus? Is he flipping again? \n\n once again, I answered this. Sen. Kerry is in favor of punishing someone who murders a fetus, its just a question of methodology. To the extent that Kerry is pro-choice (im sure u disagree with that stance), a preferable way to go about punishing someone is by making the death of a fetus an aggrevating factor in a crime, rather than simply defining the fetus as a seperate person. I honestly don't have a problem with this vote, since the end result is the same. Indeed, I'm a bit annoyed the republicans are playing politics with this, since there was a bipartisan, non-controversial idea on the table to accomplish the same goal as this bill, but the GOP felt compelled to pick an election year fight.\n \nIt must have been a bad deal. Why did Kerry vote for it?\n\n umm...because veteran's healthcare is good, and tax loopholes are bad? This doesn't strike me as particularly controversial.\n \n AGREED! I agree with the principle idea of a balanced budget. However, Kerry's plan will be to increase taxes and spending. My plan would cut the government payroll by about 1/3. We don't need all the featherbedding that's going on right now with the non-working government employees. \n\n That's cool. Obviously, everyone has different views on the balance of tax hike/spend cuts necessary to balance the budget. But it doesn't explain why most Republicans opposed it. Do they suddenly have a distaste for balanced budgets? Or are they afraid it will get in a the way of their tax cutting warpath?\n \nExpected.\n\n Not according to you. Quoting from your original \"resume\" post\n \n* f.. I voted to cut every law enforcement, CIA and defense bill in my\n career as a US Senator. \n\n Facts are stubborn things, aren't they?\n \n Who could argue with that one? Guns don't kill people...people kill people.\n ....\n I agree with the tabling \n\n Apparently 90 US Senators found an argument. And why do you agree with the tabling? I'm fine with a general exception to liability for gun manufacturers, I think it would deter frivilous lawsuits. But if gross negligance is found by the court, why shouldn't there be a legal remedy? That seems like a solid compromise.\n \n There's no need for assault weapons outside of the military. However, I am not a gun control freak. Those who argue that this may set a precedent for banning of other weapons may have a valid point. A semi-automatic 12 gauge shotgun can put out as many pellets in a short time as a fully automatic rifle. What's to keep someone from redefining a shotgun as an assault weapon. (Sawed-off barrels are already a no-no.) \n\n Well, considering some automatic rifles can put out several hundred rounds in the space of a few seconds, that's one hell of a shotgun. The precedent point is semi-reasonable (though you reject it earlier RE: The Laci and Conner Law). However, if congress was to rewrite the law to define a shotgun as an automatic weapon, you'd have my opposition. The difference between that and Laci and Conner's law is that seeks to create a legislative history for treating a fetus as a person for COURT interpretation, rather than to set the stage for future legislative action. Since the courts tend to avoid gun control issues (They haven't taken a major 2nd amendment case since US v. Miller in 1939), this issue will still stay in the hands of the legislature, who I'd imagine wouldn't be keen on making shotguns assualt weapons.\n \n So let's review. I just gave a full accounting of Senator Kerry's last 16 votes in congress. Of those, 4 of them either didn't show the contents or I couldn't undertstand them, so we ignore those. Of the remaining 12, you appeared to support Kerry's stance on 6 or 7 (depending on whether you actually would support the Assualt Weapons ban renewal or not) of the votes. That isn't a great ratio, but its not terrible either.\n \n This also gives me a great oppurtunity to show the problem with those sites that say \"Kerry voted against our troops\" or other innane things like that. Let's say that you were a member of congress, and you just voted on those amendments/bills the way u registered your support. I could put together a website that (accurately) could claim:\n -Jim's Trucking OPPOSED greater funding for homeland security and national security (Levin amendment #1)\n -OPPOSED increasing funding for veteran's healthcare (Nelson amendment)\n -voted to SHIELD gun manufacturers from lawsuits even if they were found to be GROSSLY NEGLIGENT (Levin amendment #2)\n Are these charges accurate? Yes, they are, technically. Are they fair? Not really. After all, you did also vote to increase national security spending in the Warner amendment. and your opposition to the first Levin amendment was based on the fact that it shunted funding from ABM missile defense, not because you hate the troops. But as you can see, its VERY easy to distort these sorts of things into something they're not.\n \n Now, just for fun, let's run through some more votes, since your skeptical that these are a fair sample. I'm just going to keep going in reverse chronological order.\n -The first two are motions regarding Drug re-importation bills. I could venture guesses as to the meaning of each, but I'm afraid I'll be way off, so I won't. Kerry votes against both the motions and they both pass.\n -Votes YEA on Lieberman (d-ct)amendment \"To provide for a program of scientific research on abrupt climate change, to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by establishing a market-driven system of greenhouse gas tradeable allowances, to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and reduce dependence upon foreign oil, and ensure benefits to consumers from the trading in such allowances.\" Sounds good to me. Research on this issue is important (especially if you're skeptical about global warming), a market-driven system for tradable greenhouse allowances is the best way to kick start greenhouse gas reductions (see \"Beyond Kyoto\", Foreign Affairs July/August, attempting to limit our greenhouse emissions and foreign oil dependancies are BOTH important goals, and tax credits to consumers are an important way to reward people for making environmentally sound choices (for example, by buying hybrid vehicles). Senate rejects 43-55. Republicans voting FOR are Chaffee (RI), Collins (ME), Gregg (NH), Lugar (IN), McCain (AZ), and Snowe (ME). Democrats AGAINST are Breaux (LA), Byrd (WV), Conrad (ND), Dorgan (ND), Landrieu (LA), Levin (MI), Lincoln (AR), Miller (GA) and Pryor (AR).\n -Votes NAY \"the conference report\" (whatever that means) for the partial-birth abortion ban bill. I'll just assume that means he voted against the bill. Speaking, again, as a moderate pro-lifer, that bill was a travesty. I firmly believe these bills need health exceptions (and the Supreme Court agrees with me, see Stenberg v. Carhart), and this bill didn't have one. I stand with Senator Kerry in opposition to it.\n -Then we get to the infamous Iraqi reconstruction vote. Kerry opposed it. I disagree. I know you disagree. Its bad.\n -The vote immediately preceding that was more interesting though. Kerry votes NAY on Brownback (R-KS) amendment to DECREASE funding to Iraqi reconstruction by $600 million dollars, and increase funding to the Iraqi civil defense corps by $50 mil, increase funding to afghanistan by $400 mil, and increase funding to liberia by an undisclosed amount. This vote, to me, is a close call. The Senate passes it.\n -Votes YEA on motion to TABLE Byrd (D-WV) amendment to not allow funding to be used for national guard/reserve members involuntarily deployed to Iraq who have been deployed for more than 6 months in the past 6 years. I agree with Kerry and agree with the tabling\n -Votes NAY on motion to TABLE Byrd (D-WV) amendment \"To prohibit the use of Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds for low priority activities that should not be the responsibility of U.S. taxpayers, and shift $600 million from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund to Defense Operations and Maintenance, Army, for significantly improving efforts to secure and destroy conventional weapons, such as bombs, bomb materials, small arms, rocket propelled grenades, and shoulder-launched missiles, in Iraq.\" The tabling passes. Another close call I think.\n -Votes NAY on motion to TABLE Corzine (D-NJ) amendment to establish a national intelligence commission to look into Iraq intelligence failures. I think that commission needed to be established, so we see what exactly went wrong. As you said RE: gun background checks, if no one did anything improper than there shouldn't be anything to fear. Unfortunately, the tabling passes.\n -Votes NAY on motion to TABLE Durbin (D-IL) amendment to provide funding for the treatment, research, and cure for HIV/AIDS. Speaking of flipflops, considering this very issue was part of Bush's State of the Union speech, I wonder why he made nary a whimper when his party in congress buried it. The AIDS epidemic is a powerful barrier to ending the plethora of civil wars and conflicts raging through Africa, and percieved US indifference is rapidly making this region of hte world a breeding ground for terrorists. Its clearly in US strategic interests to work to stop the epidemic. Tabling passes.\n -Votes YEA on the Boxer amendment to make retroactive the decision not to require hospitalized servicemen and women to pay for food and shelter, and to provide funds to offset past expenses. Passes 99-0\n -Votes NAY on motion to TABLE Landrieu (D-LA) amendment to create an Iraqi reconstruction finance authority and to use Iraqi oil revenue to pay for the reconstruction. Tabling passes. My take? Creating reconstruction authority=good, using Iraqi oil money to pay for it is bad. 50/50 for Kerry.\n -Votes NAY on motion to TABLE Daschle (D-SD)amendment to try and find the most cost-effective way to rebuild Iraq by attempting to secure International Support for the reconstruction effort. Saving money is good, international support is good, and this amendment makes sense. Tabling passes.\n -Votes YEA on Durbin (D-IL) amendment to insure pay contiguity for members of the federal government who are called up to serve in the armed forces. In other words, if you were making $100,000 in ure federal job, and ure salary as a grunt is $30,000, the government will make up the remaining $70,000. This prevents service families from going bankrupt, or at the least, from undergoing unreasonable hardship. It makes sense, and the amendment passes.\n -Votes YEA on Bayh (D-IN) amendment to require that Iraqi reconstruction money be used for \"Certain purposes.\" It doesn't say what purposes those might be, so I can't really comment other than to say blank checks are bad. amendment passes.\n -Votes YEA on Nickles (R-OK) amendment expressing the sentiment of congress that nations which are owed debt by Iraq incurred under the Hussein regime should forgive that debt. Makes sense, and it passes.\n -Votes YEA on McConnell (R-KY) amendment expressing sentiment that a \"global war on terror\" medal should be awarded as soon as possible to all soldiers participating in Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and Noble Eagle. Passes.\n -Votes NAY on TABLING the Lautenberg (D-NJ) amendment to prohibit the spending of funds on contracts made with companies who are paying deferred salary to US government officials. I'm undecided on this, what do you think? It certainly could reduce corruption. But the senate agrees to table.\n -Votes NAY on TABLING the Byrd (D-WV) amendment to impose limitaitons on the spending of Iraqi reconstruction money. Again, blank checks bad. senate agrees to table.\n -Votes YEA on confirmation of William Hayes to a federal judgeship in California. Passes\n -Votes NAY to TABLE Leahy (D-VT) amendment to place the CPA under the authority of the Secretary of State. I don't have an opinion either way on this. But the tabling passes.\n -Votes NAY to TABLE Biden (D-DE) amendment to pay for iraqi reconstruction funds by suspending some tax cuts on the top income bracket. This on the other hand I DO have an opinion on. In times of war, people need to make sacrifices, and that includes the wealthy. We need to realize that we only have enough money for tax cuts for certain people, and the poor and middle class need it more than the wealthy do. If we're short on cash, and in a time of war, then the rich should be willing to swallow a temporary suspension of their tax cuts for the good of the nation. That's called patriotism. Unfortunately, the Republicans disagree, and the motion to table passes. Sen. Chaffee (RI) is the only GOPer who votes against the motion, dems Baucus (MT), Bayh (IN), Breaux (LA), Miller (GA) (am i the only one who notices he's ALWAYS on this list?), Pryor (AR), and Nelson (NE) vote for the motion.\n -Votes YEA on McConnell (R-KY) amendment to commend our forces for their work on the war on terror. Passes (duh).\n \n That gets us back to October of 2003, with another 23 votes (21 not counting the 2 at the top I wasn't sure of the meaning of). I'm still not seeing that \"ultraliberal\" vibe yet.",

   "Righteous Anger: The Conservative Case Against George W. Bush\n \n By Doug Bandow\n \n I never understood why conservatives invested so much emotion in Clinton. He was a charming and bright but an enormously flawed, highly ambitious man of few principles. That warranted criticism, not hatred... Similarly, though George W. Bush is very different from Bill Clinton, hatred makes no sense. But anger is appropriate.\n ...\n The charge that Bush is a crazy right-winger is beyond silly. Other than tax cuts-which have benefited the rich only because the rich paid, and still pay, most of the taxes-virtually nothing of conservative substance has happened. Government is more expansive and expensive than ever before.\n ...\n James Traub contends, \"Today's Republican Party is arguably the most extreme-the furthest from the center-of any governing majority in the nation's history.\" This is the Republican Party that has embraced as its own every liberal initiative, from Lyndon Johnson's Medicare to Jimmy Carter's Department of Education to Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps. This is the Republican Party preparing to enact a Medicare drug benefit that would represent the largest expansion of the welfare state in 40 years. This is the Republican Party that is increasing federal education spending as if doing so had something to do with the quality of local schools. This is the Republican Party that is increasing spending faster than during the Clinton years. Right-wing extremists? For the Left, liberal means centrist, and moderate conservative approaches fascist. Really conservative is off the spectrum.\n ...\n Despite occasional exceptions, the Bush administration, backed by the Republican-controlled Congress, has been promoting larger government at almost every turn. Its spending policies have been irresponsible, and its trade strategies have been destructive. The president has been quite willing to sell out the national interest for perceived political gain, whether the votes sought are from seniors or farmers. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 encouraged the administration to push into law civil-liberties restrictions that should worry anyone, whether they are wielded by a Bush or a Clinton administration.\n \n Full essay:\n \n http://www.amconmag.com/12_1_03/cover.html\n \n \n Meet George W.

   "A little story on taxes for Duo Maxwell - the details may change, but it's the message that's important.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n This article appeared in the February 23, 2002 issue of the Lakeshore\n News - Salmon Arm, BC. It was written by Ron Adams, a local financial\n advisor that writes a regular column in the paper. Ron is sometimes a little irreverent and ruffles many conservative feathers in town, but he is often entertaining and usually gets straight to the heart of the issue.\n \n As written by Ron:\n I was having lunch at PJ's with one of my favorite clients last week and the conversation turned to the Campbell government's recent round of tax cuts. \"I'm opposed to those tax cuts,\" the retired college instructor declared, \"because they benefit the rich. The rich get much more money back than ordinary taxpayers like you and I and that's not fair.\"\n \n \"But the rich pay more in the first place,\" I argued, \"so it stands to\n reason that they'd get more money back.\" I could tell that my friend was unimpressed by this meager argument. Even college instructors are a prisoner of the myth that the \"rich\" somehow get a free ride in Canada. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n \n Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. Suppose that everyday 10 men go to PJ's for dinner, The bill for all ten comes to $100. If it was paid the way we pay our taxes, the first four men would pay nothing; the fifth would pay $1; the sixth would pay $3; the seventh $7; the eighth $12; the ninth $18. The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.\n \n The 10 men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement until the owner threw them a curve. Since you are all such good customers, he said, I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20. Now dinner for the 10 only costs $80.\n \n The first four are unaffected. They still eat for free. Can you figure out how to divvy up the $20 savings among the remaining six so that everyone gets his fair share? The men realize that $20 divided by 6 is $3.33, but if they subtract that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would end up being paid to eat their meal. The restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.\n \n And so the fifth man paid nothing, the sixth pitched in $2, the seventh paid $5, the eighth paid $9, the ninth paid $12, leaving the tenth man with a bill of $52 instead of $59. Outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.\n \n \"I only got a dollar out the $20,\" declared the sixth man pointing to the tenth, \"and he got $7!\" \"Yeah, that's right,\" exclaimed the fifth man. I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got seven times more than me! \"That's true,\" shouted the seventh man. \"Why should he get $7 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks.\" \"Wait a minute,\" yelled the first four men in unison. \"We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor.\" \n \n The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They were $52 short!\n \n And that, boys and girls, and college instructors, is how Canada's tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up at the table anymore. There are lots of good restaurants in Switzerland and the Caribbean.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Waxy",

   "Boycott Bush In 2004\n \n By Robert Locke\n \n Like most Republicans, I supported Bush the last time, but have finally been forced to the conclusion that the immigration-reduction cause, and the conservative cause generally, would be better off if he lost in 2004. So I urge the reader to withhold his vote and write the president why.\n ...\n Even before Bush announced his proposal to legalize virtually all illegal aliens in this country and open the borders to everyone on the globe who can underbid an American for a job, many conservatives were critical of him. Here's a partial list of why: \n \n \u00b7 He endorsed the revolutionary Grutter decision that placed nakedly anti-white racial preferences in the U.S. Constitution. \n \n \u00b7 He has refused to tell the truth about the 1,300-year-old civilizational war we are in, calling our Islamist enemies merely \"terrorists,\" as if they were a threat on a par with the ETA or the Weathermen. \n \n \u00b7 He has subjected the American people to intrusive random security checks at airports while continuing to protect Muslim foreigners from the racial profiling their own countries practice.\n \n \u00b7 He has left in office high-level Clinton appointees whose competence and patriotism are dubious and whose ideology is openly liberal.\n \n \u00b7 He has left in place a feminist agenda in the armed forces which kills women and impairs our defense. \n \n \u00b7 He has pushed and signed the insanely egalitarian, hugely expensive, and unconstitutional \"No Child Left Behind\" Act.\n \n \u00b7 He has legitimated the white-guilt theory that is rotting Western Civilization, giving a speech in Africa denouncing historic white America in terms that exceeded Bill Clinton. \n \n \u00b7 Then he sent $15 billion to African dictators under the guise of fighting AIDS, a disease almost wholly caused by immoral living. \n \n \u00b7 He has forced America's most vulnerable ally to risk her national survival kowtowing to terrorists under the delusion that they are incipient democrats. \n \n \u00b7 He has declined to respond in any serious way to the Democrats' outrageous blockade of his judicial appointments. \n \n \u00b7 He has renewed the funding of the radical anti-American organization UNICEF. \n \n \u00b7 He has signed the largest expansion of the federal welfare state in a generation, the funding of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients. \n \n \u00b7 He has signed the patently unconstitutional McCain-Feingold law, the aim of which is to subject political speech to bureaucratic controls as in the soft-totalitarian European Union. \n \n \u00b7 He has sought to buy off social conservatives with his faith-based initiative which, far from helping strengthen religion in America, will co-opt churches and other religious organizations by making them dependent on federal largesse. \n \n \u00b7 He has evaded the issue of gay marriage and then proposed a constitutionally-dangerous amendment that he knows will be almost impossible to pass. \n \n \u00b7 He has continued the free-trade extremism that is gutting America's industrial base and has given us a jobless recovery.\n \n As a result of these betrayals of conservative principles, Bush was barely deserving of support prior to his (latest) immigration-expansion initiative. With it, he has finally crossed the line into being a proactively destructive force in American life who must be stopped before he destroys the Republican party, the country, or both.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.americandaily.com/article/4687\n \n \n \n .",
