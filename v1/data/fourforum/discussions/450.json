   "This is a message that us anti-war cyber activists are spreading around the net to stop the siege of iraq...\n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n A problem is solved effectively when all sides win. It was clear to many of us that starting war with Iraq would increase the likelihood of more global terrorism. However ,we were unable to stop that action before it started. Now that it has begun, we must now rally behind something else effective as well. May America declare an immediate cease-fire, and let negotiations continue, allow civilians and any defectors to find shelter, and encourage Iraq to surrender peacefully.\n \n We call on an IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE. We have shown our superiority. We do NOT need to traumatize an ENTIRE POPULATION. We are now giving Baghdad their own 911, and they are now in shock and awe like we were on Sept 11, 2001.\n \n PLEASE DO NOT MARCH OUR FORCES INTO BAGHDAD! This will cause immense casualties on BOTH sides. This is UNNECCESARY to the problem at hand.\n \n This DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM. It only fuels the fire of irrational politicians on BOTH SIDES.\n \n SPREAD THE WORD. SUPPORT THE LIVES OF OUR TROOPS. CALL OFF THE UNNECCESARY ASSAULT ON BAGHDAD.\n \n THOUSANDS OF LIVES CAN BE SPARED. \n \n We take this stand to PREVENT TERRORISM and to SUPPORT our troops.\n \n It is the irrational politician who exploits the men and women of service. It is them that put our troops in harm's way UNNECCESARILY.\n \n \n We do NOT RALLY against our soldiers. We DEFEND them . Bombs hurt and maim soldiers just like they do anyone else. It is NOT OK when ONE soldier dies.\n \n \n Immediately lift sanctions against Iraq and let humanitarian aid flow quickly into the country. Let's immediately rebuild IRAQ. Let's help them win.\n \n Please spread the word. This idea of global military containment is the FALSE New World Order. The new era of global arrangement and the TRUE New World Order is ALL SIDES WINNING ALL THE TIME.\n \n All problems are solved effectively when all sides win all the time.\n \n This may be a war of FUNDAMENTALIST VS FUNDAMENTALIST, and that is NOT our war. There way of thinking is OLD and OUTDATED. Their formula seeks many losers and only one or two winners. They use deception and the poker bluff to solve problems in the world. False information never helps to solve the problem.\n \n This is a war of information. So we fight on BBS, newsgroups, and emails. Come join us.\n \n Please come attend at \n \n \n http://www.highintelligence.com \n \n Bubblefish\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

That is what we are fighting for! What you are doing right now is treason, but what makes America so great is freedom of speech! The people over there dont have any freedom!Saddam does horrible animal like things to those people! The people over there are allready dead! Saddam is a dictator, not a president. He does not care forhis country at al, he just wants to control it. You really hav no clue watit is like overthere for those people! You have no clue why we are over there do you? We are protecting ourselves! Not only that but we are helping people in Iraq. Did you know that Saddam has these rooms called \"rape rooms\"? He takes men AND BOYS (8yrs+) gives them guns and tell them to fight! If they refuse to do what he says, he takes the children and brings them to these rape rooms and has his soldiers rape them infront of their parents, andif that doesnt work they torture and kill. Sounds hrrible huh? I f you are o concerned about peace! then you should actually want to go over there and give those poor people peace.
