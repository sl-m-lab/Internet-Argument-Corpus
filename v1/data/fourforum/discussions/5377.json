   "Let's hope so. Maybe she can pull Germany out of its downward spiral. Don't anyone tell me the problem is not serious in Germany. It is damn serious. Business as usual won't cut it anymore.\n -------------------------------------------\n \"North Rhine-Westphalia's Social Democratic government has piled up debt in a vain attempt to save jobs in the dying coal and steel industries. In 1960 some 600,000 Germans worked in the coal mines; that number has declined by 94%, to 36,000.\"\n ======================\n Gerhard Fall\n Anti-Americanism reaches its limit in Germany.\n \n Monday, May 23, 2005 12:01 a.m.\n \n SINGEN, Germany--Three years ago, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder cynically used opposition to liberating Iraq to play an anti-American card just before elections in which he trailed his Christian Democratic opponents. He barely won a second term. Yesterday, facing a likely loss in elections in Germany's largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, his Social Democratic Party's union backers played another anti-American card, this time depicting U.S. investors as blood-sucking parasites. Social Democratic chairman Franz Muntefering compared hedge funds to \"swarms of locusts.\" This time, the tactic failed. Mr. Schoeder's party went down to a stunning defeat, losing the largely working-class state, home to one out of five Germans, for the first time in nearly 40 years. Last night Mr. Schroeder announced he would hold national elections this fall, a year ahead of schedule.\n \n North Rhine-Westphalia, centered on the industrial Ruhr region of northern Germany, is home to 18 million people and would be the sixth largest economy in the European Union if it were a separate nation. It is beset by many of the same problems that plague Germany as a whole. Since 1995, the German economy has been growing at a slower pace than any other European country except Moldova. Germany is increasingly losing jobs and investment to countries that do not have its crushingly high wages and social welfare overhead.\n \n Many commentators will explain away the Social Democrats' overwhelming 45% to 37% defeat by claiming it represents discontent with Mr. Schroeder's tentative moves to curb welfare benefits and reform labor laws. But if that were the real issue, the government's left-wing partners, the Greens, would have gained votes. Instead they lost support, finishing with only 6%. The Christian Democrats' free-market partners, the Free Democrats, received the same proportion of the vote. Indeed, if yesterday's vote had primarily been a left-wing protest vote, a new party, the Election Alternative Work and Social Justice, formed by dissident members of Mr. Schroeder's party, would have won seats. Instead, they failed miserably.\n \n The centerpiece of the anti-American, anticapitalist campaign was a cover story in the magazine of IG Metall, Germany's largest trade union, which has a circulation of two million. The cover featured a fiendishly grinning mosquito with an Uncle Sam hat and the caption US-Firmen in Deutschland: Die Aussauger (\"U.S. Firms in Germany: The Bloodsuckers\"). The article's headline: \"The Plunderers Are Here.\" Medienkritik, a German blog, pointed out that the artistic depiction and commentary bore a striking resemblance to 1930s Nazi propaganda against the Jews; it posted a cartoon from Der Stuermer depicting a spider with a Star of David on its back and dead Germans caught in its Web. That caption read Die Ausgesaugten--\"those whose blood has been sucked out.\"\n \n Guido Westerwelle, head of the Free Democrats, sharply criticized the cover, saying he was \"against hate of foreigners\" whether it came from the right or the left. An IG Metall spokesman called the cover \"a good caricature,\" and Mr. Schroeder himself called on his ministers to investigate whether hedge funds should be more heavily regulated if they continued to insist through their investments that German companies be streamlined.\n \n But such moves are inevitable. North Rhine-Westphalia's Social Democratic government has piled up debt in a vain attempt to save jobs in the dying coal and steel industries. In 1960 some 600,000 Germans worked in the coal mines; that number has declined by 94%, to 36,000. Each job in the industry costs the government a subsidy equivalent to some $90,000 a year. The Christian Democrats, while generally timid on economic reform in North Rhine-Westphalia, proposed to slice those subsidies in half by 2010 and also to give universities greater freedom to charge fees from students. The Social Democrats opposed both ideas.\n \n Yesterday's election results are \"a devastating defeat for Schroeder,\" political scientist Uwe Andersen told a German TV station. \"It's as if they've been thrown out of their own living room.\"\n \n Bad news for Mr. Schroeder is also good news for America. The Christian Democrats have announced that Angela Merkel, their pro-U.S. party chairman, will be their candidate for chancellor in the fall elections.\n \n Ms. Merkel is a physicist who lived in East Germany when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. While cautious, she is the closest thing German politics has to a Margaret Thatcher. When asked earlier this year if she detected any similarities between her ideas and the reforms that Britain's Iron Lady carried out in the 1980s, she told the Independent, a British newspaper, \"My whole life was changed by reunification. I have experienced change as something good, not something to be avoided.\"\n \n If German voters, tired of 12% unemployment and of being portrayed as the \"sick man of Europe,\" have had enough this fall and throw out Mr. Schroeder, she may well get a chance to prove how much change the notoriously risk-averse German electorate can tolerate.\n \n http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=110006726",

   "Ah, the \"liberal\" american media, blaming socialism for economic incompetence ...\nSocialism, European style, IS economic incompetence. Any business expansion into a new field or a new geographic area, involves risk, and many such ventures fail. Labor laws that penalize companies for laying off workers, or in any way inhibit labor flexibility, increase the cost of failure. Economic policies that penalize success with confiscatory taxation reduce the incentive on the upside. Combining the two bad policies is a formula for stagnation (i.e., decline relative to the rest of the world), and that's exactly what European socialism does.\n \n \nI found his dismissal of the idea that Mr. Schroeder's tentative moves to curb welfare benefits and reform labor laws was the cause of the SDP loss rather uninspiring.\nNot enough to overcome your preconceived notions, eh? The editorial is quite correct in noting that it is not enough to cut welfare benefits, and there also has to be an incentive for entrepreneurs to take risks in hopes of making money because that's where the job creation engine is.\n \n \nPerhaps, in Germany that type of cure would be worse then the disease.\nHalf measures only make the problem worse, and you can't solve the problem by looking myopically at only one symptom. Margaret Thatcher had it right, and the results prove it.",

   "...Margaret Thatcher had it right, and the results prove it.\nWhat? Mass unemployment, social disorder, a housing crisis, an upsurge in terrorism and the liquidating of government assets to bribe the voters with temporary tax cuts prove Thatcher was right? Thatcher was a disaster: she wrought untold damage to Britain. We are still living with the legacy of her economic and political idiocy more than a decade on. Eight years of psuedo-scoialism under wannabe president \"poodle Blair\" has put right some of the damage, but there is still a long way to go.",

Reagan did the same after four miserable years of Jimmah Carter. It's \"Reagan\" btw; not \"Regan.\" Regan was his chief of staff.\n \n The purpose of a leader is to lead; not compete in a popularity contest. Thatcher led and Britain is the better for it. Otherwise it was going down for the count. \n \n If you will recall, one of the very first things that Reagan did was to fire the air traffic controllers. He had no intention of a bunch of union thugs running the country. That set the tone for the rest of his term. Everyone knew he said what he meant and meant what he said.",

   "Germany's 'iron lady' to take on Schr\u00f6der\n \n ALLAN HALL\n IN BERLIN\n \n A WOMAN known as Germany's Margaret Thatcher looks set to challenge the country's crisis-hit chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, in a snap general election later this year.\n \n Angela Merkel, 50, is putting the creation of jobs and the taming of union power at the top of her agenda - themes that echo the Tories' \"Britain's Not Working\" message in 1979.\n \n Her bid for power came after disastrous regional elections at the weekend prompted Mr Schr\u00f6der to call for a vote of confidence in his government. His Social Democratic Party (SPD) will abstain, forcing a general election by September.\n \n With an opinion poll yesterday showing Mrs Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on 46 per cent, compared with the SPD's 29 per cent, it appears to be the biggest gamble of Mr Schr\u00f6der's political life.\n \n Mrs Merkel, who has still to be confirmed as her party's candidate as chancellor, said yesterday: \"This is about only one question - whom do people trust to change Germany's fate for the better again? And on that front, we're really confident. This country needs jobs and we are the party to bring them.\"\n \n Roland Koch, the CDU governor of the state of Hesse who has long been viewed as a rival to Mrs Merkel, appeared to clear the way for her bid for power. \"I don't know anyone in the Christian Democrats who is of a different opinion - Angela Merkel is the woman for us,\" he said.\n \n Mr Schr\u00f6der's SPD-Green alliance appears to be in chaos, and the chancellor fears the left wing of his own party will only make things worse over the next 18 months. That was the message he gave his top lieutenants at crisis talks in Berlin yesterday to explain his risky strategy of forcing an election 12 months ahead of schedule.\n \n The weekend loss of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which his party had held for four decades, was a bitter blow. He told loyalists he could either backtrack on the painful economic reforms that cost him the election or try to tame his party's militants by emphasising the need for unity to secure a popular mandate for a third time.\n \n Mr Schr\u00f6der will engineer the loss of a no-confidence vote in the German parliament on 1 July that will most likely pave the way for the president to grant him his wish for new elections on 18 September.\n \n Yesterday, he gave a taste of the fear of change he will try to instil into voters, claiming the CDU will tear down the welfare state with \"market radicalism\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=565472005",
