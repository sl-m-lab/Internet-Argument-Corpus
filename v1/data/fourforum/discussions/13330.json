   "In an infamous moment at the Values Voter Summit over the weekend, captured on video by Dave Weigel, Sen. Tom Coburn's (R-OK) chief of staff Michael Schwartz made the case against pornography. \"All pornography is homosexual pornography,\" said Schwartz, quoting an ex-gay friend of his, \"because all pornography turns your sexual drive inwards.\"\n \n Schwartz then explained the side benefit of this finding -- that if boys know pornography will make them gay, they'll never touch it, taking advantage of what Schwartz sees as a natural homophobia. \"And if you tell an 11-year-old boy about that, do you think he's going to want to get a copy of Playboy?\" he said. \"I'm pretty sure he'll lose interest. That's the last thing he wants!\"\n\n Coburn Aide: If Boys Knew Porn Will Turn Them Gay, They Won't Want Playboy | TPMDC\n \n This is just one example of why the \"ex-gay\" movement is a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.",
