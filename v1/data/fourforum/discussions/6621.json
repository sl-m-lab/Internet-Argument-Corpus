TheFounding Fathers made sure that Americans have all the tools they need to make and keep the US the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.

   "I would say that the Middle East becoming a peaceful and prosperous place is about as likely this century as it is for George W Bush to grow his hair long and move to a New Age hippy commune to find his astral self.\n \n One of the main reasons is exemplified by what is happening in Iraq right now. During the Imperialist phase of European history, right up to the end of WWII it was us who demarcated the borders of countries like Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and it was us who put their rulers in place. Iraq is a great example because the three major cultural groups - the Kurds, Sunnis and Shias - identify more with their \"tribal\" (not sure what the best term is) groups than they do with the concept of \"Iraq\". Africa has exactly the same problem where huge areas which belonged to one large and powerful tribe were divided up between the British, French, Dutch and Belgians and these divisions eventually became the borders of countries in modern Africa, leading to endless territorial civil war during the late 20th century.\n \n Another thing the ME shares with Africa is astonishingly blatant corruption at every level of authority, Saudi Arabia being the best example with the al-Saud dynasty kept in power by Western arms which also allow them to reap the vast majority of profits from the Saudi oil industry. The presence of such vast quantities of the black gold, and the questions of who has access to it and who profits from it are of course major issues with the potential to cause major problems, no matter what else is achieved in terms of stabilising the region.\n \n There are just too many different ethnic groupings with too many greivances against each other for there to be peace unless something can unify them, and unfortunately the most obvious unifying ideology at the moment is the brand of anti-Western fundamentalist Taliban-style Islam peddled by groups like Al-Qaeda. \n This same ideology is also vehemently opposed to the presence of Western troops (for ANY reason) in the ME, and equally opposed to the style of leadership currently encountered in most ME countries. The reason that this ideology is proving so popular is that most ordinary ME people agree with these two points, and those who have been most directly affected also jump on the more extreme bandwagon of global Jihad and martyrdom.\n \n I am strongly of the opinion that sometime in the next decade or two we will see a wave of Islamist revolutions across the ME (and central Asia, perhaps north Africa as well) which will bring unimaginable carnage to the region as those in power attempt to maintain the status quo, and those in the West support them to maintain their grip on the ever-more-valuable oil supplies.\n I cannot imagine how such a situation will resolve itself, or how long it will take, but I am 100% certain that it's going to get much, much worse before it starts to get better.",

When i say that I don't just mean the republicans because they are majority of Congress (thank God, yes I said God.)

I forsee a US bankrupcy within the nex decade.\n After that, Israel won't get any more money from the US to fund their walls and warmachine, so now they'll have to play nice with their neighbours and deal with them on an equal level.\n \n Personally, I can't wait for the US to go broke, it will make the world a whole lot friendlier when those US soldiers in all of the countries around the world (130 of them) leave.\nWe as a nation are broke. No one really likes to admit it but we as a country are not rich. (Just look at how big our national debt is.) The solderers don't even have all the equipment that they need. They might as well be fighting naked. Bush won't be backing out of Iraq until the job is completed. Although, I would like to know what that job is because he already had a mission accomplished party on a big boat back in 2003. The only thing we found out about the war with Iraq was that Saddam was the stereotypical \"big bully.\" When all was said and done with the main part of the war, he ran and hid with a gun that he didn't have the guts to use. We didn't make the world any safer. All we did was put our solderers somewhere where they could get killed for no reason and give bin Laden enough time to plan out what ever he wants to cook up. Here's a way where Bush flip-flopped (oh wait, he's a republican, he can't flip-flop. So I guess he's a thong.) On the night of Sept. 11, 2001, Bush said that we would not rest and we would not tire until the terrorist were brought down. With in a matter of months, the terrorist are able to escape and then Bush says that he doesn't really think much about the terrorist...that haven't been brought down yet. Now, we just keep getting bin Laden's no. 2 men. Last I heard we had captured his barber.emoticon_wow Ah-ha, we have bin Laden's barber. Now he is going to have a lot of hair and a really long beard. Freedom wins.emoticon_frazzled.\n But my main point is that the country's poverty is not going to stop Bush from going to war. Not when his \"base\" are the elite; the \"haves, and the haves more\" I know that we are viewed as the riches country in the world. The majority of the country doesn't have didily squat. The government apparently can't even afford to pay the medical bills for solderers who lost body parts in Iraq. We don't have the resources for continuing action in Iraq but Bush is too stubborn.",

What I meant was that bin Laden said himself that he didn't like Saddam but beleived that going to war with Iraq was an attack on Islam itself. He was using that as war propaganda to get his fellow muslums to support him against the americans. This was always one of my reasons for being against the war with Iraq because the guy were trying to get doesn't even have any kind of relationship with the other guy we were trying to get.\n \n Maybe after April 20th (or so) 1995, all Catholics should be arrested because Timothy McVey was catholic. My point in quoting you here is (and I'm sure from reading your quote that you fell the same way here) that people in any religion have differnent views on their own religion and what's right and what's wrong (or how much a wrong can be streached to make it more right.) People like bin Laden are extreamest (or I think fundamentalist is the word.) I actually asked someone who is of the Muslum faith how that faith has more terrorist and the answer I got is they can looks something up in their bible that says \"kill\" or \"sword\" and say \"oh, the bible says to kill.\" Anyone can twist around the way things are worded for their own goals. \n \n Looking at the middle east and thinking that all people of the Islamic faith are the same is like someone looking to America and thinking that everyone is a warmongral who wants to rule the world and force everyone to have the exact same views as us. Just for the record, half of the country voted against Bush in the last election. Just that Bush got more votes than Kerry because about 1% voted for Nader. Not everyone in America gives a damn about what movie stars are up to in their private life. (I'm sorry, I can't stand celebrity news over whose doing who or having a baby or what ever.) Not everyone is as rich as Bill Gates (or Donald Trump or any other very rich person.) Infact, the common person barely makes enough one way or another in 1 full time job. For example, I know of some people who work for the government but they don't get paid for taking off on government holidays (even though they can't work on those days anyway) and they don't get medical benifits. There are people in this country who think that things like SUV's are stupid.\n \n Okay, I'm making this too long but the point I'm giving here is that you can't take one person's idea and assume that it's the majority idea. Now, did I make my point clear or skew off onto a tangent?",

Poll results show that regardless of who wins, there will be close treaties with Iran, since the US backed canidates do not have a snowballs chance in hell. With Iran and Iraq closely alinged, US participation and control in the ME are a thing of the past. \n \n The Sunnis have bene actively campaigning to elect leaders to support and protect IRan becuase they know as well as anybody that IRans Euro based oil market, set to open next year, is the end of the petro dollar. Every OPEC nation has already agrees to sell there, and in Euros, and every major oil importer has reserved a slot to buy. \n \n Iran and Syria already have a mutual defense pact, and Iraq has already been brougth intot hat fold. The russians are backing it by providing Syria and Iran both modern anti aircraft systems to protect against potential attacks. Israel cannot possibly stand against a united Syria, Iran, and Iraq, even with US support. Their only option would be Nukes, which would almost certainly turn the entire world against them. In short, the odds of israel existing past 10 years is pretty slim with an Iran/Iraq/Syrian conglomerate in the ME.\n \n So in short, YES, there will probably be peace in the ME. How that peace will be arrived at is absolutly the worst case scenario for the US or the western world, but there WILL be peace.",
