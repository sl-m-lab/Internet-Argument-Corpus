   "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10701666/\n \n This thread is dedicated to the observation of media reports that are directing us to the next phase of war with the middle east.\n \n This time around it will be interesting to see which news reports pan out to be true and which ones will pan out to be false. As most of the world, without selective memories, might remember, the March to War: Part 1 was peppered with inaccurate intel, misconceptions and maticulous lies. \n \n Part 2 should prove interesting as it appears more and more, each day, that the population is beginning to wake up and are skeptical about taking things at face value from the current political scene.\n \n It should also prove interesting to observe which media outlets slant in favor of the March to Mar: Part 2 and which ones fervently march away (as well as which media outlets appear objective.)\n \n My prediction is we WILL be watching Isreal try to eliminate Iran's nuclear ambitions. We will, if not by unconditional loyalty, then by principle, be obligated to defend Isreal. (Yet again.emoticon_rolleyes ) \n \n But we cannot afford the ME culture to acquire nuclear war capabilities. I think that fact alone can be agreed on by just about anybody, anywhere, regardless of political persuasions (fringe radical groups/XXXXXX notwithstanding)\n \n China, Japan, S. Korea should step up and spank N. Korea. They are more a threat to them than to us it would seem.\n \n This will be interesting. So, get your self some popcorn, put on your slippers, kick back in your recliner, dim the lights and get ready for the March to War: Part 2, now showing on your local cable channels.\n \n \n \n Please submit any news clips you find biased towards military intervention in Iran, Syria, N. Korea, and even Pakistan (our next targets) on this thread. Please post, as well, any articles opposing that effort.\n \n The object is to see who believes what and what turns out to be true. There should be a grand personality analysis at the end of the show.",

Our expedition into Iraq proved to the world our political leadership is incapable of rallying the US public behind a war of aggression without true cause. China dutifully notes same and continues extending credit while building a USD reserve to spend on industrial modernization. Israel is about the only wild card left in the US hand.",

Without massive injections of capital, Iraq's economic future promises great deprivation until they can get their oil production increased, estimated at 3-4 years. The logical solution is for the US to disengage, let Iraq sort itself out, and go forward with a stable, dominating government which could attract outside capital. The problem with that is the US administration credibility position of being 'right'; that Iraq will end its internal strife on its own due to elections and turn into a nice pleasant democracy with US control of Iraq's oil, tooth fairy stuff.",
