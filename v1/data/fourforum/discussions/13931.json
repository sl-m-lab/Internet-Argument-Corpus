How is it that you can't see that your perversion has blinded you to the most basic sense of truth or personal awareness of what you represent in every post you write?\n And why is it that every time I post scripture passages which outline your failings as a so called believer in Christ, you redact them?

No Archie I don't scream my beliefs and ram them down others throats unlike yourself..... Perhaps you live in an alternate reality?\n \n And sorry but that little mound of dirt you hastily built up really isn't that good of a defense.....\n\n \n You're absolutely right Jason, we do live in alternate realities. In my reality as a believer in and follower of Christ as my savior, I understand the great commission to share Him and to spread the good news of the gospel which I am doing with you. But you redact it and lash out bitterly like some rabid dog who hates everybody he claims to be most like. You know, actual believers in Christ? You are a double minded hypocrite and a liar my lost friend.\n \n You claim to be a believer in Christ and a committed christian yet you deny His word which condemns homosexuality. You call God a liar as you refuse to repent of that sin which God has called an abomination and warned you that it will destroy you and separate you from Him for eternity. \n \n You claim that the church is bigoted against homosexuals but you can't list even one type of sin of the flesh such as fornicating, adultery or alcoholics form together as a group of offenders and lobby for political acceptance so that their sin is regarded as good, normal and right for them as individuals or for society/the family. Yet you have the nerve to defend homosexuality in such a way, even though the bible you claim to trust is very clear in condemning this lifestyle as a social cancer and a self destructive poison to its practitioners. \n \n Face it Jason as you come back and condemn my words as hate speech; you hate the truth and wear religion as a cover in order to attempt to garner some personal respectability. Sadly though, you cannot pull it off because in every post your irrational hatred comes through loud and clear. You interpret my warnings as expressions of hatred rather than the sincere attempts to correct you which they are. So I repeat Gods word which says it better than I can in the hope that you will finally take it to heart and repent of your sin before God gives you over to a reprobate mind upon which time it will become too late for you to be reached, unless that time has already passed and it's already too late for you. If that be the case then you have my sincere condolences.\n Pro 19:3 The foolishness of man ruins his way, And his heart rages against the LORD.\n \n Act 13:41 'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.' \n \n Pro 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.",

   "Matthew - Christians are not en masse supporting your execution here in the US and you trivialize what is going on in Uganda by making such a comparison.\n\n \n Yes, a bad comparison.\n \n \nJyoshu - Different segments of Christians are actively working to infringe on the rights and/or activities of homosexuals in variety of ways (marriage, employment, adoption, military service, etc.). They are hardly innocent bystanders who just politely disagree.\n\n \n Fundies, sure. I think everyone already knows that. \n But the Christian fundies aren't as bad as the Islamic ones in terms of what they do, and it seems there are fewer of the Phelps' types anyway. I have no love for fundies either (right-wing OR left-wing) but let's not pretend they are just as malevolent in carrying out acts of violence.",
