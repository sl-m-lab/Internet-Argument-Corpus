I think I've established that all identical twins develop in different pre-birth conditions - some more different than others... unless I misunderstand you here?\n \n It may interest you to know that the best science indicates pre-birth womb conditions do in fact influence sexuality.\n \n Studies show that when a woman has male children, boys born later, as 2nd or 3rd boys in a family, are increasingly likely to be gay. The more male children, the higher the gayness probability.\n \n Researchers considered the possibility that this is because their mothers are older, and it's true, older women do have more gay boys born to them, but even when accounting for age, birth order of male children is still a significant influence.\n \n The best explanation for this is that when a woman has a male child, the immune system reacts to it, and this immune response grows stronger with each subsequent birth.\n \n More research is needed in this area, but assuming their research isn't fundamentally flawed...\n \n a) Pre-birth conditions influence sexuality\n b) Identical twins have differing pre-birth conditions\n \n it logically follows then that pre birth conditions can at least partly can explain variance in sexual orientation amongst identical twins.\n \n What it can't explain is why identical twins separated at birth are less likely to share orientation than those raised in the same family. \n \n So no, I'm not arguing that all gays are born gay.... if anything the separated twin studies suggest there are post-birth elements that also impact on sexual orientation.

   "Not necessarily, but possibly. Those attributes may be affected by pre-birth conditions in different ways to sexuality. It would be an interesting study to conduct, but ultimately inconclusive on this question, regardless of a positive or negative result.\n \n\n So then how do we go about assuming that pre-birth conditions influence sexual preference, or any other personality traits and behaviors?\n \n \nWhat do you mean they \"actually don't\"? I think I've established that all identical twins develop in different pre-birth conditions - some more different than others... unless I misunderstand you here?\n \n\n Actually, you've asserted that identical twins develop in differing conditions. This isn't true. Identical twins share the same genes, same amniotic fluid, the same nutrients, the same physical and chemical conditions. They swim around and interchange positions, and are in constant physical contact with each other. So you'd really have to back up your claim that all identical twins develop in different pre-birth conditions with some proof, please. \n \n \nIt may interest you to know that the best science indicates pre-birth womb conditions do in fact influence sexuality.\n \n\n That would indeed interest me. And where would I find this science? Links please?\n \n \nStudies show that when a woman has male children, boys born later, as 2nd or 3rd boys in a family, are increasingly likely to be gay. The more male children, the higher the gayness probability.\n \n Researchers considered the possibility that this is because their mothers are older, and it's true, older women do have more gay boys born to them, but even when accounting for age, birth order of male children is still a significant influence.\n \n The best explanation for this is that when a woman has a male child, the immune system reacts to it, and this immune response grows stronger with each subsequent birth.\n \n More research is needed in this area, but assuming their research isn't fundamentally flawed...\n \n a) Pre-birth conditions influence sexuality\n b) Identical twins have differing pre-birth conditions\n \n\n I'd love to see the studies that back up this idea. \n \n \nit logically follows then that pre birth conditions can at least partly can explain variance in sexual orientation amongst identical twins.\n \n What it can't explain is why identical twins separated at birth are less likely to share orientation than those raised in the same family. \n \n So no, I'm not arguing that all gays are born gay.... if anything the separated twin studies suggest there are post-birth elements that also impact on sexual orientation. It's a little sad this is so politically loaded a question.\n\n The impact of the political pressure goes both ways.

   "All the evidence I've seen points to - partly.\n \n Genes can increase your chances of being gay. Of identical twins where one is gay (and this is from memory, I could be way off), ~90% of the time, so is the other.\n \n And of the extremely rare \"identical twins separated at birth and adopted to different parents but later rediscovered as twins\", where one is gay, ~60% of the time so is the other.\n \n Clearly the fact these %s are so much higher than in the broader population shows genetics have a major role. But the fact these percentage aren't 100% says something. What, I'm not sure.\n \n a) Some gay twins are still in the closet (or may not even realise they are gay?)\n \n b) There are pre-birth factors other than genetics that influence sexualty (hormones / antibodies in the mothers' body perhaps?)\n \n c) The conditions of the post-birth environment, whether chemical or external, can impact gayness.\n \n d) At some stage in life, perhaps even early on, is there any element of choice involved - even if genetics predispose us to make that choice a certain way.\n \n What are the thoughts of the gay community here?\n \n My thoughts are that the twin issues mainly relate to b), but I would like to think d) - not big on the whole absence of free will thing.\n\n \n I am going back to the original post to address this primary issue.\n I don't know what the thoughts of the \"gay community\" are, whoever they are; these are my thoughts.\n \n You have summarized your ideas on the \"nature/nurture\" underpinnings of sexual orientation. My understanding of things is a little different, but if I hear you correctly, you are saying there are both genetic and environmental factors at work. \n \n That the conclusion all studies to date seem to come to. The \"environmental\" factors mean anything not related to genes. This can be in utero, or after birth. We know there are environmental factors because the studies show that heredity can't explain it all. No one really know what those factors are. We do know they occur either before birth or very early in life. Once sexual orientation is set, it does not appear to be changeable. \n \n Now, bear in mind all of the above is true for all sexual orientations, from strictly hetero to pure homo and the spectrum in between. \n \n What I strongly disagree with is your idea of \"choice\". All behavior is chosen. Innate sexual feelings are not. If you are calling a person who is not attracted to the same sex, but engages in same-sex behavior a homosexual, I would disagree. So I don't even understand what you mean by choice.\n \n Another tiny point: \"Some gay twins are still in the closet (or may not even realise they are gay?)\" Not realizing one is gay is a type of being in the closet. Happens a lot. Happened to me. \n \n So in summary there are both genetic and non-genetic factors that are responsible for sexual orientation of all kinds.

If not, what other pre-birth factors affect sexual orientation, and how can we relate these factors back to what we know about the twin studies?\n \n All babies probably have varying degrees of umbilical cord constriction, and all babies have unique diets based on what the mother eats.

   "From the APA:\n\n \n What is sexual orientation?\n \n Sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes. Sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions. Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex. However, sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex), and bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women). This range of behaviors and attractions has been described in various cultures and nations throughout the world. Many cultures use identity labels to describe people who express these attractions. In the United States the most frequent labels are lesbians (women attracted to women), gay men (men attracted to men), and bisexual people (men or women attracted to both sexes). However, some people may use different labels or none at all.\n \n Sexual orientation is distinct from other components of sex and gender, including biological sex (the anatomical, physiological, and genetic characteristics associated with being male or female), gender identity (the psychological sense of being male or female),* and social gender role (the cultural norms that define feminine and masculine behavior).\n \n Sexual orientation is commonly discussed as if it were solely a characteristic of an individual, like biological sex, gender identity, or age. This perspective is incomplete because sexual orientation is defined in terms of relationships with others. People express their sexual orientation through behaviors with others, including such simple actions as holding hands or kissing. Thus, sexual orientation is closely tied to the intimate personal relationships that meet deeply felt needs for love, attachment, and intimacy. In addition to sexual behaviors, these bonds include nonsexual physical affection between partners, shared goals and values, mutual support, and ongoing commitment. Therefore, sexual orientation is not merely a personal characteristic within an individual. Rather, one's sexual orientation defines the group of people in which one is likely to find the satisfying and fulfilling romantic relationships that are an essential component of personal identity for many people.\n\n \n\n What causes a person to have a particular sexual orientation?\n \n There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.\nAnswers to Your Questions For a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation & Homosexuality",

   "Questions...\n \n If a man who is naturally and genuinely attracted only to women (heterosexual, noun) has sex with a man (homosexual, verb) one time, does that make him a homosexual (noun)? How many times would he have to have to have sex with a man (homosexual, verb), even if fantasizing all the while about sex with women (e.g., a not untypical prison situation) before he can be classified officially as \"a homosexual\" (noun)?\n \n If a man who is naturally and genuinely attracted to men (you may not believe this possible, but for the sake of argument) has sex with a woman (heterosexual, verb) once, does that make him heterosexual (noun)? How many times would he have to do that, even if fantasizing about sex with men while doing so (e.g., either your typical I-married-a-woman-to try-to-make-myself-normal or the my-church-says-I'll-go-to-hell-if-I-don't-do-this scenario) before he classifies officially as \"a heterosexual\" (noun)?\n \n If a man secretly desires to want to have sex with men (again, for the sake of argument) and not at all with women, but chooses for whatever reason not to have sex with either, is he homosexual, heterosexual or neither?\n \n Is it possible for a man to sincerely want to have sex with another man, or are all men born attracted to women and only choose to have physical sex with men for demented and ultimately unknowable psychological motives? And if so, why has this phenomenon occurred throughout history in roughly the same proportion of the world population?\n \n How can it be an established fact (and it is) that non-human species--NOT just in captivity (read the studies)--have not only physical sex but FORM LIFE BONDS with others of the same gender, to the extent of raising \"adopted\" offspring together? (Want to question this? Feel free. I've got an arm-long list of peer-reviewed links just itching to be posted.)\n \n What motivation is there for a man who is born heterosexual, by which I mean with a hard-wired natural attraction to women, to forgo sex ENTIRELY with the gender for which he was born attracted to, in favor of having sex exclusively with his own gender, i.e., the one he's hard-wired to feel (I'm told) physical revulsion for...to the point of: wanting to form a life-bond with that person, possibly even to the extent of wanting to adopt a child with that person and care for it, wanting the right to make life-and-death medical decisions for him (don't forget, homosexuality is supposed to be all about the sex act, right?) and going so far as to actually protest for the right to have that bond legally recognized as equivalent to the bond he was presumably born with a hard-wired disposition to form with a member of the opposite gender, to whom he is really attracted and not this (yuch! ptoo!) man?\n \n And given the fact that according to some people that is exactly what must be the case in hundreds of thousands of cases, covering centuries, since they believe men are born straight and choose not to act on their straightness to the degree described above, why has this bizarre, unfathomable behavior not drawn any attention from the medical or mental health community in lo these many years?\n \n I mean, talk about weird behavior, you'd think this would rank up there with the weirdest of the. \"I'm turned on by women and not--yuck! ptooey!--men. But for reasons I can't or won't explain and no one has even asked me about, I choose not to have sex with women, but with a man and only a man for the rest of my life--and down with Prop. 8!\") \n \n You'd think the anti-gay fundies would be all over it. What's the problem--the FRC doesn't have enough dough in it's coffers it can't fund research into a phenomenon so inexplicable, so in defiance of common sense, that if solved would score a final, indisputable knock-out punch to all this \"gay gene\" nonsense? \n \n Or is that the 10%, 5%, 3%, 1% of the population that's supposedly gay (the upper range is supposedly our estimate, the lower is what the fundies claim) so organized and powerful that it's conspired to cloud scientists' minds, depriving them of the will to investigate such questions?",

   "MrWrite, you've probably heard me say before that the only way to determine whether someone is gay or not is by their own subjective self-evaluation. It is not possible to determine one's sexual orientation by observing their behavior, because if a person engaging in homosexual behavior tells you he's not gay, you can't disprove it. And similarly if a man who is married with kids says that he's living a lie and deep down he really feels gay, then there's no way to disprove it either. This is how researchers often determine if their participants are gay or not. \n \n Of course, sometimes in addition to asking straight out what the participant's own category of sexual orientation is, qualifying questions are also asked regarding quantity, frequency and duration of sexual relations with men or women. It may be possible for a researcher to classify a participant as heterosexual (as in the case of a married man claiming to be gay on the inside), even though he classifies himself as gay. \n \n Classifying a person by sexual orientation seems to be so complicated, contraversal and subjective that I personally don't use them. People insist that sexual orientation is innate and permanent because any other scenario puts a dent in the idea that people are born gay. Yet we have so many situations, such as what you've listed above, where one's proclaimed sexual orientation seems to contradict their sexual behavior. And at the end of the day, it is still the individual's perogative to label himself in any manner he wants to, and any disagreement by a third party would be invasive, rude and prejudiced, so the best we can do is leave them to be happy with the label of their choice and wish them the best. \n \n When I use the word homosexual, I describe the observable behavior, and that's it. I don't label anyone else's sexual orientation. Its not my business, nor can I accurately label anyone (including myself). So I simply don't use labels. \n \n I hope that answers your question.",

Babies exposed to the prenatal masculine androgen hormones develop a higher ratio of ring to index finger length. That is, an index finger shorter than the ring finger, typically found in males, is evidence of more exposure to androgens, and therefore a more masculine hand. Females typically have closer to equal ring and index finger lengths, suggesting lower androgen exposure in the womb. \n \n For instance, a survey showed that homosexual women tend to more often have the masculine hand pattern. \n \n Another study, also discussed in the essay above, shows that statistically males who have more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual. However, as the essay shows, men with more older brothers more often have the masculine hand pattern, suggesting that they are typically exposed to more androgens than their older brothers.

Of identical twins where one is gay (and this is from memory, I could be way off), ~90% of the time, so is the other.\n \n And of the extremely rare \"identical twins separated at birth and adopted to different parents but later rediscovered as twins\", where one is gay, ~60% of the time so is the other.\n \n Clearly the fact these %s are so much higher than in the broader population shows genetics have a major role. But the fact these percentage aren't 100% says something. What, I'm not sure.\n \n a) Some gay twins are still in the closet (or may not even realise they are gay?)\n \n b) There are pre-birth factors other than genetics that influence sexualty (hormones / antibodies in the mothers' body perhaps?)\n \n c) The conditions of the post-birth environment, whether chemical or external, can impact gayness.\n \n d) At some stage in life, perhaps even early on, is there any element of choice involved - even if genetics predispose us to make that choice a certain way.\n \n What are the thoughts of the gay community here?\n \n My thoughts are that the twin issues mainly relate to b), but I would like to think d) - not big on the whole absence of free will thing.\n\n \n I dunno if it has a genetic or scientific basis but I dont believe that men are born gay.

   "I dunno if it has a genetic or scientific basis but I dont believe that men are born gay. I think being gay is pervasive because of the media but not because it's hereditary\n\n If you look at all the articles that report scientific studies that claim \"evidence\" that people are born gay, they all allude to a common theme. The significance of proving that being gay is NOT A CHOICE is that it apparently makes the fight for gay rights more legitimate. If people don't choose to be gay, or if they cannot change from gay to non-gay at will, then it would be oppressively discriminatory to deny them equal rights, as with race or disability. In fact, studies that attempt to find a connection between pre-birth factors and fail, such as the finger-length example, are still touted as \"evidence\" that people are born gay by the gay rights activists and supporters in general. \n \n Interestingly, it is illegal to discriminate against persons based on their religious beliefs, even though it has never been attempted to show that ones religious orientation is innate. Yet, even though it is generally accepted that people choose their religion, yet hindus have all the rights of christians, buddhists and agnostics. \n \n The fact is, proof that people are born gay are not a serious contributing factor in the fight for gay rights. Whether sexual orientation is innate or chosen is no grounds for gays to be discriminated against. Furthermore, laws governing marriage aren't anti-gay, they specify that marriage is the legal union between a man and a woman; sexual orientation doesn't even come into the question. Yes, that sounds contradictory, but the issue isn't to fight that marriage laws be overthrown, but simply that same-sex couples also be included. \n \n In my opinion, the gay rights campaign has gone about this issue entirely wrong. They approached the issue from a perspective of antagonism against christianity, and defiance of tradition, which was totally unnecessary. Yes, christians were the most vocal opponents, and they successfully distracted the gays from creating the legal adjustments needed, and instead became engaged in trying to convinced christians that the bible says things it doesn't, an exercise in futility. \n \n I have no issue against gay marriage, and I'll actually be happy when this thing is over, which it soon will be. However, I'm totally against dishonest \"science\", supposed scientist who conduct poorly controlled experiments, gather incomplete data and draw premature conclusions, they the gay-rights community gobbles it up and waves it in the christians face: \"see!!! God made me gay!!!\" The reality is that the \"scientific study\" really didn't even come close to any conclusive evidence supporting people are born gay. But the gays don't care, the religious don't know better and the politicians don't say anything.",

I let people make their own judgements and assessments on that based on their evaluation of their own experiences. However, I am strongly opposed to the shams that are paraded as \"scientific facts\" that claim they have found \"more scientific evidence\" that people are born gay, or by extension, that sexual orientation is never a choice.

As such, they are as useful for distinguishing that aspect of our psychological make-up as \"tall\" or \"short\" are for describing our general height, and make communication easier when discussing such matters.\n\n The thing is, in many cases, including most of the cases you've described above, the \"emontional and/or sexual\" attraction in the individual changes, as does the behavior. Its usually impossible to objectively observe emotional and/sexual attraction from a third party perspective. Ultimately, we still have to depend on the individual's self-evaluation of their emotional or sexual attractions. So, by both first and second definitions, someone could be a homosexual one year, a heterosexual the next, and a bisexual the third. \n \n \nI realize that some people with their own agendas would like to have the \"emotional\" and \"attracted\" parts stricken from the record, and for the words to only refer to lust, sexual gratification, and things they consider depraved and \"icky.\" And they've succeeded in doing so, to the extent that most--though not all--dictionaries now include a second definition referring to e.g., \"homosexual behavior\"... though what behaviors homosexuals engage in that heterosexuals do not, and in greater numbers, I'm sure I couldn't tell you.\n \n Dictionaries, though, do not adjudicate the meanings of words, or make them somehow \"official.\" They merely acknowledge popular usage of them, at a given point in time.

However, like I said above, and like you pointed out in your examples, I've found that assigning sexual orientation labels are ultimately the sole responsibility and perogative of the individual in question. In reality, there would never be enough labels to cover all the possible combinations and degrees of sexual orientation, so while the labels are simple, they are also useless with respect to scientific research. And since the discussion centers around whether science has found evidence to support the idea that people are born gay, that's the context I use the words in.

Of identical twins where one is gay (and this is from memory, I could be way off), ~90% of the time, so is the other.\n \n And of the extremely rare \"identical twins separated at birth and adopted to different parents but later rediscovered as twins\", where one is gay, ~60% of the time so is the other.\n \n Clearly the fact these %s are so much higher than in the broader population shows genetics have a major role. But the fact these percentage aren't 100% says something. What, I'm not sure.\n \n a) Some gay twins are still in the closet (or may not even realise they are gay?)\n \n b) There are pre-birth factors other than genetics that influence sexualty (hormones / antibodies in the mothers' body perhaps?)\n \n c) The conditions of the post-birth environment, whether chemical or external, can impact gayness.\n \n d) At some stage in life, perhaps even early on, is there any element of choice involved - even if genetics predispose us to make that choice a certain way.\n \n What are the thoughts of the gay community here?\n \n My thoughts are that the twin issues mainly relate to b), but I would like to think d) - not big on the whole absence of free will thing.\n\n \n Do you have any more proof then just sitting around and stating things that are pure speculation?!

If it was a choice to be a heterosexual, Just as it is a choice to be a homosexual, then why is it that we were born with sexual organs. We would be born with no sexual organs at all to reproduce. Make sense?! Probably not. Let me get to my next point.\n \n 2. If Heterosexuality was a choice, and not inherited, then why is it that Homosexual people cannot make babies between themselves?! Because if we can choose who we sleep with, then baby making could be made between two people no matter who they sleep with. But the fact that they cannot shows that men, were supposed to mate and be with women, to reproduce. The proof is in the pudding as it were. It is in the make-up of our bodies, the natural use of our bodies, was for the opposite sex. If everyone were just homosexuals then how would we reproduce?! The human race would die out. Showing that Herterosexuals was inherited not a choice. Now when people decide to change the nature of themselves to do something contrary to nature, then that is their choice. Point-blank Period. There is no reproducing, and no real reason, except for sexual perversion. How's that for not having any factual basis?!\n \n \n \nSuch attempts at analogies are inherently missing a GLARING point.\n Do we have LEGISLATED discrimination against fat people based on their weight?\n\n \n We almost do. There was talk of banning fat people from resturants, and they tried to make a law of it. And now they are talking about fat people having to pay more for life insurence. That's not fair. I see legislated discrimination against fat people fast on the rise. You should know what you are talking about before you speak.\n \n \nabout standing up to the bigotry and discrimination.\n And with fat people, it isn't really there in any comparable fashion... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n People are prejudice against fat people all the time. They won't hire fat people in most places, when they go out people stare at them and treat them differently because of how they look. They have to pay for two seats on airplanes instead of for one, they are always put in a bad light, and ridiculed. I'd call that discrimination.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Let me stop you right there cause you're pretending to speak on \"inherited\" characteristics, and then you leave the conversation by talking about \"look at sex organs\" junk.\n It's like trying to prove that a car will float by insisting that we look at the dashboard which looks like it is made of wood.\n\n \n Look at sex organs junk?! Wow baby you are funny. Let's take a second look at why I brought the sex organs up. Yeah you brought up Inherited characeristics, but that is only one aspect of genetics. You have inherited traits, that determine what facial features you will have, hair color, etc.(I already stated this, but you probably didn't read or understand it. Anyway, then you have genetic chromosomes that determine what you will be, a female or a male(or the people with two sex organs, due to a birth defect. but we are not talking about that, because that is a different topic), and then you have inherited characteristics, but where you are getting things twisted, is the inherited characteristics you likely inherit is what you inherit from youre parents, because thier DNA is involved in making you. \n \n But there isn't a gene that determines whether you will like other guys, and you are one yourself. But there are other aspects that show that heterosexuality is genitc, because of the way the human body was made. You have male dna, that is compatible to female dna, when it comes to reproducing. Meaning that the two sexes where meant to be heterosexual. The make-up of the bodies, and the testosterone of a male and the estrogen of a female is put there for reasons. And different functions to be used to reproduce. If you are going to look at genetics, then why look at one aspect?! Let's look at the whole picture, if you are capable of it. Since no one is putting up any real links as to whether gayness is genetic, then I will support my statement of how heterosexuality is inhertied, and looking at the true functions or the organs, what they are for, and how they are used, shows that heterosexuality is inherited. Sorry that you cannot see the point unless, it is spelt out in the terms you understand it. But I just can't be that elementry, so try to read this as many times as you need to so that you can get the point clearly so that I don't have to repeat myself.\n \n \n \nThe observations you are making have absolutely nothing to do with inherited genetics, nor are they a reasonable impact upon such a discussion.\n\n \n Really, I just told you why I used them, so now, why don't you go ahead and explain indept why you say I'm wrong. Instead of just making statements, and not backing it up.\n \n \n \n \nThe problem with your commentary is you are trying to insist that two things automatically have to do with each other.\n If Jimmy is in the yard and a shovel is in the yard, does it make sense to accuse Jimmy of digging in the yard with a shovel?\n No. Cause how that shovel got in the yard and how Jimmy got in the yard and the relationship between the two are entirely different issues that you can't just assume.\n\n \n You are amusing. You brought about two different things here. You spoke of Jimmy having a shovel and assuming he dug up the yard, and then you brought up How he and the shovel got into the yard. Which one are we doing, wondering who dug up the yard, or how he and the shovel got into the yard?! You understand now why I think you're a funny person?! Here's an illustration for you......\n \n You're sipping your coffe at a small outside table of a small cafe, and you hear a gunshot, you look in the direction where you heard the shot, and you see a woman holding a smoking gun, on a deadend corner right across the street from you, with a dead body in front of her. No one ran away from the scene, and gunpowder is on her hands. Is it fair to assume that she killed that man?! I think it would be no assumption to say she did it. When you look at the natural make-up of our body, it is no assumption as to what it should be used for.\n \n \nIf you want to talk about INHERITED TRAITS, then talk THE LANGUAGE of inherited traits.\n Look at inherited genetics and show me the gene that causes heterosexuality?\n Can't do that, can you...\n\n \n You are the one that can't do that. Because you have constantly told me that I'm wrong, and you fail to prove how you are right. So you are the one who can't prove you're argument. Not me. How about you show me why you think gayness may be genetic?! Why don't you speak the language of inherited traits?! All I see from you is,\" Oh that's not right! You're wrong!\" But I see no proof coming from you as to why you think it is wrong, and then back it up with your sources, or at least some examples that make sense.\n \n \n \nYou are back to Jimmy and the shovel in the yard.\n Your question makes absolutely no scientific sense for providing rational proof as to why heterosexuality would not be a choice and homosexuality would be.\n\n \n I think it is you that seems to start and finish with Jimmy.\n \n \n \nThere is absolutely no logical connection between cause and effect in that statement.\n \"Choice\" is not dictated by the capability for procreation.\n \n Oral sex does not create procreation, right?\n So by your logic, if a guy likes the idea of getting a blowjob from a girl, that guy MUST HAVE CHOSEN to think that way...\n \n After all, can't get pregnant by inseminating her mouth, can you...\n\n \n You're asking the wrong one about the oral stuff, because I think it is repulsive no matter who's doing it. With your poor attempt at being sarcastic being noted let me ask you something. What do you think the sexual rgans are for? Just satisfaction sexually?! Nope, they are there to reproduce. But if you don't want kids at the moment they are to enjoy a special bond with your mate, until you decide to have children, then the option is there. Whip the condom off and have one. \n \n \n \nAnd if the purpose of gay sex were to reproduce, you would have more of a point.\n But it isn't.\n Moreover, most heterosexual sex that occurs involves a clear desire to NOT get pregnant.\n \n So does that make that sex pointless? Does it make that sexual attraction with a condom or birth control pill a \"choice\"?\n No.\n\n \n Exactly, gay sex is not to reproduce, because you cannot. Thus my statement of sexual perversion. And yes, some heterosexual couples do not want to get pregnant, but at least the person they are doing it with has to ablity to do so. Not just doing it out of an un-natural attraction.\n \n \nHow does this prove anything at all regarding heterosexuality being \"not a choice\" or homosexuality being \"a choice\"?\n It doesn't.\n\n \n It doesn't?! Then do me the favor of proving it doesn\"t, rather then just stating it doesn't.\n \n \nAnd the question you ask is like saying \"If every organ in the body was a heart, then the body would die.\"\n Pointless observation. Doesn't prove the heart is useless at all.\n\n \n Actually, if every organ in the body was a heart then the body would die, because you wouldn't have lungs to breath with, but most importantly, you wouldn't have a brain to tell the heart to pump. So it would die, and the heart is useless without the brain. So your point is?! I don't even think you know. \n \n \nI think you provided an excellent example of not having any factual basis.\n Go back to Jimmy in the yard with the shovel.\n You're looking at things, insisting they have to point to the conclusion you want everybody to assume, and then refusing to recognize that no such conclusion has been proven.\n\n \n Isn't that what you are doing?! I mean you have not proven anything on a factual basis. You just say that other people are wrong, and you are right. How is that factual?! Expecially when you have not even given a good argument, you've only responded back to everyone else's posts slashing at it, but not proving any fact of your own. Hmmm......\n \n \nYeah. That's like being \"almost\" pregnant.\n\n \n Sure is!emoticon_cool\n \n \n1) Where was this legislation attempt?\n I have never heard of it.\n \n 2) \"Not fair\" that people pay different prices for life insurance, based on health risks of the individual?3\n emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n Maybe it's because you're not as smart as you think you are, that's probably why you've never heard of it. Is #2 an attempt at being sarcastic?! because I'm here to tell you that you bombed out on that one.\n \n \n\"on the rise\"?\n \"know what you are talking about\"?\n You have not pointed to ANY EXAMPLE OF ACTUAL legislated discrimination, and you criticize me for not knowing of laws that don't really exist?\n \n Meh!\n\n \n Yeah, that's right I'am. You should be criticized.\n \n \nIf a person takes up more than one seat, then they should have to pay for taking up more than one seat.\n That's logic!\n You aren't talking about comparable things at all.\n\n \n Just because a person is big, does not automatically mean that they take up more then one seat. Might as well look at your own Jimmy and the shovel example.\n \n \nAnd if you read what I ACTUALLY said, I don't give a hoot if people \"stare at me\" or \"look down\" at me.\n Your opinion is your own.\n \n My issue is LEGISLATED DISCRIMINATION, which you obviously cut and paste around in order to try to pretend you were responding to me.\n\n \n Oh, I'm responding to you, you're just not understanding it. Not my problem. And who said anything about caring whether peopl stare at you are not?! When yu decide to act a certain way, and know the stares won't stop, I guess the only thing you can do is except it. Which is what you're doing. Good for you.

Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston, \"which is exactly the kind of pattern you would want to see if something genetic were going on.\" By \"unrelated,\" Dr. Bailey was referring to brothers by adoption.Gay Men in Twin Study - The New York Times\n \n \n \n... then I will support my statement of how heterosexuality is inhertied, and looking at the true functions or the organs, what they are for, and how they are used, shows that heterosexuality is inherited.\n\n See, RIGHT THERE you are completely voiding your proof by leaving the ISSUE of inheritable genetic traits and introducing factors IRRELEVANT to such an issue.\n \n If you wanted to prove something about black holes, do you think it would be wise to point out facts about art?\n No!\n \n \n \nReally, I just told you why I used them, so now, why don't you go ahead and explain indept why you say I'm wrong. Instead of just making statements, and not backing it up.\n\n Because your attempts at proof are unrelated to the issue you are trying to use to prove them.\n Just because a body functions a certain way DOES NOT mean that the body function attributes has to be inherited genetics.\n \n Suppose a father is a blacksmith, and his father before him, and his father before him. He FUNCTIONS in the community in this manner.\n Does that make his job genetic then?\n No!\n \n \n \nYou are amusing. You brought about two different things here.

Which one are we doing, wondering who dug up the yard, or how he and the shovel got into the yard?! You understand now why I think you're a funny person?!\n\n I think you're amused by things you don't comprehend.\n I am pointing out that they are SEPARATE ISSUES, and taking separate issues and pretending you have a scientific conclusion based on ASSUMPTIONS is nonsensical.\n \n Just because Jimmy CAN use the shovel to dig a hole doesn't mean anything about anything.\n You can't make assumptions on \"inheritance\" based on capability to function in a specific way.\n \n \n \nYou're sipping your coffe at a small outside table of a small cafe, and you hear a gunshot, you look in the direction where you heard the shot, and you see a woman holding a smoking gun, on a deadend corner right across the street from you, with a dead body in front of her.

Flash Quiz time.\n I am putting forth that homosexuality has a genetic component.\n By the same token, does it make sense for me to also argue that heterosexuality is NOT genetic???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I am arguing YOUR ARGUMENTS are wrong.\n \n For example, a person can stick a fork into a wall electric socket.\n If you look at a LOT of forks, and a LOT of wall electric sockets, they will fit.\n Does that mean that they INHERITED a capability to fit? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Function does not prove inherited attribute.\n \n And I am proving your arguments flawed.\n \n \n \nYou're asking the wrong one about the oral stuff, because I think it is repulsive no matter who's doing it. With your poor attempt at being sarcastic being noted let me ask you something.\n\n WOAH! WOAH! WOAH!\n You are NOT going to ignore that argument!\n Whether or not you think \"oral stuff\" is \"repulsive\" IS IRRELEVANT to the argument at hand.\n \n Your thoughts on \"repulsive\" are irrelevant to the issue.\n ADDRESS THE ISSUE!\n \n Oral sex does not create procreation, right?\n So by your logic, if a guy likes the idea of getting a blowjob from a girl, that guy MUST HAVE CHOSEN to think that way...\n \n After all, can't get pregnant by inseminating her mouth, can you...\n I'm looking for a real response to that cause \"repulsive\" doesn't refute the point.\n \n \n \nWhat do you think the sexual rgans are for? Just satisfaction sexually?! Nope, they are there to reproduce. But if you don't want kids at the moment they are to enjoy a special bond with your mate, until you decide to have children, then the option is there.

Thus my statement of sexual perversion.\n\n Again, you resort to non-scientific assessments.\n \n Here's another one for you...\n A woman over 60-years old cannot procreate.\n If she has sex, is she a pervert?\n :xbanghead\n \n \n \nAnd yes, some heterosexual couples do not want to get pregnant, but at least the person they are doing it with has to ablity to do so.\n\n And there, you abandon your position and show favoritism towards heterosexuals.\n If they have sex without a capability for procreation, by your very statements, they should be considered as \"perversion\".\n \n Condoms? Woman over 60? People who are shooting blanks?\n Sex involving these people / items should be \"perversion\" and inexcusable in your narrow approach...\n \n \n \nActually, if every organ in the body was a heart then the body would die, because you wouldn't have lungs to breath with, but most importantly, you wouldn't have a brain to tell the heart to pump. So it would die, and the heart is useless without the brain. So your point is?! I don't even think you know.\n\n My point is that the body functions better with DIVERSITY than with one monotonous item.\n Heterosexuals have a tendency to OVER-procreate.\n Gay couples can adopt and raise kids that heterosexuals over-procreate.\n That is BETTER for the society than just heterosexuals by themselves over-procreating. \n \n \n \nIsn't that what you are doing?! I mean you have not proven anything on a factual basis.\n\n You suffer from the same fallacies that too many conservative pundits suffer from.\n They take:\n A) 1+1=2.\n B) red+blue=purple.\n C) Therefore, heterosexuality is genetic...\n \n It's the CONCLUSION that is flawed.\n And there is no need for me to \"prove\" that A and B =\\=< C.\n You haven't provided real \"proof\" of your conclusion coming from the statements in the first place...\n \n \n \nYou just say that other people are wrong, and you are right. How is that factual?!\n\n As opposed to YOU SAYING \"A and B prove C\", and THAT is somehow factual?\n \n \n \nSure is!emoticon_cool\n\n It's hilarious how you just criticized me for \"just saying that other people are wrong\", and then you turn around and do EXACTLY that...\n \n \n \nMaybe it's because you're not as smart as you think you are, that's probably why you've never heard of it.\n\n And without a surprise, you provide absolutely no proof of your claim.\n I repeat...\n Where was this legislative attempt to ban fat people from restaurants?\n \n \n \nIs #2 an attempt at being sarcastic?! because I'm here to tell you that you bombed out on that one.\n\n \"Sarcastic\"?\n I think life insurance based on the imminence of death is an INHERENTLY SOUND idea. WE DO IT ALL THE TIME for non-fat situations.\n And when obese people put themselves at risk of dying earlier by being obese, that's just more of a sound tactic.\n \n \n \nJust because a person is big, does not automatically mean that they take up more then one seat.\n\n That was a pretty lame response.\n Obviously if they aren't big enough to take up more than one seat, they shouldn't be charged as such.\n It's the people who ARE too large to fit into one seat which should be charged more.\n \n You're jousting at your own strawman...\n \n \n \nAnd who said anything about caring whether peopl stare at you are not?! When yu decide to act a certain way, and know the stares won't stop, I guess the only thing you can do is except it. Which is what you're doing. Good for you. Don't let the mean people get you down.\n\n \"act a certain way\"?\n Being gay doesn't cause a person to \"act a certain way\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n If you want to get all bent out of shape over things you can't change, be my guest. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "emoticon_rolleyes\n I hear you.\n None of this needed explaining to me...\n \n It's what you're about to say that is\n a) entirely unsubstantiated, and\n b) completely unrelated to the above...\n \n \n \n That is your unsubstantiated opinion.\n Earlier, I mentioned the studies showing a genetic correlation in homosexuality.\n Naturally, you ignored it...\n \n The twin studies show that the gay correlation between identical twins is higher than the gay correlation between fraternal twins, which is higher than the gay correlation between non-genetic siblings.\n \n You're going to ignore that yet again, aren't you... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n And this is where you lose it.\n You're back in the realm of claiming things are \"genetic\" just because they are.\n \n Furthermore, I can't help but chuckle at your commentary...\n \"the human body was made\"?\n Demonstrates you're talking more about your RELIGIOUS beliefs than you are about science....\n \n \n \n That has absolutely nothing to do with inheritable sexual orientation. \n \n \n \n \"put there\"?\n Again, you are talking about YOUR RELIGION.\n NOT science...\n \n \n \n \"one aspect\"???\n :xbanghead\n I am talking about looking at RELEVANT aspects.\n \n Your whole commentary is like trying to insist that astronomy be introduced into a genetics discussion.\n Because obviously the stars were \"put there\" and you think the sun \"was made\", right?\n So why doesn't that make the sun relevant to inheritable genetics?\n \n People of religion need to stop confusing their religious BELIEFS with SCIENCE.\n \n \n \n Not like I expect you to address them...\n \"We found 52 percent of identical twin brothers of gay men also were gay, compared with 22 percent of fraternal twins, compared with 11 percent of genetically unrelated brothers,\" said J. Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston, \"which is exactly the kind of pattern you would want to see if something genetic were going on.\" By \"unrelated,\" Dr. Bailey was referring to brothers by adoption.Gay Men in Twin Study - The New York Times\n \n \n \n See, RIGHT THERE you are completely voiding your proof by leaving the ISSUE of inheritable genetic traits and introducing factors IRRELEVANT to such an issue.\n \n If you wanted to prove something about black holes, do you think it would be wise to point out facts about art?\n No!\n \n \n \n Because your attempts at proof are unrelated to the issue you are trying to use to prove them.\n Just because a body functions a certain way DOES NOT mean that the body function attributes has to be inherited genetics.\n \n Suppose a father is a blacksmith, and his father before him, and his father before him.

THAT is funny...\n \n Does she even have a bullet wound?\n Did the man have a friend who was with him who also had a gun, who ran away before you looked out?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n But of course, you jumped to the conclusion you wanted, didn't you...\n \n \n \n ROFLMAO!\n Man. You're not getting the bigger picture here.\n \n Okay. Flash Quiz time.\n I am putting forth that homosexuality has a genetic component.\n By the same token, does it make sense for me to also argue that heterosexuality is NOT genetic???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I am arguing YOUR ARGUMENTS are wrong.\n \n For example, a person can stick a fork into a wall electric socket.\n If you look at a LOT of forks, and a LOT of wall electric sockets, they will fit.\n Does that mean that they INHERITED a capability to fit? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Function does not prove inherited attribute.\n \n And I am proving your arguments flawed.\n \n \n \n WOAH!

You talk about rights, but you are willing to try and take away my right to believe what I want. You're a hypocrite. You mean to tell me that you cannot carry on a debate with someone who believes in the bible?! Have I quoted scriptures?! Have I said anything about sin?! NOPE! So what is your problem?! And the way the body was made was for a specific purpose, but you want to bring up religion because you want to hide behind it, so that you can ignore anything I say, while hiding behind the fact that I'm religious.

And if you keep your GAYNESS, out of public then no one would have to discuss gays. UNDERSTAND?! How does that sound?! Nasty huh?! Well then don't you dare say anything like that to me about my belifes, expecially since I never brought it up you did. So I guess that is the solution huh?! Religious people should shut-up, and gays should just turn straight, and no one will have to discuss anything they don't want to.emoticon_rolleyes Your statements are very elementry.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n\n I am on topic.\n How you imagine I COULD say something like that is not on topic.\n So deal with what I say. Not with what you imagine.\n\n \n I would deal with what you say, if what you say was worth considering. Give me something to deal with and maybe I will. But if you give garbage you'll only get it back in return.emoticon_xgood\n \n \nSo let's get this straight.\n Your rebuttal of my scientific study is JUST to call it \"tacky\"???\n Wow!\n\n \n Yes, because it is tacky. Like I said, this is the same man that in 1991 did the first study on gay twins, and got a 50% result. But then he did a second study some years later and got a 20% result. Which shows it really has no merit, and the % rate dropped by a considerable 30% rate. So how is that reliable?! And then it was only done by one man, and on sets of twins. Where are other people who did these studies, that prove his findings are correct?! \n \n To me this shows in no way that genetically they were born that way. Because twins share a deep bond inside and out of the womb, they(once outside the womb), are exposed to the same environment and the same, parenting. But they also share most of the same ideas and feelings, because of the close bond, actions of one twin can deeply influence the other twin, which really because they are outside of the womb, involves the CHOICE of the twins, and interacton with eacthother and who they choose to associate with that determines their sexuality.\n \n It is just like that with alot of sisters and brothers who are not twins. What an older sister or brother does influences what the younger sister and brother, does. If an older child is taking a certain path 60% out of 100, the younger sibling is going to follow the olders siblings actions. That is no different with twins. Each twin has an affect on their sibling but even more because they are close because of the twin bond they have. So if one twin is gay and has gay friends, chances are the other twin is effected by it, and takes the same path. Which happens outside of the womb and not inside of it. Showing that it is not genetic.\n \n Another thing that puzzles me, is that the people who claim that gayness is genetic, only have the twin theory to rely on, nothing else really concrete. And the fact that a lot of times they are only hypothesizing rather than actually stating facts. They literally explain away the effect, without truly having evidence of the real cause. Which does not make for a really good argument to me, and has no merit.\n \n \n \n \nHow completely underwhelming.\n Did you even bother to read it?\n \n Somehow I doubt it.\n\n \n Unfortunately me I did, which is how I know it's tacky garbage.\n \n \nThis link is dead.\n Not surprised...\n\n \n I never said you should be. So the link is dead?! That's life, I'm not going to kill myself over it. But since you want to be funky, I'll look it up again and copy and paste, you know FYI!emoticon_cool\n \n \nI have to chuckle when I read such statements, and then it becomes obvious YOU FAILED TO EVEN LOOK at the article.\n Let me quote the first sentence for you...\n \"Scientists are currently uncertain as to whether homosexuality is primarily caused by environmental or genetic factors.\"\n\n \n And I chuckle to see that you totally missed the point! I'm glad that you quoted the first sentence, because I makes it easier for me. Here we go.....\n \n My reason for posting that link was because of the first sentence, and plenty of other statements it made. But the first sentence is important, because if gayness was genetic, then there would be no uncertainty, it would be stated as such, and then broken down and shown so that others for a certainty can understand that there is a gay gene and how it functions. The fact that they said they were uncertain, after spending a whole lot of time, money, and patients on it gives proof that there is no gay gene. Because if something is there then it is there, and you'll be able to clearly see it, but if you have to search and study and still be uncertain, then chances are its not there honey.\n \n \nThe statement does not refute possible genetic causes.\n It says \"we don't know\".\n\n \n It does refute it, like I said, if it was there, then they would have found it. The fact that they don't know after studying it does not look good for your genetic argument.\n \n \nLet me quote something even more damning for you in this paper.\n \n \"So these data suggest that there is a modest effect of genetics.\"\n That's right!\n The article admits the evidence shows there IS A GENETIC COMPONENT.\n\n \n The fact that they said, that they did not know, and that it SUGGESTS that there is a modest effect of genetics, does not make it a fact. Which is another thing that I wanted to point out. MODEST, and not ABUNDANT, SUGGEST, instead of FOUND or WE HAVE PROOF THAT, shows that it is based on a hunch, but is not yet known. What I think is funny is the fact that you are grasping on fleeting hope, and hunches to try to excuse, or validate the way gay people choose to live their life, and their lifestyle. Just except the fact that, the gay lifestyle is not normal, and you cannot blame it on genetics, or anything else but individual choices. Stop trying to find excuses for it. Which is another thing that I find funny, how is it that a person like you who says they don't care about what other people think of him, and the way he lives, is on here arguing with anyone who does not agree with the gay lifestyle? If you don't care what other people think, then why are you here?! Why not linger in other threads here, why argue about something you don't care what people think?\n \n \nNARTH is professionally gay and has a nasty habit of picking and choosing evidence out of convenience.\n Sometimes, just plain blatantly lying about what the evidence says.\n\n \n Really?! You have valid proof of that statement?! Humor me and show me the proof. If you can.\n \n \nLet's look at their comment.\"Dr. Richard Pillard, a professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine who was involved in a study of twins and sexual orientation, has done research showing that sexuality is greatly influenced by environment, and that the role of genetics is, in the end, limited.\"WHAT???\n Pillard was involved in the twin study I GAVE YOU EARLIER!\n I challenge you to show HOW that study in any way shows \"greatly influenced by environment\".\n\n \n He was probably talking about the later tests that were done. Like I told you, there were later tests done with different results. But since you are challenging me, I challenge you to show me more links as to why you feel that sexuality is not determined by environment, and explain why it is highly impossible for an environment not to have a major part in a child growing up to be gay.\n \n \nThe study showed a CLEAR genetic influence.\n Yet this NARTH article pretends to talk about it while giving unwarranted and unexplained conclusions.\n\n \n Like I said earlier, prove why you make the assumptions you are making. Genetic influence is very weak in this respects, and undertermined. So it does not show clearly anything.\n \n \nNARTH, like you, are ignoring the evidence that shows there IS a genetic component to homosexuality.\n\n \n There is no genetic component to homosexuality. I believe I explained why I posted that link, there were certain things I didn't point out thinking you could read and comprehend but I guess I was wrong. Let me post something up here, for some reason the link wasn't working so I copied and pasted.....\n \n The British Journal of Psychiatry 160: 407-409 (1992)\n \u00a9 1992 The Royal College of Psychiatrists \n \n Homosexuals who are twins. A study of 46 probands\n M King and E McDonald \n Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London. \n \n Forty-six homosexual men and women who were twins took part in a study of their sexuality and that of their co-twin. Discordance for sexual orientation in the monozygotic pairs confirmed that genetic factors are insufficient explanation of the development of sexual orientation. There was a high level of shared knowledge of sexual orientation between members of twin pairs, and a relatively high likelihood of sexual relations occurring with same sex co-twins at some time, particularly in monozygotic pairs. The implications of these results for the study of the origins of sexual orientation and for twin research are discussed. \n \n I don't believe that I ignored anything. But if you were confused as to whether I was ignoring the So-called genetic topic, then after you read this post(assuming you can comprehend it) you'll see that i'm not.\n \n \nSo let's get this straight.\n \n 1) You didn't even touch my article beyond calling it \"tacky\", and then you have the gall to claim \"without all the you're wrong garbage\"... emoticon_emb\n \n 2) Your first link is dead.\n Your second link acknowledges that a genetic component exists. (didn't read it, did you...)\n Your third link pretends to reference the study that I just gave you, but FALSELY gives it a contradictory conclusion.\n\n \n You just love to hear yourself speak don't you?! Well maybe you should give yourself a rest, this much stress can't be good. I addressed these things already, if you read the earlier comments then you would know this, and you're not expecting me to reiterate it. But if you are, sorry to disappoint you but it's not happening.\n \n \n \nFrom the article:\n \"\"We found \n 52 percent of identical twin brothers of gay men also were gay, compared with \n 22 percent of fraternal twins, compared with 11 percent of genetically unrelated brothers,\" said J. Michael Bailey...\"\n \n You fail at reading comprehension.\n It was the same study, comparing IDENTICAL twin rates to FRATERNAL twin rates.\n Identical twins share an identical genetic make-up.\n Fraternal twins share a genetic make-up percentage that any two siblings would share.\n With the Identical twin rate BEING OVER DOUBLE the fraternal rate, that PROVES genetics is involved.\n \n If genetics were not involved, then the identical rate would be EQUAL to the fraternal rate.\n\n \n You are so hung up on thinking that you have it all wrapped up that you failed to realize that I must be talking about his second study, which is what I said, but you are the one having reading comprehension skills. You referred to the first study done in 1991, but if you so-called know his work, then you should know that the second study turned out to be 20% as opposed to the 50% he thought that it was when he took the gay twin study in 1991. I guess you don't know as much as you think you know.",

You come here and attempt to paint your relationship as some pure love relationship which is founded in virginal innocence.\n\n \n Virgin innocence? Sigh.. Archie what you fail to grasp is my relationship with my partner is of love. We have such strong feelings for one another and want to plan a future with a family. I do not lust after members of my same sex either. I've seen many attractive men I could have hooked up with but did not because I value my love and deeper connection with my partner more than a temporary physical attraction. Besides that's also cheating which I do not do either..\n \n \nWhat a pathetic joke as you delude and betray yourself with these self serving lies. Do you think I don't know what you participate in either alone or together as a couple in your gay bars and adult sex clubs? Do you believe that just because you attempt to sound like a loving christian, that exonerates you from the unnatural sex you participate in? You are free to lie to yourself jason, but you can't lie to me cuz I understand too well what the community you exist within consists of in practice.\n \n \n Archie if I go to a gay bar it's to dance among friends and sing Billy Joel Karaoke. Maybe a Cosmopolitan on occasion. And I have not been in a sex shop except to pick out my close friend a gag gift for his bachelor party.\n \n And Archie do not generalize all gay people as the same. Like I have pointed out before we are as diverse as strait people. Do not group me with flingers and hook ups because I'm not one of those people. What you fail to separate is your ignorance and premeditated thoughts about gay people, and just how different and diverse many gay people are as a whole.\n \n \n \n \n \nTell me again how either of these statements shows that I have condoned compromising biblical/spiritual principles for the convenience of satisfying fleshly desires? Because all you have shown in your first statement is that I haven't compromised biblical principles by condoning anything homosexual; yet I have never said that homosexuals can't repent of their predominant sin and be saved just like every other straight person.\n \n \n Archie Jesus says to confess yourself to Him and believe in His love. There are many Gay Christians in monogamous relationships raising families and being a part of their communities in a positive manner.\n \n Also Archie along with the Bible comes many many different interpretations and many many denominations. When you state biblical \"principle\" the meaning may be different to someone else or may be taken differently.\n \n \nAnd as for your second statement, you are right that I have always spoken against violence toward homosexuals just as Jesus would have condemned it. I have only told you all the truth that receiving salvation means turning away from, or repenting of that which He condemns as every other believer does when they get saved.\n\n \n Archie I wish you could open your heart and see what I see. I wish that you could walk in someone else's shoes just for a day. Maybe feel the inner conflict and deep stirring of ones self. Such is the conflict of most gay people. We have had such conflict and struggle all our lives whether with ourselves, against acts of violence, or words of cruelty. I wish Archie that you could see just how much we are willing to endure for those whom we profess to love and hold dear. Because trust me Archie it is not about sex or lust. It is about the condition of ones heart. And that is what counts.\n \n \nTo expect God to accept you in all of your homosexual sin rather than trusting Him to free you of the bondage of its hold over you just shows that your love is conditional and only skin deep. So try again to prove your accusation that I have been an inconsistent believer here in any way.\n\n \n Archie I am not judging your beliefs. Your views and your values and your convictions and stances are what make you. I cannot change your opinion or heart, only you can do that.\n \n Archie once again love is not skin deep. If it were couples would not last longer than maybe 10 years or until the next botox injection.. You refuse to acknowledge our hearts beat and our inner beings stir with purpose for those whom we call our soul mate.\n \n God accepts me as his child. He alone knows my struggle and me as a person. All through my teenage years I begged God to make me normal, to make me strait. To take away the deep feelings I felt for other guys my age. And I began to deteriorate. I began to waste away physically and spiritually.\n \n Never in my mind did I ever hear it is OK for you to love someone because God still loves you just the way you are. Had many teens heard this they would be alive today instead of in cold graves, victims of themselves and the misconceptions flung by a society that only reaction to difference with fear or walls.\n \n Archie Jesus loves all people. And I know He loves me and that my partner and I love each other and God. We do not seek special treatment we have no agenda. All we want is a chance to make a life with a family, and to have the same benefits our strait neighbors have on a day to day basis. That's it.\n \n I do not want to \"indoctrinate\" your child. I do not want to restrict anyone's free speech if they wish to speak out against homosexuals so be it. I do not desire to see Pastor's thrown in prison, or any of these other convoluted claims that have been made against Gay people.\n \n I do not need to convince anyone I am right or OK or sane. My Partner and I already know the answer as do many Americans. All we seek is a chance to make it in this world and a chance to love. And All people should have that chance without though of fear, retribution, or shame, or self hatred.",

Suffice it to say that you condemn yourself with your cheap lip service.\n SCOTLAND: HEAD OF HOMOSEXUAL YOUTH GROUP GUILTY OF CHILD SEX ABUSE\n 07/05/09 08:51\n \"For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature. 27And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.\" Romans 1:26-27\n \n This is supposed to come as a surprise.

   "Virgin innocence? Sigh.. Archie what you fail to grasp is my relationship with my partner is of love. We have such strong feelings for one another and want to plan a future with a family.\n\n \n I just have to say one thing here, and then I'll let you and \"Archie\" continue to argue. Now I'm not saying that just because someone is gay they are pedophiles, but when you say strong feelings that is when I feel I should speak on that regard. Having strong feelings does not automaticaly justify an action. I mean there are men out there that feel like just because they have strong feelings for a certain kid, that it is ok to show those feelings by sleeping with that kid. Now yes, they have strong feelings for the kid, but does it make his actions right?! No it does not. So just because you have strong feelings for someone of the same sex, does not justify the lifestyle. It just shows that you are giving way to unnatural feelings.\n \n Or how about someone having strong feeling for an animal?! It happens, there are sick people out there that have sex with animals, and feel that it is ok because they have developed strong feelings for the animal. But yet an still sane people like me and plenty others say they are sick!! Why?! Because strong feeling do not justify such an disgusting act.\n \n There are alot of people that do things because they have strong feelings, and not all of the things that people do because of these feelings are natural, nor is it healthy. Are these actions justified?! Should people just walk around and be governed by their feelings without using their brain, only working on the impluse that our feelings give us?!

I'm expecting an answer.\n\n \n \n Ok first off there are major differences between an impulse and a feeling that is shared between two other people. Specifically there are two major flaws in your argument comparing gays to those who practice bestiality and pedophilia.\n \n One, a child has not reached a certain state of maturity in mind and physicallity to realize what is going on. And it is the lack of that awareness and appearance of youth or innocense that stimulates these people who prey upon children.\n \n Secondly,an animal does not have the mental capacity to say yes or no, or realize what exactly is going on. These people who say animals love them back have no such proof, and in my opinion such acts are a form of animal abuse. \n \n In these two cases there is no REACTION. There is no sense of mutuality of feeling of connection if you will, the feeling of love. Love is not a mere one sided feeling but the combined feelings and tugging of the heart of two peoples.\n \n Animals and children simply cannot understand nor can they love back in the same regard to the other person. So saying that homosexuals and pedophiles and those who sleep with animals are all in the same cataegory is flawed.\n \n Two consenting adults be they strait or gay, and having mutual affection and attraction not only sexually, but of kindred spirits, of a deeper sense than that of carnality, that is love.\n \n The love I have for my partner is not unnatural in the slightest. Nor is it one sided. It is not wholly carnal, and not skin deep. Anyone here who has been in the euophoria of love or in a relationship, or is in a relationship or married knows of what I speak.\n \n It is the connection of two people for a deeper purpose a deeper connection that in my opinion cannot be explained in words. It's the feeling that has been sung in song for hundreds of years, the feeling that has been written in the words of poets, and is the one feeling that all of us as humans can relate and connect to.\n \n Gay people in a comitted monogamous relationship are not acting upon feelings of lust, but of a deeper connection of one another just as strait people do. The issue is of course that people do not believe we as gays are capable of such feeling or that our relationships warrant the same classification or fall into the same category as the love of strait people.\n \n Well I can humbly affirm that it is the same. Despite all the misgivings and the rhetoric and whatever else is thrown out there against gay people. We do feel. And we love. And that is the main reason why we fight.

It is so important to you militant liars to personalize our disdain for what your community represents as you demonize personally as having some personal investment in your lifestyle choices. \n \n We don't have an investment in it, I don't have any investment in it other than the fact that you are attempting to impose your morality on the rest of my society. If homosexuals just lived their lives without demanding that I know you are homosexuals and accept your homosexuality as right and normal, then we wouldn't have the conflicts we have. \n \n I mean, how many parades have you seen with groups of people carrying signs saying I'm straight and proud of it? How many straights wear T-shirts announcing their sexual proclivities as right and normal? They don't, because straight being normal is self evident to all of us and needn't be shouted from the rooftops. Not so with homosexuality since you all must wear your sexual identity on your shirt sleeve at every turn in life. You can't just be gay Matthew, you must cram it down our throats and demand we personally accept you when I'm not forced to accept any other type of individual as a practice in my everyday life.",

   "You really missed the point of my post. I never said that animals and children are able to reciprocate love. Because of the obvious reasons that you stated. I agree with you on this regard. BUT....I was not pin-pointing whether or not the strong feelings are reciprocated, rather I was looking at the fact that the feelings are un-natural. I'm sure that your partner has strong feelings for you too. But these feelings are not normal between people of the same sex, and that is why I labeled it an impulse. Because when we think on an impulse we tend to do what we feel is right, rather than looking at whether the actions we are about to take are wise, logical, or natural. So when I say impulse, I'm not talking about something that you thought of doing at the last minute, and decided to just do it. That is one aspect of an impulse, but actions without forethought can also be called an impulse.\n \n Just like people who sleep with children, or animals, they are governed by the strong feelings that they feel. Which is what I'm saying, strong feelings do not justify an act, it only gives the person the false idea of thinking that their actions are correct because their heart is telling them it is ok. Not saying that you are likened to a pedophile, or someone who practices bestiality, but your excuse amounts to the ones that someone in their shoes would use.\n \n Also, I never said that gay people do not have the tendency to love, or have feelings. Because you guys are human, with a heart that beats, and feels. All I'm saying is that your perception of things is clouded, and your outlook on the entity of love is flawed, this produces unnatural affection towards the same sex.\n \n \n \n Why is that?????! You think we are weird because we have a natural attraction to the opposite sex?! But we can't say your lifestyle makes us ill?! Hmmmm......Interesting.\n\n \n It's true that feelings don't justifiy animal sex, however, homosexuality doesn't have to be justified. The latter does create strong feelings, as does heterosexuality. All this talk of homosexuality being \"flawed\" or \"unnatural\" whatever language you want to use to mean the same thing, is just bigoted rhetoric. You have no logic or reason to support it. Matthew can thus say the same things about heterosexuality with no logic to back his opinions.",

   "This is why debating anything with you is a waste of time Matthew. You never asked me to prove that God exists at all. Here is what you said, and I quote you: \n \n \n Note the bolded, you said you wanted to know what Gods expectations are, and I showed you from His word. Whether you accept His word has nothing at all to do with the truth of it. Get it Matthew? So I repeat with the evidence you asked for in His own words.\n\n \n And you still aren't understanding you can not use the bible to prove that the bible is Gods word. You only have your belief that it is. I could quote any numerous ancient books, or any book for that matter, and claim that they are the word of God or some God. I have asked you to prove that God exists many times, you just don't pay attention. I will accept nothing less then Him coming down to earth and meeting me in person.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Really Matt? Thanks for revealing more of your homosexually induced delusions which are a result of your hetero hating phobias. You constantly prove that you have been given over to a reprobate mind and are led by this irrational hatred for anything good as you cling to that which is bad and unnatural. You see that is what reprobate means Matt, what is right is wrong to you, and what is wrong is right to you. Both you and jason have my condolences.\n\n \n I don't hate heteros I know many and several are my good friends. I don't understand why heteros need special rights.",

You are just a purveyor of lies and denials of that which everyone, even unbelievers accept as the undeniable truth. And by that I mean that the bible, aka the Old and New Testaments are the officially accepted book of the Judeo-Christian ethic and the God known as Yawheh/El-Shadai/Jehovah. So, since you didn't ask for evidence that God exists, but asked for proof that my beliefs about homosexuality reflect His beliefs accurately, then quoting His universally accepted bible is totally acceptable and valid. \n \n An example of improper evidence would be if I quoted the Koran in order to defend or justify the Judeo-Christian God's attitude regarding homosexuality. That would be a corruption of the truth.\n \n \n I don't hate heteros I know many and several are my good friends. I don't understand why heteros need special rights.\n\n \n Sure you do. The very image of us following what are natural urges which contribute to the continued propagation of the human species sickens you. Here's what you said in your simplistic way: I can not bear the thought of being assume to be hetero the thought makes me ill. You are saying here that just the thought of knowing that someone thinks you are a hetero, makes you sick. If that sentiment doesn't reflect hatred for heterosexuals, then I don't know what does.",

Therefore, when gay people seek psychiatric counseling there is no reason to attempt to counsel them to change their sexual orientation. In other words, there is no reason why a gay person should not be considered normal.\n\n \n I've already been privy to this information, and have read it thoroughly, and the reason that they wanted to put homosexuals into the mental illness category was because their actions were not normal actions. They did not know how to define it so they classed it with mental illness, but the fact that they did not find any mental illness showed that gay people are not mentally ill. Rather it shows that they chose to live their life in such a way. So just because they have run tests on gay people, and have not found any mental illness does not prove that the lifestyle is a normal one. That is just a scientific psychological analysis of the brain, nothing more. This only speaks for the brain patterns being normal. But that is because it has nothing to do with a faulty brain, rather it is a moral issue, and that cannot be categorized with a psychological test. So this really proves nothing. But it does prove what I've been saying all along, it proves that the gay LIFESTYLE is a choice. It is not because of a mental illness, and it has not proven to be genetic, so it shows that it is in fact a life choice. This is not a normal lifechoice.\n \n \n \nSo what your implying is a ludicrous statement based upon sexism? Saying I can't deal with an opposite gender so therefore I am weak? Sounds to me like you have some issues with feminism...\n\n \n Yes, that is exactly what I'm implying. What are you going to do, whip your watermelon lip-gloss at me?! I'm quite partial to cherry, strawberry if you have it.\n \n Feminism huh?! Well I've never thought of myself to be one, but since you look at it that way, don't feminists believe in womens rights?! And advocate for them?! So what exactly is wrong with that since you tend to advocate for gay rights?! So your point is?! \n \n \nAs far as your relatives being gay are any of them in a monogamous relationship? DO they have a partner? Do they have HIV? Have you ever spoke to them about the struggles about being gay? If not you are ignorant on the subject. Just because you assess even your families lives from a distance through a filtered view does not give you a better grip on the subject...\n\n \n Here is where you assume things again. You tend to think that I know nothing because I must not have any contact with my gay family. Where's that buzzer?! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! No prize for you, you lose!!\n \n Yes, My aunt was in a realtionship with her gay lover for 30 years. Her lover cheated on her and that is why they are not together. And she would keep that woman on her hip as if they were glued together. \n \n My uncle had his lover for about 15-20 years. Monogamous. They both had hiv, and I was particularly close with this uncle, he was my best friend. He told me about the struggles of being gay, and the constant struggle he had to try and change the way that he was. Sometimes he would cry and get fustrated. He talked to me all the time about it. His lover died of the desease, but he died of a massive heartattack. \n \n My cousin(male) got on the phone and cried to me for hours about coming out of the closet, and how he made the decision, to finally step out. And how hard it was.\n \n So you are wrong buddy. My family did talk to me about the struggles they had with the life choice they made. And I have a pretty good grip on it. So before you assume I don't know what I'm talking about, Pause, take a deep breath, and ask yourself, \"Is this going to come back at me?\" Hmmm.....It pays to have a clue. I suggest you get one.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \n \nPortrayed? So because I love someone and I am open and honest about my feelings I am therefore soft? So then you are saying one I am weak because your a woman and two, because I love someone... Because I am open and honest about this issue to give a broader perspective.\n\n \n No, I don't think you're weak because I'm a woman. Your weak because you fall short of the expectations of what a man is supposed to be.(Sorry, but I have to be truthful.) Loving someone is not a bad thing, it is how you handle that love that makes you strong or weak. The choice is yours.\n \n \nI honestly think you have some serious issues regarding feminism and even about dealing with other peoples relationships. I painted myself in no such way and was showing how wonderful it is to be with someone who I do love. Maybe you have never been in love or maybe your bitter over something that has to do with relationships and cannot stand others being in one let alone gay people...\n\n \n I'm far from the bitter type. I have men falling all over me, at any given time of the day. All I have to do is pick and choose which one I like and he'll do what I say. And yes I've been in love, but I was in control of my feelings and thoughts and never let myself run with impulses like some do. Love, is a good thing, but there is a thin line between being in love, and being a fool in love. People should be aware of the difference. I never bitter about other people's relationships, let alone be envious of a gay relationship. Sorry buddy but is it's not my thing, then why be upset over it?emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI read this and kind of did a double take. This is the third time you've made your gender known and made it a point to place yet another comment of supreme feminism into play.. Do you not think I respect Women and have not debated with some before?\n\n \n Whether you repect women in a debate or not is not relevant to me. \n \n \nI think your taking this debate the wrong way, and I still hold by my statements that you are uncouth especially since you revealed underlying conflict with gender identity in your posts...\n\n \n You feel that I'm uncouth?! Then that is your opinion. But the fact that you have a problem that I made known that I'm a female is stunning to me. Because how many times did you make known that you are in love, and how many love rants did you do about your relationship with your partner. Would it be fair for me to assume that you are insecure about your relationship, and your lifestyle, and that is why you have to constantly defend it, and say over and over again how much you are in love?! You are saying I have a conflict with my gender?! Should I say you have a conflict with your relationship, and your gender?! I'm quite clear on my gender, and love who I' am. But it is you with the gender issues since you are the one wearing watermelon lip-gloss, and dating men, these are things women do. So who really has the gender issues here?!\n \n \n \nHave I had a temper tantrum? Was I kicking and screaming in my chair like a toddler? Actually no. My response was in turn due to your misconceived understanding of my posts and for some odd reason has now turned into a sexism issue with you...\n\n \n I really don't know what you did in your chair while reading my posts, and that really does not concern me. But I will say this, your long winded pleas for understanding that you've been posting up is a mild tantrum. Tantrums come in many forms. And you have whined on here a number of times. As far as sexism goes, if you call a heterosexual female with low tolerance for the kind of tacky debate strategy that you've been putting out sexist, then I guess you might be right. Can't handle the heat? Get out the kitchen.emoticon_cool",

   "I already know all of this. They have dreams and hopes, just like everyone else, blah, blah, blah,............. \n \n \n \n I've already been privy to this information, and have read it thoroughly, and the reason that they wanted to put homosexuals into the mental illness category was because their actions were not normal actions. They did not know how to define it so they classed it with mental illness, but the fact that they did not find any mental illness showed that gay people are not mentally ill. Rather it shows that they chose to live their life in such a way. So just because they have run tests on gay people, and have not found any mental illness does not prove that the lifestyle is a normal one. That is just a scientific psychological analysis of the brain, nothing more. This only speaks for the brain patterns being normal. But that is because it has nothing to do with a faulty brain, rather it is a moral issue, and that cannot be categorized with a psychological test. So this really proves nothing. But it does prove what I've been saying all along, it proves that the gay LIFESTYLE is a choice. It is not because of a mental illness, and it has not proven to be genetic, so it shows that it is in fact a life choice.

And she would keep that woman on her hip as if they were glued together. \n \n My uncle had his lover for about 15-20 years. Monogamous. They both had hiv, and I was particularly close with this uncle, he was my best friend. He told me about the struggles of being gay, and the constant struggle he had to try and change the way that he was. Sometimes he would cry and get fustrated. He talked to me all the time about it. His lover died of the desease, but he died of a massive heartattack. \n \n My cousin(male) got on the phone and cried to me for hours about coming out of the closet, and how he made the decision, to finally step out.

   "Archangel, this is silly. It's like me saying you are culpable for the Ku Klux Klan because the founders were Christians like yourself and your community.\n\n \n An absolutely ridiculous assumption on your part Jake. The founders of the KKK were nothing like the kind of christian I represent. They used the bible as a weapon for justification to oppress and enslave a people. A total corruption of what Jesus or His christianity really stands for in reality. So I harbor no guilt or kinship with them at all. \n \n \nThere is plenty of pedophilia in the heterosexual community, as shown in the \"heterosexual menace\" thread. That doesn't tie heterosexuality to pedophilia.\n\n \n Ahh, the old your side does it too argument. Feel free to show where I have ever argued that it is non existent in the hetero community, if you can. I would love to see evidence of that. As for the \"heterosexual menace\" thread, let's look at the first example which you rely on in order to disseminate the difference between straight and gay pedophilia. \n \n Notice they were a divorced couple who sent photos of them molesting a little \"GIRL\", not a little boy. They are definitely straight pedophiles. But then we can look at the Priest molestation history in the catholic church which went on for many many decades, if not potentially for centuries. What is so telling about literally 99% of all of those occurrences is that the victims were boys. \n \n But you apologists for homosexuality want it both ways so you will claim that no matter what sex the child is, the offender must be straight, which we know is complete balderdash. So if we compare the number of revealed instances of little girls getting sexually abused compared to little boys, and consider that heterosexuals make up 96-98% of the population and homosexuals between 2 and 4% of it, then statistically, based on the size of our respective communities and the number of victims in each gender, then homosexual pedophelia is epidemic compared to straight pedophelia.\n \n As support for my assertion, I submit the following, testimony from a catholic priest. And remember, these are insiders within the catholic church making these admissions, not biased outsiders who have some imaginary grudge against the church.\n On Homosexuals in the Catholic Priesthood\n Archbishop Oscar Hugh Lipscomb Supportive of Pedophile Priests\n \n Life Enterprises Unlimited - Site Map - Master Index\n \n In a conversation with a well qualified school teacher who is a convert to Catholicism, she stated that she believes that as many as 75% of priests may be homosexual. Later, in consideration of what she had said, I reflected upon a number of priests in the archdiocese and had to admit the possibility that a high percentage of them might at least be homosexually oriented. I told her that I had considered the possibility that 40% of priests might be homosexual but found it hard to believe that the numbers she suggested could be correct. In using the term homosexual I am not distinguishing between those who are chaste and those who are active / practicing homosexuals.\n \n Shortly after ordination I had reflected that it would be terrible that if as many as 2% of priests were homosexual. Perhaps a year later in a conversation with a highly placed priest of the archdiocese he stated that approximately 35% of priests were homosexuals. It was most disconcerting to read the following article in which Fr. Cozzens, the head of a Catholic seminary, says that estimates range as high as 60% of American priests are homosexual.\n \n Unfortunately the article states that, \"Cozzens is not against ordaining gay men, and concedes some effective bishops and even some popes may have been gay.\"\n \n I totally disagree with his position of not being against ordaining gay men. I personally believe that it should be incorporated into the Code of Canon Law that homosexual orientation invalidates ordination, that is, makes homosexual orientation a diriment impediment to ordination. I further believe that an active homosexual cleric or religious (including pedophiles) should incur a totally reserved automatic excommunication that remains unforgivable while remaining in such position. Such sin would be a permanent impediment in regard to returning to religious life.\n \n While the expulsion of active homosexuals would possibly, even probably, cause a significant temporary decline in the number of available priests, I believe that in the long run the Church would have a great increase in vocations with a correspondingly healthier priesthood and consequently a morally healthier Church and world.\n \n Father David C. Trosch\n August 18, 2000\n Feast of St. Jane Frances de ChantalHomosexuality Among Catholic Priests\n \n AND HERE:\n \n Gays and Lesbians Catholic Homosexual Activity",

Have you really researched all of the results he has documented in his 25 years of research into the subject of gay sexual molestation? Reisman relies on his work in documenting her study. Here's the link and an excerpt for your consideration. \n Homosexual political organizations have gone into overdrive, lobbying and threatening corporate sponsors to discontinue their support; President Clinton has been urged to step down as honorary president of BSA; a few members of Congress even tried -- unsuccessfully -- to revoke the organization's honorary charter. And Clinton even signed an executive order, which was followed in lockstep by a Justice Department memo designed to evict the Boy Scouts from federal lands and facilities -- on the grounds that the organization illegally discriminates against homosexuals. All this, in spite of the Supreme Court's favorable decision three months earlier.\n \n Although homosexual activists claim they are no more likely to sexually molest children than heterosexuals are, Reisman says research proves the opposite.\n \n \"They're claiming that homosexuals are not looking to have sex with boys, yet you have this massive number of boys out there prostituting themselves. And how do you have all these Internet sites if they're not looking for boys? This is not heterosexual. By definition, when you're having sex with someone of your own sex, that's homosexual,\" Reisman said.\n \n Based on data from a study of non-incarcerated child sex offenders, Gene G. Abel, M.D., has found that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring five times greater than the molestation of girls.\"\n \n A professor of psychiatry who has taught at several medical schools, including Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Abel is currently affiliated with Emory University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine. He has been a research scientist in the field of sexual violence for 25 years, and the National Institute of Mental Health has awarded him funding for six long-term studies to investigate sexual violence and to design new ways to stop it.\n \n Specifically, Abel's report provides data to show that, on average, 150.2 boys are molested per homosexual pedophile offender, whereas only 19.8 girls are molested per heterosexual pedophile offender. Incredibly, homosexual offenders admitted between 23.4 and 281.7 acts of molesting boys.\n \n [Archangel] As you can see, Abel comes to the same conclusions as the point I made in the quoted post above regarding the percentages of abusers within the respective segments of the population. (Note the bolded in the post above:)\n \n Reisman's research in \"Crafting 'Gay' Children\" determined that the total population of homosexual men in America was no more than 2 million in 1991. During the same year, \"U.S. Population, Statistical Abstracts\" show that 6-8 million boys under age 18 had been sexually abused at some time prior to age 18.\n \n Meanwhile, the population of heterosexual men in the U.S. was approximately 86-88 million in 1991, and an estimated eight million girls had been sexually abused at some time prior to age 18.\n \n Based on the government's own statistics -- the \"Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1992, Data on Boys and Girls,\" published by the U.S. Commerce Department -- Reisman cited the following for that year:\n \n Of 86 - 88 million heterosexual men, 9 percent of them victimized 8 million girls under age 18, which constitutes 25 percent of all girls.\n An uncertain percentage of the estimated 2 million homosexual men victimized 6-8 million boys, under age 18, amounting to 17 - 24 percent of all boys.\n Therefore, considered in the aggregate, 3 to 4 boys are sexually molested per homosexual adult male.\n Only .09 girls are sexually molested per heterosexual adult male, which is to say that, on average, 1 in 11 heterosexual males victimizes a girl under 18.\n Within the child protection establishment, sexual abuse is defined simply as an adult having sex with a juvenile under age 18 -- whether \"consensual\" or not. When dealing with children, \"consensual\" is not the legitimizing criterion it is for adults. Indeed, almost invariably, sexual predators defend their \"loving\" physical relationships with children as being \"consensual,\" when in reality the seduction and manipulation of children -- resulting in their \"consent\" -- is both an art form and the stock in trade of pedophiles.\n The Simon and Schuster book \"Homosexualities,\" by Alan Bell, reports that 25 percent of homosexual men admit to having had sex with boys who are 16 or under.\n \n Further corroborating this well-hidden homosexual proclivity for targeting younger males are the following findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n \n 50 percent of male AIDS victims reported having sex with an adult male by the age of 16.\n 20 percent of male AIDS victims had sex with an adult male by age 10.\n \"The Advocate,\" a popular homosexual newsmagazine, conducted a survey of its readers. Of the 2,500 responses obtained, 21 percent admitted that an adult man committed a sexual act with them by the time they were 15.\n 'The ideal situation' Boy Scout camping trips provide a perfect setting for homosexuals to pursue their forbidden desires, according to Reisman, who added that any organization that provides opportunities for homosexuals to spend time with young boys will become a magnet for homosexual child molesters.\n \n In fact, Justice Ignazio Ruvolo of the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco recently ruled that the Boy Scouts of America should be held responsible for a Southern California scout's sexual molestation at the hands of a pedophile scout leader. Why? In making his case that the Scouting organization -- despite a comprehensive national program to prevent sexual abuse -- should have done even more to protect kids from pedophiles, the judge said, \"It should be reasonably foreseeable to the Scouts that a child participating in Scouting might fall prey to a sexual predator.\"\n \n Attorney Charles A. Bonner, representing the victim who had been molested back in 1991 by his assistant scoutmaster, Jorge Paz, was even more direct. He said BSA national leaders know that \"the organization attracts pedophiles like a magnet attracts metal.\"\n \n Of all the various youth groups today, \"the Boy Scouts provide the ideal situation\" for men to find young boys to molest, according to Reisman.\n \n The BSA does all it can to protect boys from child molesters, says Shields. Every \"Boy Scout Manual\" comes with an insert about child abuse placed in the front. Troops have a video to show to boys, entitled, \"A Time to Tell,\" which teaches boys to recognize attempts to sexually molest them, to resist the attempt and report the offender.Rape of a sacred trust\n \n Please feel free to point to an equally large girls club on par with the BSA which has a history of attracting straight pedophiles who target little girls for abuse. I would love to see documented evidence that the straight majority has similar problems anywhere in society rather than segregated incidents of opportunity by individuals.",

But going back to my original challenge, feel free to post evidence of ongoing campaigns by any major gay organizations documenting them actually fighting against a culture of endorsing sex with boys.\n \n And here's more that reveals that this practice is happening right out in the open in our school systems. It is absolutely undeniable and is being financed by certain states. Here's an excerpt:\n Massachusetts Dept. of Public Health funding homosexual / transgender movement in schools\n To make up for GLBT Youth Commission funding cuts during budget crisis\n \n Dec. 19, 2008\n The madness continues. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) is giving full support to the homosexual / transgender movement in Massachusetts schools, DPH Commissioner John Auerbach (who is \"married\" to another man) told the taxpayer-funded Commission on Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Bisexual Youth at their meeting on Dec. 15 at New Mission High School in Roxbury.\n \n \n We were there, too. The New Mission High School in Roxbury (which houses grades 1-12), where the Massachusetts Commission on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth met on Monday evening, Dec. 15.\n \n \n The DPH has given $150,000 of its budgeted money to the Massachusetts Commission on Gay Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender (GLBT) Youth to make up for the $150,000 which the Governor cut from the Commission's $850,000 budget in October because of the massive budget crisis in Massachusetts. In other words, money which was meant for public health is now being diverted by the DPH to homosexual programs in the schools. \n \n The Mass. Dept. of Public Health will also begin pushing acceptance of \"transgenderism\" and will even begin bringing transgender people into its leadership roles.\n \n (Ironically, less than a month ago the DPH issued a report linking homosexuality with health problems and destructive behavior.)\n \n This was all revealed at the public meeting of the Mass. GLBT Commission last Monday evening, Dec. 15. The meeting was held at the New Mission High School in Roxbury, a building which includes grades K-12. (As we've reported in the past, this public Commission on GLBT Youth is made up of some of the most radical homosexual and transgender activists in the state, and uses hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money to push aggressive homosexual clubs and programs into the public schools, grades K-12. The Roxbury school has a robust gay-straight-alliance club run by a very aggressive homosexual activist.)Mass. DPH funding homosexual programs in schools\n \n Isn't this strange Jason? GLBT YOUTH, a dedicated separate division of GLBT is directly receiving these funds and working with youth in order to properly orient them to accept homosexuality as normal. So may I assume you will now condemn them and that your moral sensibilities are totally and completely offended? ",

You attempt to bridge or put into the same category the same old tired stigmas that gays and pedophiles belong in the same group when in fact, their is a myriad of differences that you refuse to acknowledge.\n \n For one a child is and I repeat is NOT consenting to the sexual advances of a pedophile. These people prey upon the innocence and ignorance of children for their own means and is in now way a form of love, since love is a consenting display of affection between two peoples of sexual maturity.\n \n Gay people are consenting and of the legal age. In turn as well, they are also dynamic, diverse peoples who wish nothing more than to express their mutual love of one another.\n \n Easy what I meant with in the faith is you turn a blind eye to those whom you deem unworthy or a menace in your eyes. You refuse to see the plights and the spiritual starvation in the Gay community. Many of us have been raised in spiritual nurturing from an early age.\n \n Sadly many of us including myself felt rejected by God and separated from His grace. Even now at such colleges as BYU students can be kicked out for just being Gay or even supporting Gay Rights.\n \n What I am getting to is that sadly a growing trend is occurring within the community where they abandon their faith all together because they feel that God cannot love them, or that the church in general has cast them out. In your myriad of posts you have proved such a thing!\n \n You have cast us out from your hearts and have cast us out from your minds. Christ has not nor will He cast us out. And it is my prayer that more and more LGBT peoples will realize that it is not God or the faith that is the issue.\n \n It is ignorance and fear and stigma bred through false assumption of us. I see this as an escalating issue because more and more LGBT teen suicides come from faith based homes where their families, friends, and church all but shun them. Their entire lives, support structure collapses and thus, these young minds and sensitive youth are crushed to the point of despair.\n \n Either that person will remain a cynical and critical person against faith, or will end up taking their own lives, being consumed by their own inner demons bred by false assumption and unneeded hate and scorn from others.\n \n Or, they will find Christ like I and many have re-found.

   "You are more than uncouth. You are rude and insulting and other words I shouldn't use because the you'll quote me and said 'Quack hurt my feelings' when every post you make I find offensive and insulting and a shame to the human race and straight population. I don't bother reading your posts anymore since it's not worth the ignorance.\n \n And FYI, I'm very much a woman and jason and I have no issues with each other. The only issues there is are the ones you make up in your deluded mind. \n \n I also find it disgusting that your family told you of their struggles but you are so lost in your fear that you don't care. My family is full of craziness and pain, but if I find out any of them were insulted then I will always go to the mat for them.\n\n \n I'm back from my vacation and ready to answer the many ludicrous statements that were made in my absents. I really don't care whether you think that I'm rude and insulting. I don't measure my self wroth by people on the web. So you are in no way shaming me, nor are you making me feel like I should change, are go back on anything that I've said.\n \n So you don't want to read my post?! That really does not concern me in any way. What?! I should go off crying because you don't want to read my posts?! I agree, if you don't like what I'm saying, then don't annoy yourself by reading it. Because I'm not going to change what I've said or my viewpoints. So don't annoy yourself because of something that you cannot change.emoticon_xgood\n \n As far as my family goes, I don't care for their lifestyle, but I will always defend them because they are my family. Yes, I did take the time to console my cousin, and uncle, because I love them. But I will never agree with their lifestyle. So you know nothing about me. You cannot say that I don't care just because I refuse to condone, and go along with the gay lifestyle just because some of my family choose to live that life. And I do not fear the gay lifestyle, I loathe it. There is a difference.\n \n And as far as you hurting my feelings, don't flatter yourself honey, I can take anything you bring. The only people that may be able to hurt my feelings, is people I care about, and you're not on the list. So you don't hold that much weight with me. So now who has a deluded mind?emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nThere are a myriad of factors determining a persons sexuality yet I high;y doubt you take them into consideration since you scream \"morality\" and \"choice\". I assume that all those gay teenagers that committed suicide had a \"lifechoice\" as well right?\n\n \n The fact that they commited suicide is sad. But they made a choice and could not deal with the choice that they made. Throwing up teen suicide will not change my views, nor will it make me side with you.\n \n \nI love how people can marginalize and take lightly such matters especially since you have no idea what some of these people have gone through on a day to day basis. Do not throw out your opinion as \"fact\" when you have not seen the evidence suggesting otherwise that being gay is not a choice.\n\n \n I never threw out my opinion as a fact. You said that. You just can't deal with what I'm saying so you tend to twist my stand and try to say that I'm trying to make it a fact. These are my opinions, but certain things are facts. Like gayness not being genetic, and gay lifestyle is a choice. If you can't deal with that then don't keep responding to me, because you are going to hear the same reasoning. Deal with it or don't, trust me it won't bother me. \n \n \nMy point being is you have a serious issue with the male gender for whatever reason. And sorry I don't wear lip gloss hun I don't do drag it's not my scene. Another typical gay slur.... shows where your morals truly lie doesn't it?\n\n \n Oh you don't?! Well let me refreash your memory.\n \n\n It's ok. Not my fault I like watermelon flavored chapstick.\n\n \n Your words not mine. OOPS!! My bad that it was chap stick and not lip-gloss, which is meant for the same thing. Not many men walk around with watermelon chap stick on their lips. I can only go by what you said, and you said yourself you wear the stuff. Sorry I caught you in a lie hun.emoticon_xgood Isn't lying morally wrong?! I think it is. Also, I don't have a problem with men, just gay lifestyle. Which is what I find funny, a homosexual is counseling me on morals. This is really a funny, yet sad phenomenon.\n \n \n \nI have one and seeing that these people your own flesh and blood confided in you and trusted you should give you even more of a reason to champion for equal rights and stop letting your own inner bitter prejudices consume you... I doubt any of your family members would say being Gay is a choice...\n\n \n I don't have to champion for a lifestyle I don't agree with just because my family is involved in it. My uncle(the one that is straight) Likes to deal drugs, and get locked up. Should I advocate for that lifestyle as well?! I don't have to jion the band wagon just because they want to. I love them, not their lifestyle. I support them when they are weak, but I won't support what they do. PERIOD! I'm not bitter, I just have my own views, just like anyone else and I will not change them. \n \n \n \n \nSo because I'm a veteran, I volunteered to possibly go die for my country, I come back to take on the responsibilities of my family and just because I am in love with my partner thus cancel all of that out right? You got your head screwed on backwards...\n\n \n Yeah. It cancelled it out when you decided to bend over frontwards, and backwards for the local men. Plus, you said possibly, did you actually go?! Or did you just volunteer and never was shipped out?! Because just volunteering means nothing.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nSo basically your a woman that looks out for numero uno only, and then you like to take advantage of others in some way... Pick and choose hmm? What was that whole deal about morality? Shows where your loyalities truly lie..\n \n I think I am beginning to understand you now.... Selfish, Misguided, and ill informed. A person that cares nothing for the troubles of others.\n\n \n Who said anything about taking advantage of others?! If I don't like a guy I'm not going to go bed him down just so that I don't hurt his feelings. I'm going to turn him down. Just because I get offers doesn't mean I'm going to except them. I have standards, and any women with class would pick and choose wisely who they choose to be their man. Unless I'm to assume that you slept with a lot of different men so that you don't hurt their feelings?! What is that tool that people use to garden?! Let me not say it.....emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Selfish and misguided?! WOW!! Now you made me cry! Not. You don't even know me, so I could care less what you thought. \n \n \nAnother typical gay slur... And no now I understand you better. Your a selfish greedy woman who is comfortable ensnaring others in the webs she spins to have her own needs served....\n \n I have no issues with my relationship and I am in no need to defend it especially from someone as selfish and self consuming as yourself. Oh and FYI I have no gender issues...\n\n \n Oh No! Do I see someone having a queen moment?! You know nothing about me to try and slash my character, with descriptions that don't even fit. And how am I greedy, honey?! Ensnaring?! OOOH...you must really be intimidated by me. Because from this post you feel ensnared, and violated. LOL!! This is how people get when they are unnecessary, and ignorant. You&#8217;re ignorant because you chose to throw around personal insults, when I stuck to only stating things about the gay lifestyle. But if you want to result in name calling, I guess I can stoop to your level and call you a weak sissy?!\n \n If you didn't want to defend your lifestyle then why are you here on a gay rights debate forum?! Who has their head on backwards, and is misguided now?!emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \nYes and it is such interpretation of God and His word that has led to a divide in this country and a division amongst us all. Instead of being inclusive and accepting you have pushed gays and lesbians out of faith and back into the closet.\n \n I have dealt with so many gay bloggers like Matt who are opposed to religion period. Such an issue to me is alarming because these people feel not only rejected by God's children but by God Himself. Such loathing and bitterness cannot continue.\n\n \n Why is everyone who does not agree with you bitter?! You are childish, and whiny. You can't take people disagreeing with you, so all of a sudden everyone is bitter. Get a life!emoticon_rolleyes",

When we arrived in our home port of Norfolk I went on Christmas leave came back and that's when the incident occurred.\n \n After I was honorably discharged eight months later on a shore command. If I were not attacked I was scheduled to go on deployment that February. But I don't need to answer to you or provide you with more ammo to shoot others down with so I'll leave it at that.\n\n \n I don't care if you put me on ignore. But this is the thing, it sounds more like you did alot of training, and no actual fighting. So where was the actual experience you so quickly said you had? Training and actual field experience is two different things. And you don't want to debate any longer because you lost. Period.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "JP how would my partner and I getting married in our own private ceremony destroy the sancitity of your marriage? I'm not trying to be rude I\"m just asking in a general question..\n \n I mean over 1200 rights to couples are defined by the word marriage alone! And JP I hate to be brash but the \"fringe\" minority you speak of is still human beings with hearts hopes and dreams including myself...\n \n Is not the heart stronger than fear? Mass. has already been initiating licenses for nearly five years now.. And none of the strait people have been affected or had their marriages diminished by gays getting married...\n \n I only ask that you look at the love you have for your wife and try and see that we as Gay monogamous couples have the same devotion, compassion, and love for one another. That I can assure you of..\n\n \n JJ, you've always been civil to me and I've reciprocated in kind, so I didn't take your comments as being rude.. I've stated before that marriage, to me, is a sacred establishment between God, man and woman. It's a desecration of the word marriage to redefine it to include what is seen by Christians as an \"unholy\" union. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not religious enough to declare that you'll burn in Hell because of it, I'm just letting you know why I don't support the concept of gay marriage. \n Now, I'm willing to compromise and have stated that I favor civil unions for gays. The pushback I always hear is that civil unions aren't acceptable because they don't grant the same rights and privileges as marriage. To that I say \"fix the civil union laws then, don't throw traditional marriage out because current civil union laws suck.\" I'm OK with adding the words \"and civil unions\" wherever it says \"married\" in our laws. If that isn't enough of a compromise than I say TFB. \n \n \nYou are equating what you called your \"personal\" belief in a god with the morality we all must live by. I agree that secular laws should be based on a shared morality, but why your personal beliefs? You have defined marriage as a religious institution that gets to exclude who it likes based on your personal beliefs about that religion. I did not suggest destroying something - I submit that it logically follows that must be your position unless you allow your personal religious beliefs to define the law.\n\n \n When the majority of voters hold a particular moral position, then it is NOT my \"personal belief\", but rather the prevailing societal belief. And as long as laws are made based on society's position on an issue and it is that society that pays the bills, I see no problem with it. \n \n \nI'd be interested in seeing ANY example of a voter that doesn't vote according to their \"personal beliefs.\" After all that's the way it's supposed to work.\n\n \n I always thought so, too.emoticon_confused",

   "It's not about voting on personal beliefs. It's about making law of the land based upon a single person's religious interpretation of a civil law.\n\n \n So then are you only referring specifically to Congress or state legislatures creating bills and and presidents signing them? Because that's how 'law of the land' is made. Legislators should work for a bill that represents their voting constituents. That the morality behind said law happens to come from religion can't be a preventative measure for said law being created.\n Voters vote for candidates who create those laws (and sometimes ballot initiatives) based on whatever morality they dang well want. It doesn't matter if it's based on religion, secularism, atheism, or 'hoola-hoopingism'. that's the voters' prerogative. Some folks always try to preach that law can't be made based on religious interpretation. Bull. There's no way to prevent it, nor should it BE prevented. Religion deserves no less a place in the marketplace of ideas and morality than anything else. If you feel your moral basis is better, then by all means fight for it. But don't try and mis-use Separation of Church and State by asserting that religious people or their views can't play just a much a role in democracy than anything else. Morality, which motivates law, may come from any number of sources, religion included. The right to be free from religion doesn't mean (or shouldn't, anyway) that you get to stop law based on your opinion of its supporters' influences.\n \n Even the very controversial \"Lemon Test\", which is the supposed legal precedent left-wingers often try to invoke, doesn't prevent religion as a basis for any law. It just says it has to have a secular purpose, that it can't advance religion, and that it can't represent excessive entaglement. (How's that last one for being about as iffy and subjective as possible?) So if a legislator supports an anti-stealing law simply because his-Bible-told-him-so, there's not a dang thing you can do about it. Nor can you stop voters from doing so.\n Welcome to democracy and freedom.",

So just hearing the version from a homosexual who is proven to be biased and dishonest in their objectivity leaves me unsure of what part of his testimony to believe, if any of it.\n \n\n \n You got to be ffing kidding me man... Made a pass? How in the hell would I get the balls to make a pass at one of them when one, half of them had wives and families of their own so I'm not a strait chaser, and two I wasn't out to myself at the time! I was still in the closet and refused to acknowledge to myself I was gay...\n \n As far as teaching me a lesson I taught one of those bastards a lesson he'll never forget, not all XXXXXXX are weak. He had to spend the next few months drinking through a straw....\n \n The reasoning behind it is because they thought me and another sailor had a thing going on so it XXXXXX them off. Only reason they went after me and not him is cause he was an E-5 and they had access to where I lived cause I bunked in the same berthing with them.\n \n I love how you try to make up XXXX in your mind as to the reasons why.. Why don't you go ask them Archie? I'm sure one of them is still in Leavenworth busting rocks on Christmas....",

   "I second that, Archie! As Romans 1:26-27 states God has turned them over to a deranged, Sodom and Gomorrah mindset.\n\n \n So now your blaming God for me being Gay? Jee man your story always changes as to why.... SO in other words all gays are inhospitable and full of pride? aka arrogance? cause that's the real reason behind S and G. But hey what do I know I just read my Bible and research it what do I know?",
