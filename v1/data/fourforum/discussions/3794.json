   "In the children's book, The Blind Men and the Elephant, Lillian Quigley retells the ancient fable of six blind men who visit the palace of the Rajah and encounter an elephant for the first time. As each touches the animal with his hands, he announces his discoveries.\n The first blind man put out his hand and touched the side of the elephant. \"How smooth! An elephant is like a wall.\" The second blind man put out his hand and touched the trunk of the elephant. \"How round! An elephant is like a snake.\" The third blind man put out his hand and touched the tusk of the elephant. \"How sharp! An elephant is like a spear.\" The fourth blind man put out his hand and touched the leg of the elephant. \"How tall! An elephant is like a tree.\" The fifth blind man reached out his hand and touched the ear of the elephant. \"How wide! An elephant is like a fan.\" The sixth blind man put out his hand and touched the tail of the elephant. \"How thin! An elephant is like a rope.\"\n \n As the story goes, an argument quickly ensued, each blind man thinking his own perception of the elephant was the correct one. The Rajah, awakened by the commotion, called out from the balcony. \"The elephant is a big animal,\" he said. \"Each man touched only one part. You must put all the parts together to find out what an elephant is like.\"\n \n Enlightened by the Rajah's wisdom, the blind men reached agreement. \"Each one of us knows only a part. To find out the whole truth we must put all the parts together.\"\n \n The religious application holds that every faith represents just one part of a larger truth about God. Each has only a piece of the truth, ultimately leading to God by different routes. Advocates of Eastern religions are fond of quoting this fable.\n \n Discuss among yourselves!\n \n Source: Lillian Quigley, The Blind Men and the Elephant (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959). Possible original sources of the story are the Jataka Tales, a collection of Buddhist birth stories, and the Pancatantra Stories, Hindu religious instruction fables.",

Coherance? What is the truth assertion being made in the fable?\n \n In my opinion, (IMO), the first serious limitation is that even though the men are blind, the elephant isn't necessarily mute. This is a factor the illustration doesn't allow for: What if the elephant [God] speaks?",

   "Truth by definition is exclusive. \n \n Everything cannot be true - including assertions about who God is, or is not.\n \n If everything is true, then nothing is false. If nothing is false then it would also be true to say everything is false. We cannot have it both ways. One should not be surprised at the claims of exclusivity by all the Religions.\n \n The reality is that even those who deny truth&#8217;s exclusivity, in effect, exclude those who do not deny it. The truth quickly emerges. The law of non-contradiction does apply to reality. We mean by that, that two contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense.\n \n To deny the law of non-contradiction is to affirm it at the same time. You may as well talk about a one-ended stick as talk about truth being all-inclusive.",

   "Jesus made many bold Truth claims:\n \n Jesus said, \n \n I AM the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6) \n \n And again, Jesus said, \n \n Everyone on the side of truth listens to me. (John 18:37) \n \n Quote:\n \n \"At the heart of every major religion is a leading exponent. As the exposition is studied something very significant emerges. There comes a bifurcation, or a distinction, between the person and the teaching. Mohammed to the Koran. Buddha to the Noble Path. Krishna to the object lessons. Zoroaster to his ethics. \n \n Whatever we may make of their claims, one reality is inescapable. They are teachers who point to their teaching or show some particular way. In all of these, there emerges an instruction, a way of living. It is not Zoroaster to whom you turn. It is Zoroaster to whom you listen. It is not Buddha who delivers you, it is his &#8220;Noble Truths&#8221; that instruct you. It is not Mohammed who transforms you, it is the beauty of the Koran that woos you. \n \n By contrast, Jesus did not only teach or point or expound on His message. Jesus is identical with His message. \n \n &#8220;In Him, dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; \n \n He did not just proclaim the truth. He said, \n \n &#8220;I am the Truth.&#8221;\n \n He did not just show a way. He said, \n \n &#8220;I am the Way.&#8221;\n \n He did not just open up vistas. He said, \n \n &#8220;I am the door.&#8221; \n \n &#8220;I am the Good Shepherd.&#8221; \n \n &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.&#8221; \n \n &#8220;I am the I AM!&#8221; \n \n In Him is not just an offer of life&#8217;s bread.

   "I'd need to know your definition of God, and truth, to have any understanding of what it is that's supposed to say.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Did the blind men \"know\" what an Elephant was?\n \n Are we blind, or should we listen to what the blind men have said about this so called Elephant?\n \n Does God speak to us? Or, has God revealed himself, and made himself known?\n \n When you hear the word God, what comes to your mind?\n \n Warm feelings? Theological terms? Confusion? Nothing? No doubt, our reactions are very diverse to this simple word. This diversity of reaction issues, at least partially, from the diversity of definitions of the term. In our pluralistic age there is no generally accepted definition of this incredibly important word. So when someone asks, \"Does God exist?\" it is right to reply, \"What do you mean by God?\" This question is of utmost importance, and so deserves our careful attention. Blithely accepting dogma or anti-dogma on this question serves no one. So allow me to ask this all-important question of you: what does God mean to you? \n \n To Aristotle, the ancient philosopher, God meant the Unmoved mover who is the starting point of the universe. God, for him, was an impersonal force, the eternal hinge about which the universe swings. God then is a postulate and not a person. Is that what God means to you? Is He merely a principle you posit to make your world make more sense?\n \n In stark contrast to Aristotle is the polytheist who believes God to be immanently human, maybe even overly so. Here, God, or the gods, means somebody like you or me except with a lot of power, who also happens to be immortal. I have always felt that this turns the transcendent into either a wish-receptacle or a big-bully in the sky to appease. Is this what God means to you? Is God just a source of power that you worship when you want to get some of his power? Do your sacrifices only aim at currying the favor of God?\n \n Many anthropologists explain away such notions of the divine as mere anthropomorphic projections &#8211; a making of God in human image. \n \n The Bible radically reverses this equation. It states that we, humans, are made in God&#8217;s image. God is not a really big man in the sky. More accurately, we are like little gods here on earth. We are fashioned in his image. We are creative, relational, spiritual, moral, love-seeking, free. In a word, we are persons. This is the fingerprint of the divine in our nature. Yes, the Bible also tells of our Fall, which we see evidence for everyday, but the image of God in us is not completely defaced. \n \n So when you think of God, realize He is not an impersonal force, nor is He just a big guy in the sky. God is a person, the ultimate Person. Open yourself to Him, and He will open Himself to you.\n \n Source:: Click Here",
