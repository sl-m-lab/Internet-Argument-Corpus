After Canada refused to become a member of 'The Coalition of the Willing' to invade and occupy a third tier sovereign nation (Iraq), the US began throwing seemingly endless trade obstacles and tariffs in front of Canada, much like a spoiled child not having its way. \n \n All of which backfired, driving US consumer commodity prices through the roof, further infuriating current US administration without deriving what it considered 'proper respect' for US policy as Canada took the lumps without caving in to Bush's demands. It didn't help the administration's ego when Canadian producers were being called to the US for shale oil extraction, US production and technology expertise having gone downhill ever since oil was deregulated here.\n \n The US dislikes nations it can't buy or intimidate. We're seemingly stuck in a delusional frame of mind from when we were the largest creditor nation in the world and most other nations heeded our every beck and call due to the then powerful dollar. Our last face card is our military might and even that hasn't been a shining example of displayed power when one looks at Afghanistan and Iraq. Other nations can now smell and see our fear.

   "@ Billsco\n \n Unless that foreign intervention undertaken by the US is inside Canadian borders, I don`t see how this relates to Canadian soverignity.\n \n Wether US foreign interventions is in the interest of Canada is quite hard to say. I guess it depends on what kind of foreign interventions the US will undertake. If it means that US will need to divert more of their resources to catastrophe aid, I don`t really see how Canadas interests are hurt. If it means that the US will flatten the middle east and further disrupt the world oil production, I think Canada as a net oil export could consider their interests forwarded. If it means that the US will take control of middle eastern oil supplies in order to satiate it`s own demand for oil (and by doing so depriving Canada of a lucrative oil market), I think Canadas interests are twarted. But to be honest, I can`t predict how the star wars programe will affect US behaviour or the nature of US foreign interventions.\n\n \n Any way we win IMHO.\n \n The Chinese are already desperate for any oil we have to offer.\n \n I wonder how many Americans are truly aware of just how much their daily lives depend on Canada. Oil, natural gas, and electricity for most of the biggest urban centers in the USA comes directly from Canada - at ridiculously low subsidized prices.\n \n Personally, I'd love to see Canada have the cajones to stand up to the USA when it comes to energy. Jack up the prices, cut back the supply. \n \n All we need is someone to take the USA's place when it comes to trade. The rise of China is going to let us do that IMHO, and I think any move to get in on the ground floor with what is going to be the world's dominant economy is a good one.\n \n Waxy",

The current trade disputes in cattle and softwood are in fact causing ill feelings towards the US in areas of Canada that generally have had quite positive attitudes towards the US. Alberta is the main province that exports cattle to the US and its ranchers are not blaming Canada for the trade dispute. It is the Quebecois vote that Martin has to appeal for in greater numbers, he needs the non BQ vote not to be split among three other parties and go toward the Liberal, Alberta is generally lost to the liberals anway.\n \n 4. As Canada does not have any large domestic defense contractors that would get part of the BDM pie. Any contracts that go to Canadian companies, would be infact part of US companies, with the profits then going to the US. A loss overall for Canada if Canada had to put any money up as part of the BDM.
