Also marriage isn't religious anymore, it's basically a set of state and federal contracts and rights.

Marriage between a man and a woman is protected so that families produce offspring that will allow society to continue to grow and survive. Gay coupling can not produce this and therefore does not deserve to be given special rights or priviledges.\n\n \n But we do not need marriage to convince people to reproduce. That do that, and they do that far too often all on their own. We don't want to encourage reproduction anyhow, because it would likely lead to both overpopulation and children without families to raise them. In fact, marriage limits reproduction; it discourages people from having sex with others outside of the marriage. So claiming that marriage exists so that people will produce offspring is does not make sense at all; marriage does exactly the opposite of that.\n \n One of the effects of marriage is to prevent people from having sex with random other people so that children aren't born outside of families. Marriage exists to make certain that every child is born with two loving parents to raise it. It exists to help people raise children. Well, that's not the only reason, it also exists to ensure that the members of the family all have some financial and emotional support when they need it. It is no less than evil to request same-sex couples to fund tax breaks to help your family, then refuse to fund theirs when they enter the same situation.\n \n Now same-sex couples can have and raise children, and they quite often do just that. Same-sex couples have precisely the same needs and love for their children that opposite-sex couples have. It is simply arbitrary to claim that opposite-sex couples get marriage because of reproduction; I might just as soon claim that same-sex couples deserve marriage because of lack of reproduction. We'd both have just as much reason behind our claims.",

I'm not against you getting the benefits you need in SOME way, I am against you using the institution of marriage to get them.\n\n \n Then our difference is that I don't think the institution of traditional marriage is harmed in any way, in fact I think it is strengthed by same-sex marriage; I think more people will look highly upon it in the end, it will be taken seriously, and it will remain the foundation of family, not the foundation of heterosexual sex. By denying same-sex marriage now, we are denying that marriage exists to protect families, changing that to claim that marriage exists to protect only the approved families. By denying same-sex marriage, we deny traditional marriage and make it into Christian marriage, the marriage which the religion with the most money gets to define. We are altering the laws surrounding marriage, but we do so to preserve the spirit of marriage.\n \n I'm sure there are some traditions which are worthy of being protected, but a law which states that the one you love determines what privledges and rights you get under the law is not a tradition that is worth preserving. The issue of same-sex marriage will determine whether marriage is about family or sexual preference, for we either give it to all families or all people of a specific sexual preference. It will determine whether it applies to all religions or only a select few. \n \n Before this debate, marriage was considered to protect families and apply across religions. Before this debate, no one considered marriage exclusionary, a group only for the government-approved. But we're now realizing that marriage is a group only for the government-approved. If marriage is kept only for opposite-sex couples, marriage will become something it has never been: an exclusionary group suitable only for those living the government-approved lifestyle, and everyone will know it. That's not consistant with traditional marriage; we either destroy the traditional marriage restrictions or we destroy the traditional marriage spirit.",

The individual in a polygamous relationship is not denied the benefits of marriage, and he does not have to change his relationship to get those benefits, and therefore the individual is certainly not denied equality. In the case of same-sex marriage, homosexuals are completely denied equality, for they are not even allowed the same marriage benefits that others recieve without changing their sexuality.\n \n Even though denying polygamous marriage is not actually a destruction of equality, one might still say, \"Well, even though denying polygamous marriage isn't as bad as denying same-sex marriage, why do we deny it? Don't we want people in polygamous relationships to have benefits?\" And of course we want those people to have benefits; it would be nice if everyone had benefits, but polygamous marriage is simply impractical. Each time we allow someone to marry another, those people exchange benefits in the forms of tax breaks, insurance, etc. While it is both practical and purposeful to extend those benefits across two individuals, it becomes exponentially less practical to allow more people to exchange these benefits. For example, if we allowed four people to marry, one person might provide his insurance across three others, not just one. This is expensive and highly impractical. Polygamous couples already recieve the benefits of marriage; there is no reason to deny them those benefits, but it just isn't practical to extend additional benefits for their sakes.",

   "Okay, how about an example where consent isn't an issue?\n \n It is being argued that the current marriage laws are discriminatory because they allow two people to do something that two other people are forbidden to do. \n \n So - Sue is married to Tom. Tom falls in love with Carol. He claims to love both women equally. Sue and Carol are both okay with that. Now, although Carol and Bill, her old flame, are legally able to marry, it is illegal for Carol and Tom to marry (without dissolving his marriage with Sue - which he does not want to do). That sounds like two people being allowed to do something that two other people are not allowed to do.\n \n Take the example one step further. Steve is married to Kate. Steve is bisexual. Just as homosexuals say that it isn't their fault that they are attracted to the same sex and therefore should be allowed to marry, Steve says that it is not his fault that he is attracted to both sexes and therefore should not be discriminated against my marriage laws that only allow him to marry one sex or the other. So in this future scenario, the nation ends up with a similar debate over bisexual marriage as once went on over homosexual marriage, and the bisexuals win out. Steve remains married to Kate and additionally marries Phil, who is also bisexual. Although Phil likes Kate, he doesn't feel a connection to her, so he keeps on the lookout for a woman to fulfil his 'empty' side. He meets Shannon, and they marry, even though Shannon is already married to Beth.\n \n So now you have Kate who is married to Steve who is married to Phil who is married to Shannon who is married to Beth. What kind of house would they have to have? Imagine the quantity of children! How on earth do you write a tax code for that? How do medical benifits apply?

Over the next month, she issued five more licenses to same-sex couples. The press picked up on it and she began receiving harrassing phone calls and death threats. One man chose to protest by requesting a license to marry his eight-year-old mare--Rorex rejected the application on the grounds that the mare was underage. In late April the Colorado Attorney General issued a ruling making same-sex marriage illegal in Colorado, thus voiding the licenses which had been issued and annulling the marriages.\n\n \n http://clem.mscd.edu/~diguardi/",

One man portrays it as benefits instead of punishment, and suddenly it is acceptable to limit freedom.\n \n Let me present a different situation to you, let us say that Christians are forced to pay more money in taxes, and they are denied insurance coverage of their loved ones. They are denied this only because they are Christian. Is this freedom? Certainly not; the government is promoting the religions it prefers over the ones it does not prefer. Is this financial equality? Certainly not; the government is forcing Christians to pay more money. So what if I instead said, \"Well, non-Christians just get benefits for being non-Christian. Everyone's free to be Christian, they just don't get the financial and other benefits that everyone else gets.\" Well, just because I call the punishment to Christians \"benefits\" does not mean that I have not destroyed freedom and equality in every sense of the words. Sure, Christians would be free to change religion, but in as much as the government promotes one lifestyle and system of beliefs over another, that government has destroyed freedom and equality.\n \n \nThis is not to say that gay marriage is or should be accepted. This is not a law against personal freedom. Gays are allowed to cohabitate, create families via adoption(disgusting), vote, work, not wear a badge, not be confined to certain districts of a city. Gays have all the rights of hetro's., and simply, shouldn't be given other rights to make them the equals they already are.\n\n \n Although gays have all the rights of heterosexuals, the laws are currently designed so that heterosexual relationships are rewarded while homosexual relationships are punished. Considering this, it absolutely does not matter that everyone has the same rights because those rights are designed specifically so that they do not treat everyone equally. When you realize that specific rights have qualifications attached to them that say \"by the way, you don't get this right unless you stop being a homosexual\" then it could be no more clear that freedom and equality are nothing more than ideas to be wished for.\n \n You may find homosexuality disgusting, but the terms \"freedom\" and \"equality\" mean something. They don't mean \"freedom and equality unless someone does something you don't agree with\". That's not real freedom and equality, that's tyranny. If we are to call ourselves free and equal, then we can't restrict benefits and rights just because someone's lifestyle is disliked by a group of unaffected people.",

   "If you don't fall under the recognized definition of marriage, are you really being discriminated against?\n\n \n Yes, absolutely. In all three of those cases you described, you are being discriminated by the definition of discrimination, and there is should be no doubt about that in anyone's mind. The real question is not whether there is discrimintion but whether or not there is a good reason for that discrimination, and there had better be one really, really good reason for it, because if there is not. If there is no good reason to discriminate, then that discrimination is evil.\n \n As it happens, I disagree with preferential treatment of Native Americans, and minorities (though I would maintain the right of a private organization to choose who to give scholarships to). However, as you may have noticed, I am not on those forums complaining about those things. The reason for that is that there are reasons to grant that preferential treatment. There are good reasons to give preferential treatment to minorities, and great reasons to give preferential treatment to Native Americans. I don't think that those reasons are good enough to warrant discrimination, but at least there are good reasons to do it. On the other hand, I charge that there is no good reason to deny the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples. There might be little reasons, excuses, but not one of them is good. Because of the lack of good reasons, I feel that denying same-sex marriage is nothing short of evil, even though those who oppose it may not realize it is evil and may have good intentions.\n \n So is it discrimination? Yes, I think so. Is discrimination okay? Only if you've got a good enough reason to do it. Is there a good enough reason to discriminate against same-sex couples? Not that I know of.",

When you start supporting measures that deny people rights and benefits under the law, that is when you are wrong. When you would hurt others, prevent them from recieving benefits simply because of some word definition, that is when you are wrong.\n \n The dog in your story isn't just saying \"the definition for what you do is meow, not bark\", the dog is saying \"I get extra rights and benefits under the law because what I do is called barking; maybe one day we'll implement some seperate benefits for everyone, but barking still gets its own legal recognition, and for now I'm going to assure that there is no way you have access to barking rights.\" The dog is saying something evil.",

   "A better analogy would be . . .\n \n every night the dogs bark. The dogs like barking, they always have. Sometimes they bark at the moon, other times the cars that go by. Sometimes they just bark to each other.\n \n One evening some cats come along and start trying to bark, but it's really a meow. Sometimes just as loud, sometimes just as soft. They can meow at the moon as well. But those cats insist that, darn it, they too should not be separate but equal, and so they demand that their evening sounds be called barks as well. \n \n Even though the dogs tell them that while they're making plenty of noise as well, it's not really a bark (and that's ok), the cats only want it to be called the \"b\" word: barking. The cats like to make noise too. It even feels natural for them. They insist their noises are gentic. They tell the dogs they are being \"oppressed\" because their noises aren't called \"barks.\" But alas, it's just not barking, no matter how much they want to call it it that. The dogs tell them that they're really trying to redefine 'barking,' but the cats just won't listen. Separate but equal just won't do!\n \n (BTW, my dog sometimes barks at night--so far, no calls from the neighbors)\n\n \n IMO it's much more like the dogs standing on the cats' throats so as not to allow them to make a sound just in case. \n \n BTW what do they call the sound a seal makes?",

   "If you take civil unions though, it's like allowing the cats to meow as loud as they want, while recognizing that a meow is just not a bark.\n\n \n It isn't because we're just not talking about word definitions at all. If we allow same-sex couples to take part in civil unions but not in marriage, then we've effectively got a whole set of rights and benefits, a whole government institution designed specifically for dogs who bark, and that institution exists for no reason except to degrade cats, to make certain that dogs always have a special place under the law that cats can never take part in. Understand that civil unions is NOT a seperate institution for gay people, it is a seperate institution for people who don't qualify for marriage. It doesn't elevate gay people, it keeps them below married people while letting married people feel like they're fair. \n \n But that is not fair, so long as we have an institution under the law which only the elite, only those who live a certain lifestyle are allowed to participate in, then we will have a law which is not fair and is not free. Like I said, if you want to rename the institution you're a part of because you feel its current name doesn't correctly describe it, I don't really care, that is a miniscule detail compared to the fact that people are denied rights under the law. There is no place in our laws for an institution which is only available to heterosexuals.\n \n And what gets to me the most is that people care more about the word \"marriage\" than they do about the lives of their fellow human beings. Do you not realize that in Michigan, people are losing health insurance for their loved ones and their children because the people voted to approve a Constitutional ban on same-sex marriage? It's a word for God's sake. A word. I don't care what the name of the institution is called; no person can have a moral excuse to hurt another because of a word. What is happening in Michigan is one of the most horrible displays of human selfishness I can possibly imagine. I don't know how anyone can grant forgiveness for such an act, but maybe we can do something to change it.",

Most conservatives I know DO want gays, along with everyone else to have equal rights. It's just that some gay people are hung up over redefning the institution and the \"M\" word.\n\n \n I will not debate that you want to get along with gay people, but such an expectation cannot be fulfilled so long as you deny them access to the same institutions under the law to which you yourself have access. If one truly wishes to treat homosexuals equally, he cannot logically follow it with the statement that homosexuals do not deserve the same access to legal rights that he has. So long as that claim is being made, it does not matter how good your intentions are; you will not be treating them with equality. The least that could be done with the intention of equality is to request an institution exclusive to same-sex unions, one which heterosexual cannot participate in, with a name less degrading than \"civil unions.\" But even if you did that, you would still be promoting lack of equality, two different institutions to keep gay people out of yours. Understand that seperate institutions will not stay equal long.\n \n If you are both truly hoping for gays to be treated equally, instead of suggesting that they should be kept out of your institution and let into some other one to which everyone has access, you would be arguing to allow them into your own institution under the law. It does not make sense to have two institutions which accomplish the same thing unless those institutions are intended to have some difference. If you truly seek equality, and you are hung up on the definition of marriage, why do you not argue to change the name of the legal institution so that it can be more inclusive? Why must you argue for them to be kept out of your institution? What gives you the morality to demand your own set of exclusive rights?\n \n I should also point out that when one would deny people equality and happiness before changing a word, he is the one who is hung up over that word. It is unacceptable to support protecting the word \"marriage\" at the cost of denying benefits to same-sex couples. One who wants to get along with homosexuals, then proceeds to deny them benefits, to favor a word over their happiness, can expect nothing less than hatred. In light of this, it should be no surprise that the quote above by JPSarte is so incredibly painful. I do not think I could ever justify harming another person in order to protect a definition.",

The upper class, elite, the government-approved citizens get to be married. And because these institutions are different, some politician will at some point put up a new bill, and it'll be a change that is just for marriage.

If we put it into law, we are tyrannical, we force the majority's lifestyle upon everyone for no reason.\n \n Now, in truth there are two different \"marriages\". There is the religious institution of marriage, which refers to religious vows between people to stay together forever. There is also the legal institution of marriage, which refers to the benefits under the law granted to people who get a piece of paper. They just happen to be called the same thing, but one is specifically a legal right, and one is specifically relgious. No one here is advocating that anyone change the religious marriage, they just want that right, that benefit under the law, to apply to everyone. No one cares what the name is, and if you wanted to change it in order to distinguish between the two, then that would be just fine. The important part is that the law does not grant benefits to some people that it does not grant to others.\n \n Taking marriage benefits out of law does not make sense because they help people. Why not just change the name of the institution from \"marriage\" to \"civil unions\" for everyone? That way, everyone gets the same rights under the law, religious marriage stays exactly as religions wish it to be, and the two are easily distinguishable. Beyond that, most Christian churches can then continue to reject same-sex couples as they see fit; the majority of churches would not have to accept same-sex couples as married.\n \n That solution is a great one; no one has to lose benefits, and no one has to lose sleep because a same-sex couple is \"married\".

Religion isn't the only determinant of this--common understanding is as well. Since there is no legal definition of what a marriage consists of, we much go on public understanding and tradition.

The govt. give benefits based on a commitment between a man and a woman. I agree that the benefits are not the same as marriage--marriage is a commitment. A couple can be married regardless of the benefits. I think it would give gay people more credibility on this if more of them \"got married\" regardless of whether or not the govt. recognized it or not. That way it would look less like you all are trying to use marriage as a means to an end. To many of us, marriage is sacred and the commitment is the important part, not govt. benefits.",

If I was a strict Christian, I would be fighting against al gay issues, but I'm not. I'm a strong believer in the Constitution and believe that discrimination against anyone is fundamentally wrong.\n But, my position on the term \"marriage\" has never waivered and is uncompromising. Marriage is a sacrement in my religion and it isn't taken lightly or trivially. Now, I can understand that not everyone holds the same opinion of marriage as I do. The high divorce rate is evidence of that fact, but the majority of Americans are free to establish guidelines in society for what constitutes a legal marriage. They can rely on religious teachings, witch doctors, astrologers, whatever. The bottom line is that the majority believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman and 19 states affirmed that belief in November. Period.\n \n\n They wanted equal access to a legal institution and legal benefits that man happened to name \"marriage\". They did not want to change your religious beliefs of what marriage is, they just wanted a right under the law.

Your solution is to impose the tyranny of the majority until you get your way, to take away the rights of the minority until they give in to your demands, or perhaps until they no longer have the right to argue.\n\n Once Pandora's Box was opened in Michigan, the state had no choice but to stop the practice of allowing benefits to all NEW government contractees because the people of Michigan voted that they didn't recognize same sex unions. Had the issue never been pressed, the status quo would have been preserved. In this instance, popping one's head above the foxhole got it blown off. \n \n\n It might result in that now, but it will not in the long run.

Yet such an act would not have been moral; I can only justify asking for equality.\n\n Your entire paragraph above is pure speculation and conjecture. As a very Conservative man, I'm willing to grant full equality to gays. The ONLY stipulation is that the term \"marriage\" can't apply. I have many Conservative and liberal friends who feel similarly. You just don't get the barrier that the term \"marriage\" is. That term alone may wind up forcing a Constitutional Amendment that builds a permanent wall against you. You can rationalize that it shouldn't matter, that there is a separation of Church and state, yada, yada, but none of that matters when a voter steps in the booth with nothing but his concience to answer to.\n \n\n I disagree; it is the hive who has caused the stir by taking all of the honey for themselves, and it is only now that those who have been denied honey have found the nerve to speak up about it.

How can you be so cold to the suffering of others; how can you care only about your own tax dollars but not the tax dollars of others? How can you care only about your own loss of sleep? I cannot understand this.\n\n On JPSartre12's hierachy of concerns, I can assure you that gay marriage is near the base. I don't see any gays dying in the streets, being shot at because they aren't married or being slowly starved to death by a scumbag husband.

And I think your claim that \"it hurts people\" is unfounded and unproven.\n\n \n Well, you're right, but I guess you'd have to reference other posts I've made to fully understand my point of view. Although social security treats people unfairly, it does so with a very, very good reason, because the elderly need our care and support, and they are too often unable to support themselves. That very, very good reason is the only thing that makes social security acceptable. There is no reason to disallow same-sex couples to have the same marriage benefits as anyone else, let alone a very, very good one; they have the same needs and are just as deserving. Denying a person any right is harmful, for even if that right is only a title today, denial of that title both stigmatizes their lifestyle and may eventually cause them to lose rights if that title is granted specific privledges in the future (and it is very likely that this will happen). This is harm I have described in previous posts, and the founding of my claim to harm lies there.\n \n Regarding Affirmation Action, there is a very, very good reason to support Affirmation Action, but there are better reasons to oppose it, in my opinion, not the least of which is the unequal treatment it provides. But at least there is a very, very good reason to support it.\n \n \nThe second item you mention is marriage 'benefits.' The govt. give benefits based on a commitment between a man and a woman. I agree that the benefits are not the same as marriage--marriage is a commitment. A couple can be married regardless of the benefits. I think it would give gay people more credibility on this if more of them \"got married\" regardless of whether or not the govt. recognized it or not. That way it would look less like you all are trying to use marriage as a means to an end. To many of us, marriage is sacred and the commitment is the important part, not govt. benefits.\n\n \n I don't know what you mean; most gay couples do get married religiously, and those who don't usually don't believe in religious marriage; it isn't that they aren't committed. Such activities have not led to increased credibility among most, but have led to people being outraged at \"illegal same-sex weddings\" (as described by JPSartre). Same-sex couples are as committed as opposite-sex couples.",

   "Proposition 22 in California defined marriage as a union between a man and woman only, so any same sex marriages performed by civil authorities in California were illegal.\n\n \n You are referring to civil authorities who decided to start granting same-sex marriage licenses then? I hardly see what your problem with this is; merely government officials stepping outside of their power in order to make a political point, and they were treated as such.\n \n \nI've already told you what \"my God\" thinks of homosexuality. He spoke loud and clear at Sodom and Gomorrah. If I was a strict Christian, I would be fighting against al gay issues, but I'm not. I'm a strong believer in the Constitution and believe that discrimination against anyone is fundamentally wrong.\n\n \n I believe that Sodom was destroyed for its oppression of the poor, according to the Bible, but I should not try to convince you of that. I understand that you think discrimination is wrong, but I am trying to convince you that supporting rights for your own religion and lifestyle over others is the very definition of discrimination.\n \n \nBut, my position on the term \"marriage\" has never waivered and is uncompromising. Marriage is a sacrement in my religion and it isn't taken lightly or trivially. Now, I can understand that not everyone holds the same opinion of marriage as I do. The high divorce rate is evidence of that fact, but the majority of Americans are free to establish guidelines in society for what constitutes a legal marriage. They can rely on religious teachings, witch doctors, astrologers, whatever. The bottom line is that the majority believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman and 19 states affirmed that belief in November. Period.\n\n \n That would be the bottom line if it made me feel that I am wrong, but it only makes me feel that I need to work harder. The majority in those nineteen states are wrong, are hurting people, and they should not do so. The majority has persecuted in the past, and it is only by realizing that persecution that it has been overcome.\n \n \nIt wasn't just \"some man\", it is the prevailing definition accepted by the majority of Americans. You continually attempt to trivialize the will of the people to establish their own standard.\n\n \n Some men, then. Lots of men. Every man, woman and child in the world. What does that change?\n \n \nTo beelabor :) the analogy, the worker bees aren't trying to redefine themselves as \"queens\".\n\n \n Is every Christian a queen, and every homosexual a worker then? Is the role of homosexuals to work to support the queens and their own lifestyles?\n \n \nOnce Pandora's Box was opened in Michigan, the state had no choice but to stop the practice of allowing benefits to all NEW government contractees because the people of Michigan voted that they didn't recognize same sex unions. Had the issue never been pressed, the status quo would have been preserved. In this instance, popping one's head above the foxhole got it blown off.\n\n \n The state is revoking all medical benefits of same-sex couples in public positions, not just new ones, yet the same harm would exist even if this were not true. This an issue of equality; people pressing to get the rights that others have, but they do not. If the majority responds to people asking for equality by punishing them, by stripping their rights, by telling them they never should have tried to get the same rights that everyone else has, then the majority has commited an evil act. The majority has no moral right to issue punishment, the majority has no moral right to blow the fox's head off, and by doing so they have hurt countless people. I cannot believe that any good person could respond to people who ask for equality by stripping more of their rights, by hurting them, then believe that he has done a good thing.\n \n \nYour entire paragraph above is pure speculation and conjecture. As a very Conservative man, I'm willing to grant full equality to gays. The ONLY stipulation is that the term \"marriage\" can't apply. I have many Conservative and liberal friends who feel similarly. You just don't get the barrier that the term \"marriage\" is. That term alone may wind up forcing a Constitutional Amendment that builds a permanent wall against you. You can rationalize that it shouldn't matter, that there is a separation of Church and state, yada, yada, but none of that matters when a voter steps in the booth with nothing but his concience to answer to.\n\n \n If the term marriage cannot apply then you have no moral right to suggest that the term marriage should be legally recognized, for in claiming such you claim that there is a right which only you and people like you deserve. You claim that those who are live differently with different beliefs simply do not deserve all that you deserve. You elevate yourself above all others under the law. You turn a land of freedom into a land of tyranny. You hurt people. If a man's concience in the voting booth tells him that he needs to destroy equality, to hurt others, to place himself above those who are different, then that man's concience is telling him to do something evil. A man's concience tells that man to be kind to others, to treat them as he would treat himself, to not assume his own beliefs deserve elevation; it is the natural greed and selfishness of man that cause him to strip the benefits of others simply because those benefits have one name or another.\n \n \nAnd I'm telling you that many worker bees are more than willing to share the honey as long as you don't try to redefinel yourselves as queens. (No pun intended).\n\n \n Why not stop and consider who is redefining themselves above the other? Is it not those who want their own special right the ones who are defining themselves as Queens? Are homosexuals not just trying to give themselves the same rights under the law that everyone else has? You imply that homosexuals are placing themselves above the workers, but it is those who oppose same-sex marriage that would make Queens of themselves.\n \n \nOn JPSartre12's hierachy of concerns, I can assure you that gay marriage is near the base. I don't see any gays dying in the streets, being shot at because they aren't married or being slowly starved to death by a scumbag husband. When your plight rises above the level of a splinter, I may reconsider. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n You don't see gays dying in the streets? I do. I see hate crimes and murders. Do you not think that this is partially the result of the government refusing to grant same-sex couples equality? Do you not think that by berating same-sex couples, denying them the same rights that others have, we are implying that they are less than other people, we are teaching this to our citizens? We are. I see children without medical insurance, and it is only a matter of time before we start seeing many children whose bills cannot be paid. I see people who are not allowed citizenship because their marriage is not recognized by the state. I see people who are denied food stamps, who can't take care of their loved ones in the hospital, who don't get enough food stamps for their family, who are denied inheritance, and who can't get legal custody over their loved one's children. I see a way to help with all of these problems, and I see no downside to it.\n \n Gay rights is near the top of my list, not because it is the decision that affects the most people, but because it is the only decision in which we can stop suffering, pain, and hatred without harming anyone. It's near the top of my list because it is the only issue where there is one real, correct answer. If you really don't feel that gay rights is such a big issue, then why do you insist that the term \"marriage\" can both never include gay people, and cannot be removed from the government? The issue hardly affects you; you'd never even know the difference. But some people do feel the difference, every day and every night. Concern yourself with their happiness and their suffering, not your own peace of mind found by denying rights with a certain name to same-sex couples.",

   "The Blue Laws of Connecticut\n The term 'Blue Laws' describes harsh, puritanical laws that regulate public morality. Such laws supposedly existed in colonial America, making it illegal to do such things as kiss a child or shave on Sunday. But in fact, such laws probably never formally existed. The claim that they did was a hoax perpetrated by a writer in the late eighteenth century, the Reverend Samuel Peters.\n \n The phrase 'blue laws' was first used in an anonymous pamphlet published in 1762 titled The Real Advantages Which Ministers and People May Enjoy, Especially in the Colonies, by Conforming to the Church of England. But Peters was the first person to list examples of such laws in a book he published in 1782 titled A General History of Connecticut.\n \n In this work, Peters (who was living in London at the time) described various blue laws that had once existed in Connecticut. He claimed that it had once been the law that \"every male should have his hair cut round, according to a cap,\" that \"married persons must live together, or be imprisoned,\" and that \"no one shall run on the Sabbath-day, walk in his garden or elsewhere, except to and from meeting [church].\" The punishments for breaking these laws included excommunication, confiscation of property, fines, banishment, whipping, cutting off of the ears, burning of the tongue, or death. Moreover, Peters claimed that many of these laws still remained on the books in Connecticut. \n \n Peters's history caused a sensation in England, where readers felt that his account of these bizarre blue laws confirmed their view that Americans were a backwards, overly fanatical lot. But New Englanders who read the book were outraged, and rightly so. Because Peters had simply made up these blue laws.\n \n Why did Peters invent this fanciful legal history of Connecticut? There are two reasons.\n \n First, he was a wealthy Anglican who had been forced to leave America during the Revolution. Therefore, he had no love for the Connecticut society he had left behind. He wanted to make it look as uptight and repressive as possible. \n \n Second, Peters was dabbling in a literary genre that was only beginning to make its way into print at that time: the tall tale. Sprinkled throughout his history of Connecticut were bizarre claims, such as the assertion that the Connecticut River flowed so fast in places that it could carry a crowbar downstream. He also described a procession of frogs, four miles in length, that once descended upon the town of Windham. Clearly these 'facts' about Connecticut were stretching the truth a bit.\n \n Peters's scheme to darken the history of his former home worked. Even today numerous references can still be found to the infamous Blue Laws of Connecticut.\n\n \n http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/bluelaws.html",

The majority has persecuted in the past, and it is only by realizing that persecution that it has been overcome.\n\n I don't see the \"hurting people\" that you keep referring to. Please explain. \n \n\n Some men, then. Lots of men. Every man, woman and child in the world. What does that change?\n\n See my comments above about society setting behaviorial standards.\n \n\n Is every Christian a queen, and every homosexual a worker then? Is the role of homosexuals to work to support the queens and their own lifestyles?\n\n No, we're all worker bees, unfortunately. And our job is to maintain the hive mentality. :) \n \n\n The state is revoking all medical benefits of same-sex couples in public positions, not just new ones, yet the same harm would exist even if this were not true.\n\n That is NOT entirely the case in Michigan. The state will honor all current contracts that include same-sex benefits, but it will not include those benefits in any future contract. I'm OK with that. I was never asked to extend benefits to more groups and it's my taxes that are paying their healthcare.\n If I was consulted, it might be different, but the state decided to be benevolent with my money and I don't agree with that. I would also be ticked off if they offered their state employees petcare or any other non-traditionally accepted benefits without consulting the voters.\n \n\n This an issue of equality; people pressing to get the rights that others have, but they do not. If the majority responds to people asking for equality by punishing them, by stripping their rights, by telling them they never should have tried to get the same rights that everyone else has, then the majority has commited an evil act. The majority has no moral right to issue punishment, the majority has no moral right to blow the fox's head off, and by doing so they have hurt countless people. I cannot believe that any good person could respond to people who ask for equality by stripping more of their rights, by hurting them, then believe that he has done a good thing.\n\n Like I said, gays brought on the fight. If the fox didn't want its head blown off, it should have stayed out of the chicken coop.\n \n\n If the term marriage cannot apply then you have no moral right to suggest that the term marriage should be legally recognized, for in claiming such you claim that there is a right which only you and people like you deserve. You claim that those who are live differently with different beliefs simply do not deserve all that you deserve. You elevate yourself above all others under the law. You turn a land of freedom into a land of tyranny. You hurt people. If a man's concience in the voting booth tells him that he needs to destroy equality, to hurt others, to place himself above those who are different, then that man's concience is telling him to do something evil. A man's concience tells that man to be kind to others, to treat them as he would treat himself, to not assume his own beliefs deserve elevation; it is the natural greed and selfishness of man that cause him to strip the benefits of others simply because those benefits have one name or another.\n\n More melodrama? emoticon_rolleyes To be real honest with you, I think that a moral man should be elevated above an immoral one. But being a moral man means that one agrees to treat others with equality without compromising his morality. To me, using the term \"married\" for same sex partners compromises my morality and I'm not interested in doing so. \n \n\n Why not stop and consider who is redefining themselves above the other? Is it not those who want their own special right the ones who are defining themselves as Queens? Are homosexuals not just trying to give themselves the same rights under the law that everyone else has? You imply that homosexuals are placing themselves above the workers, but it is those who oppose same-sex marriage that would make Queens of themselves.\n\n Would you have preferred if I had used drones as an example. The point was that a worker bee doesn't fit the definition of a drone or queen and therefore can't become one...except through redefinition.\n \n\n You don't see gays dying in the streets? I do. I see hate crimes and murders. Do you not think that this is partially the result of the government refusing to grant same-sex couples equality? Do you not think that by berating same-sex couples, denying them the same rights that others have, we are implying that they are less than other people, we are teaching this to our citizens? We are. I see children without medical insurance, and it is only a matter of time before we start seeing many children whose bills cannot be paid. I see people who are not allowed citizenship because their marriage is not recognized by the state. I see people who are denied food stamps, who can't take care of their loved ones in the hospital, who don't get enough food stamps for their family, who are denied inheritance, and who can't get legal custody over their loved one's children. I see a way to help with all of these problems, and I see no downside to it.\n\n More melodrama? emoticon_rolleyes I don't see gays being slain in the streets. Sorry, I see more people being struck by lightning than gays being killed in the streets. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Gay rights is near the top of my list, not because it is the decision that affects the most people, but because it is the only decision in which we can stop suffering, pain, and hatred without harming anyone. It's near the top of my list because it is the only issue where there is one real, correct answer. If you really don't feel that gay rights is such a big issue, then why do you insist that the term \"marriage\" can both never include gay people, and cannot be removed from the government? The issue hardly affects you; you'd never even know the difference. But some people do feel the difference, every day and every night. Concern yourself with their happiness and their suffering, not your own peace of mind found by denying rights with a certain name to same-sex couples.\n\n And still more melodrama. emoticon_rolleyes \n You want to stop suffering, pain and hatred?

   "Hum, I wonder why I would have a problem with the above. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n And I wonder why you feel it justification to punish homosexuals.\n \n \nWow, you must read the abridged version of the Bible. emoticon_wow I believe that society has the power to set standards of conduct that it feels are appropriate. You can't urinate on the sidewalk because that same society doesn't want that type of behavior to be tolerated. Do you agree that it has that \"right\"?\n\n \n I have read the King James Version of the Bible. I agree society has the moral right to disallow urinating on the sidewalk, but only because there is a good reason to disallow it. Society is never morally right when it denies people rights or benefits without a good reason. Slavery, mass genocide, denying women the right to vote, segregation, even. Society is morally evil when it implements any of those things.\n \n \nI don't see the \"hurting people\" that you keep referring to. Please explain.\n\n \n The denial of rights or benefits hurts those who are denied those rights. I do not see what is difficult to understand about this. Those who are denied medical insurance are hurt through lack of medical insurance. Those who must pay additional taxes are hurt because they must pay more money. Those who must care for children and loved ones without the legal protections of marriage are hurt through the lack of these things. Shall I list all 1,049 benefits of marriage here? Lacking each one is a harm. You may consider these things \"benefits\" which are only granted to the worthy, but a benefit when looked at from a different angle is a punishment to those who do not recieve it. There is no difference between legal benefits and legal punishment to those who do not recieve the benefits.\n \n Even the lack of the title of marriage is a harm, for one can never be treated fairly by the inhabitants of society if the laws of society do not do so. The fact that same-sex couples are denied marriage while opposite-sex couples are granted it elevates opposite-sex couples above same-sex couples, and in doing so, degrades same-sex couples, sending a clear message to the nation that they are not as good as opposite-sex couples. This is a harm.\n \n I would have no problem with you causing such harm if you had a good enough reason to do so, but as far as I can tell your reason is only to promote your own religious values and lifestyle over those of other people. That is not a good reason, it is evil. Or is there more?\n \n \nSee my comments above about society setting behaviorial standards.\n\n \n Again, see mine about society being morally wrong when it hurts others.\n \n \nNo, we're all worker bees, unfortunately. And our job is to maintain the hive mentality. :)\n\n \n Then we should all have equal access to the honey.\n \n \nThat is NOT entirely the case in Michigan. The state will honor all current contracts that include same-sex benefits, but it will not include those benefits in any future contract. I'm OK with that. I was never asked to extend benefits to more groups and it's my taxes that are paying their healthcare.\n If I was consulted, it might be different, but the state decided to be benevolent with my money and I don't agree with that. I would also be ticked off if they offered their state employees petcare or any other non-traditionally accepted benefits without consulting the voters.\n\n \n Yet you have no problem forcing others to pay for your own marriage without consulting them? You have no problem taking peoples money and claiming it as your own without returning the same favor to them? Reason cannot guide one to justify forcing others to pay for his own marriage then refusing to pay for their own. I can't understand being glad to force others to give you money then being ticked off when they ask you to do the same for them. And certainly you do not put homosexuals, other human beings, on the same level as pets.\n \n \nLike I said, gays brought on the fight. If the fox didn't want its head blown off, it should have stayed out of the chicken coop.\n\n \n And what would they have if they hadn't? Nothing at all. They ask for equality, people say no, so they try to work with the system to get it, and you hurt them as much as you can.\n \n \nMore melodrama? emoticon_rolleyes To be real honest with you, I think that a moral man should be elevated above an immoral one. But being a moral man means that one agrees to treat others with equality without compromising his morality. To me, using the term \"married\" for same sex partners compromises my morality and I'm not interested in doing so.\n\n \n What I write seems as melodrama to you because you do not read it as I would say it; each sentence is intended to be a factual explanation of the evil of opposing same-sex marriage. \n \n If using the term \"married\" for same-sex couples makes you feel immoral, then don't use it, but don't prevent them using it to describe themselves. Don't use the government to tell people that they can't have the same rights, simply because your religion says so. It is, as I have stated, complete tyranny.\n \n I too feel that a moral man should be elevated over an immoral one, but I would never use my religion to claim a man who hurts and hates no one, who loves his family, and who contributes wholly to society is immoral.\n \n \nWould you have preferred if I had used drones as an example. The point was that a worker bee doesn't fit the definition of a drone or queen and therefore can't become one...except through redefinition.\n\n \n And my point is that we are all workers. None of us is a queen; none of us are above the others. We all work to contribute to society, and we are all deserving of its benefits. No group is deserving of an exclusive right all to their own; no group can give themselves special rights or institutions without becoming the queen, without turing a free nation into a tyranny.\n \n \nMore melodrama? emoticon_rolleyes I don't see gays being slain in the streets. Sorry, I see more people being struck by lightning than gays being killed in the streets. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Then am I to suppose if you could stop those people from being struck by lightning only by giving them the same benefits you have, you would choose to deny them such benefits? Is it okay to sacrifice a few lives? Write the ways you harm others off as ingsignificant if it makes you feel better, but it does not change the fact that they exist and that those who are affected do not feel they are so insignificant. \n \n Your religion is no more an excuse to harm others than mine is to harm you. I would be no more justified in stealing your money and distributing it to same-sex couples than you are in using the government to take my money and distribute it to opposite-sex couples, if the only reasons we have to do such things are religion. I am no more justified in refusing to drive you to the doctor when you have been hurt than you are in denying medical insurance to others who wish the same benefit upon you, even if my religion told me to let you suffer. Religion is no excuse to hurt people, to treat people poorly, or to deny them rights and benefits under the law. \n \n It is not equality you are fighting for; it is equality only so long as your own beliefs and religion always have special privledges and titles. But that just isn't equality, no matter how much the majority might want to redefine equality to give themselves exclusive privledges.\n \n \nAnd still more melodrama. emoticon_rolleyes \n You want to stop suffering, pain and hatred? Volunteer for the Peace Corps.\n\n \n As a matter of fact, I would do just that if I did not feel I could help more people by spending my time working toward gay rights.",

But it's better to accurately portray the situation rather than overstate it for whatever reason. \n \n The really sad thing is that everytime gay lobbyists claim gays are oppressed and killed regularly \"in the streets\" or wherever, it's a slap in the face to groups that really have gone through such a plight. No gay person has been enslaved due to their sexuality. And to be honest, deaths of gay people over their sexuality is really rare.\n \n \"Melodrama\" hits the nail on the head.\n\n \n You'd probably only hear about it, from those \"gay lobbyists\". You would not hear that someone who was in the closet was harrassed, beaten, or killed, for being gay.",

However, it should not be stated that those who view stealing as wrong played no part in that thief's murder. If society did not look down on stealing, then the person who is stolen from would be less likely to view that action as wrong and would therefore be less likely to murder that thief. If I see nothing wrong with stealing, then I'm not going to murder a thief, but because I see stealing as wrong, I am likely to get angry that the thief is stealing and I may hurt or kill him to stop him from stealing. It is society that has taught me that stealing is wrong; there have been societies in which no one has property. It isn't just a random coincidence that immeasurably more homosexuals are murdered for their sexual orientation than heterosexuals, even though far more people are heterosexual.

However, the teaching that something is wrong in general does incite hate; people do not like it when someone engages in an activity that they see as wrong, and if they hold a deep enough belief that it is wrong, they will try to stop or punish that person for engaging in that activity. \n \n I do not have a problem with you holding onto your religious belief, but leave the teaching that homosexuality is wrong to your religion, not to the laws, not to the government, not to the tyranny of the majority. A good government is free and equal, and it does not deny anything to the minority. A good government does not allow the majority to force the minority to become the majority or be faced with less rights.

However, no amount of denial can obscure the link between hateful rhetoric and hate-filled brutality. Ms. Short says it was wrong for Response  to depict groups such as Focus on the Family as perpetrators of anti-gay violence. However, these groups are part of a nationally coordinated effort to deny GLBT people the civil and human rights that the United Methodist Discipline says should be protected. Two years ago, for example, they supported a \"get out the Christian vote\" effort that succeeded in repealing human rights protections for GLBT people in the state of Maine. They also can be counted on to oppose special laws addressing hate crimes. The impact of these groups' rhetoric is demonstrated by dramatic increases in anti-gay violence tracked in Colorado and Oregon by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs during debates over civil rights laws in those states. \n \n Furthermore, it is a very short distance from declaring our love \"incompatible with Christian teaching\" to sending a message that condones brutality. As Mag Segrest points out in the Response  article \"Contemplating Matthew Shephard,\" the United Methodist Church and other denominations underline the point whenever \"...they put the question of human community up for a denominational vote.\" \n",

Alcohol and drugs sometimes help fuel these crimes, but the main determinant appears to be personal prejudice, a situation that colors people's judgment, blinding the aggressors to the immorality of what they are doing. Such prejudice is most likely rooted in an environment that disdains someone who is \"different\" or sees that difference as threatening. One expression of this prejudice is the perception that society sanctions attacks on certain groups. For example, Dr. Karen Franklin, a forensic psychology fellow at the Washington Institute for Mental Illness Research and Training, has found that, in some settings, offenders perceive that they have societal permission to engage in violence against homosexuals.\n",

One organization reports that 18 anti-gay murders and 700 assaults took place in 2003. And recent years have seen a number of high-profile anti-gay incidents, such as the murder of Matthew Shepard.\n \n Links to Religion\n \n Unfortunately, many times religious leaders do nothing to discourage anti-gay violence. In some cases, they may even encourage that kind of behavior. A few months ago, there was some discussion in the blogosphere in general about comments made by formerly (still?) influential preacher Jimmy Swaggart, who told a crowd he would kill any gay man who looked at him romantically. (Swaggart later apologized.) \n",

   "Most hate crimes are carried out by otherwise law-abiding young people who see little wrong with their actions. Alcohol and drugs sometimes help fuel these crimes, but the main determinant appears to be personal prejudice, a situation that colors people's judgment, blinding the aggressors to the immorality of what they are doing. Such prejudice is most likely rooted in an environment that disdains someone who is \"different\" or sees that difference as threatening. One expression of this prejudice is the perception that society sanctions attacks on certain groups.

You cannot claim taxpayers would be paying for same-sex marriage then proceed to claim that gays are not paying for your marriage in the same fashion.\n \n You have said that you don't have a problem with them recieving those benefits, but your actions did not match your words.

Such a claim is grounded in no reasoning.\n \n \nThey certainly didn't redefine it. Slavery was made illegal, not redefined. emoticon_wow\n\n \n Slavery was redefined in exactly the same way that marriage is being redefined. In America, slavery was a long-held tradition which applied only to blacks. The institution of slavery was redefined so that it no longer applied to blacks. Or looking at it in the reverse sense: the right to freedom applied only to those currently free, not those currently currently enslaved. That right was altered, redefined, so that it applied to everyone in the United States. It redefined both slavery and freedom, it did so in exactly the same way that you are claiming marriage is being redefined, and we were right in changing that definition.\n \n \nIt's ironic that ONLY gays would call the institution of marriage \"evil\".

I believe you were displeased with attempts by activists to legalize same-sex marriage, so you issued eternal punishment to all same-sex couples.\n \n It may be your view of morality that leads you to fight against same-sex marriage, but if it does, then your view of morality includes harming other people who are harming no one else. I believe that your view of morality is tainted by your imperfections, the same that we all have. I believe your view of morality is evil, and I am certainly trying to convince you of that. Remember that the most evil men in history did not believe they were evil; their views of morality were just wrong and they hurt countless people. No one's view of morality is perfect. I look at all the people whose rights are denied, and I see no people who benefit from denying same-sex marriage, and I can come to no conclusion but that is is evil to deny same-sex marriage.\n \n \nDitto.\n\n \n Hooray!",

But people turn down state benefits all the time when they don't fit the criteria, for many things. That's the way it works.\n\n \n The right to marry an opposite-sex partner is a right that is designed specifically to prevent gay people from making use of it. To claim that homosexuals have equal rights is to decieve yourself; marriage has a set of restrictions that precisely say, \"If you want to be married, you've got to stop being homosexual.\" I have used this example in the past, and I will continue to use it every time you claim that homosexuals have equal rights because they can simply marry someone of the opposite sex: restricting marriage to same-sex couples is no less equal than restricting rights to people who practice Christianity. Certainly anyone can choose to stop practicing Christianity, to stop being Christian, but if such a law were in place, no one could rightly claim that Christians have the same rights as anyone else.\n \n When people turn down government benefits because they do not meet the criteria, those people are always and every time being discriminated against, and those people are always and every time denied rights. Every benefit granted is the denial of that benefit to someone else. But there is usually a good reason to discriminate and to deny those people rights.\n \n I guess I might as well mention that I am bisexual, not homosexual, and since this makes 96% of the people I might choose to spend my life with female, I would be surprised if I ended up marrying a male, though it may happen. For me, engaging in sexual relations with members of the same sex would completely be a choice. What I mean is that I'm not fighting for that possibility that I might benefit from same-sex marriage; I support same-sex marriage because there are people out there who will fall in love with someone of the same sex, and those people deserve the same rights and benefits under the law that anyone else has.\n \n \nIt's really a matter of you wanting to redefine marriage, to custom-fit it to what you want. The only real legal basis you have to say that marriage is a \"civil right\" is the Loving case, which was about interracial marriage.

Remaking it into anything else to fit any circumstances isn't, anymore than remaking social security to fit any age group, disability to fit non-handicapped people, or affirmative action to fit any race, even white people.\n\n \n An incredible debate could go on about whether or not loosen a restriction on marriage warrants the term \"redefining marriage\", for marriage stays the same for every person who enjoys it now, and it stays the same for all new people who would be able to participate in it. The claim that it is being \"redefined\" simply because we want to allow more people to get married may very well be inappropriate. Yet I will not make that argument; I will say simply that if lessening a restriction on marriage constitutes redefining it, then I can say with as much certainty as I am able that it is morally evil to not redefine it, to leave it as it is.\n \n Marriage is certainly a civil right, for a civil right is any action or benefit granted to an individual by the law. I don't see how you could say that marriage does not qualify as a civil right. When I say that homosexuals are denied civil rights, I mean that they are denied the same rights under the law that others recieve. The fact that marriage is a civil right doesn't necessarily mean that everyone should get marriage, but certainly we are denying people civil rights if we deny them marriage. When I claim that denying marriage to same-sex couples is unequal, tyrannical, and harmful, those are the reasons that homosexuals deserve marriage (well, they deserve the same rights everyone else has, whether that is marriage or not). Because giving more rights to heterosexuals than to homosexuals is unequal, tyrannical and harmful, and because there is no good reason to do that, it is morally evil to support giving heterosexuals extra rights.\n \n When we grant social security, disability benefits, and affirmative action, we are indeed denying everyone else civil rights. We are indeed discriminating against everyone else. And if there was not a very, very good reason to discriminate like that, I would be outraged. But there is a very, very good reason; disabled people need the extra benefits. Older people need the extra benefits. So we, as a good government, try to help out these people who aren't able to help themselves; we try to help those with disadvantages. Yeah, it's not fair to the majority of people, but being disabled or old isn't fair either. In the case of opposite-sex couples, they do not need the extra benefits any more than same-sex couples do. They are taking these extra benefits only to elevate themselves, their beliefs, and their lifestyle above everyone else. They take these benefits out of greed, selfishness, or a desire to discourage people from being different. I'm sure you deny this, but consider why you oppose same-sex marriage. You have stated that your religion says it is wrong, but why do you therefore decide to deny rights to those who believe differently? Is it not because you do not want people to be homosexual? Is it not because you want people to believe as you do? I do not believe that you would cause such harm simply because you don't want to change the Webster definition of marriage.",

The phrase \"civil right\" has a tendency to evoke memories of segregation, Martin Luther King Jr., women's suffrage, etc. I don't think gay rights falls under that catagory, because gay people aren't threatened and denied anywhere near the level these other groups were, if any. (And if they are denied, it can be attributed to gays' behavior as opposed to racism, but that's another debate.) But I can agree that couples' benefits are a right that individuals should have access to, and so gay people should get them if they need them. We should find ways to meet those needs. But not by redefining marriage. Marriage is a commitment between a man and a woman.\n \n \nWhen I claim that denying marriage to same-sex is unequal, tyrannical, and harmful, \n\n \n These terms are so loaded they hardly fit the context, if at all.

A young or healthy person could argue they \"need\" disability benefits as easily as you argue you \"need\" marriage benefits. You are arguing that disability, SS, and affirmative action is ok because it is genuinely needed--so are marriage benefits to couples. Someone not disabled could probably really use a disability check too at times, just like gay people can claim to really need marriage benefits at times.\n \n \nThey are taking these extra benefits only to elevate themselves, their beliefs, and their lifestyle above everyone else. They take these benefits out of greed, selfishness, or a desire to discourage people from being different. \n\n \n Come on now, don't you think this is a bit presumtuous and over-the-top?

Each commitment of love is a special thing.

Reading a book doesn't feel like a civil right, but if you suddenly aren't allowed to do it anymore, the fact that it is a civil right becomes clear.\n \n \nThe phrase \"civil right\" has a tendency to evoke memories of segregation, Martin Luther King Jr., women's suffrage, etc. I don't think gay rights falls under that catagory, because gay people aren't threatened and denied anywhere near the level these other groups were, if any. (And if they are denied, it can be attributed to gays' behavior as opposed to racism, but that's another debate.) But I can agree that couples' benefits are a right that individuals should have access to, and so gay people should get them if they need them. We should find ways to meet those needs. But not by redefining marriage. Marriage is a commitment between a man and a woman.\n\n \n Blacks certainly had it far worse; they had almost no civil rights, and we are talking about only a few civil rights for homosexuals. But although blacks had it worse, it is not much more morally acceptable to deny a few civil rights than it is to deny a lot. No one here would claim that blacks are not being discriminated against if they were denied even one civil right that is allowed to whites, and no one here could call that morally good. As for the feasibility of living a different lifestyle to achieve rights, I don't think that in a free or equal society, anyone should have to change their lifestyle to get all the rights and benefits of a another citizen unless there is a very good reason for that. In a free and equal nation, a different lifestyle or belief should be treated no differently than a different race, we cannot ask people to conform to our standards without a very, very good reason.\n \n As for finding a way to meet the needs of homosexuals, I do not think their needs can be met so long as heterosexuals have some right which they do not, for as long as that is the case, then society will be teaching that homosexuality is wrong and less deserving of rights. Each person should have an equal right to promote and teach his or her own belief, and so long as heterosexuals have extra rights under the law, that equality will never exist. I don't care whether it is called marriage, civil unions, family plus, bag of super-commitment benefits, pile of sticks, or anything else, so long as it is the same for everyone. I'll redefine as few or as many words as it takes to grant equality.\n \n \nThese terms are so loaded they hardly fit the context, if at all. To be true and accurate to the situation, I wouldn't use a word like \"tyranny\" which evokes thoughts of the situation being a lot worse than it is.\n\n \n I use tyranny because tyranny is a very bad thing, and denying the same rights to same-sex couples that opposite-sex couples have is in fact tyranny. It is a horrible thing, and although it is not complete tyranny across all rights, tyranny is still as unacceptable when done on a small scale. Also, \"tyranny of the majority\" is a political science term which describes the precise situation we have here, where the majority denies rights to the minority. The framers of the Constitution tried extremely hard to prevent tyranny of the majority, and their efforts can be read about in the Federalist Papers.\n \n \nCouples need the benefits of marriage as well. What's the difference? A young or healthy person could argue they \"need\" disability benefits as easily as you argue you \"need\" marriage benefits. You are arguing that disability, SS, and affirmative action is ok because it is genuinely needed--so are marriage benefits to couples. Someone not disabled could probably really use a disability check too at times, just like gay people can claim to really need marriage benefits at times.\n\n \n Well, factual evidence and reasoning can show no reason that opposite-sex couples are more in need of marriage benefits that same-sex couples. It is true that couples need the benefit of marriage; all couples need that benefit, not just opposite-sex couples, and that is precisely why all couples should get it. If some other person ends up in a situation where he is just as needy as a disabled person, that person should probably get the rights of disabled people too. Our laws try to cover all those cases, with welfare, disability benefits, etc. We try to care for everyone who needs help.\n \n \nCome on now, don't you think this is a bit presumtuous and over-the-top? You are attributing motive when you couldn't possibly know what it is in every case.\n\n \n I shouldn't claim to be all-knowledgable, but these are the only motives that make sense to me. Why would someone choose to deny rights to one group but not another, if granting those rights to both groups harms no one? I can think of no explanations except greed, selfishness, or a desire to discourage people from being different. I suppose I should also add misinformation.\n \n \nIronically I defend marriage for the very opposite reason you think: because I consider it very sacred and important. I don't want the institution watered down.\n\n \n But what do you mean by \"watered down\" and why is it so bad? Why do you want to keep it sacred? I think that the root cause can only be one of the following: You want to discourage homosexuality and encourage your own religion (disouraging people from being different), you want that feeling of being special (selfishness), or you want exclusive access to the benefits for monetary gain (greed). Perhaps it is not one of these things, but then I do not understand your real reason: why is opening the doors of marriage to same-sex couples a bad thing? What is the core problem?",

If you had the benefit only of civil unions, then you may or may not be working toward, but I would argue that you probably should be. Even if you were not complaining that you are not allowed marriage, I would be. You deserve every right to promote and teach your religion, your beliefs, and your lifestyle, and the government has no place teaching people that you are wrong by denying you the same titles that anyone else gets.\n \n \nThat's why I can't understand nor can I identify with why so many gay people seem to think there is something magical about govt. sanction.

ALL the govt is doing is giving some benefits in recognition of these marriage commitments. We can do the same thing for gay people, regardless of what it's called.\n\n \n See, but I see gay people doing precisely the opposite of what you say. I see gay people all over becoming religiously married. I see them doing this in spite of the lack of government religion. I see them making the commitments, holding to them, and asking only that those commitments be recognized by the government. The same-sex couples who married in San Francisco were celebrating the recognition of their relationships and trying to show the world that they are committed; they weren't making those commitments for the first time. They aren't waiting for government recognition, they are going ahead with their love regardless of the government, then pushing for the government to recognize them. They are doing everything there that you have said they are not. The problem is that the media only focuses on the civil rights battle, so the average person has no one has any idea who gay people are; they know only that gays are asking for the right to marry. The problem is not the mindset of homosexuals, the problem is that people assume the worst, when in reality gay people are just as committed in their relationships as straight people.\n \n \nThere isn't even any comparison. Blacks were slaves for hundreds of years and considered property. To claim gay people are anywhere close to that is distasteful in the least and insulting at the worst. You are trying to piggyback off the black civil rights movement by invoking it to further your movement, when in fact you are nowhere close to it in terms of civil rights violations. I'd argue the very phrase \"civil rights violations\" is a big stretch when it comes to gay people, these days anyway.\n\n \n I specifically stated that black people had it far worse, and certainly the plight of homosexuals is not even on the same level as the plight of black slaves. But to imply that there can be no comparisons is illogical. In both cases we see a denial of civil rights; in slavery all civil rights were denied, while with homosexuals, only a few are denied. Yet in both cases, rights were improperly denied, and a comparison can be made. A comparison does not imply that the harm is equal nor even remotely similar in magnitude, but it does imply that it is the same type of harm.\n \n I have made no mention of the black civil rights movement; that was you. I used the term \"civil right\" which is the only term that accurately explains what the legal form of marriage is. Although you may associate that term with slavery, civil rights extend to millions of issues besides slavery, and my use of the term is nothing less than appropriate here. I do not associate the term \"civil rights\" with slavery, and I ask that you do the same when reading my posts. It is certain that you will get the wrong message if you think that I am referring to slavery every time I use the term \"civil rights\". As I said, civil rights apply to every right that is not denied us by the government.\n \n \nBut if they both have \"couples' benefits\", neither would have rights the other didn't have. Again, your hangup is obviously over semantics.\n\n \n Yes, it is over semantics. The same benefit can be granted through different civil rights if the semantics are changed. I am suggesting that it is wrong to deny the civil right of marriage to some, even though those people might still have access to the civil right of civil unions.\n \n \nOk, then we should make sure you have couples' benefits as well.\n \n That's why I support recognizing your relationships in other ways.\n\n \n So long as access to the same ways is denied, the harm I spoke of will still exist. So long as heterosexuals have their own special right, then the religion and lifestyle of homosexuals will be taught to be wrong by our government. Giving yourself the exclusive title of marriage serves no purpose but to promote your beliefs over the beliefs of others.\n \n \nAgain, the use of \"tyranny\" in this context is hyperbole. No one is being tyrannical toward you. I'd say all in all you probably have a pretty good and comfortable life here in America and an honest assessment would show you don't have it bad at all, most likely. One case where some get benefits and you don't hardly constitutes \"tyranny.\"\n\n \n Tyranny does not have anything to do with standard of living; it is very possible for a tyranny to grant an excellent standard of living to everyone. Tyranny is completely related to restriction of rights. I use the word because it accurately portrays the problem created through denying gay rights.\n \n \nI could say the same about the motives of the gay lobby and say that its motives are malevolent. \n \n Most people who are trying to protect the institution of marriage are doing it because they care about it, not as some sort of attack on you.\n\n \n You could say that about the motives of the gay lobby, but I have been trying to convey to you the motives of the gay lobby, and hopefully you understand better that their motives are about equality, freedom, and helping people instead of harming them.\n \n My point here is that I do not understand why you think you are the one who is protecting marriage, and I do not understand why you think that allowing more people to take part in it is a bad idea, unless I use one of those motives to justify it.

   "Because in this case the institution itself has to be redefined to do that. One of the the most fundamental aspects of marriage is that it is between a man and a woman.\n\n \n But redefining it is not the same thing as protecting it, for if part of its definition is flawed, then you are denying marriage the chance to be fixed.\n \n \nI don't want to \"deny\" anyone anything. I want gay couples to have the benefits they need. I just don't want to see marriage redefined to do that.\n\n \n Well, no one needs benefits, but it is morally wrong to deny them benefits without a very, very good reason. And a legal title is a benefit. You cannot grant equal civil rights unless you remove or change every exclusive right.\n \n Marriage is a time-honored institution, but then again so was slavery. Certainly slavery caused far more harm, so we had to do away with slavery completely. Marriage is doing mostly good things, with only a minor harm, and appropriate solution is just to make a minor change to fix that harm. But the point is that just because an institution is time-honored does not mean that it is not morally evil to leave it unchanged. \n \n \nBecause I don't see any good reason to redefine a time-honored institution that is downright sacred to many people, just because you insist on that being the only want you want to receive couple's benefits. It's like replacing a car because the taillight is out.\n\n \n That analogy doesn't work at all; it implies that we find one thing wrong with marriage, so we replace the entire thing. But that is precisely the opposite of what we are trying to do. We see the tail light on the car is out, and we say, \"Let's replace the tail light.\" Supporters of same-sex marriage see the problem and want to directly fix that problem, they don't want to change all of marriage, only the one thing that is wrong with it. But opponents of same-sex marriage say, \"No! The tail light has always been out, and we don't want to redefine our car.\" Of course, I respond with \"That doesn't make sense, if we found a problem with the car, let's fix it.\" And when my opponent continues to refuse to fix that tail light, I say, \"Fine, we can get a new car, a free car, the same car, just with a different name, and it will have a working tail light.\" Your solution, as I see it, is to get a second car, but to continue to keep using the one with the broken tail light the majority of the time, no matter how many people are put in danger by the broken tail light.\n \n \nIt is exclusive by it's very nature. It's not that I think it should be, it's that I recognize that it IS. When a man and a woman commit to one another, it IS an exclusive, special thing.\n\n \n But that is not a harm or a reason to deny a right, it is your own belief. I believe that the commitment between a man and a man or a woman and a woman is every bit as special as special as a heterosexual commitment. Nature has nothing to do with what is right or wrong, you're talking about a religious belief that the commitment between men and women is more special than the commitment between two people of the same sex, and you want to put that into the law. Is that not the promotion of your own beliefs and lifestyle over others?\n \n \nBecause the institution of marriage is under attack by your movement, pure and simple. I think it is needless to change it, when we can meet your needs in other ways.\n\n \n But an attack indicates an attempt to harm, not an attempt to change, fix, or help. Clearly the gay rights movement seeks to change, fix, and help marriage, and therefore the term \"attack\" does not fit. As long as there is legal institution under the law which applies to opposite-sex couples but not to same-sex couples, then you cannot be treating homosexuals in a morally acceptable fashion, for you are by definition denying them equality in rights and benefits, and there is not a reason to do so.",

   "The problem is that the govt. recognizes that special feeling. It's not a matter of two separate types of marriage, it's a matter of the govt. recognizing the religious ceremony.\n\n \n This is wrong. Not only is there a separation of church and state in this great nation, atheist - those who do not believe in any deity or religion - can have their marriages recognized.\n \n Try again.\n \n \nPerhaps we should again say that the govt. should simply give \"couples' benefits\" and stay out of marriage altogether.\n\n \n Perhaps. Are you willing to cut off your nose to spite your face?\n \n \nAlso, I think you are giving national portable civil unions WAY to bad of a rap here. It's simply a way for the govt to provide the benefits you need for gay unions (or \"marriage\", if you will). You can still call it what you want. If you are getting the benefits you need, and you can still call it marriage, ultimately your hangup is over semantics. IF the situation were reversed, I wouldn't be so concerned about what the govt. called my marriage. I'd have a marriage either way, regardless of what the govt. said. That's why I can't understand nor can I identify with why so many gay people seem to think there is something magical about govt. sanction. If their relationships are truly based on love and commitment, they won't wait around for the govt. like so many gay couples did in San Francisco and Massachusetts. I just can't indentify with that mindset. Marriage is not even about what the govt. does, and that's why so many straight people are put off by this movement of yours, which seems to cheapen the whole thing and misses the point altogether of what marriage is. ALL the govt is doing is giving some benefits in recognition of these marriage commitments. We can do the same thing for gay people, regardless of what it's called.\n\n \n Two things:\n \n 1. Civil Unions do not exist on a national level, so there is no federal recognition. Also, there is the issue of portability. If one is to travel to another country, their civil union will not be recognized in most places. Plus you forget about all those constitutional amendments that also rule out recognition of not only civil unions, but any other domestic partnerships.\n \n 2. If you don't think it's such a big deal, why are you so bent out of shape about same-sex cuples using the word marriage to recognize their relationships? Why does it bother you that these same couples would want their marriages recognized as such?\n \n \nThere isn't even any comparison. Blacks were slaves for hundreds of years and considered property. To claim gay people are anywhere close to that is distasteful in the least and insulting at the worst. You are trying to piggyback off the black civil rights movement by invoking it to further your movement, when in fact you are nowhere close to it in terms of civil rights violations. I'd argue the very phrase \"civil rights violations\" is a big stretch when it comes to gay people, these days anyway.\n\n \n This is silly! Are we now going to discuss who had it worse between blacks and jews? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nBut if they both have \"couples' benefits\", neither would have rights the other didn't have. Again, your hangup is obviously over semantics.\n \n\n \n Honey, you're the one who is harping over semantics. If it walks like a duck smells like a duck and quacks like a duck, why are you calling it a fridge?\n \n \nOk, then we should make sure you have couples' benefits as well. \n \n That's why I support recognizing your relationships in other ways. \n\n \n Oh yeah! Just so long as your relationship is considered superior to mine emoticon_rolleyes",

   "The right to marry an opposite-sex partner is a right that is designed specifically to prevent gay people from making use of it. To claim that homosexuals have equal rights is to decieve yourself; marriage has a set of restrictions that precisely say, \"If you want to be married, you've got to stop being homosexual.\" I have used this example in the past, and I will continue to use it every time you claim that homosexuals have equal rights because they can simply marry someone of the opposite sex: restricting marriage to same-sex couples is no less equal than restricting rights to people who practice Christianity. Certainly anyone can choose to stop practicing Christianity, to stop being Christian, but if such a law were in place, no one could rightly claim that Christians have the same rights as anyone else.\n\n You can't be married because you don't meet the criteria for marriage. Just as I don't meet the criteria for AA and I'm not trying to redefine minority to include white males am I?\n \n\n When people turn down government benefits because they do not meet the criteria, those people are always and every time being discriminated against, and those people are always and every time denied rights. Every benefit granted is the denial of that benefit to someone else. But there is usually a good reason to discriminate and to deny those people rights.\n\n I'm being discriminated against because I can't collect Social Security. The fact that I'm only 48 should have no bearing, it's age discrimination!!! See how ludicrous that kind of argument is? If I don't meet the criteria, NO SALE.\n \n\n I guess I might as well mention that I am bisexual, not homosexual, and since this makes 96% of the people I might choose to spend my life with female, I would be surprised if I ended up marrying a male, though it may happen. For me, engaging in sexual relations with members of the same sex would completely be a choice. What I mean is that I'm not fighting for that possibility that I might benefit from same-sex marriage; I support same-sex marriage because there are people out there who will fall in love with someone of the same sex, and those people deserve the same rights and benefits under the law that anyone else has.\n\n Ah, so being gay is really a choice? emoticon_confused \n \n\n An incredible debate could go on about whether or not loosen a restriction on marriage warrants the term \"redefining marriage\", for marriage stays the same for every person who enjoys it now, and it stays the same for all new people who would be able to participate in it. The claim that it is being \"redefined\" simply because we want to allow more people to get married may very well be inappropriate. Yet I will not make that argument; I will say simply that if lessening a restriction on marriage constitutes redefining it, then I can say with as much certainty as I am able that it is morally evil to not redefine it, to leave it as it is.\n\n But redefining marriage is morally objectionable to a MAJORITY of Americans, therefore, pushing redefinition is the kiss of death to gay marriage AND civil unions as we have seen in states with ballot initiatives in 2004.\n \n\n Marriage is certainly a civil right, for a civil right is any action or benefit granted to an individual by the law. I don't see how you could say that marriage does not qualify as a civil right. When I say that homosexuals are denied civil rights, I mean that they are denied the same rights under the law that others recieve. The fact that marriage is a civil right doesn't necessarily mean that everyone should get marriage, but certainly we are denying people civil rights if we deny them marriage. When I claim that denying marriage to same-sex couples is unequal, tyrannical, and harmful, those are the reasons that homosexuals deserve marriage (well, they deserve the same rights everyone else has, whether that is marriage or not). Because giving more rights to heterosexuals than to homosexuals is unequal, tyrannical and harmful, and because there is no good reason to do that, it is morally evil to support giving heterosexuals extra rights.\n\n Agreed......just call it something other than marriage. Is that too hard to comprehend for gays? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n When we grant social security, disability benefits, and affirmative action, we are indeed denying everyone else civil rights. We are indeed discriminating against everyone else. And if there was not a very, very good reason to discriminate like that, I would be outraged. But there is a very, very good reason; disabled people need the extra benefits. Older people need the extra benefits. So we, as a good government, try to help out these people who aren't able to help themselves; we try to help those with disadvantages. \n\n Let's consider the constitutionality of your above statements. Uncle Sam has no legal charter to engage in the creation and administration of social programs. By doing so, it is acting extra-constitutionally. It compounds its illegality by denying equal protection to all citizens.\n \n\n Yeah, it's not fair to the majority of people, but being disabled or old isn't fair either. In the case of opposite-sex couples, they do not need the extra benefits any more than same-sex couples do. They are taking these extra benefits only to elevate themselves, their beliefs, and their lifestyle above everyone else. They take these benefits out of greed, selfishness, or a desire to discourage people from being different. I'm sure you deny this, but consider why you oppose same-sex marriage. You have stated that your religion says it is wrong, but why do you therefore decide to deny rights to those who believe differently? Is it not because you do not want people to be homosexual? Is it not because you want people to believe as you do? I do not believe that you would cause such harm simply because you don't want to change the Webster definition of marriage.\n\n \n When marriage benefits were enacted, there was no great cry from gays that they were discriminated against. Marriage benefits predate any and all efforts by gays to be included in marriage. To claim that married people \"take these benefits out of greed, selfishness or a desire to discourage people from being different\" is just plain silly. I can assure you that thumbing their noses at gays wasn't even remotely on the minds of the legislators who first enacted laws beneficial to married couples. To claim nefarious motives is just unbelievable and very out of character for you. You are usually far more logical in your arguing. I'll have to attribute that statement to what we call here a \"brain fart\". :)",

   "Those who kill based on sexual orientation do so because they believe that people of a different sexual orientation are evil. It would therefore be possible to state that if a religious group which teaches others that homosexuals are sinners had not done so, those murderers may never have learned to hate homosexuals, and they would never have committed those crimes. However, this ignores the fact that an individual must be held responsible for his own actions, and it further ignores the possibility that the religion also teaches that others should not be murdered.\n\n I disagree. I've never heard of a Christian killing a gay because they were evil. Evil people kill people and sometimes the victims are gay. Sometimes the victims are weak men or women or other easy marks. There is an evil element out there that doesn't need an excuse to rob, rape and murder.\n \n\n Religions should have the freedom to believe what they wish so long as their members do not hurt anyone else, even if a misinterpretation of those values cause one sick man to murder another. Yet our laws cannot be so liberal. Our laws must treat individuals equally unless there is good reason to deny that equality, for if they don't then the reason implied to the nation. If we deny people any right without reason, then the reason can only be that those people are less than everyone else, that there is no equality. I would not blame a religion for a murder, but it is still unacceptable to transfer those religious beliefs into our laws. It is never okay to restrict rights or benefits simply because you believe your own religion is better than your neighbor's.\n\n Most of our laws have a basis in religious morality.

   "Well ther is also the goodrich case in Mass and the case in New york, those rulings will be used as well. Lovings vs Virgina is used because it declared marriage a civil, basic right and it is.\n\n \n Did you actually read the SCOTUS ruling? Here's the salient portion:\n \n\n The Equal Protection Clause requires the consideration of whether the classifications drawn by any statute constitute an arbitrary and invidious discrimination. The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States.\n \n There can be no question but that Virginia's miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race. The statutes proscribe generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of different races. Over the years, this Court has consistently repudiated \"distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry\" as being \"odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\" At the very least, the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications, especially suspect in criminal statutes, be subjected to the \"most rigid scrutiny,\" Korematsu v. United States (1944), and, if they are ever to be upheld, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permissible state objective, independent of the racial discrimination which it was the object of the Fourteenth Amendment to eliminate. Indeed, two members of this Court have already stated that they \"cannot conceive of a valid legislative purpose . . . which makes the color of a person's skin the test of whether his conduct is a criminal offense.\"\n \n There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy. We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. \n\n \n The SCOTUS ruling specifically addressed race...nothing else.",

We have a very, very good reason.\n \n \nAh, so being gay is really a choice? emoticon_confused\n\n \n I have no control over my sexual attractions, though I do have control over whether I act on those attractions, and as a bisexual I am capable of loving someone of either sex.

Homosexuals would not nearly be on the level of acceptance that they are currently at if this movement had not taken place, and if they had pushed for anything less than equality, they would have even less. There is always resistance at the beginning of a push for civil rights, and pushing the idea is the only way to ever bring about change.

Our laws cannot engage in that teaching.\n\n \n It's easy and convenient to claim somthing to the effect of \"Christians are killing gay people\" or their \"teachings are causing gays to die\" when nutcases who are associated with a church somewhere act against Christian teaching and do something evil. But people do this all the time who are not so-called Christians as well, and who are not associated with a church or Christian teaching. There are nutcases in all walks of life, unfortunately. \n \n Christian teaching that stealing is bad has not resulted in widespread killing of petty theives. Teaching that lying is wrong has not resulted in widespread killing of liars. Why should we think that the teaching is the real cause of nutcases who have commited acts of violence against gays? Why should we not assume it's the culprit who has issues? I think it is probably more accurate to assume that a prejudiced and evil person will be prejudiced and evil, regardless of what they hear in church, in most cases anyway. More likely most of these cases are people with preconceived extreme prejudices who found bad religious teaching to be an easy excuse. The teaching wasn't the cause, but the justification (in their minds) for something they would have done anyway.\n \n The bottom line is that the whole idea that Christian teaching leads to gay deaths is a non sequitor--you need to show a causal relationship for it to fly. In my opinion, true Christianity has done far MORE good for people in the world (gay people included) than any harm. I certainly don't see too many gay lobby organizations running soup kitchens to feed the homeless or calling for aid to oversea poverty victims. That's not to say they should be (as that's not their focus), but the point is that we need to keep things in perspective and not use the news of nutcases who do violence against gays as an excuse to lash out at religious teaching or religious groups in general. Or assume a causal relationship to be there when there's not proof of it, for that matter.

I highly doubt there is anyone here who would say there was no connection or causality between the murders and the climate of hostility that had been created.\n \n Much less disdainfully dismiss their reports as \"rare\" or mere \"melodrama.\"\n\n \n I guess you don't watch to much TV News. For example, everytime a Catholic Priest is charged with child molestation or a minister is charged with having sex with a parishoner, there's a news blitz and liberal feeding frenza. I'd say that overall, the major media goes out of its way to dig up anti-Christian stories.",

   "And your proof of this claim is? \n\n \n The news. Newspapers have reported that the Mormon Church (the institution) as well as the Caotholic Church (the institution) bankrolled Prop. 22 in California. Also, both churches bankrolled the marriage amendment in Hawaii. It seems like every other week, the pope or some catholic bishop is condemning gays (not just marriage). Countless TV appearances where people from the TVC, AFA, or CWA (of all people) are denigrating gays. They are all no better than the Westboro Baptist Church in my opinion.[/quote]\n \n \n \nI doubt you've heard a single one do that. And chances are there are pulpits who have said the same thing about voting Republican. If you had begun your tirade saying that \"some\" in the Mormons and RCC are like Phelps or are against gays, you might have some credibility in your statements. But all you've really shown is a propensity for broad, sweeping generalization.\n\n \n It was a bishop in Denver. My statements are credible because they are true. Whether the members of these churches believe or follow the dictates of their bishops is another story. However, the church (the institution) has been sending out mandates to all their parishes dictating how bishops and priests should respond to issues regarding homosexuality, and it aint pretty. During the Constitutional Convention in Massachusetts, we had priess and bishops either refusing communion to any politician that was againsd a constitutional amendment or telling them not to worship at their church. Hell, even one bishop announced that he would refuse communion to Kerry because of his supposed stance on abortion, yet Bush was supported by the Catholic Church, even though they were against the war and are against the death penalty. I was there to witness the hateful signs of the evangelicals who were bused into Boston to give support for the amendment. Even the Bishop of the Boston Achdioses had a rally with these same evangelicals denouncing same-sex marriage.\n \n But of course, I'm generalizing [/sarcasm]\n \n \nAhem . . . you certainly have here. :) \n\n \n Sure ... whatever ... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nSo Jimmy Carter knows that some in the church are against gays, some not. Unlike you who generalizes the whole church by the actions of someand can't seem to tell the difference between someone who simply expresses an opinion that the Bible frowns on gay sex from someone who pickets gay peoples' funerals and holds \"God hates f@gs\" signs. Many of the same people who you are generalizing in the church condemn Phelps as well. But I don't expect you to notice that, since you apparently think a billion or two church goers also picket gay victims' funerals.\n\n \n They may condemnPhelps, but their messages are the same. And that is what Jimmy Carter was criticizing. **** sprinkled with perfume is still ****. Only difference it smells af if one is trying to cover up the odor.\n \n \nYou don't need to remind me. You have your own movement to blame for the backlash you are experiencing these days. Both the election AND constitutional amendments are a part of that backlash.\n\n \n Of course! \n \n \"Shut up and get back in your corner, or I'll whup you again!\" - seems to be your mantra.",

   "It's easy and convenient to claim somthing to the effect of \"Christians are killing gay people\" or their \"teachings are causing gays to die\" when nutcases who are associated with a church somewhere act against Christian teaching and do something evil. But people do this all the time who are not so-called Christians as well, and who are not associated with a church or Christian teaching. There are nutcases in all walks of life, unfortunately.\n\n \n I have not claimed that Christians are killing gay people, and I have not implied that they are. But I think you would be hard pressed to find a murderer who has not committed murder because of the teachings of society. Certainly society does not teach to kill, but twisted minds find justification to kill where there is none. As I said, it would be absurd to prevent Christians from teaching a religious belief, but it is just as absurd to write a teaching into our law which grants a special title to heterosexuals. Perhaps I did not explain this well, but I think doing so is especially dangerous because it blurs the line between religious belief and treatment of others; it plants into people's minds that homosexuals don't get the same things as anyone else. That is not the place of the law.\n \n \nChristian teaching that stealing is bad has not resulted in widespread killing of petty theives. Teaching that lying is wrong has not resulted in widespread killing of liars. Why should we think that the teaching is the real cause of nutcases who have commited acts of violence against gays? Why should we not assume it's the culprit who has issues? I think it is probably more accurate to assume that a prejudiced and evil person will be prejudiced and evil, regardless of what they hear in church, in most cases anyway. More likely most of these cases are people with preconceived extreme prejudices who found bad religious teaching to be an easy excuse. The teaching wasn't the cause, but the justification (in their minds) for something they would have done anyway.\n\n \n Certainly it is the culprit who has issues, but all prejudice is learned. No one is born with prejudice, it is society that teaches it. You should not think that teaching that lying is wrong has caused no murders; I would guess that it has caused countless murders. How many have committed murder because they were angry that they were lied to? The hatred of lies is taught by society; lies are not necessarily harmful to anyone. The law has no place punishing lies, unless those lies hurt someone.\n \n \nThe bottom line is that the whole idea that Christian teaching leads to gay deaths is a non sequitor--you need to show a causal relationship for it to fly. In my opinion, true Christianity has done far MORE good for people in the world (gay people included) than any harm. I certainly don't see too many gay lobby organizations running soup kitchens to feed the homeless or calling for aid to oversea poverty victims. That's not to say they should be (as that's not their focus), but the point is that we need to keep things in perspective and not use the news of nutcases who do violence against gays as an excuse to lash out at religious teaching or religious groups in general. Or assume a causal relationship to be there when there's not proof of it, for that matter. Most religious people are good people IMO, and religious groups are doing a great deal of good that I'd hate to see the world be without.\n\n \n I have described a causal relationship: I have stated that the teaching of society cause a twisted person to commit murder. This is a very causal relationship, because even twisted minds do not commit murder without being taught to. Teaching disapproval of something teaches hatred of it to some, even though that is unintended. But even though there may be a causal relationship, certainly there are many causes that must come together, and the teacher cannot be blamed. Yet it is not the place of our laws to teach these things; our laws must teach that heterosexuals are equal to homosexuals, and in so much as it fails to teach that, it fails to be an equal system of laws.\n \n \nWell said.\n\n \n It was only well said if you took this as an attempt to demonize or blame Christianity. If this was not an attempt to do so, then the statement did not make any sense. I cannot speak for the others, but do not have that intention. I have the intention of showing why it is evil to grant homosexuals anything less but completely equal protection and rights under the law. The importance of this particular issue is negligable in comparison to the rest of the reasons I have listed; this issue is made large only because people have assumed their own beliefs were under attack.",

I have suggested that teaching a disapproval of lying leads to crimes against people for lying, and yet I support teaching a disapproval of lying. Although teaching disapproval of something leads some people with issues to cause crime, the appropriate course of action is to make certain that as few people as possible have issues, not to stop teaching disapproval of something which is bad. Some Christians believe homosexuality is wrong, and they teach disapproval of it; I would not stop them from doing so. But because homosexuality is not harmful and its immorality stems only from a religious belief, our government has no moral place teaching that it is wrong.\n \n \nAgreed it is the culprit who has issues, but the problem is that you haven't proven that society'e teaching of disapproval about homosexual actios is tantamount to \"prejudice\" or \"lying.\" You've made a jump from A to C without dealing with B. I would say that society's teachings on this are often NOT rooted in bigotry and prejudice, but rather a concern to protect the institution of marriage.\n\n \n Any Sociologist can tell you that people will tell you how in-groups treat out-groupls.

They will negative behavior shown by an individual in that group as representative of the group, and they will attribute positive behavior as an exception.

The overbearing message does not appear to me to be \"accept homosexuals\"; it is \"homosexuality is evil\", and it is that message which people learn by.\n \n As I said, it may be that if someone fully follows the beliefs of your religion, they will learn to accept homosexuals people, but just deny them legal rights. Yet this is not the message that is teaching most people. Your religion is not to blame, and it is not alone; the dominant group almost always unintentionally teaches disapproval of the minority group.\n \n \nOf course--making the message of an opponent out in the worst possible light is a common tactic.\n\n \n I don't know if that is quite right, or maybe just not quite fair; the Pope isn't out to portray same-sex marriage in the worst possible light, he is out to portray it in the worst possible light that actually makes sense. He calls same-sex marriage evil because of words in the Bible. He calls same-sex marriage evil because he believes that it is evil, and he is trying to explain why he opposes it. I am the same way. I believe that opposing same-sex marriage is evil because it harms people, and I believe that the Bible agrees with me. I call opposing same-sex marriage evil because I believe that it is evil, and I am trying to explain why I disapprove of opposing same-sex marriage. Both of us will list reasons for our claims to evil.\n \n \nNo, it doesn't \"teach.\" That's not why we have laws. Laws are simply rules that protect society.

Perhaps you do not steal because of moral reasons, but what about a more difficult example? Do you disapprove of a woman walking around topless in public? Why? How do you feel when someone speeds by you at 20 over the speed limit on the freeway? Why? What do you think of a person who hacks into your computer and watches your private Internet conversations? Why? What do you think of a stalker? Why? What do you think of an 18-year-old getting drunk at a bar? Why? I will argue that if you disapprove of any of these things, you have probably been taught by the law. I think that most people do disapprove of these things, and they disapprove of them because of the law; if our law was worded differently, some of the things that people see as immoral would not be so. The law teaches; I think the examples I have listed are more direct and do not adequately describe the subtle teachings of the law. \n \n If we agree to the idea that heterosexual couples should get a special title under the law, just for being heterosexual, then we agree to the idea that heterosexuals deserve just a little more, that extra something, and we write that idea into law.

Although many people tend to focus on whether or not homosexuality is genetic, that entire topic is completely irrelevant and pointless regarding whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry. The topic that is missing from your list is the topic of freedom, equality, happiness and harm to people caused by allowing or denying same-sex marriage. That is the topic that most gay rights supporters should be continually focused on, and it is my opinion that every time we allow the topic to be pulled away from that one, we are allowing our opponents to control the direction of the debate.\n \n \nIn both of these cases (and probably all cases) the law is not where I learned 'morality.'

Is it not the law that has taught them not to show such things to their children? The law tells us that men can walk around topless, yet women cannot. Is there any other reason that we should allow one but not the other?\n \n What about speeding? Surely you could kill someone driving at the speed limit too. So why is driving the speed limit okay, but driving 20 over is unacceptable? The law has provided a number for us, and suddenly anyone driving too far above that number is wreckless, careless and could kill someone, while anyone driving right around the speed limit is just fine. The law has taught us how fast is okay.\n \n \nActually, I'd hate to think that the law was my moral guide. It would mean than my morals were not rooted in altruism and goodwill, but rather a cold set of rules to avoid jail time.\n\n \n It would not necessarily mean that, because you naturally assume that the laws are rooted in altriuism and goodwill. In fact, that is usually a good assumption. You can agree with a law simply because other good people have agreed with it. But because we hold the assumption that other good people have agreed with it, we are more susceptable to be taught by it than we realize.\n \n \nI disagree.

The law has nothing to do with it, other than making sure people are accountable for their actions.\n\n \n But stalking someone does not put anyone in danger at all. It is just following someone around. Yet we have been taught that stalking is bad by the law.\n \n The same goes with hackers who listen in on your Internet conversations. They are not harming anyone, only violating the right to privacy that the law tells us we have.\n \n \nThis is a bit of a philosophical debate though, and I doubt we're going to be able to come to a conclusion of who is right. Some people out there may indeed use the law as their moral guide, or learn their morals and behavior from the law, but I doubt there are many.\n\n \n You're right, we may not come out with a good conclusion, but surely it is an interesting and relevant discussion. I do believe that the law teaches everyone, even though no one realizes it.

   "It is not what his remarks are about that matters, it is what his remarks teach people.\n\n \n Well, that's very much \"in the eye of the beholder.\" \n \n \nI suspect that the Pope understands a man molesting a young boy is not any more wrong than a man molesting a young girl. He would see such as an invasion of adults who have sex with children. \n \n \n Not necessarily--he is from an older generation and there is no reason to assume he would not hold to anti-gay stereotypes such as the \"child-molestor\" one. You and I know it is not true but why should we automatically assume the Pope knows? If he elevates other matters over facts and science, why would he not elevate his own prejudices over facts in this case? I suspect he hold the same frustrations as some priests who feel that the priests who are molesting kids are homosexuals who have made it into the church and their sin is being played out. Understand that I agree with you that gay people aren't any more likely to molest kids than anyone else. At the same time I know for a fact there are many priests who see the pedophilia problem as a gay problem.\n \n \nAlthough many people tend to focus on whether or not homosexuality is genetic, that entire topic is completely irrelevant and pointless regarding whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry.\n\n \n I actually agree with you on this. The issue of same sex marriage is not linked to genetics.\n \n \nThe topic that is missing from your list is the topic of freedom, equality, happiness and harm to people caused by allowing or denying same-sex marriage. That is the topic that most gay rights supporters should be continually focused on, \n\n \n I would say for most gay rights supporters that falls under the 3rd catagory I listed.\n \n \nBut why would some parents not want their children to see a woman walking around topless? Is it not the law that has taught them not to show such things to their children? The law tells us that men can walk around topless, yet women cannot. Is there any other reason that we should allow one but not the other?\n\n \n No, I doubt many at decided they don't want their kids seeing a topless woman due to what the law says about it. Most people probably don't even know the wording of indecency laws. I think for this there are deep cultural and sometimes religious reasons afoot. Think of it this way: do you think in a culture that had no indecency laws, there would still be parents wanting to guard their children from public nudity? I think there definitely would be. For every issue (not just public nudity) there are various reasons why people might feel a certain way, at at the least I would put \"the law\" close to the bottom for most people. I don't think the law is much more to most people than a set of rules that will get you thrown in jail if you don't abide.\n \n \nWhat about speeding? Surely you could kill someone driving at the speed limit too. \n\n \n Well, let me rephrase it to \"driving fast.\" I don't need the law to tell me it's more dangerous than driving slower.\n \n \nBut regardless of this debate, I can still think of no reason to justify granting a special title to heterosexual couples under the law. I still would like to know that reason, if you would be willing to explain it to me.\n\n \n For a \"title\", I don't see why it hurts to do it, as long as everyone gets the same benefits.",

Still, I kind of have a feeling that he sees this as an attack on Christian beliefs, that he feels that if same-sex marriage is legalized, then Christianity will fall apart. I think the opposite is true, that Christianity will be more likely to fall apart if it continues to oppose same-sex marriage.\n \n \nI would say for most gay rights supporters that falls under the 3rd catagory I listed.\n\n \n I see what you mean; the third category just sounded like it covered all the others to me.\n \n \nNo, I doubt many at decided they don't want their kids seeing a topless woman due to what the law says about it.

I don't think the law is much more to most people than a set of rules that will get you thrown in jail if you don't abide.\n\n \n I think that a culture with no indecency laws would eventually result in parents who do not care whether their children are exposed to nudity, yes, just as man before clothing did not care. Yet I think that such a culture would need to have the necessary supporting laws to back it up. Perhaps I should say that I think if our own society removed all indecency laws, then we would eventually end up with a culture that does not care whether children see nudity. But in a culture with unequal rights for women, or no consentual sex laws, or a religion which specifically states that topless women constitues nudity, we might see something different.\n \n Laws, I think are like writing the culture values of a society in stone. Laws preserve aspects of culture that don't make any sense, often. Laws create the culture of the future in so much as culture creates the laws of today.\n \n \nWell, let me rephrase it to \"driving fast.\" I don't need the law to tell me it's more dangerous than driving slower.\n\n \n You're right, you don't need a law to determine that driving faster is more dangerous, and you don't need a law to tell you how fast is too fast. Yet because there is a law, you have been taught how fast is too fast. You know the specific number. You could have figured out a number on your own, but you didn't; the law taught you that number.\n \n \nFor a \"title\", I don't see why it hurts to do it, as long as everyone gets the same benefits.\n\n \n But the title itself is a benefit, and I wish you could see that. The title itself means something, and if it did not, I do not feel that you would be arguing so avidly in support of making sure heterosexuals get that title. By the same logic, I might argue that homosexuals are the ones who deserve the special title, while heterosexuals deserve only civil unions. The title hurts no one, right? But even if no harm came from it (and I do believe there is harm), there would still be no reason to grant the title. We don't do something just because there is no reason not to. So what reason is there that we should grant a special title to heterosexuals?",

And I would futher argue that Christ did not believe it was the place of man to punish the wicked; it was the place of God to do so. Christ would never have justified leaving the creation and execution of such punishment up to man, unless it was necessary to protect harm to someone else. Christ would have supported leading through example, not through elevating oneself and punishing others through laws. I think he understood that so long as Christians punish people who are different, they can never teach those people. I also do not think he had anything bad to say about homosexuality, but that is an far less relevant point when it comes to what laws he would have supported.\n \n \nDid you support Vermont when they were trying enact civil unions for gay people? Did you want supporters of it then? If you did, then you are a hypocrite.\n\n \n No, I don't think this is correct. I think allowing opposite-sex couples marriage but leaving only civil unions for same-sex couples is evil, but it is less evil than no benefits for same-sex couples at all, and it is a step toward correcting that evil. I would certainly support civil unions over nothing, and I do not feel that makes me a hypocrit at all.\n \n \nI'm not following your logic on this one, please explain.\n\n \n Well, opposition to giving same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples can only exist as an attempt at social engineering. It exists not because there is some harm granted by giving same-sex couples the same rights as as opposite-sex couples, because such harm does not exist. Denying same-sex couples the same rights exists because either religion, one man's morality, or a one man's preferred definition of a word tell the government that it should institute a right which only applies to opposite-sex couples. They are asking the government to engage in social engineering to promote their own view over the opposing view. Granting this right, this benefit to opposite-sex couples encourages people to be part of such a couple instead of choosing whatever other family they might prefer. This is teh very definition is social engineering; the government is trying to mass-produce two-person, opposite-sex parents. This is social engineering at its most pure form, and the people who don't want to submit to that lifestyle have asked the government to extend those benefits to apply to more people, to dampen its social engineering so that couples who are just as deserving have the same rights under the law.\n \n \nTo be real honest with you, one of the reasons that I'm not a better Catholic is because I believe they're trying to become TOO politically correct. While I don't expect anyone but the most devout to follow every Catholic doctrine, I believe that the doctrine itself should be unyielding and not \"reinterpretted\" to prevent the loss of parishoners. For example, I understand the Church's old position on birth control. I chose not to follow it, but I understood it. I don't like the idea of the Catholic Church yielding to moral relativism in order to maintain or increase its numbers.\n\n \n What about the church's old position on kings over democracy? What about the church's old position on slavery? What about the church's old position on freedom? What about the church's old position on the role of women? Was it acceptable to reevaluate these things simply by becoming a new branch? Catholicism will reflect the interpretation of the Bible held by the people in power, and if those people change, and the members change, then so will the Biblical interpretation. The church is being politically correct because the people who run it have changed their minds about what the words of the Bible mean. I understand that it may not be the same interpreation you hold, but the church is not yielding to moral relativism, it is yielding to the beliefs of its members.",

As a Lord Action said \"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" When the RCC held the positions you speak of, they were playing the role of government, not church. That's why I see a difference in the RCC's moral stances today on many matters (value of life, anti-death penalty, sanctity of marriage, etc.) from it's stances in the past. It wasn't the same church in those times, and arguably wasn't the 'church' at all. It was church/government, with the Pope acting more as monarch than spiritual authority.",

I do think that you are a good person, and I know you wouldn't intentionally do anything evil. But we all do evil things unintentionally, and I feel that evil is the correct word here.\n \n Try to understand where I'm coming from; I don't think there is any reason to preserve an institution that only opposite-sex couples can participate in. To me, it is no different than keeping the term \"citizen\" for white people only and granting the term \"civil person\" to all other races. There just isn't a reason to do that. It's wrong. And even if the term \"citizen\" meant only white people, then we either need to change the name of the institution, change the definition of the word, or remove the institution from our laws. There just can't be an institution that only white people are allowed to participate in, just as there can be no institution that only opposite-sex couples are allowed to participate in. Even though white people might be far less evil by removing slavery and allowing minority races to have almost the same rights, so long as white people keep one special institution under the law for themselves, they just aren't fair. It's a little bit of selfishness, and desire to be superior, even though people might not be able to admit that to themselves. It is a little bit of evil.\n \n I have asked before, but I'm afraid I still do not see your side of it. Why should we preserve marriage as a legal institution only for opposite-sex couples? Who is benefited by that? What is the reason we should do that? Why not either get rid of the legal recognition of marriage, or allow same-sex couples to participate in it too? If there was a good reason to keep marriage as it is, to give opposite-sex couples their own special institution, then I might be able to understand this, but I don't know of any reason for it at all.\n \n \nActually the matters you speak of were held by the RCC when IT was in power. We must never forget that Catholicism's most inhumane moments happened when it was historically playing the role of civil government. (The church was never designed for this, from the get-go, IMO.) As a Lord Action said \"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" When the RCC held the positions you speak of, they were playing the role of government, not church. That's why I see a difference in the RCC's moral stances today on many matters (value of life, anti-death penalty, sanctity of marriage, etc.) from it's stances in the past. It wasn't the same church in those times, and arguably wasn't the 'church' at all. It was church/government, with the Pope acting more as monarch than spiritual authority.\n\n \n I agree. I mean, JPSartre was saying that he doesn't like the church reinterpreting the words of religious documents, but I think the church has changed a lot for the better over the years, and I do not think that has meant keeping traditional interpretations of religious documents sacred.",

Also, it would not bother me in the least if the word citizen was used for another group and my group was called something else.\n\n \n But that's not quite the situation here. What is happening is not that everyone falls into the civil unions category while only the elite fall into the marriage category. There isn't a different term or different institution just for same-sex couples, there is an institution for everyone, and a second institution only for opposite-sex couples.\n \n But regardless, I think that you would feel a whole lot differently about giving yourself a different name if you were part of a minority group. For example, try to create a new institution called United Statesian, which is like a citizen, but it only includes white people. Ask any member of a minority race if they approve of such an institution, and tell them that it is only a title, but it only applies to white people because you want it to be \"special\". See if you can find even one who agrees with the creation of such an institution, and see how many become outraged.\n \n \nI think the crux of the problem for you is that you equate the term \"civil unions\" as being inferior to the term \"marriage\".

What situtation makes it a good idea to keep an insitution which is only allowed to opposite-sex couples? Under what circumstances would the roles have been reversed?\n \n Anyhow, whether civil unions are inferior depends on their interpretation by the people. Certainly I view an institution which applies only to opposite-sex couples as evil, and that inherently puts it far below an institution which applies to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples in my mind. But in the minds of most, marriage will be superior. Marriage will be a special form of civil union that only opposite-sex couples are allowed to engage in. Sure, opposite-sex couples could be in a civil union if they wanted to, but who would enter a civil union when they can have marriage? This will teach people who is deserving of additional opportunity and who is not, and there is no reason to have two different institutions if they are not intended to be something different. There just isn't a good reason to have two different institutions, and so long as we have them, they will never be equal.\n \n \nIf we give both types of couples recogntion, I don't see how they're any different in substance--only in the terminology.\n\n \n They would not be any different in substance, well not until someone decided to pass a law benefiting one and not the other, at least. But they would be different in their interpretations by the people, and that interpretation is clearly important to both of us. It is clearly the only difference, and if that did not matter to you, then you would not mind having only civil unions for everyone.\n \n The interpretations of disallowing civil unions to same-sex couples but not marriage implies specifically that we allow same-sex couples civil unions, you know, just because we want to be equal, but we want to make sure people know that our relationships are in a different category. Well, some people might choose to put themselves in the same category as same-sex couples, but most people will choose marriage instead, seperation from same-sex couples. It teaches a disapproval of same-sex relationships.\n \n \nIt would not be a \"special\" institution if the govt. granted benefits to both. Again, you are getting hung up on the terminology.\n\n \n I'm not getting hung up on terminology; I don't care what the institution is called, but it's got to be the same for everyone. We can't have an institution only for opposite-sex couples; that's what I care about. It is those people who want to \"defend marriage\" by keeping its definition unchanged who are getting hung up on terminology.\n \n I understand that marriage would not be a \"special\" institution if the government granted benefits to both couples, but being special is the same as being evil. We should be able to see here that marriage is special because it is exclusive; it doesn't offer itself to some people. Asking for such an exclusive institution, an institution special to oneself and people like oneself without having a need for such a special institution is the result of selfishness, greed, desire to keep things for oneself that are not granted to others. To have a \"special\" institution is to have an institution which does not apply equally to everyone. If people don't need special rights, we should not grant them.\n \n \nAnd I do agree with you that removing \"marriage\" recogntion altogether by the govt. may not be a bad idea.\n\n \n Well, I think it would be a good idea, but it's tough to fight for. People who tend to oppose same-sex marriage, many look for ways that same-sex marriage hurts them. So long as I can say, \"But you aren't affected at all by legalizing same-sex marriage\", I have a chance at convincing people. If I start telling people that I want to replace marriage, people will feel that they are losing something, that their own rights are under attack, even though I'm just changing the name so that it can be more inclusive. Gay rights activists tend to fight for marriage not because the term \"marriage\" is so important, but because it is their best chance at equality.

   "Geees, I've heard more fire and brimstone from you in the last two posts telling what you think is constantly being said in churches than I've ever heard in church! And I KNOW I've never heard a Catholic priest, bishop, cardinal, Vatican official or otherwise, ever \"yell\" in front of reporters about this or \"shout\" about anything of the sort.\n \n How about just coming clean and admit you're trying to paint all of Christendom a Phelps-like color?\n\n \n Why don't you come clean for once:\n \n You name it. If it's sexual, the Roman Catholic Church is likely to have problems with it, from Mary being conceived like every other human being, to Jesus having any brothers and sisters (which would mean that Mary and Joseph experienced the unmentionable), to masturbation, to homosexuality, to birth control, to abortion, to women in the priesthood, or even to priests being married to women, and priests experiencing the unmentionable).\n \n http://www.liberalslikechrist.org/Catholic/churchvsgays.html\n \n In decrying recent efforts to legalize same-sex marriages, the U.S. bishops declared that \"the principled defense of [traditional] marriage is an urgent necessity for the well-being of children and families, and for the common good of society.\" Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Vatican's chief doctrinal custodian, went so far as to declare in 1986 that even one's homosexual \"inclination,\" absent any genital activity, marks a \"strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil\" and thus must be regarded as \"an objective disorder.\"\n \n http://www.uscatholic.org/1997/11/cov9711.htm\n \n On orders from Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, about a dozen people wearing rainbow-colored sashes were denied Communion at Holy Name Cathedral on Pentecost Sunday, May 30. George said that wearing the sash indicates disagreement with church teaching that gay sexual relations are sinful and he did not want the Eucharist used as a protest statement.\n \n http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives2/2004b/061804/061804m.htm\n \n Catholic Church leaders worried about the growing acceptance of gay marriage and other legally sanctioned domestic partnerships are expected to launch a counter-offensive this week in Rome. \n Vatican observers say the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith will release a 12-page document Thursday titled \"Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions Between Homosexual Persons.\"\n \n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/07/29/MN210754.DTL\n \n Two bishops led about 1,000 devout, sign-carrying Roman Catholics on a five-block march through North Beach on Saturday to protest same-sex marriages in San Francisco. \n \"We need to speak out, with civility,\" Archbishop William Levada said on the steps of SS Peter and Paul Church before leading the procession of the faithful. \"We must keep society on the right track.'' Levada called same-sex marriages a \"regression in society\" and urged passage of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages in order to \"stand up for the bedrock of society -- marriage and family. ... The only possible resolution of this is a constitutional amendment.\" \n \n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2004/04/04/BAGQT60FTU1.DTL\n \n VATICAN CITY--The Vatican urged Catholics and non-Catholics on Thursday to unite in campaigning against gay marriages and gay adoptions. \n Catholic politicians have a ''moral duty'' to oppose laws granting legal rights to gay couples, and non-Catholics should follow their lead since the issue concerns ''natural moral law,'' said the Vatican's orthodoxy watchdog, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. \n The 12-page document, issued in seven languages, was criticized by gay groups across North America and Europe, where politicians are increasingly granting homosexual couples the same legal status as heterosexual couples. \n ''This new document is intended to intimidate public officials across the globe into doing what the Vatican has not been able to do on its own--stem the growing tide for justice,'' said Marianne Duddy, executive director of Dignity USA, an organization of gay Catholics.\n \n http://www.suntimes.com/output/religion/cst-nws-gay01.html",

   "I'm sorry, but this is incredibly naive on your part. \n \n It is the pope who is using words like 'disordered', not the random homophobe. It is the pope who is claiming that same-sex relationships in any form are destroying civilization, not some random homophobe twisting his words.\n\n \n Of course I realize this. I posted the link to him claiming that homosexuality is part of an ideology of evil earlier in this thread. But certainly you don't think that he supports violence toward homosexuals. Look at me, I claim that opposing gay rights is part of an ideology of evil. I claim that opposing gay rights hurts our civilization. I claim that opposing gay rights is an absolutely horrible thing to do. I would say the Pope is as morally wrong as he claims homosexuals to be. So if someone goes out and kills a person because that person opposes gay rights, am I to blame?\n \n I don't think I should be. I am supporting a cause that I believe is morally right. So is the Pope. Am I morally justified just because I am right? I mean, the Pope thinks himself right, and so do many other people. I cannot blame him for someone else twisting his words to create justification for murder if I would not do the same to myself.\n \n \nThat may be true, but right or wrong cannot be dictated by a mere book. Harm and consent should be the indicators of morals. Nothing more.\n\n \n I almost completely agree; I would just use the word \"happiness\" instead of consent.\n \n \nThat still doesn't justify the analogy. It is a bad one because, unlike stealing, the church isn't constantly harping on it. You do not hear pastors, bishops or cardinals constantly talking about the evils of stealing. The Church (the institution) can disctate whatever it wants. But they can and should be held accountable when their words deliberately incite actions.\n \n I will respond to the rest when I get home from work.\n\n \n The analogy did not imply that the chuch was saying anything bad at all about stealing. The analogy meant that although someone might condemn stealing, and some other person might get angry at a thief and kill him, we cannot blame the person who demonized stealing for this murder. I would say that just about everyone in our society thinks stealing a bad thing, but I would never say that society should change what it says about stealing just because someone uses it as an excuse to commit a far worse crime.\n \n \n____\n\n \n Hey! Where is my repsonse to post 384? Well, I'm just joking around; you don't need to respond or anything. I just wanted to make sure you didn't miss it with all the activity this thread is seeing.",

   "That may be true, but right or wrong cannot be dictated by a mere book. Harm and consent should be the indicators of morals. Nothing more.\n\n \n For YOU, that's fine--you may not be religious. But some of us (in fact millions of us) do happen to believe in a higher authority.\n \n \nIt is a bad one because, unlike stealing, the church isn't constantly harping on it. You do not hear pastors, bishops or cardinals constantly talking about the evils of stealing\n\n \n This is almost funny, because I've heard more from the pulpit about stealing than I ever have about homosexuality. \n \n It's obvious to me that you've taken on some stereotypes about churches and religious groups, most likely due to a few bad apples. I hope that you can at least see at some point that by far most religious people and clergy aren't Fred Phelps, and most preachers really don't spend much time at all even bringing up homosexuality.\n \n \nBut they can and should be held accountable when their words deliberately incite actions.\n\n \n Well there's a \"matter-of-opinion\" issue if I ever heard one. You've got quite a tall order to show causation in most cases, which is what you'll have to do to hold churches accountable--otherwise you're on a witch hunt against religion.\n \n I don't always agree with Jaxian, but in this case he's right. Blaming churches for nutcases just isn't a very rational way of dealing with it.",

   "What is oxymoronic about it?\n\n \n The Catechism of the Catholic Church is very clear on its position WRT homosexuality and it isn't a positive one. For example:\n \n\n ......\n The Catholic Church thus teaches: \"Basing itself on sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2357).\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Homosexuality.asp\n \n",

   "But that's not quite the situation here. What is happening is not that everyone falls into the civil unions category while only the elite fall into the marriage category. There isn't a different term or different institution just for same-sex couples, there is an institution for everyone, and a second institution only for opposite-sex couples.\n\n \n So if there were two \"institutions\" by which couples' benefits were given, one for gays and one for straights, you'd be fine with that?\n \n \nBut regardless, I think that you would feel a whole lot differently about giving yourself a different name if you were part of a minority group. \n\n \n Nah, I don't think so. As far as I'm concered I'm happy no matter what the govt. calls it's giving of benefits. It's the commitment that makes the marriage for me, not the benefits.\n \n \nFor example, try to create a new institution called United Statesian, which is like a citizen, but it only includes white people. Ask any member of a minority race if they approve of such an institution, and tell them that it is only a title, but it only applies to white people because you want it to be \"special\". See if you can find even one who agrees with the creation of such an institution, and see how many become outraged.\n\n \n Well, that's a race issue, and as such it is debated and supported by a whole slew of different points than the issue we are talking about. IOW, sure racial minorities might get upset, but perhaps for different reasons than you would. And citizenship is much more constitutionally supported by wording than 'marriage' is. And most certainly many people who oppose marriage terminology extended to gay couples do so for reasons not even close to racism.\n \n [QUOTE=Jaxian]Anyhow, whether civil unions are inferior depends on their interpretation by the people. \n \n \nCertainly I view an institution which applies only to opposite-sex couples as evil, and that inherently puts it far below an institution which applies to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples in my mind. But in the minds of most, marriage will be superior.\n\n \n Only because some have trouble separating the government's recognition of marriage from marriage itself. Anyone can call their union a \"marriage\" regardless of what the govt. calls it's giving of benefits.\n \n \nWell, some people might choose to put themselves in the same category as same-sex couples, but most people will choose marriage instead, seperation from same-sex couples.\n\n \n Wel, most people are straight. And marriage is, fundamentally, a straight institution IMO. At least it has been traditionally--and I see nothing wrong with that as long as everyone's needs are being met. I don't see why marriage being a straight institution is such anathema. \n \n \nIt teaches a disapproval of same-sex relationships.\n\n \n As we've already discussed, anyone relying on civil law for their moral guide in life is already in trouble. And we can't decide laws based on what they might \"teach.\" Can you imagine a judge making a decision based on that? I've never heard of such.",

   "I just happened to find this forum on a search through Google and was astounded at some of the replies I've read here. I decided after reading most of this thread that I wanted to reply.\n \n Firstly, the debate here isn't about marriage. Marriage is just the issue in which the debate is taking form. What really being debated here are issues regarding differences between the question of \"is being gay a choice\" and the belief that \"straight people are morally superior/generally superior to gay people.\" \n \n The first debate is a matter of opinion. I would be interested in knowing what some of the anti-gay marriage folk feel about the issue of gay being a conscious choice. If they feel that it is a conscious choice, then their feelings of superiority may be justified in some way. It may be understandable. If they feel that being gay is not a choice, and they still feel that being straight is superior to being gay then that could raise some serious issues about their personal moral character.\n \n Personally, I do not feel being gay is a conscious choice. As a gay man myself I do not see any benefits of being gay, and had I the choice to make I wouldn't have chosen to be gay. I think most people will tend to agree with me, that being gay is not a conscious choice. Those that disagree should ask themselves if they could ever be persuaded to be gay, or if they were ever faced with such a choice in their lives. I believe, barring any bi-sexuals, most people would say \"no.\" All evidence in this case seems to fall into the \"gay is not a choice\" favor. \n \n The second issue, whether or not heterosexuality is either morally superior or superior in general to homosexuality is a trickier case to handle and hinges much on if you believe being gay is a conscious choice or not. Either way there will be little said on the subject to change anyones mind. Although, I would like to point out the parallel of past civil rights struggles. During segregation white people did not \"hate\" black people; they did not segregate black people from white society because they hated them. They did so because they thought they were superior to them. That they were better than them. Certainly, when black people protested and demanded equal treatment under the law and in the eyes of the government this caused hatred between whites and blacks. The same can be said for women and their struggles for equal rights. The struggles gays face parallel those of the past, and oddly enough many of those who struggled in the past (women and blacks) are guilty of the same prejudices they once struggled (and still struggle) against. \n \n Certainly, it is human nature to think you are superior to other people who are different. Most people, for example, think humans are superior to animals and have a right to treat animals badly. They don't view themselves as having anything in common with animals and therefore do not empathize when animals are treated badly. (Unless they are cute, of course, then it's a different story! :p ) People generally think of themselves as important and like to think of themselves as better than other people.\n \n Admittedly I am guilty of this. I feel in many ways I am superior to many straight people because of the struggles I have endured, the struggles which have made me stronger than them, struggles that they will never have to face. Many black people feel they are superior to white people and vise versa. It is a common trait that defies boundaries of class, sexuality, race and religion. \n \n This, of course, brings us to the topic at hand. There are religious issues involved with the marriage debate. This is understandable, but I believe they truly have no place in the debate. It goes against the very law to make an institution giving rights or privileges to an established religion or group of religions. This, in and of itself, makes the claim that marriage is a religious institution empty. If that were the case then the government would, by the very law set in the constitution, have to abolish the institution of marriage all together. No one wants that. However, I do believe it is important to recognize and distinguish the differences of marriage as their ARE two types. \n \n First you have the religious institution of marriage. No one can define that, only a particular religion, church, temple, priest, or what have you can define that. The government, rightfully, has no right to tell a religion what it should or should not believe or what it should practice or what it should not practice. \n \n However, the debate is not over the religious institution of marriage. Most gay people can, if they wanted to, be married in a religious fashion currently. The debate over marriage centers around the civil institution of marriage as recognized by the government. Now, I am uncertain why gay people should not be allowed to have civil marriage and in fact many people (perhaps most) support civil unions. Allowing civil marriage, which would be called marriage as it already is, would not force a religion, a church, or otherwise to recognize that marriage. They could deny marriage rights to whomever they please -- just as they do now -- and it would have no effect upon them. However, the effect of not allowing marriage rights to gay people is a negative effect as anyone who is honest will admit.\n \n Certainly, there is the argument of tradition and this is true -- marriage is traditionally a heterosexual institution -- but marriage as all things goes under redefinition as time passes and society changes and adapts. Just a hand full of years ago it was illegal for a white and black person to get married, and marriage was forced to be redefined as a marriage between two consenting adults regardless of race. That, despite what tradition had been. Before that a woman was a husbands property, and with the granting of equal rights that changed, forcing a redefining of marriage. That, despite what tradition had been. Why, then, is it wrong to once again evolve our definition of marriage to include two consenting adults, regardless of race and sexual orientation? That would simply be the next step in the evolution of marriage.\n \n Of course, there are also arguments against gay marriage because it would \"open the door\" to other possibilities, and yes this argument might be true to a degree. However, those same arguments can be made for prior evolutions in marriage, interracial marriage in particular. So should we then abolish all interracial marriages and once again make wives the property of their husbands simply for the sake of tradition? Traditions, unfortunately, change as society evolves and changes.\n \n Now, this brings us to the options which are laid out before us. Neither side is going to settle until one side wins. Gay people aren't going to accept \"separate but equal\" civil unions, and heterosexual people aren't going to want to allow gay people to have civil marriages. So instead we will battle each other to death until one-side ends up losing which will result in nothing but hard and bitter feelings for generations to come. One would think, as \"civilized\" human beings, that we could come to some sort of compromise that would make all parties involved happy at least to some degree. \n \n The first post within this thread was one such proposal. I believe everyone here will agree -- gay marriage is eminent. It does not matter how many states place constitutional bans on gay marriage, once gay marriage makes it to the federal supreme court it will nullify them. Yes, this is the long hard road we will travel battling each other bitterly tooth and nail. The legislature will not touch the issue in fear of backlash and their pandering to political groups for votes. This leaves the courts, which is what they were designed for, to make the decision. Constitutionally, the same issue that applies to homosexuals applied to interracial couples. They won. That is why there is such a drive in Congress to pass a Federal Marriage Amendment, which would force the court (whose job is to interpret the constitution) to not recognize same sex couples as equal citizens deserving of equal protections and equal rights under the law. Of course, we all know and have seen that the FMA has no chance or hope of passing -- ever. This leaves us with only a matter of time before gay marriages happen in every state all around the country.\n \n I believe the best compromise that can be made was the one suggested at the beginning of this thread. That the government no longer recognize marriage at all and instead allow religious institutions to have that word exclusively for themselves, and instead anyone who wishes to be \"married\" in the eyes of the government will have to undergo a civil union. All prior marriages would automatically constitute as a civil union. This would, at the very least, allow certain groups of people to keep their word \"marriage\", and allow the benefits of marriage to everyone -- making civil unions completely equal to marriage from a governmental point of view. Of course, some would argue that this isn't good enough that they shouldn't have to redefine marriage at all and just leave things the way they are. However, the alternative is to lose everything and it is a battle that will be lost. It may not happen next year or the year after, but it will happen eventually -- even if it is 50 years from now.\n \n Naturally, this argument also goes much deeper and goes back to the argument of homosexuality not being equal to heterosexuality. Some people fear, and I believe rightfully so, that if homosexuality were to eventually be seen equal to heterosexuality then their beliefs that homosexuality is wrong will be frowned upon by society. That they will be regarded in much the same way that the KKK is regarded today. Well, there is no comfort that I can give in that because it will likely happen but it will happen regardless of whether or not gay people are allowed to get married. As time passes and gay people become more visible -- as surely is happening now -- we will become more accepted by the mainstream of society. Eventually, people will stop fearing us and instead begin to see themselves \"no different\" than us and you will be right where you stand now. The battle you face is not whether or not being gay should be equal to being straight but instead whether you are strong enough to hold on to your beliefs in the face of a changing and dynamic world. \n \n In the end, sixty or seventy years from now, this entire debate will seem foolish and silly to most people. Just as segregation seems foolish and awful to those who did not live through it, although those that did will not forget what happened and may even harbor some form of resentment to this very day. \n \n So, in the end what will those who are against gay marriage gain? I cannot see any benefit, any hope, as victory is not possible and the best hope that you have, the only hope, is to try and make some form of compromise.",

It may not happen next year or the year after, but it will happen eventually -- even if it is 50 years from now.\n \n Naturally, this argument also goes much deeper and goes back to the argument of homosexuality not being equal to heterosexuality. Some people fear, and I believe rightfully so, that if homosexuality were to eventually be seen equal to heterosexuality then their beliefs that homosexuality is wrong will be frowned upon by society. That they will be regarded in much the same way that the KKK is regarded today. Well, there is no comfort that I can give in that because it will likely happen but it will happen regardless of whether or not gay people are allowed to get married. As time passes and gay people become more visible -- as surely is happening now -- we will become more accepted by the mainstream of society. Eventually, people will stop fearing us and instead begin to see themselves \"no different\" than us and you will be right where you stand now. The battle you face is not whether or not being gay should be equal to being straight but instead whether you are strong enough to hold on to your beliefs in the face of a changing and dynamic world. \n \n In the end, sixty or seventy years from now, this entire debate will seem foolish and silly to most people. Just as segregation seems foolish and awful to those who did not live through it, although those that did will not forget what happened and may even harbor some form of resentment to this very day. \n \n So, in the end what will those who are against gay marriage gain? I cannot see any benefit, any hope, as victory is not possible and the best hope that you have, the only hope, is to try and make some form of compromise.\n\n \n Wow after all that and you still didn't say anything new.",

   "So if there were two \"institutions\" by which couples' benefits were given, one for gays and one for straights, you'd be fine with that?\n\n \n No, you misunderstood what Jax was saying. Jax was pointing out that what is being offered is a seperate institution for same-sex couples and that it is NOT acceptable. Please refer to Jax's earlier post to you in this thread explaining his argument, here.\n \n \n \n \nNah, I don't think so. As far as I'm concered I'm happy no matter what the govt. calls it's giving of benefits. It's the commitment that makes the marriage for me, not the benefits.\n \n \n So would you be 'fine' with gays and lesbians who make this commitment also using the term \"marriage\" to define it? Obviously not from your earlier comments, unless you are finally starting to see our point of view. Which would be a breakthrough. \n \n \n \n \nWell, that's a race issue, and as such it is debated and supported by a whole slew of different points than the issue we are talking about. IOW, sure racial minorities might get upset, but perhaps for different reasons than you would. And citizenship is much more constitutionally supported by wording than 'marriage' is. And most certainly many people who oppose marriage terminology extended to gay couples do so for reasons not even close to racism.\n\n \n Really? I guess those reasons would be the same reasons why interracial marriage was such an issue of it's time, right? Both arguments are based completely in religious ideals and dogma. \n \n \n \nOnly because some have trouble separating the government's recognition of marriage from marriage itself. Anyone can call their union a \"marriage\" regardless of what the govt. calls it's giving of benefits.\n\n \n So, what's your argument against the usage of that specific word for gay and lesbian couples? Since, as you say, \"anyone can call their union a marriage.\" Why not you change what you call your marriage so to remove all reference to religious sentiment? Even if you did so, do you think the majority of \"married\" couples would agree to having their committed relationships \"down-sized\" in such a way? \n I sincerely doubt it. \n \n \n \nWel, most people are straight. And marriage is, fundamentally, a straight institution IMO. At least it has been traditionally--and I see nothing wrong with that as long as everyone's needs are being met. I don't see why marriage being a straight institution is such anathema.\n \n \n Who said it was? Obviously you see it as one which leads me to believe then it is you who may have the twisted sence of what a \"marriage\" is or implies. \n For the word to be such an anathma there would have to be a much larger push to have the word itself stripped from legal books entirely. Since this is not happening, nor would it be approved of by the majority, nor is the minority attempting to do so, there simply is no anathma, as you call it. \n \n \n \n As we've already discussed, anyone relying on civil law for their moral guide in life is already in trouble. And we can't decide laws based on what they might \"teach.\" Can you imagine a judge making a decision based on that? I've never heard of such.[/QUOTE]",

   "\n VATICAN CITY--The Vatican urged Catholics and non-Catholics on Thursday to unite in campaigning against gay marriages and gay adoptions. \n Catholic politicians have a ''moral duty'' to oppose laws granting legal rights to gay couples, and non-Catholics should follow their lead since the issue concerns ''natural moral law,'' said the Vatican's orthodoxy watchdog, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  \n The 12-page document, issued in seven languages, was criticized by gay groups across North America and Europe, where politicians are increasingly granting homosexual couples the same legal status as heterosexual couples. \n ''This new document is intended to intimidate public officials across the globe into doing what the Vatican has not been able to do on its own--stem the growing tide for justice,'' said Marianne Duddy, executive director of Dignity USA, an organization of gay Catholics.\n\n \n Let me see. Unless I am mistaken, the Vatican is a recognized soverign nation. Isn't there some law about foreign powers attempting to influence votes of US citizens? Wasn't there some issue with attempted Chinese influence in the last presidential election?",

   "So if there were two \"institutions\" by which couples' benefits were given, one for gays and one for straights, you'd be fine with that?\n\n \n Actually, I would be more happy with such a situation than I would be with standard civil union proposal. Such a solution would not implicity place homosexual relationships below heterosexual relationships, and that is a good thing. But I would not be much more happy with that solution because it does not solve the basic problems of a segregated institution.\n \n Creating a union only for gays still means that we have an institution which people are excluded from based on their sexual orientation or lifestyle. Actually, we have two. Even though each group would have its own, exclusive institution, there is still no reason to keep people of a different sexual orientation out of that institution. The segregation will still result in one of those institutions being viewed as superior, most likely the institution of the dominant group, in this case, opposite-sex couples. The institutions are also not likely to remain equal. This is made all the more important by the fact that there just isn't a reason to have two seperate institutions that do the same thing; the bottom line is that there should be no right or benefit under the law which is denied to anyone based on that person's sexual orientation.\n \n \nNah, I don't think so. As far as I'm concered I'm happy no matter what the govt. calls it's giving of benefits. It's the commitment that makes the marriage for me, not the benefits.\n\n \n Aaaah, see that statement frustrates me incredibly. It first implies that homosexuals are not making the commitment of marriage, which is absolutely untrue. It next implies that I am debating that benefits make the marriage, which is also untrue. It further implies that it would not matter to you if everyone else was given extra rights under the law that are denied to you, and I don't believe that is true.\n \n I think you're looking at this as a debate about commitment, but this is not about commitment at all. Most gay couples already make the commitment of marriage, they already call themselves married, and they already believe they are religiously married. That's not what the debate is about. This debate is about a set of rights and benefits granted to same-sex couples. You say that commitment makes the marriage, and of course it does. I agree completely. But same-sex couples are still denied equal rights and benefits under the law, and our law is still unequal. The name of the institution that grants those benefits is not going to change anyone's commitment. It affects their legal rights under the law, and that is it.\n \n I still think that if you were a member of a minority, you would understand immediately that this debate is about rights, and you would not be satisfied if someone else was given more or different rights than you, simply because that person is a member of the majority.\n \n \nWell, that's a race issue, and as such it is debated and supported by a whole slew of different points than the issue we are talking about. IOW, sure racial minorities might get upset, but perhaps for different reasons than you would. And citizenship is much more constitutionally supported by wording than 'marriage' is. And most certainly many people who oppose marriage terminology extended to gay couples do so for reasons not even close to racism.\n\n \n It's a race issue to be sure, but it is not debated and supported by a different set of points that we are talking about. I just made up the situation. The person in that situation was justifying creating a seperate but equal institution for white people because he wants that institution to be special, not because he thinks anything less of minorities. It is precisely the same reason that you listed to me for denying same-sex couples access to the same institutions as opposite-sex couples. Yet even though that individual may hold nothing against minorities, you can bet every minority would be outraged, and reasonably so. There is no good reason to create a special institution for white people, and doing so implicitly places them above everyone else. Do you think it would be any better if that individual had created a special institution for white people, then a seperate one for minorities? Certainly it would not.\n \n \nOnly because some have trouble separating the government's recognition of marriage from marriage itself. Anyone can call their union a \"marriage\" regardless of what the govt. calls it's giving of benefits.\n\n \n You're right! So why should the government give a special institution to opposite-sex couples? Why should everyone not have the same institution, then call their relationships what they want? As you said, the government's recognition of marriage is different from marriage itself; it is not marriage that is being changed here, it is the the way the government recognizes people's relationships. I just want the government to recognize everyone's relationships in the same way. The people are free to think of their relationships however they please.\n \n \nWel, most people are straight. And marriage is, fundamentally, a straight institution IMO. At least it has been traditionally--and I see nothing wrong with that as long as everyone's needs are being met. I don't see why marriage being a straight institution is such anathema.\n\n \n Because under the law, there should be no straight institution. The law cannot grant different rights to someone because of his or her sexual orientation. To do so is just as morally evil as it is to create a special institution for men, for whites, for orange-juice drinkers, for Muslims, for blondes, or for anyone else who doesn't need special help under the law. Like I said, I do not care what the name of the institution is, so long as it applies equally to everyone. I don't care if one's religion says that marriage is a special institution for straight people, for white people, for blondes, or for anyone else, but the law cannot do that.\n \n \nAs we've already discussed, anyone relying on civil law for their moral guide in life is already in trouble. And we can't decide laws based on what they might \"teach.\" Can you imagine a judge making a decision based on that? I've never heard of such.\n\n \n Certainly a judge would never invalidate a law because it teaches something. A judge would say, \"seperate can never be equal\" or \"there is no reason to deny this right to these people\". But when we think about why it is wrong to do those things, one of the reasons is that the law is being used as a tool to promote the majority belief, the majority lifestyle over all others. That is not the only bad part, but it certainly is one. If there were a reason to create such an exclusive institution, that might be different, but there just isn't a good reason to do so. Let the same law apply to everyone.",

But we are not talking about sharing a building or restrooms. These are tangible things that indeed do qualify to be called segregational when done wrongly.

It becomes a lot more tenuous to call that segregation because by their very nature, benefits are nearly always \"segregated\" in who the benefits go to. If there were no segregation in govt. benefits ever, EVERYONE would already be given the funds that SS provides, as well as disability. (It doesn't matter that there may be good reasons for this segregation; the point is that there really is no such thing as anything OTHER THAN separate but equal when it comes to benefits.) The right to use the same restroom as everyone else is very different from marriage benefits, which again are more akin to affirmative action or disability. So all things considered, I would not see two separate avenues for assigning couples' benefits (which is really all we're talking about) as a bad thing. \n \n \nAaaah, see that statement frustrates me incredibly.

I suspect many of the couples in the first days of marriage for gays in Massachusetts and San Francisco used it either for politics or the benefits, or else they would't have waited till then to do it. If they really loved their partner and wanted to commit to them, they would have done it already. The fact it fell to a trickle when the media got tired of the whole thing further shows this.

Think of the tangible things we segregate. Bathrooms, dressing rooms, these things are segregated for a reason. What about the benefits we segregate? Disability benefits, social security benefits, again these are segregated for a good reason; the benefits are issued to help the people who need those benefits. In fact, comparing marriage benefits to social security and disability benefits should make it perfectly clear why we grant benefits: we don't just grant benefits to the majority, we grant them to the minority of people who need help. But we should never grant benefits based on sexual orientation, and certainly not to the majority sexual orientation. People do not deserve more or less for being of a sexual orientation, and the law should not grant or deny them anything because of their sexual orientation.\n \n \nNot at all--I am not making a judgement here either way on whether or not gay people can or do form commitments. But I do think that the nature of your argument elevates the benefits over the commitment, or else you would see that the \"term\" marriage is really not that important when it's all said and done. A govt. benefit is still a benefit, no matter what it's called. As Shakespeare said, \"What's in a name?\" Especially when the benefits could still be there.\n\n \n The nature of my argument elevates benefits over commitment because the debate isn't about the commitment. And my argument absolutely does say that the term \"marriage\" isn't all that important. I've stated many times that I don't care what the institution is called, so long as it applies equally regardless of sexual orientation. It is those opposed to gay rights who don't care about the commitment; it is those opposed who say that it does not matter how commited a same-sex couple is, same-sex couples can't have marriage. It is those who oppose same-sex marriage who value a term more than a commitment. There is no value in a name, but there is great value in the government granting the same rights to both heterosexuals and homosexuals.\n \n \nBut the benefits recognize the commitment, so you can't just separate the two. That's why the issue of commitment IS a big part of this issue. And that's why it pains me to see anyone (gay or straight) only get \"married\" to get the benefits--it's using marriage as a means to an end. I suspect many of the couples in the first days of marriage for gays in Massachusetts and San Francisco used it either for politics or the benefits, or else they would't have waited till then to do it. If they really loved their partner and wanted to commit to them, they would have done it already. The fact it fell to a trickle when the media got tired of the whole thing further shows this. And of course, plenty of straight people have also used marriage as a means to an end for selfish purposes as well.\n\n \n The commitment isn't part of the issue because both sides are equally committed. Both sides love their partners, and both sides vow to stay with their partners forever. Commitment has nothing to do with this debate because we're not distinguishing between the committed and the less committed. We're distinguishing only based on sexual orientation, and the alteration in our law does not change that commitment, it changes the benefits granted to committed people. We're by nature referring to committed people in this debate, but the debate is not over commitment, it is over the benefits that those commtted people recieve.\n \n Or based on your post, maybe you do not understand that gay people are just as committed as straight people. Certainly every couple in San Francisco who got married did it for the benefits or for political reasons. I can say that with certainty because I guarantee that they were married religiously long before the government legally recognized that marriage. I don't understand what chain of logic could lead you to believe that they were not. If your own marriage was not recognized by the government, then suddenly the government told you that they would recognize it, would you not go get that marriage recognized? Would you not celebrate that? Would you not repeat the vows to your loved one? Surely you would do all of those things, just as same-sex couples did. Everyone of those same-sex couples who got married had previously vowed a commitment to their loved one, but of course you did not see that commitment; how could you? You saw only the commitment that the showed on television, but it would be a huge mistake to assume that those couples had not made a commitment to one another long ago.\n \n \nYep, but that commitment is what the govt. recognizes to give the benefits. So it's inseperable from this discussion.\n\n \n Yet marriage is not that commitment, according to you; if it were about commitment, the government would be allowing same-sex marriage. It is about heterosexuality; you can only get marriage if you are a heterosexual. It does not matter whether you're committed. And that is not right. Sexual orientation should not determine what benefits and institutions you have access to under the law.\n \n \nMaybe. I think it would depend on a lot of factors, though. Regarding THIS issue, I don't think I would be inclined to give up rights just so I could have the same terminology as someone else.\n\n \n Yet you'd be giving up nothing but a term. You'd have exactly the same benefits and rights that you always have, except they'd have a different term, a different title associated with them. You are not losing rights, you are changing terminology. All that would change for you is the name of that legal instituion. As Shakespeare said, \"What's in a name?\" Especially when the benefits would still be there.\n \n \nSure it is! For instance, no one is trying to redefine an institution when it comes to the race issue. That's an issue of acceptance of another group. But regarding gay marriage, one can oppose it and still fully accept gay people, IMO. Also, Amendments have specifically been written to address both women's rights and blacks' rights. But not for gay people. Black people have sought the SAME rights as others, while gay people are wanting a right that no one else has: recognition of new types of marriages (same-sex). So the issues are quite different.\n\n \n Whether or not I am redefining an institution has no bearing on whether I am right or wrong. Assuming that redefining an institution is a bad thing assumes that something is right only because it has been done that way in the past, and such an assumption is an logical fallacy when I can show harm created by that past practice.\n \n Also, you said that race is an issue of acceptance of another group, but that it is possible to oppose gay marriage while fully accepting gays. Yet I would say that it is completely possible for someone to oppose being of the black race while still accepting black people. It is possible for an individual to ask someone to try to change his race, and to deny people of a certain race rights, while still accepting those people. Same-sex marriage is just as much about acceptance of another group as denying rights to people of a certain race is, or certainly you can agree that if it is wrong to deny a right to black people because such affects their acceptance in society, then it is wrong to deny a right to same-sex couples because it also affects their acceptance in society.\n \n \nThat's why I would agree for you to get the benefits you need. But we don't need call any sort of arrangement that comes along a \"marriage.\"\n\n \n People deserve the same rights; no one deserves different rights because he is a part of the majority-favored sexual orientation. I don't care whether it is called marriage, but we all deserve the same treatment, the same access to legal institutions. There can be no legal institution designed to benefit people of a certain sexual orientation; we need one institution for everyone.\n \n \nIn fact the issue of whether or not it \"teaches\" something wouldn't even come into play in his decision, because it is irrelevant. (assuming he is an impartial judge who is about the business of interpreting the constitution instead of trying to \"teach\" people.)

   "In fact, comparing marriage benefits to social security and disability benefits should make it perfectly clear why we grant benefits: we don't just grant benefits to the majority, we grant them to the minority of people who need help. \n\n \n So, hypothetically speaking, if gays were in the majority, you'd favor keeping the word \"marriage\" with straights?\n \n See, the benefits wouldn't be segregated--only the term. You are spending an awful lot of words over a word. Although I'm enjoying the discourse.\n \n \nBut we should never grant benefits based on sexual orientation, and certainly not to the majority sexual orientation.\n\n \n Agreed, again that's why I want you to have the benefits you need. We agree on this. We just don't agree on the gravity of the term \"marriage.\" I say it's not a big enough deal to warrant changing the status quo and calling other arrangements that come along the same thing.\n \n \nThe nature of my argument elevates benefits over commitment because the debate isn't about the commitment. And my argument absolutely does say that the term \"marriage\" isn't all that important. I've stated many times that I don't care what the institution is called, so long as it applies equally regardless of sexual orientation. \n\n \n What you want is to ensure is that they are called exactly the same thing--I don't think it amounts to a hill of beans whether or not the govt. refers to one or the other as a \"marriage\" as long as the benefits are ensured. However, why go and take away the uniqueness of that term from the one group that it is traditionally applied to when it's just a term? Why broaden the term's meaning? What if a racial minority decided it wanted the term white redefined so it could be included in that group, even though that racial minority was in fact not white? Would you support that? I doubt you would. You keep claiming that there is harm afoot here, but no one is harmed by different terms only.\n \n \nIt is those opposed to gay rights who don't care about the commitment; it is those opposed who say that it does not matter how commited a same-sex couple is, same-sex couples can't have marriage.\n\n \n Because traditionally marriage is opposite sex. No one is saying gay couples can't be commited, but they're not opposite-sex so applying the term \"Marriage\" is a misnomer. It has nothing to do with sexual orientation or the fact they are gay but rather with the term \"marriage.\"\n \n \nThe commitment isn't part of the issue because both sides are equally committed.\n\n \n Ok, if that's true, fair enough. \n \n But still, there is marriage (which is the commitment between a man and a woman) and the govt. recognizing it and giving benefits for it. The bottom line here is that I would be in favor of the govt. also giving gay people benefits, but I don't see a compelling reason to change the uniqueness of that word and redefine it for any arrangement that comes along.\n \n \nCertainly every couple in San Francisco who got married did it for the benefits or for political reasons. I can say that with certainty because I guarantee that they were married religiously long before the government legally recognized that marriage.\n\n \n I seriously doubt it. Every one? \n \n \nI don't understand what chain of logic could lead you to believe that they were not. \n\n \n Because they did a religious-style ceremony (wedding dresses, cake, flowers, rice, etc.) when the govt. decided to give them benefits. If the commitment were the important part, they would not have needed to do all that because they would have already done it. Speaking for myself, I only need to commit in marriage once. Not a first time when I make a \"religious\" commitment, and then a second later when the govt. recognizes it.\n \n \nIf your own marriage was not recognized by the government, then suddenly the government told you that they would recognize it, would you not go get that marriage recognized? Would you not celebrate that? Would you not repeat the vows to your loved one?\n\n \n I'd see no need to \"get married\" because I would have already been married. That's the bottom line.\n \n \nYet marriage is not that commitment, according to you; if it were about commitment, the government would be allowing same-sex marriage. It is about heterosexuality; you can only get marriage if you are a heterosexual.\n\n \n Actually, it IS about commitment--between a man and a woman. That doesn't mean gay people can't be commited--I can take your word on that. \n \n \nSexual orientation should not determine what benefits and institutions you have access to under the law.\n\n \n Again, I agree with this.\n \n \nAlso, you said that race is an issue of acceptance of another group, but that it is possible to oppose gay marriage while fully accepting gays. Yet I would say that it is completely possible for someone to oppose being of the black race while still accepting black people. It is possible for an individual to ask someone to try to change his race, and to deny people of a certain race rights, while still accepting those people. \n\n \n It would be more akin to a black person (or any minority) trying to claim the word \"white\" and redefine it to fit their skin color as well. There's just no point in it.\n \n \nThe role of our law in society is certainly not to be a teacher\n\n \n Now you are contradicting yourself.",

   "So, hypothetically speaking, if gays were in the majority, you'd favor keeping the word \"marriage\" with straights?\n\n \n Certainly not; straights don't need extra help any more than gay people. I mentioned the minority because it is sort of justifiable to give people benefits just because they are the minority. For example, one might support Affirmative Action, not because minority races are less capable but because they are in the minority and are inherently in need of extra benefits. As you may have read in a previous post, I don't think that is a good enough reason, but it is certainly more reason than simply just granting benefits to the majority.\n \n \nSee, the benefits wouldn't be segregated--only the term. You are spending an awful lot of words over a word. Although I'm enjoying the discourse.\n\n \n But that's not true at all; the benefits would be segregated. If we were talking about just calling one by a different name, we would not be talking about the law at all. The law has nothing to do with the meanings of specific terms. The law is about creating legal institutions which grant benefits, and we aren't talking about different terminology, we are talking about two different legal institutions. We are talking about different access to those institutions under the law. We are talking about institutions that could easily be treated differently by the law if a politician chooses to pass a bill that applies only to one. We are talking about keeping gay people out of the straight people's legal institution. Creating both civil unions and marriage has nothing to do with creating different terminology. If the government chooses to call an institution \"Welfare\" it does not change the definition of the word \"Welfare\". If the government decides to create an institution called \"Social Security\", this does not change the definitions of the words \"social\" or \"security.\" These are just the words chosen as names for political institutions. You are not arguing for a difference in terminology, you are arguing for a segregation of legal institutions.\n \n \nAgreed, again that's why I want you to have the benefits you need. We agree on this. We just don't agree on the gravity of the term \"marriage.\" I say it's not a big enough deal to warrant changing the status quo and calling other arrangements that come along the same thing.\n\n \n I couldn't care less about the term marriage. Keep it the same, leave it alone, call the institution marriage, or call it something else. It is equality of legal institutions that matters to me; the word \"marriage\" is no more than a word in the English language. The word means whatever people interpret it to mean. What means one thing to me might mean something completely different to you. But the law must not mandate a specific sexual orientation in order to qualify for access to a political institution.\n \n \nWhat you want is to ensure is that they are called exactly the same thing--I don't think it amounts to a hill of beans whether or not the govt. refers to one or the other as a \"marriage\" as long as the benefits are ensured. However, why go and take away the uniqueness of that term from the one group that it is traditionally applied to when it's just a term? Why broaden the term's meaning? What if a racial minority decided it wanted the term white redefined so it could be included in that group, even though that racial minority was in fact not white? Would you support that? I doubt you would. You keep claiming that there is harm afoot here, but no one is harmed by different terms only.\n\n \n I don't want them to be called the same thing, I want there to only be one thing according to the law. People can distinguish between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships using whatever terms they want, so long as the law makes them the same institution. I want to make sure that the law does not say \"Opposite-sex couples can enter the institution called marriage. Any couple can enter a different institution called civil unions.\" And that is precisely what will happen if we create civil unions and keep marriage.\n \n \nBecause traditionally marriage is opposite sex. No one is saying gay couples can't be commited, but they're not opposite-sex so applying the term \"Marriage\" is a misnomer. It has nothing to do with sexual orientation or the fact they are gay but rather with the term \"marriage.\"\n\n \n Then why fight for marriage to stay in the law? Why not fight to change the name of legal marriage to civil unions and apply that to everyone? Arguing to keep marriage and add civil unions argues both to write this definition into law and to create a special legal institution surrounding it. There is no reason for this special legal institution, nor does it make sense to write the definition of a word into law.\n \n \nBut still, there is marriage (which is the commitment between a man and a woman) and the govt. recognizing it and giving benefits for it. The bottom line here is that I would be in favor of the govt. also giving gay people benefits, but I don't see a compelling reason to change the uniqueness of that word and redefine it for any arrangement that comes along.\n\n \n Again, I don't care about the word. Changing the legal institution called \"marriage\" doesn't change the defintion of the word \"marriage\" any more than changing the institution called \"welfare\" changes the definition of the word \"welfare\". I'm not arguing to change the definition of a word.\n \n \nI seriously doubt it. Every one? \n \n Because they did a religious-style ceremony (wedding dresses, cake, flowers, rice, etc.) when the govt. decided to give them benefits. If the commitment were the important part, they would not have needed to do all that because they would have already done it. Speaking for myself, I only need to commit in marriage once. Not a first time when I make a \"religious\" commitment, and then a second later when the govt. recognizes it.\n\n \n Do ceremony, cakes, flowers, and rice have anything to do with commitment, or do they have everything to do with celebration and a political statement? Can you imagine yourself just running off and marrying someone you aren't committed to simply because it was legalized? Of course not; you aren't going to marry anyone just so you can get some benefits. You are not in a different mindset than a gay person. The people who got married were the couples who had made that commitment. If they weren't, then what happened to all of those couples? Did they just decide not to get married now that the government was finally allowing them to? Or do you think they just didn't exist?\n \n \nI'd see no need to \"get married\" because I would have already been married. That's the bottom line.\n\n \n Even if you had been fighting your whole life to try to get the government to legalize marriage? Would have just sat it out then? Would you not have taken advantage of the fact that the government was letting you marry? Would you not have celebrated? Would you not have tried to show the nation that gay people do want to get married and are committed, just like anyone else? That is what the people there were trying to do.\n \n \nIt would be more akin to a black person (or any minority) trying to claim the word \"white\" and redefine it to fit their skin color as well. There's just no point in it.\n\n \n If there were a legal institution called \"white\", I would certainly let black people take part in it, despite the name. Call them civil unions, call them marriage, call them \"unions of hatred\" or \"unions for kittens\". The name doesn't matter; it doesn't change the definition of those words. It is the legal institution that matters. We can't create legal institutions for people based on their sexual orientation.\n \n \nNow you are contradicting yourself.\n\n \n I am not; I have always stated that the law has no place teaching people. It should certainly not be created in a particular fashion with an intent to teach people, which seems to be the case with marriage. Although I certainly do believe that the law can and does teach people, I by no means agree that it is the role of law to teach people or that the law should teach.",

   "The true test of just how important the tradition and sanctity of \"marriage\" is to heterosexuals (especially those like jyoshu) would be to see their reaction to the creation of an institution for gay people devised by gay people and accepted by the government. I can imagine that it would offer quite a few advantages over heterosexual marriage, perhaps more clearly delineated levels of financial interdependence as mutually agreed upon (sort of a built-in prenup option), or perhaps a broader interpretation of \"family\" to allow individuals to bond legally in legal \"extended families\", not necessarily based on sexual relationships. These are the realities of our gay lives. What if the law recognized them?\n \n Clearly, heterosexual society has spent centuries working on \"marriage\" and what we have today is what they've come up with virtually free of our influence and suggestions.

It is the same benefits but a different institution. The fact that the government calls it something different makes it different. Civil unions would not be the same institution as marriage. Let everyone drink from the same fountain, and let everyone get the benefits of marriage from the same institution.\n \n \nThen why are you spending so much energy trying to get that word applied to gay people when I have said that separate terms is fine with me?\n\n \n Because although you intend to support only seperate terms, you are actually supporting seperate rights under the law, seperate legal institutions.

There is no such thing as an institution of \"legal marriage\" per se--the govt. simply gives benefits to those who are married.\n\n \n A legal institution is a set of benefits, grouped together. This means that when an institution changes, it changes for everyone who is part of that institution. Creating civil unions means that we have two seperate institutions, and each change must be considered seperately. For example, if a state Congress passes a bill that grants additional benefits to marriages and civil unions, a governor could simply line-item veto the benefit to civil unions, which then means that the benefits would apply only to marriage. If they were the same institution, that could not happen. Different names means they are considered as seperate entities under the law.\n \n \nI am arguing that couples' benefits should be given to both straight couples and gay couples. I am also arguing that the terminology (\"marriage\") stay with straight couples and continue to mean that, as there is no compelling reason to change the meaning of the word.

I fear, even, that you would not be willing to fight for civil unions, that you will simply continue to allow people to be hurt until they can convince everyone else themselves.\n \n Back on topic, there is a good reason to change the terminology of marriage, and that is because if same-sex couples are allowed to be called a \"marriage\", they will be less likely to be viewed as inferior by those who have been raised their entire life learning that true love leads to marriage. But I'm not even arguing for that bit of generosity; I am arguing only for exactly the same rights under the law.\n \n \nNo but only because I would never have waited for legalization to get married. I don't understand why a good number of gay couples apparently did.\n \n I would have already been married, rest assured.

It seems extremely likely, because that is exactly the way that I feel. It is exactly the way that most gay people feel. It is exactly the way that the people of San Francisco feel. I agree that there would be no need to celebrate twice unless you had political and PR motives in mind, and I can guarantee that every person who got publically married in San Francisco did have political and PR motives in mind.

That's the analogy. But of course they didn't, and the govt. gives the same benefits to blacks without the term \"white\" suddenly having to cover black people too.\n\n \n What didn't happen when black people were liberated is that white people didn't start choosing terms that had been previously denied to blacks and stating that by the definition of that term, blacks weren't allowed. What happened is that blacks were given exactly the same rights by the same name in absolutely every case. As I see it, stating that marriage is only for opposite-sex couples is akin to and just as absurd as white people having grabbed up the term citizen and saying it is only for white people. When someone says something like that, I am either forced to say, \"Then we're changing the definition, or we're getting rid of the word from our law\". We would never have been equal if we had said, \"then we'll call the rights of blacks something different.\"",

   "Oh, so you're just setting the scene for your answer to the question. I see. By all means, provide all the context you need.\n\n \n \n\n Since sexual desire is subject to a high degree of cognitive conditioning in humans (there is no biological reason why we find certain scents, forms of dress, or forms of underwear sexually stimulating), it would be most unusual if homosexual desires were not subject to a similar degree of cognitive conditioning.\n \n Even if there is a genetic predisposition toward homosexuality (and studies on this point are inconclusive), the behavior remains unnatural because homosexuality is still not part of the natural design of humanity. It does not make homosexual behavior acceptable; other behaviors are not rendered acceptable simply because there may be a genetic predisposition toward them.\n \n For example, scientific studies suggest some people are born with a hereditary disposition to alcoholism, but no one would argue someone ought to fulfill these inborn urges by becoming an alcoholic. Alcoholism is not an acceptable \"lifestyle\" any more than homosexuality is. \n ......\n on marriage...\n The first and most basic confusion is thinking of priestly celibacy as a dogma or doctrine-a central and irreformable part of the faith, believed by Catholics to come from Jesus and the apostles. Thus some Fundamentalists make a great deal of a biblical reference to Peter's mother-in-law (Mark 1:30), apparently supposing that, if Catholics only knew that Peter had been married, they would be unable to regard him as the first pope. Again, Fundamentalist time lines of \"Catholic inventions\" (a popular literary form) assign \"mandatory priestly celibacy\" to this or that year in Church history, as if prior to this requirement the Church could not have been Catholic.\n \n These Fundamentalists are often surprised to learn that even today celibacy is not the rule for all Catholic priests. In fact, for Eastern Rite Catholics, married priests are the norm, just as they are for Orthodox and Oriental Christians.\n \n Even in the Eastern churches, though, there have always been some restrictions on marriage and ordination. Although married men may become priests, unmarried priests may not marry, and married priests, if widowed, may not remarry. Moreover, there is an ancient Eastern discipline of choosing bishops from the ranks of the celibate monks, so their bishops are all unmarried. \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Celibacy_and_the_Priesthood.asp \n\n \n \n\n Prerequisites for entering seminary :\n .....\n #2 Freedom from sexual problems -masturbation for a period of a year, more than a single act of fornication during life that has not occurred in at least three years prior to applying for major seminary, freedom from all acts of homosexuality, bisexuality, bestiality, pedophilia. \n \n Actions that preclude moral ordination (A man who enters priesthood under false pretense is not a moral priest, nor may he subsequently become a morally ordained priest.) :\n ...\n #5.

   "Oh come on. You know good and well analogies are a perfectly acceptable common tool in discussions. \n\n \n Well, in this case, we have the very real-life example of the Pope's apology to the Jewish people.

It doesn't need tools to illuminate nuance.\n \n \n \nWell you've made quite a quantum leap from the church's view on homosexuality to selling guns (designed to cause physical harm). \n\n \n See, here's a good reason to stick to real-world examples instead of analogies when they're not needed. What I've had in mind while discussing the moral responsibility of creating an atmosphere conducive to violence is what I said I was talking about, Catholicism and the history of anti-semitism.\n \n \nIt's very telling when others seem much more concerned about the gun salesman (or church, if you will) and are much more eager to have them \"take responsibility\" (whatever they mean by that) than the perpetrators who actually did the crime. \n\n \n I think it's \"very telling\" as well.

I am offering people good reasons to change those beliefs, and I am certainly not taking away their right to believe whatever they like. If someone were giving gays the choice to engage in same-sex marriage or opposite-sex marriage, but giving them good reasons that they should not engage in same-sex marriage, I wouldn't have any problem with that. But this isn't what is happening; people are denying gay people the right to marry completely, and they are granting no reason except \"my religion should be law, and yours should not.\"",
