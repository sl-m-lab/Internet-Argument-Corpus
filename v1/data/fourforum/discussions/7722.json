Washington already has long-standing sanctions prohibiting American companies or individuals from doing business with the Islamic republic.\n \n Meanwhile, the White House rejected as provocative Iran's warning that the United States could feel \"harm and pain\" if the Security Council took up the issue of Tehran's nuclear research.\n \n \"Provocative statements and actions only further isolate Iran from the rest of the world,\" spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters travelling with President George Bush in New Orleans. \n\n \n This is, IMO, a pretty blatant shot at the oil bourse. Since the Chinese and russians both already have multi billion dollar energy deals with Iran, has it not occured to the geniuses pushing for these idiotic sanctions that they are not likely to be happy with them? While the iranian oil bourse certainly has the potential to crash the us economy, if we sanction away cheap chinese imports, our economy will crash just as surely. We are addicted to those cheap goods as completely as any junkie has ever been addicted to crack. \n \n Take it one step further. If we tick off half the world by imposing such unilateral sanctions, there is no reason for them to not strike back by dealing soley inthe euro based oil bourse as a retalitory measure.\n \n It is time for th US, and in this case our lawmakers in particular, to figure out that while we are certainly the worlds last superpower, we are so weak economically, and so dependant on foreign energy, imports, and continued goodwill from the rest of the world, that we little more than a paper tiger, and that measures liek this stand to hurt the us a LOT more than they hurt our enemies.",

I think that much of the world is starting to re-think their support of the US position against Iran considering that Bush recently promised to essentially exempt them from the NPT, despite the fact that we KNOW they have nukes. \n \n While the logic may seem reasonable to many Americans, I think that in many places people fail to see the logic behind that decision. Except the chinese, who are taking it as essentially a move of agression.",
