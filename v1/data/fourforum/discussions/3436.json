You post seems to be your opinion rather than a scientific reasoning. The idea that homosexuality is a choice doesn't make any sense. Why on earth would anyone chose to be something so many people arer against. \n \n I give you this bit of a paper on some of the evidence I can present as opposed to the opinion you have presented.\n \n http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gayscience.html\n \n Interactionist Hypothesis\n \n Few researchers believe that sexual orientation is completely biologically determined, despite the growing evidence supporting biological causation and the poor support for environmental factors. Most researchers work from the assumption that a combination of environmental and biological factors interact to produce sexual orientation, just as combinations of these two factors interact to produce most complex human behaviors. \n \n Valid issues have been raised with many of the biological studies. For example, Bailey himself was unable to replicate the correlation of homosexuality in twin studies in a recent, large-sample, Australian study. Another recent study failed to replicate LeVay's findings (Byre, Mt Sinai Hospital, New York). Similarly, studies have failed to replicate genetic marker results, like Hamer's as well as other brain structure studies. \n \n This doesn't mean that biological definitive biological evidence won't be found, it does mean that we must be cautious in our assumptions about the extent that biology participates in sexual orientation development. It also means that we must be cautious in using biology when entering the political, legal or philosophical arena to defend gay rights and affirm ourselves as gay people. Given the tentative nature of the data so far, if we rest our arguments on biology and biology eventually fails to prove our case, that could lead to negative consequences for our movement's progress.",

   "Britain \n \n \n \n October 13, 2004 \n \n When science is blessing and burden\n By Mark Henderson\n \n \n \n THE weight of scientific evidence clearly favours the view that sexual orientation has at least some basis in biology: research has largely demolished the argument that being gay is either a personal choice or purely socially constructed. \n Just what that basis is, however, remains open to question.Some scientists think genetics are critical, while others believe that conditions in the womb are of paramount importance. Most experts think that both factors might play a part, creating a predisposition that is then triggered by environmental influence. \n \n \n \n Homosexual behaviour is known in at least 450 different animal species. \n \n Ray Blanchard, of the University of Toronto, has shown that the probability of homosexuality increases substantially with each older brother a man has. Dr Blanchard has suggested that this could reflect the way the mother's immune system responds to carrying multiple male foetuses. \n \n The idea of a single \"gay gene\", however, is rejected by mainstream researchers.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1306892,00.html",

   "I think you read into the article only what supports you side of it. Not what it really says.\n\n i'm not the only person that read the article and came to that conclusion. i've read lots of studies on what people cite as a link between homosexuality (the behavior and the preference) and genetics. the flaw with these studies is the assumption that homosexuality is somehow different from all other types of preferences and behaviors. hundreds of studies for decades have been linking behaviors and prefences to choice based on what the individual gathers from his environment. what an individual comes in contacts with, he/she learns from and form habits and tastes that become part of their identity. thats how it always has been.\n \n all of a sudden, these \"scientists\" isolate homosexuality and are trying to convince society that it is somehow different from what years os research has shown about behaviors and preferences\n \n what's more, none of the experiments are convincing\n \n lets really take a look at the experiment itself.\n \n the research shows that among gay men there were a greater number of gays in the maternal line of the families. \n \n the conclusion the scientist come to is that the \"gay gene\" may be in the X chromosome. this would mean that in cases where the mothers both X chromosome contain this gay gene, all the boys in the family would be gay. but this would also mean that the mother herself would be gay. and if a gay man and woman have children, all the children, male or female, would be gay. similarly, if a woman has no gay genes in either of her X chromosomes, then none of her sons will be gay\n \n but consider this. in a family where the mother is gay, both parents are gay, or the mother has gays in her family, the environment the child would grow up in would be strongly influenced by gay lifestyle, attitudes and values. if all the children in a gay family turn out gay, then it should be no surprise, since homosexuality is the environment the child was brought up in\n \n the results of such an experiment doesnt point to the conclusion that homosexuality is genetic. this is not me reading into the experiment what i want to believe, i am showing from a logical perspective that the conclusion the article author comes to is not supported by the results of the experiment\n \n \nanother unfounded statement, that why they call it social science.\n\n do you know what social sciences are? politics, psychology, sociology, etc. you cannot determine genetics through social sciences. you need a genetic experiment to do that\n \n \nNot s true statement, you haven't read the methodolgy of the study and you don't know if they had the same enviromental factors. Just another unfounded statement\n\n have you? the article says that the results were based on homo- and hetero- men and their relatives. they looked at the statistical frequency in the maternal and paternal lines of these men's families to see how high the incidence of gay people on each side was. from what the article suggests, there were more gays on the maternal sides of the gay men's families that the paternal sides on average. using this statistic, the scientists come to the conclusion that the X chromosome from the mother's ovum contains the gene that causes men to be gay. yet the experiment totally discounts the fact that these gay men grew up among gays in their mother's side of the family. there is no reason why the gay environment wouldnt be the influencial factor in these men becoming gay. genetics may very well have nothing to do with it and the rsults (statistical frequency) would be exactly the same\n \n \n\"The key factor is that these genes both influence homosexuality in men, higher fecundity in females and are in the maternal and not the paternal line,\" Andrea Camperio-Ciani, who headed the research team, said in an interview. \n \n They studied the genes, that is gentic hence the word.

Based on my experience, it seems to be an impossible position to hold. \n \n I can see the attraction of it, it allows you to believe that you are 100% in control of all your choices and actions in life, and that you will always be able to freely choose to do whatever you please based on what you're presented with. I just don't see that as reality. I'd like to believe it too, but experience both with myself as well as others has shown me that isn't always the case. \n \n I think of it kind of like a poker game - you get unlimited draws of 1-3 cards, but your two hole cards cannot be exchanged. You have to play your hand based around those two hole cards.\n \n IMHO genetics plays a MAJOR role in not only WHAT you learn, but HOW you learn.\n \n Forget about a \"gay gene\" for now-\n \n In your opinion, is intelligence genetic?\n \n What about other abstract things like artistic ability? The ability to do complex mathematics in your head? Think in three dimensions? \n \n IMHO, and IME, you have it or you don't, it's genetic. Furthermore, it can't be taught or learned. You may be able to learn one of these traits to a modest degree of proficiency with a lot of hard work, but you'll never be as \"good\" at it as someone that it just comes naturally to.\n \n From there I'd go on to several personality traits that I would link to genetics based on my own experiences of watching several generations of family members develop.\n \n I'd like to hear your thoughts. \n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. I would never presume to deny or even discount the environmental influences on behaviour. IMHO it's not nature vs. nuture, it's nature + nuture.",

Try seeing the big picture.\n \n Why does stimulating the sex organs provide pleasure?\n \n We can keep breaking this down to the neurons, but ultimately, sex is pleasurable to ensure it's pursuit by humans. We'd be far less likely to reproduce if it was incredibly painful, or, if like the Black Widow, the female ate the male after copulation.\n \n By making sex pleasurable, it promotes an increase in the amount of intercourse and it increases the bond between parents, the ultimate result of each is a greater chance of propogation of the species.\n \n IMHO, each time you get horny, that's an urge to reproduce. It may not be your ultimate intent at that moment mentally, but biologically you're being driven to have intercourse. There's a reason why men think about sex on average every 10 seconds IMHO. I love football and snowmobiling, but I sure as heck don't think about them nearly as much as I think about sex.\n \n Without modern medicine, the number of times you get to have intercourse before it results in a birth is generally very finite, often the number is 1. \n \n As for animals, \"What animals have no urge to reproduce?\" was not my sole question. I would also argue that humans don't fall into that category, we just have the option of sex for recreation.\n \n The point is, if animals have an innate, biological, genetic urge to reproduce, what makes us different? It would require you to separate humans from the animal kingdom on a fundamental biological level, or alternatively, provide animals with the ability to choose to act based on conscious thought. \n \n From there I would carry the point to suggest that if that genetic urge is there, what prevents a minor mix up in DNA from directing that attraction/urge toward the same species? We've observed it in nature.\n \n Waxy",

We are physical beings, we have acute senses to operate in a physical world, and not only does it apply to humans, but it applies to all animals. \n\n and my assertion is that in such a society, the tall, handsome boy will obviously do better than the short ugly boy. this has nothing to do with genetics and everything to do with environment. the tall handsome boy doesnt have high self-esteem or charisma built-in, he learns that he gets approval from society based on his looks. vice-versa for the short ugly boy. please fill in the part where genetics is directly linked to how these 2 boys behave.\n \n \nSo, how do physical traits combine with our environment? That's the question IMHO, how do genetics, and therefore physical traits (and mental) dictate or influence how we respond, and how we are responded to as we go through life?\n\n how we are responded to is totally external. if society shuns you or approves you, there is nothing about your inherent physiology you can change. you can change your behavior and your value set, and therefore your preferences. in fact, we change our behavoir very largely because of our desire to be accepted by society. our personal values conform to society's general value template, and our behaviors must be curbed lest we go against society's laws and suffer the consequences. your environment (what you are exposed to) is what dictates the scope of what you will become",

The researchers also collected DNA samples from 123 healthy nonsmokers. \n \n The study found fewer heavy smokers had a CYP2A6del allele than light smokers or nonsmokers, and that fewer ex-smokers had a CYP2A6del allele than current smokers. \n \n The researchers conclude the CYP2A6del allele seems to restrict the amount of lifelong cigarette consumption in heavy smokers, but not in light smokers. It also appears the CYP2A6del allele inhibits smokers from quitting but also helps protect against development of pulmonary emphysema. \n \n \"These findings suggest that determination of the genotype will be useful in efficiently withdrawing patients from nicotine dependence in smoking cessation protocols with nicotine-containing materials, and will give a new insight into the pathogenesis of smoking-induced pulmonary emphysema,\" the authors write. \n http://www.hon.ch/News/HSN/513971.html",

   "Yeah, I'm dead serious. Try seeing the big picture.\n \n Why does stimulating the sex organs provide pleasure?\n \n We can keep breaking this down to the neurons, but ultimately, sex is pleasurable to ensure it's pursuit by humans. We'd be far less likely to reproduce if it was incredibly painful, or, if like the Black Widow, the female ate the male after copulation.\n \n By making sex pleasurable, it promotes an increase in the amount of intercourse and it increases the bond between parents, the ultimate result of each is a greater chance of propogation of the species.\n \n IMHO, each time you get horny, that's an urge to reproduce. It may not be your ultimate intent at that moment mentally, but biologically you're being driven to have intercourse. There's a reason why men think about sex on average every 10 seconds IMHO. I love football and snowmobiling, but I sure as heck don't think about them nearly as much as I think about sex.\n \n Without modern medicine, the number of times you get to have intercourse before it results in a birth is generally very finite, often the number is 1. \n \n As for animals, \"What animals have no urge to reproduce?\" was not my sole question. I would also argue that humans don't fall into that category, we just have the option of sex for recreation.\n \n The point is, if animals have an innate, biological, genetic urge to reproduce, what makes us different? It would require you to separate humans from the animal kingdom on a fundamental biological level, or alternatively, provide animals with the ability to choose to act based on conscious thought. \n \n From there I would carry the point to suggest that if that genetic urge is there, what prevents a minor mix up in DNA from directing that attraction/urge toward the same species? We've observed it in nature.\n \n Waxy\n\n first of all, stimulating the sex organs and reproduction can be totally foreign (ask gay people, people who masturbate, people who use protection and people who have abortions). if sex was painful, nobody would make a big deal out of it in the commercial sense as it is today. yet when you need to reproduce, you'd have to go through the pain (ask any mother about this). \n \n if this was the case, then why isnt diet and exercise more pleasurable than eating pizza and playing video games all day? if you are arguing on the basis that we naturally have an urge to do activities that will encourage perpetuation of the species, you argument has already fallen apart\n \n why is drug use and thrill-seeking pleasureable? both activities are completely contrary to survival, yet they are more pleasurable than living moderately and being introverted.\n \n i fail to see your point.",

Same for the short kid.\n \n I keep going back to the cards, both guys are dealt two cards face up, one guy has a pair of Aces and the other guy has a 9 and a 2. Those two cards will always dictate how the hand is played, and how others react to the hands.\n \n Now to expand on that, let's reverse the situation, or at least change it up a little, and add in some \"mental genetics\". Let's say our tall kid is bit of dolt, and our short kid is a genious. How does that affect how they go through life? Will that affect their behaviour? (Please don't tell me that everyone is equally smart/intelligent and that it's a function of society and the environment, if you honestly believe that, we're done here.)\n \n \nhow we are responded to is totally external. if society shuns you or approves you, there is nothing about your inherent physiology you can change. you can change your behavior and your value set, and therefore your preferences. in fact, we change our behavoir very largely because of our desire to be accepted by society. our personal values conform to society's general value template, and our behaviors must be curbed lest we go against society's laws and suffer the consequences. your environment (what you are exposed to) is what dictates the scope of what you will become\n\n \n I'll agree that there is little or anything we can do to control how we are perceived by society, thus the importance of initial genetics on our development.\n \n I suppose it is possible to completely change ones behaviour, my point is it's VERY unlikely, it's not even probable IMHO. Jocks don't become nerds and vice versa. You are what you are. Hollywood has made a living off of this kind of movie where the nerd tries to be \"cool\". It seems to me that in the typical plot they do all they can, but in the end, they realize that \"I have to be myself\" and that is rarely the type of person they set out to become.\n \n This is tough for me to get across, because I agree with much of what you're saying, your world definately influences your personality and behaviour, but IMHO, you respond to that world within the scope of your genetic makeup, and that genetic make up therefore has a guiding influence on your behaviour and personality.\n \n Waxy",

The fact that the two acts are not directly linked is no more relevant than saying that because our taste buds and linked brain centres aren't directly linked to the absorbtion of food that they don't respond to generally higher calorific foods favourably.\n \n I find it hard to beleive that genetics can't influence the brain to give it hard wired 'choices' seeing as the whole thing is coded for in the genes and there are instinctive behaviours in humans already.

That's false logic.\n \n Scenario 2-\n \n A= sex\n B= skydiving\n C= survival\n \n \nBoth A and C are agreed to be pleasurable.\n \n I'm stating that A=C, you're stating that B=A, so therefore either B also equals C, or neither A or B = C.\n\n i am stating that you cannot look at the relationship between sex and survival and conclude that activities that promote survival are always pleasureable. see below\n \n \nThe problem lies in the fact that A and B are not truely analagous beyond the superficial, and therefore the conclusion does not follow.\n \n Either way, your argument boils down to a logical fallacy.\n\n A=C implies pleasureable activities are for survival. i have shown that there are unpleasant activities that are for survival, pleasant activities that go against survival and unpleasant activities that go against survival. therefore the relationship A=C cannot stand as a rule. in fact, i have shown that A=C is the exception rather than the rule.\n \n \nPlease quote where I have stated that positive reinforcement is NECESSARY for survival. The rest of your point is purely a strawman.\n\n you said that a cold beer would make taking out the garbage more pleasurable. my point is that it would get done with or without the beer. i didnt say you said it is necessary. some activities necessary for survival are pleasant, some are unpleasant. regardless of the pleasure or displeasure derived from activities necessary for survival, they end up getting done. adding pleasure to an activity doesnt make it \"more likely to get done\" if it has to get done.\n \n \nAlso, you have not proven that the relationship doesn't exist, in fact, far from it, therefore, this is your OPINION, and definately NOT a fact.\n\n see above\n \n \nThey do have that natural urge, if you want to get really fuzzy, I'd suggest the urge to find pleasure and comfort are based in the urge to survive. Survival is more likely if you life is pleasureable and comfortable than miserable and uncomfortable.\n\n again, the relationship between pleasure and survival is the exception rather than the rule. survival happens when you overcome the discomfort and become stronger in hardship. survival is more likely if you are willing to do the unpleasant activities that ensure survival\n \n \nIt's not the exception to the rule by any stretch, that's merely your perception and the stance you've adopted. For every person that engages in the \"negatives\" there is one or more that engages in positives that also provide pleasure. Proper diet, exercise, marriage, etc...\n\n therefore there is no \"rule\" regarding the reltionship between pleasant activities and survival activities. i can easily list more pleasant activities that are detrimental to our survival than you can list pleasant activities that are necessary. furthermore, i can list more unpleasant activities that are necessary for our survival than you list of pleasant necessary activities. if there was anything to be said of a relationship, it would be that activities for survival are UNPLEASANT, with the exception of a few pleasant activities that are necessary\n \n \nAre you married? Have a girlfriend? Any family at the stage of starting to have children? No offense unkerpaulie, but you seem a little out of touch on this one. :p\n \n Ask them if they would rather party until they're 75 or whether they'd like to settle down and raise a family. Then ask them why. Next, ask those with children if they feel that raising children is strictly toil, or whether it is actually the most pleasureable and rewarding, albeit difficult, thing they've they've done in their lives. Finally, ask them if they'd give it all up tommorrow so they could go out and drink and party.\n \n We have a biological urge to reproduce, I'm really not sure how that can be denied. Coupled with that urge is the desire to see one's offspring survive, and that's where the individual sacrifices for the good of the offspring.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. From now on, I'm going to take it that if you fail to reply to a point that you have conceded the point. :p\n\n my personal life should not be an issue, but since you ask, i am married, 3 years, have a son almost 2 and another baby on the way. i work in a book publishing company in a job i hate, and i am in the process of moving to a bigger home and starting my web design company\n \n being married, working, paying rent and having children are all necessary activities that promote perpetuation of the human race. and while i love my wife and im overjoyed reading to my son or watching him doodle, there are many more instances of displeasure that i must endure. maybe for you, everything in life comes easy, so survival has no displeasure. thats good, and i strive to reach that point, but until then i still have to commit to the unpleasant activities as long as i intend to survive and perpetuate my family",

   "i am stating that you cannot look at the relationship between sex and survival and conclude that activities that promote survival are always pleasureable. see below\n\n \n I can see where we've broken down here, and the problem is, you're arguing against a strawman. I have never stated that \"activities that promote survival are always pleasureable\". That is a position you created.\n \n My simple point was that if something is pleasureable, you're more likely to do it, if you're more likely to do it, then you're more likely to succeed.\n \n Nothing more, nothing less.\n \n \nA=C implies pleasureable activities are for survival. i have shown that there are unpleasant activities that are for survival, pleasant activities that go against survival and unpleasant activities that go against survival. therefore the relationship A=C cannot stand as a rule. in fact, i have shown that A=C is the exception rather than the rule.\n\n \n You don't seem to understand these equations.\n \n Simply because A=C , and at the same time B=C, does NOT invalidate the fact that A=C. \n \n IMHO, you haven't shown that to be the case.\n \n \nyou said that a cold beer would make taking out the garbage more pleasurable. my point is that it would get done with or without the beer. i didnt say you said it is necessary. some activities necessary for survival are pleasant, some are unpleasant. regardless of the pleasure or displeasure derived from activities necessary for survival, they end up getting done. adding pleasure to an activity doesnt make it \"more likely to get done\" if it has to get done\n.\n \n Maybe, maybe not. I'd be far more likely to either forget or let the garbage pile up for a week or two without the added incentive. It might ultimately get done, but not as timely, and not as well.\n \n It simply is not reasonable to deny the influence of positive reinforcement.\n \n \nagain, the relationship between pleasure and survival is the exception rather than the rule. survival happens when you overcome the discomfort and become stronger in hardship. survival is more likely if you are willing to do the unpleasant activities that ensure survival\n\n \n For the most part I agree. Those that survive will be the ones willing to do whatever it takes. However, if doing what it takes is pleasureable rather than difficult, it will increase the number of those that ultimately engage in the activity, thus aiding in overall survival.\n \n I'm not saying that there won't always be those that will do what it takes, there will, what I'm saying is that by making an activity pleasureable, you'll increase the number willing to engage in it.\n \n \ntherefore there is no \"rule\" regarding the reltionship between pleasant activities and survival activities. i can easily list more pleasant activities that are detrimental to our survival than you can list pleasant activities that are necessary. furthermore, i can list more unpleasant activities that are necessary for our survival than you list of pleasant necessary activities. if there was anything to be said of a relationship, it would be that activities for survival are UNPLEASANT, with the exception of a few pleasant activities that are necessary\n\n \n Again, you're either simply missing the point or arguing against a strawman.\n \n \nmy personal life should not be an issue, but since you ask, i am married, 3 years, have a son almost 2 and another baby on the way. i work in a book publishing company in a job i hate, and i am in the process of moving to a bigger home and starting my web design company\n \n being married, working, paying rent and having children are all necessary activities that promote perpetuation of the human race. and while i love my wife and im overjoyed reading to my son or watching him doodle, there are many more instances of displeasure that i must endure. maybe for you, everything in life comes easy, so survival has no displeasure. thats good, and i strive to reach that point, but until then i still have to commit to the unpleasant activities as long as i intend to survive and perpetuate my family\n\n \n You're right, it shouldn't be, it was probably inappropriate of me to ask. I was simply curious as to your state in life since your experience seems to be so vastly different than mine despite the fact that I know we're very close in age.\n \n I wish things came easily. :p\n \n Anyhoo, I think we've beat around this bush pretty well, and lost the topic somewhere along the way. :)\n \n Waxy",

   "i think your last post cooled my head down a bit...\n \n ok, backtracking a little to see where exactly we got lost. first i assumed you meant the urge to have sex (being horny, busting a nut) was necessary to ensure reproduction, and therefore perpetuation. my argument has been that this is not a rule. pleasant activities dont necessarily promote survival, and activities that promote survival are not necessarily pleasant, therefore no general rule between pleasant activities and survival activities exist. \n \n my point is that survival would occur regardless of the pleasure or discomfort of the necessary activities. activities that both provide pleasure and are necessary for our survival are in the minority",

   "\n Marriage is a specially protected institution in most societies for a reason. If the definition of marriage is expanded to include other subgroups, it will lose some of it's status, and will be weakened.\n\n \n Hogwash. Marriage is between two people and it is up to them to keep it strong.\n \n \nThis is not a good thing, and will hurt us as a nation, and as a culture, in a very broad sense. Also, it doesn't help to take a wonderful and well respected institution like marriage and redefine it as something supportive of sexual perversion. It's a loss of respect that is quite injurious. Turning marriage into a haven for deviant behavior is a very bad idea.\n\n \n So do you want to talk about sex or marriage here?\n \n Sex is already totally and completely legal in this country. Ang as everybody is a consenting adult human - they can be just as perverted as they want. That goes for straight and gay pervs - and everything in between. Sex doesn't need a haven - it already has the government's thumbs up. All the stupid misguided stats you use in opposition to gayness don't mean squat. It's not illegal to be gay or have gay sex.\n \n So,with that stated. Just how will gay marriage hurt you. It won't. You can't provide a single shred of tangible evidence that it will do any kind of damage to anything but some people's sensibilities - and well, that sounds like a personal problem to me.\n \n \nWithin ten years of legalizing homosexual marriage, the words, husband and wife, will become politically incorrect.\n\n \n Another classic. Terms that become un-PC are terms that are used to label a group and that group finds derogatory. Husband and wife are the labels given to the two parties in heterosexual marriage. For the words to get un-PC, heterosexual married people would have to be the ones claiming offense.\n \n It would be like me saying what is and isn't offensive to a black man when I am white woman.\n \n \nThe homosexuals will then complain that those words offend their status as married couples and that everybody should be referred to as partners.\n\n \n Why do you think this? On what do you base this? Show me the evidence. Or once again, maybe you are just speaking for somebody else, That is really a nasty habit you should try to break.\n \n \nDespite the rhetoric of the sexual Left,\n \n \n LOL. What? -people on the right aren't sexual! Gotta remember that the next time a guy asks me out!\n \n \nChristian involvement in this debate is not based on fear or hatred or lust for power. Instead, we engage in this debate because, with love and honor toward God, we love our neighbors and want the best for them.\n\n \n Ahhhhh - so because you are Christian you get to tell everybody else what to do. Somebody had a wonderful post in here about how this is tyrannical. \n \n You don't get to make personal choices for other people Jamaan.\n \n This is so insulting. No gay person will ever consider this love. Heck - a lot of straight folk know better, too.\n \n How would you like it if I came into your home, told you how and when to have sex, what clothes to wear, what books to read, or arbitrarily made any decision for you simply because I believe it's in your best interest?\n \n Gay people are not lacking intelligence. This is highly offensive. Big time. \n \n \nThat includes protesting against this effort by some to desensitize this generation into believing that gay relationships are comparable to heterosexual ones and into believing that there is nothing wrong with homosexual sex. \n\n \n And I know of gay relationships that not only are comprable but completely better than many straight relationships. My son's mentor and his partner have one of the best relationships I have ever seen. They do much better than me or my parents did.\n \n \nWe do not believe that this is what is best for society.\n\n \n I don't think hate, discrimination or tyranny are best for this society.\n \n And don't tell me again this is about love. If it is - I challenge you to tell me how many gay friends you have. How many gay people have you talked to today? How many gay relationships have you witnessed?\n \n And of those - how many of them have seen this back-XXX idea that you know what's best for the poor dears - and then still called you friend.\n \n I will bet dollars to pesos the answer is none.",
