   "Yep, presumptive presidential nominee John McCain's selection for his vice presidential running mate: Sarah Palin.\n \n Here's what she said during a PBS debate in 2006 while running for governor.

Sure, Obama's been a Senator for almost 4 years, but for the last 2 he's been running for President. And as a State Legislator in Illinois, he voted present 130 times as his way of not committing to politically sensitive issues. After all, he wasn't in politics to serve the needs of the people and to make the hard decisions, he was attempting to build a record that wouldn't offend anyone when he made his move to run for president. His cowardice and lack of real commitment to real issues in favor of protecting an image and playing politics will most assuredly come out in this campaign. AND HE AND JOE BIDEN WILL LOSE IN NOVEMBER.\n It's Not Just 'Ayes' and 'Nays': Obama's Votes in Illinois Echo\n \n By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and CHRISTOPHER DREW\n Correction Appended\n \n In 1999, Barack Obama was faced with a difficult vote in the Illinois legislature - to support a bill that would let some juveniles be tried as adults, a position that risked drawing fire from African-Americans, or to oppose it, possibly undermining his image as a tough-on-crime moderate.\n \n In the end, Mr. Obama chose neither to vote for nor against the bill. He voted \"present,\" effectively sidestepping the issue, an option he invoked nearly 130 times as a state senator.\n \n Sometimes the \"present' votes were in line with instructions from Democratic leaders or because he objected to provisions in bills that he might otherwise support. At other times, Mr. Obama voted present on questions that had overwhelming bipartisan support. In at least a few cases, the issue was politically sensitive.\n \n The record has become an issue on the presidential campaign trail, as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, has seized on the present votes he cast on a series of anti-abortion bills to portray Mr. Obama as a \"talker\" rather than a \"doer.\"\n \n Although a present vote is not unusual in Illinois, Mr. Obama's use of it is being raised as he tries to distinguish himself as a leader who will take on the tough issues, even if it means telling people the \"hard truths\" they do not want to hear.\n \n Mr. Obama's aides and some allies dispute the characterization that a present vote is tantamount to ducking an issue. They said Mr. Obama cast 4,000 votes in the Illinois Senate and used the present vote to protest bills that he believed had been drafted unconstitutionally or as part of a broader legislative strategy.\n \n \"No politically motivated attacks in the 11th hour of a closely contested campaign can erase a record of leadership and courage,\" said Bill Burton, Mr. Obama's spokesman.\n \n An examination of Illinois records shows at least 36 times when Mr. Obama was either the only state senator to vote present or was part of a group of six or fewer to vote that way.\n \n In more than 50 votes, he seemed to be acting in concert with other Democrats as part of a strategy.\n \n For a juvenile-justice bill, lobbyists and fellow lawmakers say, a political calculus could have been behind Mr. Obama's present vote. On other measures like the anti-abortion bills, which Republicans proposed, Mr. Obama voted present to help more vulnerable Democrats under pressure to cast \"no\" votes.\n \n In other cases, Mr. Obama's present votes stood out among widespread support as he tried to use them to register legal and other objections to parts of the bills.\n \n In Illinois, political experts say voting present is a relatively common way for lawmakers to express disapproval of a measure. It can at times help avoid running the risks of voting no, they add.\n \n \"If you are worried about your next election, the present vote gives you political cover,\" said Kent D. Redfield, a professor of political studies at the University of Illinois at Springfield. \"This is an option that does not exist in every state and reflects Illinois political culture.\"\n \n The vote on the juvenile-justice bill appears to be a case when Mr. Obama, who represented a racially mixed district on the South Side of Chicago, faced pressure. It also occurred about six months before he announced an ultimately unsuccessful campaign against a popular black congressman, Bobby L. Rush.\n \n State Senator Christine Radogno, a Republican, was a co-sponsor of the bill to let children as young as 15 be prosecuted as adults if charged with committing a crime with a firearm on or near school grounds.\n \n The measure passed both houses overwhelmingly. In explaining his present vote on the floor of the Senate, Mr. Obama said there was no proof that increasing penalties for young offenders reduced crime, though he acknowledged that the bill had fairly unanimous support.\n \n \"Voting present was a way to satisfy those two competing interests,\" Ms. Radogno said in a telephone interview.\n \n Thom Mannard, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, said political calculation could have figured in that vote.\n \n \"If he voted a flat-out no,\" Mr. Mannard said, \"somebody down the road could say Obama took this vote and was soft on crime.\"\n \n Mr. Obama's aides said he was more concerned about whether the bill would be effective rather than with its political consequences. They did not explain why he did not just vote no.\n \n Lawmakers and other Illinois officials said the present vote was devised to enable lawmakers to recuse themselves from voting on bills that present personal conflicts. It can also be used in the routine day-to-day wrangling in the legislature.\n \n In at least 45 instances, Mr. Obama voted with large numbers of fellow Democrats as part of the tactical skirmishing with Republicans over the budget.\n \n Seven other times, he voted that way as part of a broad strategy devised by abortion rights advocates to counter anti-abortion bills.\n \n Pam Sutherland, president of Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said Mr. Obama was one of the senators with a strong stand for abortion rights whom the organization approached about using the strategy. Ms. Sutherland said the Republicans were trying to force Democrats from conservative districts to register politically controversial no votes.\n \n Ms. Sutherland said Mr. Obama had initially resisted the strategy because he wanted to vote against the anti-abortion measures.\n \n \"He said, 'I'm opposed to this,'\" she recalled.\n \n But the organization argued that a present vote would be difficult for Republicans to use in campaign literature against Democrats from moderate and conservative districts who favored abortion rights.\n \n Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general who was in the Illinois Senate with Mr. Obama from 1998 through 2002, said she and Mr. Obama voted present on the anti-abortion bills.\n \n \"It's just plain wrong to imply that voting present reflected a lack of leadership,\" Ms. Madigan said. \"In fact, it was the exact opposite.\"\n \n In other present votes, Mr. Obama, who also taught law at the University of Chicago while in the State Senate, said he had concerns about the constitutionality or effectiveness of some provisions.\n \n Among those, Mr. Obama did not vote yes or no on a bill that would allow certain victims of sexual crimes to petition judges to seal court records relating to their cases. He also voted present on a bill to impose stricter standards for evidence a judge is permitted to consider in imposing a criminal sentence.\n \n On the sex crime bill, Mr. Obama cast the lone present vote in a 58-to-0 vote.\n \n Mr. Obama's campaign said he believed that the bill violated the First Amendment. The bill passed 112-0-0 in the House and 58-0-1 in the Senate.\n \n In 2000, Mr. Obama was one of two senators who voted present on a bill on whether facts not presented to a jury could later be the basis for increasing an offender's sentence beyond the ordinary maximum.\n \n State Representative Jim Durkin, a Republican who was a co-sponsor of the bill, said it was intended to bring state law in line with a United States Supreme Court decision that nullified a practice of introducing new evidence to a judge in the sentencing phase of the trial, after a jury conviction on other charges.\n \n The bill sailed through both chambers. Out of 174 votes cast in the House and Senate, two were against and two were present, including Mr. Obama's.\n \n \"I don't understand why you would oppose it,\" Mr. Durkin said. \"But I am more confused by a present vote.\"\n \n Mr. Obama's campaign said he voted present to register his dissatisfaction with how the bill was put together. He believed, the campaign said, that the bill was rushed to the floor and that lawmakers were deprived of time to consider it.\n \n Mr. Obama was also the sole present vote on a bill that easily passed the Senate that would require teaching respect for others in schools. He also voted present on a measure to prohibit sex-related shops from opening near schools or places of worship, which ultimately did not pass the Senate.\n \n In both of those cases, his campaign said, he was trying to avoid mandates on local authorities.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/politics/20obama.html?ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all\n \n And here's another article worth reading:\n http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-oped0826byrneaug26,0,4780984.story",

I just believe kids should be exposed to the Creation account in order to force them to think about the spiritual aspect of our existence. There is no way allowing kids to think about the creation account can be considered a bad thing over the course of a lifetime of information they will receive.\n\n Hear hear. I don't mind differentiating between the fact of something being true and the effects of believing it to be true. If someone wants to know material facts, science is the most reliable mechanism for arriving at them. If on the other hand someone finds a particular belief or perspective helpful or comforting or illuminating or inspiring, even temporarily, it's impossible to argue that said belief doesn't hold some kind of value. \n \n My attitudes have changed somewhat over the past few years of discussing these matters. I have concluded we each have a responsibility to decide, and to help each other decide, whether following fact or belief serves us better in any given circumstance. That doesn't mean we should compromise on our methods of establishing fact, as some Creationists would have us do by lacing all our methods with theology. Our choice should always remain a fair one. But just as fact and reason can and should inform belief, so it is sometimes possible for belief to presage understanding.\n \n One pertinent example is the unfortunate detour into Social Darwinism. Incomplete understanding of the ramifications of evolutionary theory lent unwarranted credence to the value of self-serving behaviour. I don't think for a moment that one single person heard about social darwinism and felt obliged - though they hated every moment of it - to act like an absolute bastard as a result. But I do agree with marc9000, for example, that social darwinism applied a false veneer of respectability to such behaviour and made it harder to criticise and easier to justify.\n \n That doesn't mean evolutionary theory itself is to blame, or that we should be morally opposed to the teaching of common descent, or any such nonsense. It's simply a warning that we shouldn't always thrash around changing the way we live our lives or view the world with every single new fact discovered or theory formulated, because there is, at the very least, something to be learned from the discrepancy between our beliefs and these new facts and theories. In the case of social darwinism, the knowledge plugging the gap between our moral sense and the rampant individualism apparently implied by Darwinian evolution was the less obvious evolutionary value of altruism. The theorists had missed something vitally important - obvious enough in hindsight when you consider that evolution has to explain the ultimate expression of altruism: multicellular creatures.\n \n What, I wonder, could we learn from the discrepancy between the widespread belief that we were specially created in the image of a god and the obvious fact that we evolved, just like everything else? Does that belief itself have value? Has it helped us or inspired us? At the very least, such considerations can give us deeper insight into ourselves. It may be that as a species we have become symbiotic with certain kinds of beliefs; that we need them circulating within our society in order for us and it to continue to function in the manner to which we're accustomed. Stranger things have happened: there's some evidence we're partially symbiotic with hookworm, and that their eradication in the West, while improving our general health in some ways, has unbalanced our immune systems and fuelled a rapid increase in the incidence of asthma, hayfever, diabetes and so forth. Again, the lesson seems to be: try to understand the value of what you've got before you go changing anything, so you can make the right kind of changes in the right way.",
