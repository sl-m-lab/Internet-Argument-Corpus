It is our massively out of proportion population that causes all our problems.\n \n If there weren't 6 billion of us, we wouldn't be using so much energy, thereby damaging the atmosphere and wiping out species left right and centre.

However, the planet is clearly not big enough for all of us and we clearly have an interesting and dangerous time ahead of us. \n While I can't see us literally wiping ourselves out (unless we actually have a nuclear war), if global warming, the energy crisis and the global conflict situation continue to get more severe, we will probably experience a very chaotic era which a large proportion of the population will not survive. I'm not saying this will happen quickly, it could take decades or centuries but it is looking likely. \n It's part of nature that when a species becomes too populous for its environment it experiences a drop, sometimes large, in numbers.

If a country as a whole comes out the other side pretty much OK, our descendants will still have the knowledge and technology\n to progress quickly and will not suffer from living in an overcrowded world.\n If you look at it from the point of view of the species as a whole, it would probably be a good thing. \n \n \nAmerica's not about to come to an end.

I just find it amazingly arrogant that some people think that we have control over the forces of nature, rather than nature having control over us.\n\n \n Our sun will not 'burn out' as such, it is too small to undergo a supernova and will expand into a red giant, swallowing up the inner planets and some of the rest of the solar system in about 5 billion years. We know this from looking at similar stars and determining that ours is about halfway through its life cycle. \n \n The reason many people believe we will not suffer extinction is the fact that we have developed technology. As I said before, I don't think we will wipe ourselves out completely unless someone does something really stupid involving a big red button marked \"nukes\". Even if we lose all the accumulated knowledge of the last few hundred years in a global crisis, the survivors will inherit a healing world and will, I believe, eventually progress on a similar scientific path. If the crisis is not that extreme and knowledge is retained, the survivors will be in the best position for long-term survival than any humans before, with a pre-industrial population combined with 21st century technology.\n In either scenario, it's a race against time to develop advanced enough technology that a sizeable proportion of the human race can survive anything the universe throws at it. Leaving our own mistakes aside, the biggest threats to long-term survival are comet/meteor impacts, natural climate change and the eventual death of the solar system. \n The biggest barrier to long-term survival is leaving the planet successfully; no one yet has any idea how this can be done, apart from fanciful notions with no foundations on solid science. It will be an incredibly slow process, with the colonisation of the solar system probably taking millenia, and interstellar travel looks like it will take even longer unless we can make large, stable wormholes, which no one knows is even possible, let alone how to accomplish.\n It is true that at this stage in our development we are in the hands of nature, but with enough time, we could reverse that process. Two quotes by famous scientist/authors illustrate this nicely:\n \n \"we are just animals embedded in an ecosystem; if it dies back, so shall we\"\n - Stephen Baxter\n \n \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\"\n - Arthur C Clarke",
