   "I would use as a context for judging evil Matthew 25:31-36:\n \nWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. \n \n All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. \n \n He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.\n \n Then the King will say to those on his right, \"Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. \n \n \"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, \n \n \"I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\"\n \n I absolutely believe that all this nonsense about being saved and having eternal life is an evil conceit.\n \n Too much emphasis is put on the supposed \"after\" life as opposed to life here on earth. I think this is done to make it easier for evil people to ignore suffering and not feel guilty if they cause someone to starve or lose their homes or jobs. One should also be very sure that one's economic conduct does not cause someone else to become homeless or jobless or lose access to health care.\n \n We have a national political debate right now between those who are so selfish that they don't believe that everyone has a right to health care, all they care about is the profit motive in providing health care, and they are so selfish that they demand enormous profits and they don't care who goes without medical care, they don't care that people die as a result of their economic selfishness. These are the most outstandingly evil persons -- and corporations -- that I have ever seen.\n \n One should feed the hungry, give aid to the homeless, care for the sick, look to those in prison and make sure that they receive justice but not because one wants eternal life.\n \n These things should be done simply because they are the right thing to do and as human beings we have an obligation to look after other humans and recognize that in advanced, industrial nations we owe a great deal of gratitude to the accomplishments of other humans who have come before us.",

   "I honestly believe that if one goes through life caring and respecting others the afterlife will look after itself. The problem is to remember this when it matters!\n \n As for health care. I have never paid a penny directly for my or my childrens healthcare. We in England complain about the car park fees at our local general hospitals.\n I can see my GP wthin 48 hours generally and if I need medicine it costs about $10 per prescription( not everyone pays for it.I think all medicine is free in Scotland buts thats another story)\n Our national health system is a big ,unwieldly money pit but to me and most others in the UK worth the money.",

ON ALL COUNTS. This is a perfect example of the convoluted thinking which guides the atheist left as they misrepresent every issue in order to serve their own perverse world view. \n \n Yo say too much emphasis is placed on the afterlife, yet the most generous givers to charitable causes here and now are christians and christian organizations on a world wide scale. \n \n And you use the scare tactics which attempt to divid and conquer by pitting the have against the have nots by making this healthcare debate about profit, when nothing could be further from the truth. It is about controling the people and their ability to take care of themselves without government intervention into our private lives. \n If we could get Government completely out of the healthcare debate and make it about supply and demand with competition as capitalism requires, the prices would plummet based on the demands of the market place.",
