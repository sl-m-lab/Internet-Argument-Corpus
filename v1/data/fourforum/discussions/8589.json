   "Israelite soldiers fired on UN military base which dislocated in Lebanon! Yes, Israel representatives apologized to UN General Secretary but who will recover 4 peacemakers' lives? Well, I think that all politicians' travail to adjust Arabs-Israel conflict goes to the dogs. Look, Israelites has modern equipment and armament but high-accuracy rockets are falling on UN bases and in addition to it they annihilate civil citizens too! To tell the truth the situation in Near East is turning to uncontrollable and spontaneous character. And the most interesting that UN Security Council wished to publish resolution about cease-fire in conflict zone but USA interposed a veto on it! By one word USA and Israel are countries-terrorists which working side by side for the sake of their own interests. And of course, Israel could attack UN bases in Lebanon because it feels US behind Israel's back! Who need the continuation of this war in Near East? \n The East is uniting... The humanitarian support is coming to Lebanon from contiguous countries (United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia). Moreover, as I know in Iran was formed some group of volunteers for help to their brothers in Lebanon but this is Israelite Mossad provocation only! I'm sure that USA incandesce situation in Near East knowingly. Americans and Jews are trying to push into the war Iran first of all for unleashing aggression against Iran. This fact is well-known. With time when Arabs from Iran, Iraq and other Muslim countries will come to Lebanon for the help, Americans will enter to the war too but in Israel side. This is countries-terrorists methods of work. The situation in Near East is well-thought-out conspiracy of CIA and Mossad.",
