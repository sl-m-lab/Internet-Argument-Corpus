Their pitching is simply horrible now.\n \n Realistically it looks like the Mets in the NL. The Yankees are also looking like the team to beat although the Tigers could give them a run for their money.\n \n Assuming they can keep it up, the Mets look like almost a lock to take the NL. Of course as you know, anything can happen in the playoffs. I would have said the Yankees were a lock up 3-0 on the Red Sox and bringing in Mariano Rivera, one of the best closers of all time. There's really only one way to find out.",

Pretty sad how the wild card team in the Central will have a better record than Oakland (the West winner) but that's the way it works I guess.\n \n San Diego-Los Angeles Dodgers @ New York Mets\n If the Dodgers win or San Diego loses it will be San Diego here, otherwise the Dodgers.\n \n St. Louis-Houston @ Los Angeles Dodgers-San Diego\n If the Dodgers win or San Diego loses it will be the Dodgers here, otherwise San Diego. The other race is a bit more interesting. The Cardinals have 2 games left and Houston only has one. If St. Louis can pick up a win either day or if Houston loses their only remaining game, St. Louis will be here. Otherwise Houston has completed one of the most miraculous combacks ever.

   "OK, here are my playoff predictions.\n \n Detroit's playing Kansas City and Minnesota is playing the White Sox. Kansas City is a pretty horrible team, but they've been scoring a lot of runs recently. Also the White Sox are already out and the Twins will be playing for a shot to play the A's rather than the Yankees AND have home field advantage. I can't even guess how the Detroit game will play out, but I see the Twins picking up the win and clinching the AL Central.\n \n St. Louis has 2 games left, and winning one of them clinches the NL Central. Carpenter, seemingly their only ace left, looks to come into this crucial game and pick up the win against Villanueva (1-2) in the clutch. This will render the other 2 games irrelevant.\n \n The Dodgers-Giants and the Padres-DBacks games should be great games. They all seem to have their aces on the mound. We've got Lowe vs. Schmidt and Williams vs. Webb. Between the Dodgers' hot streak against a not so great Giants team and San Diego going into Arizona taking on Webb, one of the best pitchers in the game, even though he is on a mediocre team, I see the Dodgers taking this one.\n \n Now for the actual matchups.\n \n Twins over A's - 5 games\n Yankees over Tigers - 7 games\n Mets over Padres - 5 games\n Cardinals over Dodgers - 7 games\n \n Yankees over Twins - 6 games\n Mets over Cardinals - 4 games\n \n World Series - Mets over Yankees - 6 games",
