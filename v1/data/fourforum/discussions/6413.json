Love is a choice to do what is in the best interests of another regardless of the cost. Would you not say that your friend dying for you is an act of love. What if someone you called an enemy but who did not see you as an enemy chose to die for you? Is that not an act of love as well?\n \n Trebor: You mistake affection for Love. God does want your affection, but as you point out in mommie dearest, if it is not freely given then it is not love. The difference with God is that he says you don't have to if you don't want to. If you are coerced into it because of fear of hell, then by all means do not accept it. You would not enjoy being with him anyways.\n \n I have defined hell more consistently with christian doctrine as eternal separation from God. You have defined it as burning forever. They are different . I actually think the first would be worse.\n \n However, If you do not see god as loving and do not believe in him then don't . I am not trying to convince you to believe in god. I am trying to correct the doctrinal statements that are being made about christianity. If you want to say \"this is christian doctrine\" and then you base your decisions on what YOU have declared as christian doctrine rather than what it really is, that is simply you justifying your position and not actually working from correct information.\n \n At least decide based on what is really true. What you have done is declared something which is false, to be true and then decided that it was terrible.\n \n It would be the same as me saying Islam requires the sacrifice of the first born to demons, and then saying I hate islam because of that. I made a statement that is not true and then drew conclusions based on something that is false. Now if a muslim comes and says, no that is not the muslim doctrine, then who am I a, non muslim, to claim that it is? I may have studied it, but I have less authority than a muslim who says,. no this is what the doctrine really is. (This is just a hypothetical example, with no basis in truth whatsoever).\n \n This is all you are doing in this argument.\n\n \n \n No, I don't. You are the one that insists there is an eterinal hell. Why?? I don't know, it isn't I that is insisting on 'eternal hell'. It is you. And, I don't see how creating a place of eternal torture if someone doesn't worship you in the right way is love. \n \n It , I think, is more of a reflection on you than on any hypothetical god.",

   "Well, since the christian belief is \"ashes to ashes\" and that our physical being is merely that, \"physical\" (or \"in the flesh\") and our spiritual being has no physical properties, the myth of eternal burning in a mythical hell is contadictory as there will be nothing left that is physical to burn after we have died and became spiritual in nature. No teeth left to \"gnash.\"\n \n Satan? God? Both mythical but I really can't tell any difference between the two. Here, you got the \"Satan\" character, a super-bad guy who gets all the blame, and on the other hand you got the God character, who is this super good-guy, that has actually done (if we are to believe the bible :p ) acts that are so beyond evil you have to wonder if Stephen King himself wrote the bible. And God is supposed to be the good guy? I think the guys who created the \"God\" character and wrote of his works must be really twisted individuals. I don't think even Jeffery Dahmer could come up with stuff that gruesome.\n \n I hope that if I ever meet anyone who is \"god-like\" they are securely held behind bars. emoticon_wow \n \n Boy howdy. No wonder all these religious folks get so screwed up. I would imagine it to be rather difficult to weave all the myths and legends into anything believable by any stretch of the imagination. And spinning the evils of this so called \"god\" into intrepretaions of love and mercy must be a full time job. I sometimes wonder, if there really is a heaven, if God doesn't have a full-time \"Karl Rove\" type angel up there working overtime. Bad is good. Up is down. Death is life.

He is the very definition of it. God is the objective authority, not the bible. I do believe the bible to be God's revelation to man, and I have reasons for that beyond faith but it finally does come down to faith. However, that is mostly irrelevant. God is the creator of all. I think you say that you believe in God. I think you would even say that God is indeed Good. Your conception of God that is, I am not referring to mine at this point. If it is true that God is Good, and you and I agree that God is good, then whatever HE does must be good because it simply is who He is. That is the point that I am making. It is not circular logic.\n \n I am saying GOD is the objective standard of what is good. Now, we come to the bible and whether or not what is done is good. That really is a good question. It is one that I struggle with as a christian. But, God knows far more than I do. If God did it then it must be good.\n \n My opinion (and it is just that, my opinion) is that some of those stories are being taken out of context of God and scripture as a whole. The context of scripture is that God is slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness. God is also, Holy, Just, merciful, gracious, kind, righteous, etc. \n \n It is difficult for the human mind to square justice and mercy. If God did not punish sin and simply chose to ignore it, then he would not be just, but if God did nothing to save those that deserved punishment, he would not be merciful. God had to do both because he is both.\n \n The debate on the validity and reliability of the bible is another topic and has been discussed in other threads.\n \n As to your inner voice, that is tough to debate. My authority is not based soleley on an inner voice, although it is that in part. Tell me about the God you believe in. How does he deal with justice and mercy? Is he just? Is he merciful, is he aloof? I am truly interested.\n \n EF",

   "That is yet another point I have to disagree with. It is not a gift if it comes with strings. It is not a gift if you have to give up everything you believe in, such as faith in the Jewish faith, the Muslim faith, hinduism, or whatever. That makes it not a free gift. It makes it either an extortion or a bribe.\n\n \n Correct me if I am wrong, but haven't we been down this path? Your argument is logically fallacious. To accept one belief over another that is mutually exclusive is not considered a \"cost\". It is a natural consequence. Like if I walk into the ocean then I get wet. To say I want to be able to walk into the ocean and also not get myself or anything attached to me wet is silly. \n \n It is like saying. I don't want to be dehydrated but then refusing to drink water because It costs me something (the refusal to drink water) to remain hydrated.\n \n I have a friend right now who may wind up in a homeless shelter. He has worked part time for about a year at four different jobs being fired from them all because he did drugs and came to work high. He cannot get a job because so many places drug test now. He says people should give him a job and not drug test him and let him come to work high. He thinks he should be able to do whatever he wants to do and have nothing be the result of what he does. That is just not how the world works. It is why so many in the younger generations are claiming that it is everybody else's fault for their ills.\n \n EF",

   " Again we don't need preists,or a bible to tell us right and wrong. I think it is within all people to figure it out.\n \n The picture is clear.\n \n A good portion of the population has not the ability to figure things out for themselves, ... and so they turn to a preist or a book.\n \n This saddens me for their sake, to be chained to dogma simply because they don't have enough FAITH in themselves and their OWN sense of good and bad. And so they spend their lives defending a blood thristy god because for them there is nothing else to give them a personal foundation.\n\n want to hear something interesting? god was never speaking to any of these \"leaders\" in those days, just as he doesnt speak to anyone directly today. the idea of god speaking to and through the king is a two-fold political tool. the premise is that the general population (or at least a critical majority) already believes that god exists and is leading them. with this follows the assumption that god has put the king as the leader because the king can communicate directly with god. therefore anything that the king says would be taken as if god has said it, even if the king didnt say \"god told me so\". so when the king thinks up a crazy feat he wants to see accomplished, he just says \"god said to...\" and even if he doesnt say that, the people will tell themselves \"well if the king said it, then it must be from god\". you'd have a perfect circle of obedience. what politician could ask for more?",

But that takes God out of the framework of eternity and puts him in tempoprality and temporariness. It is not parallel and not really a part of the discussion. I say this less for your benefit and more to pre-empt arguments from others that might distract.\n \n The point is that it is not okay as long as you believe it to be okay. You cannot say that it is fine as long as I don't bother you with it. The point being, what if my philosophy says that if you don't allow me to bother you with it then there is something wrong with you and you are being intollerant. You see. There MUST be an objective reality or nothing makes sense and all descends to chaos. If that is the case, then we might as well all strap nuclear devices to our chests and push the button now, because there is really no point to anything. \n \n It is not me being absurd. It is me taking the point to its logical conclusion. For an argument to have logical validity it must be true under all tests of its own conditions. If it fails in the extreme then it fails, period. \n \n As to what we already do as a nation, irrelevant. The question does not concern what we are doing but what SHOULD we be doing.\n \n As to \"the best way we know how\" that is a very scary proposition. Have you noticed the state of the world today?

   "THE WORLD&#8217;S MOST EVIL BELIEF\n \n The eternal torment theology of the Arminian Christian relies on so-called &#8220;free will&#8221; and luck. \n \n The god that Arminian eternal tormentors profess to love says to his fallen creatures \n \n &#8220;Unless you are lucky enough to find out about my son during this lifetime, and even if you are that lucky, if you don&#8217;t have the good sense to cooperate with my son properly before you die, then I am going to raise you from the dead and I will sustain you alive in an inescapable state of eternal torment forever.&#8221; \n \n The eternal torment theology of the Calvinist Christian relies on God alone, not &#8220;free will&#8221; at all. It is summed up by the word TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, and the Perseverance of the elect. \n \n The god that Calvinistic eternal tormentors profess to love says to his fallen creatures \n \n \"I created most of you for the purpose of torturing you forever. However, I am going to choose a few of you undeserving ones to go to heaven where you will be happy forever.\" John Calvin said there will be infants a span long in hell because they were not among the elect. (A span is the distance between the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger.) \n \n And then both the Arminian and Calvinistic eternal tormentors say that the feelings that they have for this god of theirs is &#8220;love.&#8221; \n \n Without God&#8217;s sustaining power everyone would cease to exist. So if anyone were to suffer forever, our all-powerful God (Who is Love in essence, not just loving) would be fully 100% responsible for it. We would have to conclude that any definition of the manifestation of &#8220;love-in-essence&#8221; includes eternally sustaining people alive in an inescapable state of suffering. \n \n What a travesty; what a revolting definition of love it is that God, Who is love personified, would grant any creature a will so strong that they can choose themselves into an irreversible state of never ending suffering (Arminian) or deserve to suffer forever just by being born into the human race (Calvinist)!! \n \n Thank God the Bible does not teach such insane ideas! \n See the following two links \n \n Type into Google \n \n SAVIOR OF THE WORLD SERIES\n \n And\n \n ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE IN JESUS CHRIST",
