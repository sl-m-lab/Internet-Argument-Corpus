Bush has used to build support for the war in Iraq. \n \n Released Friday, the report discloses for the first time an October 2005 CIA assessment that before the war, Saddam's government \"did not have a relationship, harbour or turn a blind eye toward\" al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi or his associates. \n \n Saddam told U.S. officials after his capture that he had not co-operated with Osama bin Laden even though he acknowledged that officials in his government had met with the al-Qaeda leader, according to FBI summaries cited in the Senate report. \n \n \"Saddam only expressed negative sentiments about bin Laden,\" Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi leader's top aide, told the FBI. \n \n The report also faults intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion. \n \n As recently as an Aug. 21 news conference, Bush said people should \"imagine a world in which you had Saddam Hussein\" with the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction and \"who had relations with Zarqawi.\" \n \n Democrats contended that the administration continues to use faulty intelligence, including assertions of a link between Saddam's government and the recently killed al-Zarqawi, to justify the war in Iraq. \n \n They also said, in remarks attached to Friday's Senate Intelligence Committee document, that former CIA Director George Tenet had modified his position on the terrorist link at the request of administration policymakers. \n \n Republicans said the document, which compares prewar intelligence with post-invasion findings on Iraq's weapons and on terrorist groups, broke little new ground. And they said Democrats were distorting it for political purposes. \n \n A previous report in 2004 made clear the intelligence agencies' \"massive failures,\" said Senator Kit Bond (R-Mo.), a member of the committee. \"Yet to make a giant leap in logic to claim that the Bush administration intentionally misled the nation or manipulated intelligence is simply not warranted.\" \n \n White House press secretary Tony Snow said the report was \"nothing new.\" \n \n A second part of the report concluded that false information from the Iraqi National Congress, an anti-Saddam group led by then-exile Ahmed Chalabi, was used to support key U.S. intelligence assessments on Iraq. \n \n It said U.S. intelligence agents put out numerous red flags about the reliability of INC sources but the intelligence community made a \"serious error\" and used one source who concocted a story that Iraq was building mobile biological weapons laboratories. \n \n The report also said that in 2002 the National Security Council directed that funding for the INC should continue \"despite warnings from both the CIA, which terminated its relationship with the INC in December 1996, and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), that the INC was penetrated by hostile intelligence services, including the Iranians.\" \n \n According to the report, postwar findings indicate that Saddam \"was distrustful of al-Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime.\" \n \n It said al-Zarqawi was in Baghdad from May until late November 2002. But \"postwar information indicates that Saddam Hussein attempted, unsuccessfully, to locate and capture al-Zarqawi and that the regime did not have a relationship with, harbour, or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi.\" \n \n In June 2004, Bush defended Vice-President Dick Cheney's assertion that Saddam had \"long-established ties\" with al-Qaeda. \"Zarqawi is the best evidence of connection to al-Qaida affiliates and al-Qaeda,\" the president said. \n \n The report concludes that postwar findings do not support a 2002 intelligence report that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program, possessed biological weapons or had ever developed mobile facilities for producing biological warfare agents. \n \n \"The report is a devastating indictment of the Bush-Cheney administration's unrelenting, misleading and deceptive attempts to convince the American people that Saddam Hussein was linked with al-Qaeda,\" said Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich.), a member of the committee. \n \n The panel report is Phase II of an analysis of prewar intelligence on Iraq. The first phase, issued in July 2004, focused on the CIA's failings in its estimates of Iraq's weapons program. \n \n The second phase had been delayed as Republicans and Democrats fought over what information should be declassified and how far the committee should delve into the question of whether policymakers may have manipulated intelligence to make the case for war. \n\n \n Pretty much all common sense stuff....the isalmic fundamentalists did not like the secular leader who oppressed islamic fundamentalists...bush administration pressured intelligence officials to change their positionon key points...\n \n What is interesting is the portion about the Iraqi National congress being inflitrated by the Iranains, and the fact that the CIA warned Bush about this. This implies that not only is Bush and his administration a bunch of liars, they are bigger XXXXXX than I originally imagined. \n \n Did it not occur to them to stop and wonder why it is that the Iranains had infiltrated the INC and were feeding them intel to encourage us to go to war? You would think that they would have stopped for just a minute and said \"Hold on...what are these guys hoping to gain\". It is pretty obvious (and this is not just with the advantage of hindsight...many people were making this same point prior to the war) that Iran knew full well that their people would take over Iraq following the US led war, and they would have themselves a nice little sattelite state.",
