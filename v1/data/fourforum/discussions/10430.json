It does not mean special creation as there may be other nonmaterial causes other than a GOD or a special creator.\n \n On the other hand its certainly clear that in some cases material causes do explain material outcomes. This does not prove necessarily that such is always the case, but it does prove that special creation does not explain everything and material causes DO explain some things. So far the score is about 99.99999% material causes and approximately 0% nonmaterial causes. Subject to alteration as new data comes in of course.",

Just because science cannot explain origin does not mean God. Your argument is nothing more then why humans believed in the old Gods. We could not explain X therefore God. The only difference is you've replaced lightning with matter. The principle hasn't changed. Your argument is nothing more then a argument from a position of ignorance. Goddidit because we ignorant. \n \n \nI have a question for you...if God really DID create everything from scratch, how would you ever accept it?\n\n \n God did create everything from scratch. Just not how you believe it was made. It's called Deism and unlike your asinine beliefs, it actually makes sense. \n \n \nFor example, if God were to make a fully-grown tree (rings and all) from nothing, how would you -- how could you -- be convinced of this fact?\n\n \n If the holy book of that God didn't outright lie about it.\n \n The fundamental lie of creationism is that it says it believes in the Christian God. That is simply untrue. If God made the World as we see it and as we understand it, then God is a big fat liar in the Bible. If God made the world as stated in the Bible, then he's a big fat liar in deceiving us. Either way the belief has a very different Deity, one that engages in deception and lies, which just happens to be the fancy of Satan. \n \n \nIf you think about it, only materialistic mechanisms could be proven (by scientific method, of course) -- prior miracles, on the other hand, certainly cannot be.\n\n \n You mean like Eclipses. Oh wait. That was a miracle explained by Science!\n \n \nAnd since you have offered up no proof for your materialistic mechanism it only leaves one thing left: special creation.\n\n \n Excuse me if I don't accept ignorance = Goddidit.\n \n You are asking us to believe you on the same basis as why Animism arose.",
