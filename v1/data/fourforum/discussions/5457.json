   "I think the vote showed 2 things. First, you cannot put a 500 page document up for an up or down vote. That was just stupid. They drafted the thing like it was going to be the end all....all the rules rolled into one and voted on by the masses. In 500 pages, EVERYBODY is going to find stuff they like and stuff they don't, and what peopel tend to remember is what they dislike, not what they like. \n \n I think they need to go back to the drawing board and come up with something about 2 pages long. Then they can go back to their people and tell them the truth....\"We are all going to be screwed in 10 years if we do not manage to form a coalityion with cheap labor nations\"\n \n The other thing I think this displays pretty well is how disconnected the politicians and businessmen are from your joe on the street. ratification got wide support from politiicans and busnessmen, but failed at the street level. I can't help but wonder if this is becuase politicians and the power elite in Europe play the same \"Everything is OK, there is no reason to be alarmed\" game that they play here in the US. \n \n Maybe they need a series of commercials to explain things better. I rememebr there used to be a commerical on Tv that showed an egg. They said \"this is your brain\". The egg was cracked and put in a frying pan. Thye said \"this is your brain on drugs....any quesitons\". They could use the same format. \"This is france with the EU..........\"",
