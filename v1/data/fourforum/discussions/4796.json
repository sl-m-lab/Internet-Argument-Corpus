   "This is totally ridiculous. \n \n Law HR3632 now makes it illegal to buy certificates of authencity. \n \n \nIMPACT: Microsoft's monopoly power has increased so that consumers cannot resell or recycle Microsoft licenses that they own. The First Sale Doctrine has always protected the right for a consumer to resell or recycle a Microsoft license, but under HR.3632 consumers lose that right. Consumers can resell their used computer system and they should be able to resell their used Microsoft software. Microsoft is the only party that benefits from this because a consumer who would normally purchase a used COA from another consumer or an online reseller must now purchase a Full OEM version from Microsoft at a much higher cost.\n\n \n http://www.atlgroup.com/hr3632.htm\n \n People over 35 should be banned from writing and passing laws that deal with technology.",
