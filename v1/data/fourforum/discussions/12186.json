A recent report by the University of Illinois's Arctic Climate Research Center suggests however, that the only people we should be blaming are the \"specialists\" themselves, who continue to rely on false data:\n \n Earlier this year, predictions were rife that the North Pole could melt entirely in 2008. Instead, the Arctic ice saw a substantial recovery. Bill Chapman, a researcher with the UIUC's Arctic Center, tells DailyTech this was due in part to colder temperatures in the region. Chapman says wind patterns have also been weaker this year. Strong winds can slow ice formation as well as forcing ice into warmer waters where it will melt.\n \n This new data will not deter alarmists who will continue to cite erroneous data that sea ice is melting. They will instead declare that the recent rise in sea ice is not an indicator of a reverse in the warming trend, but merely a short term phenomenom due to a change in wind patterns. This, despite the fact that NASA had already blamed the decrease in Arctic sea ice on stronger wind patterns, which pushed the ice shelves into warmer waters.\n \n Over the last decade we have seen cooling temperatures, and increasing sea ice, but don't let that fool you.... the \"science\" of global warming has been settled.\n Sea Ice At 1979 Levels\n \n The fix on Global Warming is pretty much in.

   "The Arctic : \n \n The Arctic sea ice decreased to a record low level in 2007, since satellite observations began in 1979. The decline in the Arctic sea ice from 2005 to 2007 was caused by winds, according to a NASA study. Atmospheric pressure conditions set up wind patterns that compressed the old thick sea ice, loaded it into the Transpolar Drift Stream and then increased its flow rate out of the Arctic along East Greenland. By this the perennial thick sea ice in March 2007 essentially was confined by winds to the Arctic Ocean north of Canada. Consequently, most of the Arctic Ocean was dominated by thinner seasonal ice than usual, melting faster. In addition, this thin ice is more easily compressed and responds more quickly to being pushed out of the Arctic by winds. This thinner seasonal ice conditions facilitated ice loss, leading to the 2007 record low amount of total Arctic sea ice. \n\n \n Hang on, so AA is saying that it's wrong to cite wind patterns as the cause of the change in sea ice distribution, because NASA says the change in sea ice distribution is due to changes in wind patterns...

Eh?emoticon_confused\n NASA - NASA Examines Arctic Sea Ice Changes Leading to Record Low in 2007\n\n \n That's not what I meant to say at all. My point is, and what the article I quoted is saying that Researchers had expected the newer sea ice, which is thinner, to be less resilient and melt easier. Instead, the thinner ice had less snow cover to insulate it from the bitterly cold air, and therefore grew much faster than expected, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. They also predicted a complete melt off when the ice rebounded in to record levels in record time, as shown in the quote below. Not bad for being in the midst of a Global Warming melt off. And even your NASA article which was written in November of 07 was making a similarly gloomy prediction.\n Between winter 2005 and winter 2007, the perennial ice shrunk by an area the size of Texas and California combined. This severe loss continues a trend of rapid decreases in perennial ice extent in this decade. Study results will be published Oct. 4 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. \n \n The scientists observed less perennial ice cover in March 2007 than ever before, with the thick ice confined to the Arctic Ocean north of Canada. Consequently, the Arctic Ocean was dominated by thinner seasonal ice that melts faster. This ice is more easily compressed and responds more quickly to being pushed out of the Arctic by winds. Those thinner seasonal ice conditions facilitated the ice loss, leading to this year's record low amount of total Arctic sea ice. \n \n Nghiem said the rapid decline in winter perennial ice the past two years was caused by unusual winds. \"Unusual atmospheric conditions set up wind patterns that compressed the sea ice, loaded it into the Transpolar Drift Stream and then sped its flow out of the Arctic,\" he said. When that sea ice reached lower latitudes, it rapidly melted in the warmer waters. \n \n \"The winds causing this trend in ice reduction were set up by an unusual pattern of atmospheric pressure that began at the beginning of this century,\" Nghiem said. \n \n The Arctic Ocean's shift from perennial to seasonal ice is preconditioning the sea ice cover there for more efficient melting and further ice reductions each summer. The shift to seasonal ice decreases the reflectivity of Earth's surface and allows more solar energy to be absorbed in the ice-ocean system. \n \n The perennial sea ice pattern change was deduced by using the buoy computing model infused with 50 years of data from drifting buoys and measurement camps to track sea ice movement around the Arctic Ocean. From the 1970s through the 1990s, perennial ice declined by about 500,000 square kilometers (193,000 square miles) each decade. Since 2000, that amount of decline has nearly tripled. \n \n Results from the buoy model were verified against the past eight years of QuikScat observations, which have much better resolution and coverage. The QuikScat data were verified with field experiments conducted aboard the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy, as well as by sea ice charts derived from multiple satellite data sources by analysts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#8217;s National Ice Center in Suitland, Md. \n \n The new study differs significantly from other recent studies that only looked at the Arctic's total sea ice extent. \"Our study applies QuikScat's unique capabilities to examine how the composition of Arctic sea ice is changing, which is crucial to understanding Arctic sea ice mass balance and overall Arctic climate stability,\" Ngheim said. \n \n Pablo Clemente-Colon of the National Ice Center, Suitland, Md., said the rapid reduction of Arctic perennial sea ice requires an urgent reassessment of sea ice forecast model predictions and of potential impacts to local weather and climate, as well as shipping and other maritime operations in the region. \"Improving ice forecast models will require new physical insights and understanding of complex Arctic processes and interactions.\" \n Global warming from the continuing buildup of human-generated greenhouse gases is almost certainly contributing to the ice retreats, many Arctic specialists now agree, although they hold a variety of views on how much of the recent big ice retreats is due to human activity.\n \n Oddly, those Arctic &#8220;specialists&#8221; failed to make mention of the fact that ice coverage in the Arctic was 260,000 square miles above that of August 2007.
