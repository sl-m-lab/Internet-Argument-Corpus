   "Actually, yes, they do have explanations. Here are a couple with which I am familiar.\n \n God created the light from the distant stars on it's way to earth. Now I'm not clear when the light was created that we see as stars. Light was created on the first day and the sun and the moon and the stars were created on the 4th day (and hung in the firmament). Now that means, of course, that the history of events that we see in the light from the stars never really happened. It is a false history that god created just to fool us. He just made the universe look old. And example of the above is SN 1987 A. It has been measured by more than one method to be 170,000 light years away. That means that it actually never existed and that the fading star (it is almost invisible now) was never there and the shock wave that is lighting a ring (now at it's brightest), was never illuminated by that shock wave. The light from those events was created 164,000 years after they appear to have happened.\n \n Another explanation is that the speed of light has been slowing down. Barry Setterfield of Australia is the proponent of this. He took many of the historical measurments of the speed of light (all relatively recent, you know. First done in 1676.), plotted them on an exponential curve and concluded light was much faster in the past and has just now, when we have developed the technology to measure it precisely, stabilized at the current speed. Now as I understand it, there is no good reason to plot the data on an exponential curve except to cram 13.7 billion years of travel of light into 6000 years. I also understand that Setterfield left out some of the measurments. When they are included, the data point to a different finding. Besides that, the speed of light is one of those nasty little constants that tend to change the laws of physics when you mess with them. You might guess that relativity becomes a pure muddle when you change the speed of light as well as other principles of physics. I believe that it was Maxwell, while working on his theory that eventually united electricity and magnetism found that the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves was a consequence of his equations. That was in the 1860s. And Einstein discovered that Maxwell's equations were not compatible with Galileo/Newton mechanics. Someone was wrong. Relativity says that it was Galileo/Newton.\n \n And yet another explanation is that the Bible says that god stretched the firmament. Now the actual reference from the Bible is to the stretching of a tent. God stretched the firmament over the earth like a tent. But never mind. Creationists sometimes claim that this means that god created the universe quite small and then stretched it. Thus the light was created close enough to reach earth in a short time but now appears far away because god stretched the universe.\n \n And finally there are those who claim that light at extremes of the universe travels faster. In other words, the farther that one goes away from earth, the faster light is traveling. One problem with this is that if that were true, then events at great distances would appear to go in slow motion. And that isn't true. For example, various phenomena in SN 1987 A have been observed (predicted and then observed actually) that indicate that light at 170,000 light years distance is traveling at the same speed as on earth.\n \n None of these are based on any evidence or any actual science. Faced with the reality of a universe in which we can detect objects that are 13.7 billion years away, they must make the observations conform to the dogma. Since the Bible says that the universe is only 6000 years old, it is OK to invent ad hoc stories and call it \"creation science.\"",

   "Can creationists explain why we can see stars millions of light years away? Do creationists have a valid reason for claiming astronomers/physicists have got it wrong?\n\n \n I have been reading some of the replies on this page, and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old. This problem is appearently solved by Dr Russell Humphreys new \"Relativistic Cosmology\" in which he out lines in the book \"Starlight and Time.\" \n \n I got this book a few days ago, and I am now nearly finished reading it. On page 11 he briefly out lines where he is heading in regards to his theory. His new cosmology uses exactly the same sciences and equations as the big bang theory, i.e. that of General Relativity (GR). According to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, gravity affects the flow of time. Clocks at a low altitude tick more slowly than clocks at a high altitude - and this has been observationly confirmed. For example, an atomic clock at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, ticks five microseconds per year slower than an identical clock at the National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado, both clocks being accurate to about one microsecond per year. The difference is exactly what GR predicts for the one-mile difference in alitude. Both the clocks are \"correct\" in their own frame of reference, it all depends on where you are in relation to a gravitational field. The effect applies to the rates of all physical processes and biological \"clocks\". \n \n He than goes on to say what this new cosmology shows is that gravitational time distortion in the early universe would have meant that while a few days were passing on Earth, billions of years would have been available for light to travel to Earth. It still means that God made the heavens and Earth in six ordinary days, only a few thousand years ago. It then has to be asked to which frame of reference is the six days related to? The mathematics of this new theory shows that while God makes the universe in six days in Earth's frame of reference, the light has ample time in the extra-terrestrial frame of reference to travel the required distances. \n \n Dr Russell Humphreys uses the big bang equations, i.e. the equations of GR to show that all of this could have been possible. The crucial reason why such different cosmologies (i.e. New Cosmology and big bang) come out of the same mathematics is that two different (but absolutely arbitrary) starting points (initial assumptions) are utilized. The big bang theory says that the universe has no edge and no centre, and that 3-D spacec expands with matter, i.e. it is unbounded. Why do big bang cosmologists use as their starting point the assumption (which seems quite contrary to common sense) that the universe has no boundary? Is there some good scientific reason, or is it perhaps demanded or even suggested by well-established, experimentally-backed theory, like GR? The answer is no. It is an arbitrary assumptino, called the \"cosmological principle\", or more recently the \"Copernican principle\". This assumes that there is no edge and no center. ~ The above came from p.18.\n \n So we know that unbounded cosmos (arbitrary assumption) + Cosmos has expanded (observations) + General Relativity = Big Bang Cosmology.\n \n BUT!!! Bounded cosmos (Biblically based assumption) + Cosmos has expanded (observations) + General Relativity = White Hole Cosmology.\n \n This is how Dr Humphreys goes on to explain it without the mathematical stuff. Imagine this bounded universe when it was about fifty times smaller than today. The equations of GR would then allow the universe to be in one of two states (no other states are possilbe). One of the possiblities would put the universe inside a huge black hole. Matter and light can exist inside a black hole; however, the equations of GR require that they must fall inward, eventually reaching the point of \"singularity\" at the center. However, the evidence indicates that the universe has expanded (red shift of starlight) and is not currently undergoing such an overall inward-falling. Therefore the universe cannot now be within a black hole. \n \n The other possibility allowed by GR is that th euniverse was previously in a huge white hole. This is a black hole running in reverse. Astrophysicists of the 1970's gave that name to the concept, arising from theoretical studies of black holes. The concept is still considered valid today. Like a black hole, however, a white hole would also have an event horizon. Matter and light could exist inside its event horizon without any particular problems, as they would be no singularity at its center. However, the equations of GR must require that light and matter inside the event horizon of a white hole must expand outward. The event horizon of a white hole would be a one-way border which permits only outward motion  through itself. Matter and light waves would have to move out of a white hole, but they could not go back in. Since the diameter of an event horizon is proportional to the amount of matter inside it, the event horizon would shrink as matter passes through it and out of a white hole. As more matter passes out of the white hole the event horizon would get smaller and smaller and eventually shrink to nothing. There would then be no more white hole, but only scattered matter moving away from a central point. \n \n The ideas about black and white holes comes directly from GR. The equatinos of GR permit, but do not demand, the existence of white holes today. By starting with the assumption that the universe is bounded and accepting the overwhelming observational evdience that it has expanded, it can be shown:\n 1. The visible universe was once inside an event horizon. \n The means that it was once either within a black hole or a white hole. We have seen that if it were a black hole it would be contracting, which is not indicated by the evidence. Therefore:\n 2. The visible universe was once inside a white hole.\n It may, however, have commenced as a black hole before expansion started. \n \n Dr Russell Humphreys than goes through and describes a possible scenario as to how the Creation Week might have unfolded. His new theory also answers how the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) may have been formed. He believes that it may have happened on Day Two of the Creation Week. By taking that Bible literally, and applying GR and science, he has shown that the light from distant stars can arrive to Earth in a single day, Earth Standard Time (E.S.T). He says and I quote in relation to the stars being made:\n \"Early on the fourth morning, God coalesces the clusters of atoms into stars and thermonuclear fusion ignites in them. The newly-formed stars find themselves grouped together in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. As the fourth day proceeds on Earth, the more distant stars age billions of years, while their light also has the same billions of years to travel to the Earth. While the light is on its way, space continues to expand, relativistically stretching out the light waves and shifting the wavelengths toward the red side of the spectrum. Stars which are now farthest away have the greatest redshift, because the waves have been streched the most. This progressive redshift is exactly what is observed. \n \n For more information I would strongly suggest and urge you to get Dr Humphreys book \"Starlight and Time\". It is a thrilling application of science and mathematics and is hard to put down. \n \n Note: You may have heard of the fact that many creationists believe in a decreasing c, but this is not true. Indeed a few might (nearly all of creationists have disgarded the idea), but it has been disgarded by most as re-calculations on the issue have pushed the variation between the 17th Century measurement and todays value to within 0.4%, not the original 2.6% value. This new model by Dr Russell Humphreys may (by his own admission) end up having some flaws in it, but at the moment he has been able to defend his theory from attack by evolutionists. The only real difference between the big bang and this new Relativistic Cosmology is the starting assumptions and arbitrary beliefs. The mathematical equations and the science, i.e. GR, is the same.",

It passed peer review, by qualifying reviewers, for the 1994 Pittsburgh International Conference on Creationism.2 Young-earth creationists have been cautious about the model,3 which is not surprising with such an apparently radical departure from orthodoxy, but Humphreys has addressed the problems raised.4 Believers in an old universe and the big bang have vigorously opposed the new cosmology and claim to have found flaws in it.5 However, Humphreys has been able to defend his model, as well as develop it further.6 The debate will no doubt continue.\n \n The above came from the same link.\n \n Some still perfer the Mature Creation idea, but I am convinced as time goes on and IF the idea put forward in \"Starlight and Time\" is still a valid concept that they too might come and be a little more explorativein this new Relativistic Cosmology. I for one am all for it. Before I had no answer and was wondering this question myself. Thank goodness no one ever asked me that kind of question before!",

Yet potassium-argon dating of the lava rock has given ages of up to half a million years old! Now this alone is a big flaw. Any person who uses their logic can tell that the result of the potassium-argon is way out, it should be less than 200 years. The radio-carbon date is only restricted to thousands of years, because even after several hundreds of thousands of years, there will be no more radio-carbon left.\n The above came from Snelling, A., \"Dating Dilemma: Fossil wood in \"ancient\" sandstone\", Creation  21(3):39-41.\n \n Creationists don't have (by their own admissions) all of the answers when it comes to radio-metric dating methods, but they can see enough that there is something seriously wrong with the underlying assumptions.

In fact, please give us details of all of the other 180 methods.\n \n I read through this thread. An essentially silly objection to radiometric dating is the bucket filling at some rate objection. The claim is that we are making an assumption as to the amount of the daughter element - in other words, we can't know how much water was in the bucket to start or how tall the candle was when it was lit. The objection is false. It is really quite well established and verified, based on historical events, that the amount of daughter element in metamorphic rock is essentially zero. Why is it that we know the historical date of the burial of Pompey from history, and that date is confirmed by radometric dating, and yet a date from before the creation of the earth is somehow a question of \"how much water was in the bucket?\"\n \n It is silly.\n \n Let me offer some reading for those who think that the \"how much water was in the bucket\" argument is actually credible. If you think that you have an argument, then have the courage to read these books.\n \n The first is:\n \n Strahler, Arthur N. 1987. Science and Earth History: The Evolution/Creation Controversy. Prometheus Books. Amherst.\n \n The book may be out of print, but if you can buy it used, it will teach you volumes. Whatever you pay, if you read it with an open and critical mind, it will give you an education. It is a large book (8 1/2 x 11) with small print that runs more than 500 pages (528 to be exact not counting the references cited). It is a prodigious undertaking.\n \n The second is:\n \n Dalrymple, G. Brent. 1991. The Age of the Earth. Stanford University Press. Stanford.\n \n This book requires an above average scientific sophistication. It assumes an elementry knowleged of geology and radiometry. But that is just one of the assumptions that creationists tell us about. Scientists assume that their audience understands what they are talking about. It is a matter of scientific sophistication.",

If a star is 100,000 light years away and we can see it, then either light has been travelling from that star for 100,000 years or the light was created in transit say 6,000 light years away. The latter is dishonest and implies God is a liar to suggest that is what he did. How else can light from a 100,000 light year away star have reached us in only 6,000 years?",

Knowing we couldn't possibly witness the entire life cycle of a star, He has shown us the process by creating stars at different stages of \"life\". Make sense?\n\n \n \n Okay Sandy let's take a really detailed look at the requirements. I assume you know that a light-year is the DISTANCE that light travels in a year when traveling at its maximum speed. No let's take our star example. Imagine a star that is 100,000 light-years away from us by thinking of two round objects with a string between them. You can have this on a table with the string representing the light that God created between the star and the earth. We are going to assume that the star is one that exploded recently or according to you about 6000 years after it was created. So if we go back to creation, we could make a mark on the string that represented 6000 light-years from the earth. Now we are going to start time by pulling the string through the earth. That would represent time by seeing how the mark on the string moves towards the earth. Now when the mark gets to earth, that light would have to be the light of the star exploding because that is what we would be seeing. However that light never left the star because it was created in rout by God. So what is actually happening to the star? Is the star actually exploding? If you say it is actually exploding 6000 years after it was created, then what will happen to the light that the star has actually been emitting for the past 6000 years. At some point it will reach the earth (100,000-6000) or 94,000 years from now, the star would again be visible to earth. Then 6000 years later earth would see the star explode again because that light of the explosion left the star 100,000 years ago. We should see stars turning on again all over the sky. However we don't see that. That is proof that God did not create the stars and the light from them in rout to the earth.\n \n \nBut, according to science (astronomy), even in a universe billions of years old, we only see the light from distant stars, since the star itself has ceased to exist, no?\n\n \n Exactly! That's why we know the universe is billions of years old, because we see the light from stars that are billions of light-years away. That's why scientist call it a time machine. Because we are looking at how the star looked billions of years ago.\n \n \nAnd, no, God is not deceitful, whatever the age of the universe. \n\n \n Agreed, which is why we know he didn't create the light in rout to the earth. Or rocks that are dated billions of years old. That would be deceitful.\n \n But isn't it amazing that he took billions of years to create us? How much more do you care about something that you have invested a lot of time in than something that took you 5 minutes to make?",

   "If you use a calendar to measure a 100 yard dash race, it&#8217;s not going to be very accurate. If you use a calendar to measure a person&#8217;s lifetime, you will be very accurate. When you are measuring rock that is a billion years old, a half million-year error is very accurate. The dating is very accurate if you use the right type of dating method for the time you are dating. Scientist know this and eliminate errors by using more than one dating method on a sample.\n\n \n But here is my point! The point that I have been trying to get across either here or on a different thread, how do you know that the dating techniques are accurate?? Before you measured the rock [above] how do you know it was billions of years? You don't, you have to make an arbitrary assumption based on your underlying beliefs. You have no scientific basis for stating that, it was in your opinion.\n \n Now based on the rocks characteristics you could choose a certain radiometric dating technique, depending on how old or young you want the rock to be. And in many cases if the radiometric date does not agree with your assumption (based on your beliefs) than the radiometric date is usually dropped, unless it is not in conflict with eachother than it is kept. This after-the-event reasoning shows that radiometric dating has serious problems.Woodmorappe cites hundreds of examples of excuses used to explain away \"bad\" dates in his book \"The Mythology of Modern Dating Methods\". Although they are not being dishonest, it is just that all observations must fit the prevailing paradigm or belief system. Molecules-to-man evolution is so strongly entrenched it is not questioned - it is \"fact\". So every observation must fit this paradigm. Unconsciously, the researchers involved - \"objective scientists\" in the eyes of the laymen - select the observations to fit the basic belief system. \n \n The following is a statement from AiG article on this topic, after they go through a hypothetical example (they later provide real examples of where this has happened):\n \nWe are not suggesting that the scientists are dishonest. This illustrates how a person's perceptions and expectations affect the way they do their science.\n \n the link is\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/negative1-8-2001.asp \n \n \nThe dating is very accurate if you use the right type of dating method for the time you are dating.\n \n \n How do they know that the rock is old when they haven't even tested it? You see, they are using several evolutionary assumptions to put into practice to prove the theory of evolution, creationists can use their assumptions and put them into practice to prove their model. How do you know what \"time you are dating\"? This is going against the flow of logic! So if you discard the results to which you believe are false - i.e. those that go against your assumption or guess - what do you have left? Only dates next to the ones that you assumed or guessed to be right. So no wonderthe dates give old ages! You have discarded the dates that disagree with that! LOL!",

   "To Close_slave_can:\n \nI assume what you are trying to say is that there are 200 ways of dating rocks and only 20 out of these 200 say the earth is old enough for evolution to happen. \n\n Yes, that is what I am trying to say, I thought I made that pretty clear in English, meh, oh well. \n \n \nIf you can give me these 180 methods that show the earth is young I will appreciate it. \n \n \n I heard this fact at a lecture several years ago, so I can't remember how he backed up his statement at all! But I do remember being fairly impressed with the information that he provided. Of course it was a creationist - the evolutionists don't appear to travel up the mid-north coast of NSW, Australia. I will withdraw my statement for now, as I currently have no proof to back it up. I will ask around here and there and come back with evidence to back it up. Sorry for any Inconvenience. I'll argue this point once I get some evidence, so we'll put this part of the discussion on hold for the time being and I'll get back to ya.\n \n \nIf you can show that various dating methods usually disagree by a factor of a half a million then you can claim 6000 years gets misdated as 4 billion years. \n \n \n I don't claim that 6000 years gets misdated as 4 billion years, but you have the gist of what I mean. Now this is something that I might be able to answer and deal with! How many times would I have to show you that the dating methods fail and what dating methods would you want me to go on about? When you say show that they are out by some large factor, I trust you mean on rocks of known ages?\n \n \nIncidentally what is the level of proof you would require to chuck out creationism? \n \n \n Someone to explain (politely) how evolution deals with the Law of Causality and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics for a start. I would also like to hear the evolutionists explanation for:\n a. The formation of Uluru (a massive rock out in the heart of the Australian outback) taking into account the observed features, including the felspar. \n \n b. The missing link(s) between apes and people. \n \n c. That the Bible is scientifically wrong.\n \n d. The problem of increasing DNA genetic information in an organism for molecules to man evolution to proceed; i.e. there needs to be an addition (over the evolutionary time period) for 999 books of 500 pages of complex DNA information to be added to get a microorganism into something like a human. \n \n The above to start off with, I have a few other things after you explain those.\n \n \nIf new dating methods were shown to be highly accurate on say napeolons and king tuts bones and they dated the earth as 4 billion years old would you say that is merely explained by physical changes smote on the earth after the great flood or eve munching on the apple?\n \n \n <laughing appreciatively< Good question! I would firstly see what the creationists response would be. Other than that, I would want to know what effect the flood of Noah's day might have on the dating methods. If the method passed both of those tests, than, um, I'm not quite sure. I trust the Bible from Genesis 1:1 through to the end of Revelation, and knowing that God wrote the Bible and that the dating methods of fallible man are prone to mistakes, I would probably still trust the Bible. I don't know. I most likely wouldn't address the issue, as I would have no answers. If some asked me about the age of the Earth, \"Oh darn, I forgot! I have a mathematics test tomarrow, I best start studying for that!\" would most likely be my excuse. \n \n But it is important to know that such a method is not around at the moment, only time will tell. At the moment, none of the dating methods (to my knowledge anyway) can measure the age of rocks of known ages -- so why should we trust them on rocks of un-known ages??\n Matt.\n Btw, we have done sooo well in getting off topic!",

   "As for the law of causality, all theories about humanities existence need something to initially exist without cause wether its god or the big bang etc. Also the what is the cause of the law of causality? If you cannot show the cause of the law of causality doesn't that show its a law that allows exceptions. \n \n\n To Close_slave_can:\n The Law of Causality, or \"cause and effect\" relationship states that one cause can have many effects, but no effect can be quantitatively greater r qualitatively superior to its cause. Observed effects are assumed to ave causes because of this Law, and are not treated as purely random or chance occurences. The inquisitive mind will speculate on the cause of an observed effect and then seek to recreate and test the cause experimentally. [Jeremy I. Walter, \"In Six Days: Why 50 scientists choose to believe in creation\", p.11]\n \n So the above is a definition I got from the book in brackets. It adequately describes what it is. Now, for an object to have a cause, what does it need? It needs to have a beginning right? The following reasoning stands up to scrutiny:\n * Everything which has a beginning  has a cause.\n * The universe has a beginning (as will be shown via the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics).\n * Therefore the universe has a cause. \n \n It is important to stress hte words in bold type. The universe requires a cause because it had a beginning. GOd, unlike the universe, had no beginning, so does not need a cause. In addition, Einstein's GR shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space at the beginning of the universe. Since God, by definition, is the creator of the whole universe, He is the creator of time. Therefore He is not limited by the time dimension He created, and so has no beginninig in time. Hence He does not have, nor need to have, a cause. \n \n Now to show that the universe had a beginning. The 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics can be used to prove that the universe had a beginning:\n 1st Law: The total amount of mass-energy in the universe is constant.\n 2nd Law: The amount of energy in the universe available for work is running down; or entropy (a measure of disorder, or of decrease in usuable energy) is increasing to a maximum.\n \n So if the total amount of mass-energy is limited, and the amount of usuable energy is decreasing, then the universe cannot have existed ofrever, otherwise it would already have exhausted all usuable energy and reached what is known as \"heat death\". There would be no processes and everything would be the same temperature. So the best solution ist that the universe must have been created with a lot of usuable energy and is now running down.\n \n \nAs for the law of causality, all theories about humanities existence need something to initially exist without cause wether its god or the big bang etc. \n \n \n I agree with you. Since the \"big bang\" had a beginning in time, it must also have a cause. We know what the effect is, people and all the other life forms on the Earth were made from an initial explosion (over eons of time). The big bang violates the Law of Causality; God however, does not. He is outside of time, and hence has no beginning in time. So hence, as shown above, He needs no cause and thus does not violate the Law of Causality. There is not a really good evolutionary explanation to get around this that is valid.\n \n \nIf you cannot show the cause of the law of causality doesn't that show its a law that allows exceptions.\n \n \n The Law of Causality is just a man made hypothesis to explain the observations that we see or observe. A hypothesis becomes a Law when it applies to everything without exception. If these is an observed  event that violates this Law, then we have to assume that the Law was never a Law of Nature and discard it. It had a cause; i.e. to explain observations. It's effect: observations are explained. Now hence, the effect is not more superior to its cause.\n \n So in summary:\n a. the universe requires a cause.\n b. God being creator is outside of time and hence, does not require a cause.\n c. big bang theory cannot account for this.\n d. I still require an evolutionary answer to this point.\n [Some of the above came from \"The Updated and Expanded Answers Book\" by Ken Ham, Jonathan Sarfati and Carl Wieland, p. 12-13]\n Matt.",

It was rather interesting. I had a limited understanding of what it was. I especially found that stuff about the sun and the bucket of water interesting. I was wanting a rebuttal in terms of evolution/creation. Let me put foward how creationists use the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics in an evolution/creation debate. \n \n When many evolutionists talk about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics they do so in terms of an \"open system\". Many claim that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics doesn't apply to open systems. But this is false. Dr John Ross of Harvard University states:\n \"&#8230; there are no known violations of the second law of thermodynamics. Ordinarily the second law is stated for isolated systems, but the second law applies equally well to open systems. &#8230; There is somehow associated with the field of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics the notion that the second law of thermodynamics fails for such systems. It is important to make sure that this error does not perpetuate itself\".\n \n Open systems do not help the evolutionary case, i.e. open systems still have a tendency to disorder. Raw energy cannot produce the specified complex information in living things. Undirected energy just speeds up the destruction. For the full article on the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and how it is used in an argument, I would invite you to check out:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/370.asp \n \n If there is someone out there, either on the forums, or in an article that can refute this real science on which evolution is denied, than I would really like to know. This Law again stops evolution in its tracks! It cannot proceed.\n \n \nWhy does the universe need a cause? \n \n \n By the Law of Causality. Everything which has a beginning must have a cause. Consider the example of a stool or a chair. It just isn't made for no reason, is it? It has a cause from the start, from the beginning when the designer thought of making it up. Since the universe had a beginning, which can be showed by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics (amount of usuable energy running down) it must have had a cause. I can't really explain it much simplier than that. Sorry. \n \n How about this, can you think of anything, anything in the whole Earth that comes into existence, i.e. has a beginning, that does not have a cause? If not, why, then, should the universe be any different? Some evolutionists assert that quantum physics can produce something from nothing, and that the Law of Causality breaks down at the quantum level, but that too is false. Theories that the universe is a quantum fluctuation must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate - their \"quantum vacuum\" is a lot of matter-antimatter - not \"nothing\". Also, if there is no cause, there is no explanation why this particular universe appeared at a particcular time, nor why it was a universe and not, say, a banana or a cat that appeared. This universe can't have any properties to explain its preferential coming into existence, because it would not have any properties until it actually came into existence. [\"The Updated and Expanded Answers Book\" by Ken Ham, Jonathan Sarfati, and Carl Wieland, p.13]\n \n They (the creationists) use science and have a very good point to which evolutionists have no really good answer. So far, the Laws of Science appears to agree with the Bible and lean away from evolution.",

Again, be careful about how you interpret relativity.\n \n \nHence He does not have, nor need to have, a cause.\nEssentially, you are saying that you have defined God to not have a time frame, and thus being relatively causeless.

Your claim seems completely irrelevant and certainly without any connection to evolution at all.\n \n \nThe Law of Causality is just a man made hypothesis to explain the observations that we see or observe.\nIndeed. Now, where is it documented and validated?\n \n \nA hypothesis becomes a Law when it applies to everything without exception.\nActually, the distinction between a scientific theory and a natural law is that theory is a model that explains behavior where as a natural law simply states a measurable relationship at experimental conditions.

   "Let me put foward how creationists use the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics in an evolution/creation debate. \n \n When many evolutionists talk about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics they do so in terms of an \"open system\". Many claim that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics doesn't apply to open systems. But this is false. Dr John Ross of Harvard University states:\n \"... there are no known violations of the second law of thermodynamics. Ordinarily the second law is stated for isolated systems, but the second law applies equally well to open systems. ... There is somehow associated with the field of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics the notion that the second law of thermodynamics fails for such systems. It is important to make sure that this error does not perpetuate itself\".\nSomehow you missed the part about how local parts of open systems can reverse local entrophy through the application of outside energy.\n \n \nOpen systems do not help the evolutionary case, i.e. open systems still have a tendency to disorder.\nThat claim is rather dishonest. The \"tendency\" is always towards enthropy. However, the addition of energy can drive the equation towards the storing of energy. Otherwise, a battery, f.ex., would not be able to work. Batteries should be decharged, never recharged, as that goes against enthropy. Likewise, YOU shouldn't exist. You started as one cell, which should have burned itself out in no time. It just happened that you were able to add energy to the open system that is you, and thus increase your complexity into an organism with many millions of cells. Are you saying that you don't exist?\n \n \nRaw energy cannot produce the specified complex information in living things.\nHow is energy a restriction in information complexity? The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is a law about energy, not information. You have NO foundation for your claim (this is usually the claim that creationists can not document and support). How is it valid that you apply a natural law of Energy use to an issue of information complexity? And anyway, the same point as above still goes. How come that we can grow and develop ourselves, if \"raw energy\" can not produce increased complexity? Your argument is completely bogus. Your comprehension of the 2LoT seems to come solely from creationist websites. You might benefit from some physics studying as well. I would recommend a College intro textbook for a fair discussion of this topic.\n \n \nUndirected energy just speeds up the destruction.\nHow so. And the solar energy is NOT undirected. It gets captured by chlorophyl and stored in plant materials, which is then eaten and reeaten through the predator food chain.\n \n \n For the full article on the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and how it is used in an argument, I would invite you to check out:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/370.asp\nYes, I recognized the argument from AiG. The AiG people are incorrect in their claims, which is what you run into when you try to learn about science, filtererd through non-scientific sites with a political agenda of a pre-madeup conclusion regardless of the scientific evidence against it.\n \n This is why I caution people about their sources. Creationists WILL make false statements, like the AiG site does. It will misapply scientific principles and the Scientific Method. If you want to criticize science, know the science first, not just the creationist-filtered misrepresentation of it.\n \n \nIf there is someone out there, either on the forums, or in an article that can refute this real science..\nIt is NOT real science. Real science has been evaluated through the Scientific Method and been formulated with the ability to make accurate predictions. \n \n \n.. on which evolution is denied, than I would really like to know. This Law again stops evolution in its tracks! It cannot proceed.\nThe very claims of the creationst's version would make any life impossible, as it claims that there is NO increase in local energy. Growth and development would be impossible. However, their claims also are completely unrelated to evolutionary changes. There is no evidence that a mutation needs energy to occur beyond normal cell division, or that this energy is unavailable to the cell. Mutations happen during cell divisions. The only way the mutation would be impossible is if the cell division was impossible as well, which would make your very existence impossible. \n \n As such, your claim (or really the AiG claim that you repeated uncritically and without thought or knowledge of the scientific facts) is false. Evolution can proceed as long as cell division proceeds. The creationist claims merely shows incredible ignorance of what evolution actually is, which always makes me wonder about the reliability of those who argue against what they obviosuly knows nothing about.\n \n \nSome evolutionists assert that quantum physics can produce something from nothing,..\nPlease don't make up lies about \"evolutionists.\" Evolution does not deal with quantum physics. The ones dealing with that are physicists. The Scientific Theory of Evolution is a Scientific Theory in the field of biology, not physics. And the Scientific Theory of Evolution says nothing about the origin of the universe, the Big Bang, Quantum Physics or anything like that. So please refrain from misrepresenting Evolutionary Biologists in the future.\n \n \n.. and that the Law of Causality breaks down at the quantum level, but that too is false.\nWhy? What is the Quantum physical limitation of this?\n \n \nTheories that the universe is a quantum fluctuation must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate - their \"quantum vacuum\" is a lot of matter-antimatter - not \"nothing\".\nActually not. The matter-antimatter is what erupts from the singularity inversions. The matter-antimatter is the result, not the spource, of these singularity inversions. You really ought to read up on these things before posting them.\n \n \nAlso, if there is no cause, there is no explanation why this particular universe appeared at a particcular time, nor why it was a universe and not, say, a banana or a cat that appeared. \nNow, that is kind of correct. A singularity can invert into anything, even another singularity, and as such have never existed to begin with, even while it inverted. (Yes, quantum physics is odd stuff).\n \n \nThis universe can't have any properties to explain its preferential coming into existence, because it would not have any properties until it actually came into existence.\n Now, THAT is correct, except that we have the current physical function (natural laws and such), showing us the specifics of the character of this universe. Another universe could have inverted with different physical properties. So the way the singularity inverted itself is hinted at in the physical properties of our universe.\n \n \nThey (the creationists) use science..\nRather, they misuse and misrepresent science, as I showed above regarding the 2LoT. Using science inappropriately is not laudable. Selecting bits and pieces and misrepresenting everything else may be to \"use\" science, but it sure ISN'T science.\n \n \n..and have a very good point to which evolutionists have no really good answer.\nOnly in their own postulation. Actually, when science evaluates the creationist claims, they are disproven and hence rejected as is appropriate through the Scientific Method. Crackpot wishful thinking is not science.\n \n \nSo far, the Laws of Science appears to agree with the Bible and lean away from evolution.\nNope, as has bbeen repeatedly shown. Rather, creationists believe this, because they generally are ignorant of the scienec itself, and because they are starting out with their conclusion borne from dogma, and then explore data for fit afterward, picking and choosing data and making up false claims and misrepresenting the actual science, as shown above. :xbanghead",

   "So in summary:\n a. the universe requires a cause.\n b. God being creator is outside of time and hence, does not require a cause.\n c. big bang theory cannot account for this.\n d. I still require an evolutionary answer to this point.\n \nTaking the last point first:\n \n d. No you don't: evolution has nothing to do with the creation of the universe. This is like saying you need meterological answer to concrete.\n \n All the rest can be lumped together. God, being the creator outside of time, provided the cause of the universe. He did it via the big bang. We know, with a fairly high level of certainty, that the universe had a start and that start was the big bang.\n \n I find it funny seeing others implying that the big bang is some atheist threat to Christianity and creation by God. Until late in the 20th century, the most popular by far theory of the universe amongst atheists was the steady state model. The \"big bang\" was thought up by a Christian and was given the name as a joke by an atheist who loathed the idea and saw it as a \"comic theory\" rather than a \"cosmic theory\".",

   "To Carla5010:\n \nWhere did this \"law\" come from and how was it validated and verified?\n \n \n I do not know where this Law came from. But is that important? The main point is that it exists, and only an un-scientific layman would deny it's existence. It forms the basis of science and scientific knowledge. Scientists seek to explain what, how, and why, an observed object behaves the way that it does. How is it validated and verified? By the scientific method of course! I thought that you should have picked up on that. It is a very special scientific thing called observation. When a hypothesis is found to work everywhere without exception is it known as a Law of Nature - which are absolute. And no matter where we look in nature, everything which comes into being has a cause, i.e. there is not one example in nature where something comes into existence that does not have some sort of cause. \n \n I don't know if you are questioning real scientific knowledge here, but if you are it is pointless.\n \n \nWhy?\n \n \n I think that it is pretty obvious, don't you? For one, massive observational evidence (which your scientific method relies so much on), and for two, if something has been around forever and ever, than how can it have a cause? You appear to be questioning logic.\n \n \nThe current estimate is that this cause was a singularity.\n \n \n That is a common mis-understanding of the Law of Causality. Singularity is not  the cause of the universe, it is thought to be the process  involved in its creation. There is a very big difference. Consider the example of a chair being made. The cause would be for someone to sit on it after the chair is made. To make the chair, a large piece of wood needs to be found and the proper components made, once the parts are all assembled the chair is finished. (Now that is a pretty crude way of looking at it, it is more complex than this, but just to illustrate my point we will keep it simple.) The effect would be someone sitting on it. Hence, the effect is not greater than the cause (an important aspect of Causality).\n \n So from the simple example above, you can see that the processes invovled in making the chair is vastly different from the cause. Now if we apply this to your \"singularity\" as being a possible cause we come up with a similar thing. The \"singularity\" explosion is the processes involved in the \"creation\" of the universe, it is not the cause  for the universe. The cause would be something like \"Why was the singularity there in the first place?\" Once this question is answered, evolution is than able to proceed. But it is stuck at the first hurdle.\n \n \nYou still haven't shown that this actually is the case. This \"law\" is not one we see commonly used and validated, so we need a bit more evidence first. Is this a scientific law?\n \n \n See above for the first statement (observation and logic). I gave you a definition of Causality in previous post and yes it is a scientific law, hence the Law of Nature idea. Did you know that in tests when a question asks you to \"Explain\" something that it is actually asking you to relate the \"cause and effect\"? You see, this Law forms the basis of science and what it does (see above for \"what, why, how?\")\n \n \nWell, relative time anyway. Be careful about how you present relativity.\n \n \n You also appear (I don't know for sure though, and if you understand it more than me and I have made a mistake I apologise in advance :-) to have a mis-understanding about Relativity. Let me \"try\" to enlighten you. Since the speed of light is a constant, than time and length (distance) are variables. This comes from D = ST where D=distance, S=speed and T=time. As a consequence of Special Theory of Relativity in order to define an object's position we must consider four coordinates in the space-time continuum - three dimensions of space and time [Einstein's First Thought Experiment - teacher handout reference]. So as soon as we have matter and space, time starts, as a result of above. I know some of relativity.\n \n \nWell, that is a presumption, Since this is not possible to prove, it must remain a presumption, a basis for Faith.\n \n \n Ah, so the clever atheist does finally catch on with the idea of assumptions! Congrats! So true you are.\n \n \nin OUR relative time, anyway. Again, be careful about how you interpret relativity.\n \n \n From above, so my statement was correct. God is outside of everyone's frame of reference. Because He (by definition) created the universe and hence time, He is outside of it - no matter what frame of reference you are dealing with. So your statement is irrelevent.\n \n \nEssentially, you are saying that you have defined God to not have a time frame, and thus being relatively causeless. That is valid inside our relative time frame only.\n \n \n No, what I am saying is that God is outside of time period, including any other frame of reference. Going on the assumption that a God guided big bang did happen, okay? This \"big bang\" would have created all the matter and space present in this universe at present date, would it not? So with the initial explosion time would have started. As time passed differences in gravity in different areas of space would have made more frames of references in which time flows faster or slower. Earth's gravitational frame of reference is just an area of space from which we can compare other frame of references to. So God being outside of time would apply to all frames of reference. This is similar for the Genesis account of our origin.\n \n \nAgreed.\n \n \n Wow! There is one thing we can agree on! Praise the LORD! \n \n \nWhy? it certainly could have been caused by a singularity! Your claim is merely your personal opinion, not proven or documented in light of the possibility of a singularity inversion.\n \n \n See above for more detailed response. The singularity explosion or fluctuation is the process, not the cause. It is my opinion, but thus far, evolutionists have no been able to answer this question - which further leads me to believe that they have no answer.\n \n \nExactly WHAT does evolution have to do with the above? Your claim seems completely irrelevant and certainly without any connection to evolution at all.\n \n \n I posted this post before I started that new thread. To me, the big bang is apart of the whole evolutionary scheme of things, i.e. it is the science of genetics that deals with DNA changes and so forth (which you say that evolution deals with). As far as I know, Charles Darwin - the main \"re-formist\" of evolution was implying that evolution dealt with how things got here, i.e. pond-scum into fish into reptiles into birds/mammals. Then a logical questioner can ask where the \"soup\" came from and end up taking it all the way back to the beginning. I think that the definition of evolution has been changed since Darwin's day. \n \n \nIndeed. Now, where is it documented and validated?\n \n \n Since you know so much about the scientific method and so on you should not need to ask such questions. Do you know what a hypothesis is? A hypothesis is a possible solution or an educated guess to the problem. Now if the hypothesis is found to apply generally without any exceptions, it is regarded as a Law. How about I turn the tables on you? Is there any example in Nature where something comes into example without a cause? Btw, why are you arguing with scientific knowledge? I thought that that was the creationists job?? \n \n \nActually, the distinction between a scientific theory and a natural law is that theory is a model that explains behavior where as a natural law simply states a measurable relationship at experimental conditions. They are not interchangeable\n \n \n Actually, a \"theory is a group of related hypothesis relevant to the original problem\". I am reading this directly from that HSC Physics book in regards to \"Laws and Theories\" [Excel HSC Physics by Neville Warren, \"Laws and Theories\" p. 305]. I am not making up the definitions of Laws of Nature and theories, I am using references. Theories are not proven to work beyond all circumstances, while the Laws of Nature are absolute and apply to all circumstances without question.\n \n \nYes it actually can. Go read up in singularity inversions.\n \n \n See above for singularity rebuttal. It is a process, not a cause. Once again, a wrong interpretation of science. \n \n \nWhy? Evolution has NOTHING to do with the Big Bang\n \n \n As I have said before, I group all of the three types of so called \"sciences\" into the single category of evolution, including origin. They are all apart of a three sided triangle (obviously three sides, :- 0). That is my defintion of evolution. From now on I will use your definition of evolution if it pleases you.\n \n Btw, thanks for not calling me a liar or my information full of the \"usual lies\" and for concentrating on the argument. I really appreciate that. I makes for a better debate.\n Yours truly,\n Matt.\n \n We are the masters of getting off topic! But it is more enjoyable that way!",

Thanks for sharing that with us! But I don't think that the big bang theory today is exactly the same as he proposed it.

   "But here is my point! The point that I have been trying to get across either here or on a different thread, how do you know that the dating techniques are accurate?? Before you measured the rock [above] how do you know it was billions of years? You don't, you have to make an arbitrary assumption based on your underlying beliefs. You have no scientific basis for stating that, it was in your opinion.\n\n \n Fan I will answer your question but before I do I'm going to say that you don't seem to be interested in looking at the evidence, only in trying to make the evidence fit your beliefs. That is exactly what happened when the church was embarrassed by putting Galileo on trial for stating that the earth rotated around the sun. Sandy on the other hand seems to want the evidence to be according to her beliefs but is genuinely interested in the truth. \n \n I'm not interested in arguing 15 different things. Science is difficult, especially in this age when so much knowledge has been discovered. The basic principles are often easily understood, but the details require years of study and research. As someone who works in a field that requires years of study to understand the details of the subject, I understand how a general knowledge of a subject can be distorted into almost the opposite of what the truth is. Therefore when 99% of the scientists who are educated in a field state that something is true, I'm not going to believe the 1% who have an agenda that say it's not true.\n \n But to answer your question. The way you know your dating techniques are accurate is to use more than one method and compare the age given by each to each other. If the dates agree, then you can be sure you have the right answer. If they don't agree, then you don't have the right answer.\n \n \nNow based on the rocks characteristics you could choose a certain radiometric dating technique, depending on how old or young you want the rock to be. And in many cases if the radiometric date does not agree with your assumption (based on your beliefs) than the radiometric date is usually dropped, unless it is not in conflict with eachother than it is kept. This after-the-event reasoning shows that radiometric dating has serious problems.Woodmorappe cites hundreds of examples of excuses used to explain away \"bad\" dates in his book \"The Mythology of Modern Dating Methods\". Although they are not being dishonest, it is just that all observations must fit the prevailing paradigm or belief system. Molecules-to-man evolution is so strongly entrenched it is not questioned - it is \"fact\". So every observation must fit this paradigm. Unconsciously, the researchers involved - \"objective scientists\" in the eyes of the laymen - select the observations to fit the basic belief system. \n\n \n There are very few cases that are thrown out and for those that are, there are reasons for questioning the dates. They don't just throw out dates for no reason.\n \n Can you post a link or reference to the hundreds of examples cited by Woodmorappe?\n \n \nHow do they know that the rock is old when they haven't even tested it? You see, they are using several evolutionary assumptions to put into practice to prove the theory of evolution, creationists can use their assumptions and put them into practice to prove their model. How do you know what \"time you are dating\"? This is going against the flow of logic! So if you discard the results to which you believe are false - i.e. those that go against your assumption or guess - what do you have left? Only dates next to the ones that you assumed or guessed to be right. So no wonderthe dates give old ages! You have discarded the dates that disagree with that! LOL!\n\n \n Evolution is not used to date rocks. You continually refer to every science as evolutionary science which simply shows your ignorance of science in general.\n \n The following link is the best I have seen on dating rocks. Its author is a Christian so he has no anti-Christian agenda to promote.\n \n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens.html",

If you are unable to do any further elaboration yourslf, please provide a scientific source for this.\n \n \nWhen a hypothesis is found to work everywhere without exception is it known as a Law of Nature - which are absolute.\nThis is incorrect. Natural laws are mathematical relationships that are always true.

This proclaimed law is beginning to seem more and more like a philosophy exercize rather than science.\n \n \nI don't know if you are questioning real scientific knowledge here, but if you are it is pointless.\nI am merely wondering whether this socalled law actually is science. Sofar you have not exactly been forthcoming with documentation for this, chosing instead to attack me for doubting you.\n \n \nI think that it is pretty obvious, don't you? For one, massive observational evidence (which your scientific method relies so much on), and for two, if something has been around forever and ever, than how can it have a cause? You appear to be questioning logic.\nRather, I am questioning whether somethignactually needs a cause. Quantum Theory seems to indicate that this is not the case. So does String theory. Sofar you have not shown otherwise., atatcking me instead of even providing documntation for this \"law\" that I am expected to accept on your \"because I say so.\" I will need some independent verification.\n \n \nThat is a common mis-understanding of the Law of Causality. Singularity is not  the cause of the universe, it is thought to be the process  involved in its creation.\nProcess vs cause. OK. Then you will have to show that something caused the singularity, though.\n \n \nThere is a very big difference. Consider the example of a chair being made. The cause would be for someone to sit on it after the chair is made.\nAh, so you are using the word \"cause\" as synonymous with \"purpose\" rather than with \"originator\"?\n \n \nNow if we apply this to your \"singularity\" as being a possible cause we come up with a similar thing. The \"singularity\" explosion is the processes involved in the \"creation\" of the universe, it is not the cause  for the universe. The cause would be something like \"Why was the singularity there in the first place?\"\nFor no reason at all. That is clear in Quantum Theory. There doesn't need to be an originator of the Singularity.\n \n \nOnce this question is answered, evolution is than able to proceed. But it is stuck at the first hurdle.\nBack to that nonsense. Evolution is about the change in a population over time. It has nothing to do with the origin of the universe.\n \n \nSee above for the first statement (observation and logic). I gave you a definition of Causality in previous post and yes it is a scientific law, hence the Law of Nature idea.\nI only have your owrd for it, and the explanation that seems to contradict it being a Natural law. So you need to do much better.\n \n \nDid you know that in tests when a question asks you to \"Explain\" something that it is actually asking you to relate the \"cause and effect\"?\nSo please explain to me the cause of a Singularity (Yes, this is a test).\n \n \nYou see, this Law forms the basis of science and what it does (see above for \"what, why, how?\")\nYour climing it to be a law doesn't make it so. You need to provide some independent documentation. I did a search of it, and every description of it is a bout philosophy, not science. So that alone indicates that your attempt at making it a law of physics is outright wrong.\n \n \nYou also appear (I don't know for sure though, and if you understand it more than me and I have made a mistake I apologise in advance :-) to have a mis-understanding about Relativity.\nI would recommend you not going there, but OK.\n \n \nAs a consequence of Special Theory of Relativity in order to define an object's position we must consider four coordinates in the space-time continuum - three dimensions of space and time [Einstein's First Thought Experiment - teacher handout reference].\nWhat is this \"teacher's handout reference\" \n \n \nSo as soon as we have matter and space, time starts, as a result of above. I know some of relativity.\nWell, that was a rather simple explanation of lightspeed as distance meassurement. That is a bit unsubstantial for explaining Relativity Theory. Lets just say that yes, I do know how this work.\n \n \nAh, so the clever atheist does finally catch on with the idea of assumptions! Congrats! So true you are.\nI would strongly recommend you stopping lying about me right now.[U]\n \n \nFrom above, so my statement was correct. God is outside of everyone's frame of reference. Because He (by definition) created the universe and hence time, He is outside of it - no matter what frame of reference you are dealing with. So your statement is irrelevent.\nNope, rather your concept of time is off. God is outside time of our universe only. Weird that you missed that part.\n \n \nNo, what I am saying is that God is outside of time period, including any other frame of reference.\nAny other frame inside our universe only.\n \n \nGoing on the assumption that a God guided big bang did happen, okay? This \"big bang\" would have created all the matter and space present in this universe at present date, would it not? So with the initial explosion time would have started.\nWithin this universe, yes.\n \n \nSo God being outside of time would apply to all frames of reference.\nNope. Only that God would be outside of any frame of reference that WE can access inside of our dimensions of existence.\n \n \nThis is similar for the Genesis account of our origin.\nAs that account occurs inside our universe, no it isn't. Time might pass differently to God, but a day in our universe remains a day. And the Genesis account of the occurances as \"days\" simply are not correct (Not to mention that the order described in the first 6 days are out of order and inconsistent).\n \n \n \nThe singularity explosion or fluctuation is the process, not the cause.\nI disagree with that assertion. Do I need to teach you about singularities?\n \n \nIt is my opinion, but thus far, evolutionists have no been able to answer this question - which further leads me to believe that they have no answer.\nAnd again, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with Evolution, which is a biological field dealing with the changes in populations of organisms, not the origin of the universe 10 bill years before these organisms first existed.\n \n \nI posted this post before I started that new thread. To me, the big bang is apart of the whole evolutionary scheme of things, i.e. it is the science of genetics that deals with DNA changes and so forth (which you say that evolution deals with).\nYes, the Big Bang is indeed separate from the Scientific Theory of Evolution. They have nothing to do with each other.\n \n \nAs far as I know, Charles Darwin - the main \"re-formist\" of evolution was implying that evolution dealt with how things got here,\nYou are incorect. Your knowledge of darwin's hypothesis is telling. he dealt with the changes of populations (namely Evolution), not the origin of the first lifeform (which is known as Abiogenesis, and which is separate from Evolution.)\n \n \n i.e. pond-scum into fish..\nThis is not evolution.\n \n \n..into reptiles into birds/mammals.\nThat part is part of Evolution, yes.\n \n \nThen a logical questioner can ask where the \"soup\" came from and end up taking it all the way back to the beginning.\nNone of which has anything to do with the Scientific Theory of Evolution. You have fallen into the creationist trap of believing thta everything that contradicts creationism must be \"evolution,\" when in fact, this encompasses just about every scientific field in addition to Biology.\n \n \nI think that the definition of evolution has been changed since Darwin's day.\nNot really. What Darwin proposed was a hypothesis. Nut till the process of mutations and the existence of DNA was established, was it possible to formulate an actual Scientific Theory of Evolution. Until that point, it remained a model.\n \n \nSince you know so much about the scientific method and so on you should not need to ask such questions.\nSince you seem to misuse the Scientific Method right and left, yes I do need to ask such questions.\n \n \nDo you know what a hypothesis is? A hypothesis is a possible solution or an educated guess to the problem.\nYes.\n \n \nNow if the hypothesis is found to apply generally without any exceptions, it is regarded as a Law.\nNope, then it is considered to be a Scientific Theory.\n \n \nHow about I turn the tables on you? Is there any example in Nature where something comes into example without a cause?\nNot that I can think of right now, but a Singularity certainly fits that picture. And as far as I can tell (I need to read up more on this), String Theory (which as far as I can see is still only a model, but wiser people may be able to clarify this) also fits this.\n \n \nBtw, why are you arguing with scientific knowledge?\nI am not sure that I am arguing with anything but philosophy. Sofar, everything I have found on this \"law of causality\" shows it to be philosophy rather than science. I am still awaiting your clarification.\n \n \nActually, a \"theory is a group of related hypothesis relevant to the original problem\". I am reading this directly from that HSC Physics book in regards to \"Laws and Theories\" [Excel HSC Physics by Neville Warren, \"Laws and Theories\" p. 305]. \nActually, they need to be more than hypotheses, as a hypothesis doesn't remain a hypothesis if there is evidence for it. At that time, it becomes a model. So the correct definition would have to substitute \"model\" instead of \"hypothesis.\" That book is a bit off. It is apparently geared towards Highschool physics. Every search I did on \"HSC physics\" came up with Australian sources, so perhaps they teach it differently there?\n \n Here is a good explaination of the difference between Scientific theories and natural laws:\n http://wind.cc.whecn.edu/~mechalke/chapter1/lecture_ch1.htm\n ----\n How does a theory differ form natural law?\n A theory is a model that explains the behavior of nature.\n The atomic theory states that matter is composed individual particles. This helps explain the behavior of gases.\n A natural law does not explain behavior, but simply states a measurable relationship\n Many times a natural law is expressed as an equation.\n Bolye's law states: P1V1=P2V2\n ----\n \n \nI am not making up the definitions of Laws of Nature and theories, I am using references.\nNot very good ones \n \n \nTheories are not proven to work beyond all circumstances, while the Laws of Nature are absolute and apply to all circumstances without question.\nYour hbasis for contrast is invalid.\n \n \nSee above for singularity rebuttal. It is a process, not a cause.\nYour above claim didn't make sense.\n \n \nOnce again, a wrong interpretation of science. \nThat's how I read your post.\n \n \nAs I have said before, I group all of the three types of so called \"sciences\" into the single category of evolution, including origin.\nYes you do. Your mislabeling of other scientific fields as evolution is merely your misuse of the term.\n \n \nThey are all apart of a three sided triangle (obviously three sides, :- 0). That is my defintion of evolution. From now on I will use your definition of evolution if it pleases you.\nSince your definition has no bearing in reality, yes the correct use of the term would \"please\" me.",

   "To carla 5010:\n \nI am not denying its existence. I am merely questioning its existence. And it certainly doesn't immediately seem to fit a \"natural law\" concept. If you are unable to do any further elaboration yourslf, please provide a scientific source for this.\n \n \n Do you know what a natural law is? It is where a hypothesis is seen to apply to everything without question or exception. You don't appear to get the gist of this very simple concept. Before I state some sources, does anyone else know about the Law of Causality? May be Carla5010 might listen if one of the evolutionists or secular humanists tells him/her rather than me trying to re-explain it again and again to a level that a five year old would be able to understand. Some sources:\n * http://creationsciencemessages.org/lawcausal.htm\n * http://www.utas.edu.au/docs/humsoc/philosophy/ccc/slides/2a.html \n * http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/7547/1cause.html \n Just go to google.com.au and type in \"Law of Causality\" and you get a massive list of replies that will tell you that this Law is a Law and that it is true. Let us move on.\n \n \nThis is incorrect. Natural laws are mathematical relationships that are always true. Hypotheses that are validated are known as Scientific Theories, not Natural Laws.\n \n \n Remember that this definition that you are arguing against is not what I made up. I got this from a physics textbook and I am confident that it's defintion is correct. Your last and final statement is not reading my post fully. When a hypothesis  is found to apply everywhere without execptions  it becomes a, wow look at that, Law! A number of related hypothesises relevent to the oringinal problem may then be joined to form a theory. If you are going to argue a point, read the information in the post that you are going to try and refute first. It may help you out.\n \n \nThis certainly doesn't fit for quantum physics. So perhaps you need to modify this to encompass only the Newtonian Universe? This proclaimed law is beginning to seem more and more like a philosophy exercize rather than science.\n \n \n As explained before, Causality does not break down in quantum physics. Read my response to Mr Jack for more information. A fluctuation must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate - their quantum vacuum is a lot of matter-antimatter potential - not \"nothing\", which is what you are implying. For Causality not to apply, something would have to come from nothing. BUT from above, their vacuum is not \"nothing\" - it is a lot of matter-antimatter potential. Who is still going against science? You claim that the creationists do this, but you are doing a pretty goood at that!\n \n \nI am merely wondering whether this socalled law actually is science. \n \n See previous response for more information. This is about as scientific as you are going to get scientific, i.e. it uses observations (a jolly lot of it too), which if I'm not mistaken forms the basis of the scientific method.\n \n \nRather, I am questioning whether somethignactually needs a cause. Quantum Theory seems to indicate that this is not the case. So does the String theory.\n \n \n As shown above, Causality still applies to quantum physics. As for that other thing, the \"String Theory\" I have never heard of it and as a result will not argue about it.\n \n \natatcking me instead of even providing documntation for this \"law\" that I am expected to accept on your \"because I say so.\" I will need some independent verification.\n \n \n Actually, all science, history and law enforcement would collapse if this Law of cause and effect were denied.\n \n \nProcess vs cause. OK. Then you will have to show that something caused the singularity, though.\n \n \n That is the idea. Now, Causality doesn't apply in thesitic evolution (or a God guided evolution) as that has cause, nor does it worry the creation model. Causality is only a trouble athesitic or secular humanism evolution (or the big bang theory), as there is no cause. I got the following information from an internet site on the String Theory:\n \nString theory is based on the (deceptively simple) premise that at Planckian scales, where the quantum effects of gravity are strong, particles are actually one-dimensional extended objects. Just as a particle that moves through spacetime sweeps out a curve\n \n The question has to be asked, why are thos particles there in the first place and why do they behave the way that they do?\n \n \nAh, so you are using the word \"cause\" as synonymous with \"purpose\" rather than with \"originator\"?\n \n \n Yes, as the Law of Causality says. Sorry if I made it unclear.\n \n \nFor no reason at all. That is clear in Quantum Theory. There doesn't need to be an originator of the Singularity.\n \n \n That is a common mis-understanding (to my knowledge) of Causality and quantum mehanics. See above for rebuttal.\n \n \nBack to that nonsense. Evolution is about the change in a population over time. It has nothing to do with the origin of the universe.\n \n This all goes back to my original definition. You see, from my definition it is not nonsense. Besides, the science that deals with your definition is called genetics. Genetics deals with basically \"everything to deal with genes\" and we don't need evolution to explain this. Everyone who has studied mutations on a molecular level discovers that all mutations lead to a loss of information, i.e. there is not one mutation that actually adds new information to the genome (which would be required for the Theory of Evolution to proceed, i.e. simplier organisms to change into more complex organisms requires a tonne of information. Evolutionists theorise that mutations along with nautral selection is such a mechanism, but this goes against scientific knowledge and observations).\n \n \nI only have your owrd for it, and the explanation that seems to contradict it being a Natural law. So you need to do much better.\n \n \n My definition is correct (you can check it if you want). I got it from Dr Jeremy I. Walter (Mechanical Engineering) from the book \"In Six Days: why 50 scientists choose to believe in creation\". You can also check that if you want to.\n \n \nSo please explain to me the cause of a Singularity (Yes, this is a test).\n \n \n Firstly let me define singularity, The point at which space-time becomes compressed to the point of being infinitely dense and infinitely small. It is a mathematical expression. The cause of the singularity would be \"Why is it there?\" I have no athesitic answer for this that is valid, my closest answer would most likely involve quantum mechanics. The effect would be everything (space-time, or matter) being crushed to the smallest point possible, i.e. close to being infinitely small and dense. The cause from my point of view would be the handiwork of God - depending on the situation.\n \n \nYour climing it to be a law doesn't make it so. You need to provide some independent documentation. I did a search of it, and every description of it is a bout philosophy, not science. So that alone indicates that your attempt at making it a law of physics is outright wrong.\n \n \n Well, I don't know if you used the \"\" around the words that you used. But I typed it in and got quite a list. It has observational backing and is a fundamental law of science, I do not know why you persist in this argument. It would have went through the scientific method that you constantly bring up.\n \n \nWhat is this \"teacher's handout reference\" \n \n \n I don't know whether or not you can remember school (assumption neccessary), but do you remember getting additional information or hand outs from your teacher that are supposed to further advance your knowledge rather than just study out of one or two textbooks? Well this is one of them. It is just an extract from another physics textbook that the class does not have. And no, there is no conspiracy here if you are thinking that I am making it up.\n \n \nI would strongly recommend you stopping lying about me right now\n\n \n Woah! I'm sorry, it was a compliment. When you acknowldge the existence of assumptions (rather than calling them lies or whatever) you are starting to have more of an \"open mind\" which many people say is important. Btw, you said it, not me. Once again, sorry if that offended you, that was not it's purpose.\n \n \nNope, rather your concept of time is off. God is outside time of our universe only. Weird that you missed that part.\n \n \n There is only one universe, although a few evolutionists or secular humanists (since you totally oppose the use of \"evolutionist\" to describe the big bang and so on). A definition from that same Excel HSC Physics Textbook of a universe: a universe is all that exists. So how can you have two lots of all that exists and so on? At the moment the idea of multi-universes (to my knowledge) is just theoretical and has no real hard evidence. But you are entitled to your opinion. So in my opinion, since there is only one universe (1 lot of \"everything that exists\") and God made that, hence He is outside of time altogether! So once again, your statement becomes invalid.\n \n \nAny other frame inside our universe only.\n \n \n True I guess, since there is only one universe. That is what the Bible hints at, and since I trust the events in Genesis (as there is no scientific evidence that goes against this - once again, if there is, please show me, not in terms of evolution, as I believe that evolution (having a different definition to you) is just a different interpretation of the evidence that we see to describe in a way that might be able to exclude God. So once more, invalid statement unless it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt that more than 1 lot of \"everything that exists\" exists, i.e. multi-universe.\n \n \nNope. Only that God would be outside of any frame of reference that WE can access inside of our dimensions of existence.\n \n \n Incorrect, if God made everything (including time), that means that He would be outside of every frame of reference in the entire universe, regardless of whether or not we can observe or access them. \n \n \nAs that account occurs inside our universe, no it isn't. Time might pass differently to God, but a day in our universe remains a day. And the Genesis account of the occurances as \"days\" simply are not correct (Not to mention that the order described in the first 6 days are out of order and inconsistent).\n \n \n God does not have a starting point in time. He does not even experience time (to my knowledge, although I have no proof of this, His very nature suggests this though). Who are you to say that the Genesis account of events is incorrect? Were you there? Since the Bible is the written Word of God, and it is for man, obviously (and logically) the \"days\" therefore must be with reference to Earth, or E.S.T. (Earth Standard Time). And no, the order is not out of order and inconsistent. I invite you to explain this point, as I cannot see anything incosistent with this.\n \n \nI disagree with that assertion. Do I need to teach you about singularities?\n \n \n It is not the cause, it is the process involved. You can teach me if you want to, all I know about singularity is the defintion (given above). Whether or not you agree with my \"assertion\" is your choice. I'm not really worried if you don't.\n \n \nYes, the Big Bang is indeed separate from the Scientific Theory of Evolution. They have nothing to do with each other.\n \n \n They are kind of the same thing. The main point is that they all use natural processes and without the haniwork of a Creator God (although some may imply that God guides the process, but it is still naturalisitc). One can ask where the first life came from, and where Earth, stars, solar system and galaxies came from. And from this view of evolution, we need to expand on it to explain and encompase this whole area. \n \n \nYou are incorect. Your knowledge of darwin's hypothesis is telling. \n \n Probably. Why then, was there a BIG stir up in the media when those evolutionary scientists were trying to make life from non-life? They were trying to show how the first microorganism could arive by chance to further support evolution! However, they failed, even if they did succeed, it still would not be evidence for evolution. This is because the scientists were trying to show that no intelligence was neccessary in the first life, but they had already made a mistake, they were using their own intelligence to show that no intelligence was neccessary! In otherwords, the experiment was flawed from the beginning. This attempt to me suggests that your definition of evolution is not fully correct and indeed evolution encompasses a much broder area than you are willing to admit (in my opinion). \n \n \nNone of which has anything to do with the Scientific Theory of Evolution. You have fallen into the creationist trap of believing thta everything that contradicts creationism must be \"evolution,\" \n \n \n That is making them sound cynical, which is not keeping an \"open mind\" or a neutral mind. I think that you might misunderstand your own theory (in my opinion) and what it actually involves, as in the example above. It forms a triange: Astronomical evolution, chemical evolution and biological evolution. \n \n \nNot really. \n \n \n I think that where Darwin got confused in with his knowledge of genetics (which wasn't very advanced at his time). When he say variety in the offspring of say dogs, that was outside that of the parents he thought that there must be new information being added; hence, he thought the species was changing in an upward direction. That is where he made his main mistake.\n \n \nSince you seem to misuse the Scientific Method right and left, yes I do need to ask such questions.\n \n \n More baseless accusations. You are pretty brave in making such claims when you do not even apply the scientific method to Causality. The basis for the scientific method are observations and experimental validation. This is what Causality is based on (observational data). \n \n \nNope, then it is considered to be a Scientific Theory.\n \n \n No, a number of related hypotheses releveant to the original problem may then be joined to form a theory. I am reading this directly from the book. You appear to have a misunderstanding here, unless Neville Warren does not know what he is talking about (it is however doubtful).\n \n \nNot that I can think of right now, but a Singularity certainly fits that picture. \n \n \n As shown above, singularity is not the cause, it is a process. It needs a cause. String Theory (from my understanding) still fails here too.\n \n \nI am not sure that I am arguing with anything but philosophy. \n \n As said above, Causality forms the basis of all science.\n \n \nEvery search I did on \"HSC physics\" came up with Australian sources, so perhaps they teach it differently there?\n \n \n I don't know, good question. I couldn't imagine so. Who knows. Btw, thanks for the link. We have two different sources saying \"similar\" but different information. I don't know which one to trust. We will never agree, so let us just call it a truce, eh? Otherwise we will be going on about this forever. \n \n \nYour above claim didn't make sense.\n \n \n The main point was that singularity explosion that supposedly started the big bang is the process involved in the universe's \"creation\". Hence, you are still lacking a cause for the singularity by Causality.\n \n \nThat's how I read your post.\n \n \n Charmed, I am slightly amused. Now, Causality is a true and fundamental part of science. Science seeks to explain the nature and processes of our universe and why it behaves in a certain manner. This is basically is talking about the \"cause and effect\" relationships.\n \n \nYes you do. Your mislabeling of other scientific fields as evolution is merely your misuse of the term.\n \n \n Arguable point.\n \n \nSince your definition has no bearing in reality, yes the correct use of the term would \"please\" me\n \n \n I am so happy for you.

   " Do you know what a natural law is? It is where a hypothesis is seen to apply to everything without question or exception.\nNope, that is a wrong description of a natural law.

Go learn some real science, and then get on with the issue, rather than trying to perpetuate your error. Merely repeating your claim doesn't make it any more right.\n \n \ntheir quantum vacuum is a lot of matter-antimatter potential - not \"nothing\",\nAH, but that is NOT what you first said. First, you left out the \"potential\" part.\n \n \nFor Causality not to apply, something would have to come from nothing.\nLike a singularity.\n \n \nBUT from above, their vacuum is not \"nothing\" - it is a lot of matter-antimatter potential.\nAnd the potential is still a nothingness. It doesn't change until we actually have the singularity inversion, which then creates the matter/anti-matter itself. before then, there isn't any matter/anti-matter present, only a nothingness.\n \n \nWho is still going against science? You claim that the creationists do this, but you are doing a pretty good at that!\nRather, you are showing your ignorance. You are essentially saying that because a void has the potential to not be a void, it is not a void.\n \n \nSee previous response for more information. This is about as scientific as you are going to get scientific, i.e. it uses observations (a jolly lot of it too), which if I'm not mistaken forms the basis of the scientific method.\nSo far, you and the various websites have NOT distinguished this from philosophy. There is still no evidence that this \"law of causality\" of yours is a natural law rather than a philosophical concept.\n \n \nAs shown above, Causality still applies to quantum physics. As for that other thing, the \"String Theory\" I have never heard of it and as a result will not argue about it.\nHere are a couple of informative sites that are not to technical:\n http://superstringtheory.com/\n \n http://turing.wins.uva.nl/~rhd/string_theory.html\n (good pictoral description.)\n \n \nActually, all science, history and law enforcement would collapse if this Law of cause and effect were denied.\nI haven't said that it was denied, only that it doesn't sound like a Scientific Theory, more like one from the fiedl of philosophy.\n \n \n [Show that something caused the Singularity]\n \nThat is the idea.\nSo? Where is it?\n \n \n Now, Causality doesn't apply in thesitic evolution (or a God guided evolution) as that has cause, nor does it worry the creation model. Causality is only a trouble athesitic or secular humanism evolution (or the big bang theory),\nThose two are unrelated.\n \n \nas there is no cause.\nFor the big bang theory, the cause is deemed to be a Singularity Inversion. For the Scientific Theory of Evolution, the cause is Natural Selection.\n \n \nI got the following information from an internet site on the String Theory:\n \"String theory is based on the (deceptively simple) premise that at Planckian scales, where the quantum effects of gravity are strong, particles are actually one-dimensional extended objects. Just as a particle that moves through spacetime sweeps out a curve \"\n The question has to be asked, why are thos particles there in the first place and why do they behave the way that they do?\nWell, that's what the research is working on, the behavior part. We already know what they are. They are a combined matter and force \"particle\" (Like a particle and its vector physically attached, making out the strings of One Planck Length)\n \n \nThat is a common mis-understanding (to my knowledge) of Causality and quantum mehanics. See above for rebuttal.\nWhat is? That there need to be a cause for the singularity? That is a common misunderstanding?\n \n \nThis all goes back to my original definition. You see, from my definition it is not nonsense.\nFrom ANY definition other than the actual one, it is nonsense. Just because YOU define Evolution to include the Big Bang doesn't mean that your inclusion is valid. It actually remains invalid, as the real, Scientific definition is that found in the biological sciences, which are NOT related to cosmology and physics.\n \n \nBesides, the science that deals with your definition is called genetics.\nNonsense. Please stop lying about science. Genetics deal with the mechanism of DNA replication and allied processes.\n \n \nGenetics deals with basically \"everything to deal with geness\"\nyou are still lying about science. Your attempt at redefining all science to justify your initial lies does not make your redefinitions valid.\n \n \n and we don't need evolution to explain this.\nQuite. But we do use the Scientific Theory of Evolution to explain the changes in populations over time.\n \n \nEveryone who has studied mutations on a molecular level discovers that all mutations lead to a loss of information,\nAnother of your outright lies. You clearly have not studied this anywhere else than on creationist lie-sites.\n \n \n i.e. there is not one mutation that actually adds new information to the genome\nReplications, point mutations, codon shifts and so on, they all generate new genes. You are either incredibly ignorant of what you try to speak about, or you are outright lying. Which is it?\n \n \n(which would be required for the Theory of Evolution to proceed, i.e. simplier organisms to change into more complex organisms requires a tonne of information.\nAnd since these processes are directly observable, that goes on quite nicely.\n \n \nEvolutionists theorise that mutations along with nautral selection is such a mechanism,\nNope, that is not a theory, that is directly observed.\n \n \nbut this goes against scientific knowledge and observations).\nThat is an outright lie. Please cease lying.\n \n \nMy definition is correct (you can check it if you want).\nROTFLAMO. I already KNOW what the Scientific Theory of Evolution says, silly. Your made-up false definition is NOT what the Scientific Theory of Evolution is.\n \n \nI got it from Dr Jeremy I. Walter (Mechanical Engineering)\nHis characterization of the outcome from the Scientific method is in error. Is that because he is a creationist? Or is he deliberately dishonest? On the other hand, he is an engineer, not a scientist. Perhaps you should use scientific sources when seeking definitions of scientific terminology.\n \n \nfrom the book \"In Six Days: why 50 scientists choose to believe in creation\" You can also check that if you want to.\nWhy would I use a non-scientific source as information about science? Go pick up a college textbook in biology, physics or chemistry. They should list the definitions. There is generally a glossary in the back, and they generally have a section on the Scientific method.\n \n \nFirstly let me define singularity, The point at which space-time becomes compressed to the point of being infinitely dense and infinitely small.\nIndeed. And as this site nicely explains:\n http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/biol1005.htm\n ----\n \"Many people believe that everything in nature has to have a causal explanation. Although this may be true at the macroscopic level, it is not necessarily the case at the microscopic level, as quantum physics has demonstrated. Transitions, decays, and nuclear reactions do sometimes occur spontaneously without apparent cause. Similarly, the universe itself does not require a cause\" (Crowe, 1995) \n ----\n It nicely describes the singularity as well.\n \n \n It is a mathematical expression. The cause of the singularity would be \"Why is it there?\" I have no athesitic answer for this that is valid, my closest answer would most likely involve quantum mechanics.\nAnd possibly, there is no cause. As is mentioned in the scientific lecture linked to above, at the quantum level, causality is not necessarily needed.\n \n \nThe effect would be everything (space-time, or matter) being crushed to the smallest point possible, i.e. close to being infinitely small and dense.\nThat's the \"big crunch\" hypothesis of the singularity, the idea of the oscillating universe. However, as the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, that seems more and more unlikely.\n \n \nThe cause from my point of view would be the handiwork of God - depending on the situation.\nThat would be your faith, yes. That would not be any meaningful, scientific explanation of a Singularity. As such, per your uninterested in actual evidence, the very fact of you trying to talk about evidence when you just showed that evidence doesn't matter to you, well, that's another example of your inherent dishonesty. You really should work on not causing more damage to your credibility.\n \n \nWell, I don't know if you used the \"\" around the words that you used.\nDUH! Of course I did.\n \n \nBut I typed it in and got quite a list. It has observational backing and is a fundamental law of science,\nIn the sources that came up in my Google search, it was described as an issue of philosophy.\n \n \nI do not know why you persist in this argument. It would have went through the scientific method that you constantly bring up.\nIf it is a Scientific natural law, yes. However, it seems to be derived through philosophy, rather than science, and as other scientific sources mention, Cause is not always needed for an event at the quantum level.\n \n [What is this \"teacher's handout reference\" ]\n \nI don't know whether or not you can remember school (assumption neccessary), but do you remember getting additional information or hand outs from your teacher that are supposed to further advance your knowledge rather than just study out of one or two textbooks?\nAh, so you plagiarized this from a textbook? What is the reference? (or are you not aware that reposting other people's work without referencing it is a violation of copyright and plagiarism?\n \n \nWell this is one of them. It is just an extract from another physics textbook that the class does not have.\nWhich physics book?\n \n \nAnd no, there is no conspiracy here if you are thinking that I am making it up.\nInstead, there is plagiarism.\n \n \nWoah! I'm sorry, it was a compliment.\nNo it isn't. It is you lying about me, calling me an atheist.\n \n \nThere is only one universe,\nThat we live in, yes. However, there is no exclusion of other universes, or a realm that God exists in. Those realms or parallel universes or alternate dimensions don't necessarily have the same space/time as we do. In those realms God is not guaranteed to be timeless or without origin.\n \n \nalthough a few evolutionists or secular humanists (since you totally oppose the use of \"evolutionist\" to describe the big bang and so on).\nYes I do, as the Big Bang has nothing to do with the Scientific theory of Evolution.\n \n \nA definition from that same Excel HSC Physics Textbook of a universe: a universe is all that exists. So how can you have two lots of all that exists and so on? \nYour high school physics book likely is not set up to handle the intricacies of quantum mechanics, don't you think? perhaps you need something that goes beyond HS level science.\n \n \nAt the moment the idea of multi-universes (to my knowledge) is just theoretical and has no real hard evidence.\nHowever, through quantum theory, their existence is possible.\n \n \nBut you are entitled to your opinion. So in my opinion, since there is only one universe (1 lot of \"everything that exists\") and God made that, hence He is outside of time altogether! So once again, your statement becomes invalid.\nNope. You merely try to define the rest of the scientific evidence away, like a true creationist. That is why creationists are not scientists.\n \n \nTrue I guess, since there is only one universe. That is what the Bible hints at, and since I trust the events in Genesis (as there is no scientific evidence that goes against this..\nAn outright lie. We have proven this to you through scientific sources that you continue to ignore in your inherent dishonesty.\n \n \n- once again, if there is, please show me, not in terms of evolution,\nActually evolution does a fine job at disproving the literal interpretation of genesis, as the order of biological entities appearing is out of order with the real world.\n \n \nas I believe that evolution (having a different definition to you)\nA false one, yes.\n \n \nis just a different interpretation of the evidence that we see to describe in a way that might be able to exclude God.\nYour ascribed motive to science is outright false. Science tries no such thing, merely works only with what is observable and possible to evaluate through the Scientific Method. Your paranoia is duly noted.\n \n \nSo once more, invalid statement unless it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt that more than 1 lot of \"everything that exists\" exists, i.e. multi-universe.\nIt is not proven that other universes exists, any more (actually less) than gravity is proven to exist. Evolution, of course, is proven more to exist than is gravity, of which we can only see the effect.\n \n \nIncorrect, if God made everything (including time), that means that He would be outside of every frame of reference in the entire universe,\nWhich I am not denying, but rather pointing out that this may not be the case for any time reference from outside our universe.\n \n \nGod does not have a starting point in time.\nAs long as it is measured only inside our universe, yes.\n \n \nWho are you to say that the Genesis account of events is incorrect? Were you there?\nWho are you to say that it is correct? Were you there? Scientific research certainly have shown the chronology to be incorrect.\n \n \nSince the Bible is the written Word of God,\nwritten by men, and undergone multiple translations.\n \n \nAnd no, the order is not out of order and inconsistent. I invite you to explain this point, as I cannot see anything incosistent with this.\nThis has been done for you several times, you deciding to ignore the provided evidence. Why should I at all bother any more when you ignore the provided material to this point? Your very invitation to explain it is inherently dishonest as you have no intention to pay attention to it. Your dishonest actions until now clearly shows this.\n \n \n [singularities]\n \nIt is not the cause, it is the process involved.\nNope.\n \n \nYou can teach me if you want to, all I know about singularity is the defintion (given above). Whether or not you agree with my \"assertion\" is your choice. I'm not really worried if you don't.\nYes you have clearly shown that facts and evidence matters little; if it disagrees with your dogma, you have defined it to be wrong regardless of the evidence. So again, you even talking about evidence is dishonest.\n \n \nThey are kind of the same thing.\nNope. You are again lying.\n \n \n The main point is that they all use natural processes and without the haniwork of a Creator God\nAnother lie. That is not their main point.\n \n \n(although some may imply that God guides the process, but it is still naturalisitc).\nAll science is. Nice that you are now trying to discredit all science, using a computer developed through that science. What science do you know of that is actually correct? Certainly, it is all Naturalistic, which you have just defined as invalidating it.\n \n \nOne can ask where the first life came from, and where Earth, stars, solar system and galaxies came from.\nYou can. It has nothing to do with the Scientific Theory of Evolution. \n \n \nAnd from this view of evolution,\nWhich is not evolution at all, so thus is a false and misleading \"view\"\n \n \nwe need to expand on it to explain and encompase this whole area.\nThe Scientific theory of Evolution is a biological Scientific Theory explaining changes in biological populations over time, that is all. It says nothing about the origin of the universe and doesn't \"need\" to either, your false claim none withstanding. This merely demonstrates your extreme ignorance of science.\n \n \nProbably. Why then, was there a BIG stir up in the media when those evolutionary scientists were trying to make life from non-life?\nThey didn't. You are again lying. Chemists are involved with abiogenesis, evolutionary biologists are not.\n \n \nThey were trying to show how the first microorganism could arive by chance to further support evolution!\nAnother lie. This would do NOTHING regarding the Scientific Theory of Evolution, your misrepresentation none withstanding. You really ought to NOT get your scientific knowledge from the mass media.\n \n \nHowever, they failed, even if they did succeed, it still would not be evidence for evolution.\nCorrect, as it has absolutely NOTHING to do with evolution.\n \n Well, this has gone on long enough. I am tired, and doubly tired of your lies, misrepresentations and ignorance. If you actually have something real to say, other than your misrepresentations, I'll look at it. But wasting time replying to outright nonsense and misrepresentations that you spew is simply not worth anybody's time. You are WAY to dishonest for any meaningful communication.",

   "Do you know what a natural law is?\nHi astronomyfan87,\n My understanding of natural laws is that they are philosophy concepts. For example the \"law of identity\" is a natural law. Many of these laws of philosophy get broken by quantum theory, so they belong only to the realms of philosophy and not science or the real world.\n \n To me, the \"law\" of cause and effect is most accurately written these days as \"every effect has a cause, save for God and weird quantum stuff\". It isn't a universal law. It never was, as we always made an exception for God and these days we [may] have to make exceptions for quantum events. Some even go so far as to throw out causality altogether and replace it with \"probabilities for physical processes constrained by symmetries\"\n \n But such arguments surrounding the Big Bang are pointless anyway. If one wants a cause for the Big Bang, one need look no further than God. It is only those that deny God that must provide an alternative cause or demonstrate that no cause was required.\n \n \nActually, all science, history and law enforcement would collapse if this Law of cause and effect were denied.\nOne thing that can be said for quatum theory is that it common sense collapses when one tries to study it, let alone \"minor\" things like \"all science, history and law enforcement\".\n \n \n...Causality is only a trouble athesitic or secular humanism evolution (or the big bang theory), as there is no cause...\nBig Bang Theory is mot \"athesitic or secular humanism evolution\". It does have an obvious cause: God.\n \n \nThis all goes back to my original definition. You see, from my definition it is not nonsense. Besides, the science that deals with your definition is called genetics. Genetics deals with basically \"everything to deal with genes\" and we don't need evolution to explain this. Everyone who has studied mutations on a molecular level discovers that all mutations lead to a loss of information\nThis is utterly untrue. Any mutation that adds a base pair adds information: more \"bits\" are required to represent the genome and thus it has more information. You have fallen for another creationist lie by claiming otherwise. Sorry. We most certainly do need evolution to explain genetics. Current DNA makes no sense if we try to assume that God created it as is. Current DNA in all organisms was created via evolution.\n \n \n \nTrue I guess, since there is only one universe. That is what the Bible hints at, and since I trust the events in Genesis (as there is no scientific evidence that goes against this - once again, if there is, please show me...\nThis is very disapointing AF. You have been shown lots of scientific evidence by people here that shows that Genesis cannot be true in a literal sense. There are thousands of books, papers, websites and people in the world that can provide you with tons more evidence. Just because you choose to close your eyes, sing \"lalala\" at the top of your voice, doesn't make the evidence go away.\n \n \n \n \nI think that where Darwin got confused in with his knowledge of genetics (which wasn't very advanced at his time). When he say variety in the offspring of say dogs, that was outside that of the parents he thought that there must be new information being added; hence, he thought the species was changing in an upward direction. That is where he made his main mistake.\nYou have made up this whole paragraph, surely? Darwin didn't get confused about genetics, as he didn't know about genetics. Whilst Mendel, who discovered genetics, did so around Darwin's time, he was ignored. The world knew nothing (ie it was non existent, not \"limited\") of genetics when Darwin published. Also he most certainly didn't think that \"there must be new information being added\" as the whole information added/ mutation nonsense is a creationist invention of the last few years. Finally Darwin very deliberately went for \"descent\" in his title to get away from notions of species \"changing in an upward direction\". Evolution is directionless.",

   "Firstly let me define singularity, The point at which space-time becomes compressed to the point of being infinitely dense and infinitely small. It is a mathematical expression.

The cause from my point of view would be the handiwork of God - depending on the situation.\n\n \n Our universe from what we know now is very close to being flat. That means it could either start collapsing or it could expand indefinitely in a flat shape or it could curve back on itself depending on the value of the actual numbers. If it collapses then it could be a cyclic universe that has no beginning or end. If it is flat or curved, as far as we now know it will develop into black holes in the future which will eventually evaporate into nothing.

   "To Hank:\n \nFan I will answer your question but before I do I&#8217;m going to say that you don&#8217;t seem to be interested in looking at the evidence, only in trying to make the evidence fit your beliefs.\n \n \n Please, call me Matt if you want. Secondly, I am interested in the evidence and hence, am interested in science. Thrirdly, does the secular humanist or evolutionist not try and make the evidence fit their belief/religion/theory? As I have said many times, creationists have a different interpretation of the evidence to the secular humanist, i.e. we have the same science (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, information scinces, astronomy) and we also have exactly the same facts (e.g. same stars, Earth, satellites, fossils, etc). The only difference is the interpretation of the facts and evidence. Now do you understand that? We have the same evidence and facts as we live in the same universe. So your (and others) opinion that the creationists lie and twist the evidence is quite mis-leading and twisted! It is just a different interpretation of the same evidence that you have. \n \n I am talking about both the big bang theory and the General Theory of Evolution (i.e. molecules to man evolution). \n \n \nThat is exactly what happened when the church was embarrassed by putting Galileo on trial for stating that the earth rotated around the sun. \n \n Actually, the Church is doing today what it did in Galileo's day! Did you know that Galileo was a creationist, or a Bible believing Christian? He realised that from the \"view of the day\" contradicted what was said in the Bible and when he tried to address it his enemies (from the Aristotlan idea) tried and succeeded in decieving the Pope into thinking that Galileo's new idea about the Earth rotating around the sun was contradicting the Bible. You see, when Galileo first published his ideas on the Earth orbiting the sun who was the people who first dismissed it and openly attacked his ideas? It was not the Church - they in fact were in support of it - it was the Aristotlean followers and the universities. The only way to shut him up was to decieve the the Church, and this is what they did. (You see, the Church had compromised with the so called \"science\" of the day and it is doing the same thing today, instead of letting the Bible be our foundation for science. Newton and many others found no conflict between science and the Bible; in fact they saw it as a way of finding more about the wonders of God and how He made everything). For more information of the conflict with Galileo (which is just really old science V new science; i.e. Aristotlean V Galileo) see the book \"The Myths of Science\" by Kirsten Birkett.\n \n \nTherefore when 99% of the scientists who are educated in a field state that something is true, I&#8217;m not going to believe the 1% who have an agenda that say it&#8217;s not true.\n \n \n Yeah, but 99% of people didn't survive the flood! Today there is a big myth of atheism and science. Many today think that science is anti-God. Just to show you where I am heading in this: many claim that creationists are un-scientific and have religious views that affect the way that they do science, I aim to show you that evolutionists (taking the molecules to man, GTE, and the big bang idea) has the same affecting factors as the creationists. So hence, your statement above will be invalid. Atheists encourage this view by claiming that theirway of thinking is \"scientific\". In claiming this, they are merely redefining science to exclude God. In fact, science began to flourish only when the Biblical view of creation took root in Europe as teh Reformation spread its influence. Such a view of creation enables a scientific approach to investigate the world - that the created universe is real, consistent, understandable, and possbile ot investigate. \n \n But is it science? Science has given us many wonderful things: men on the moon, cheap food, modern medicine, electricity, computers, and so on. All of these achievements involve doing experiments in the present, making inferences from the results and doing more experiments to test those ideas. Here the inferences, or conclusions, are closely related to the experiments and there is often little room for speculation. This type of science is called process, or operational science, and has given us many wonderful advances in knowledge that benefited mankind. \n However, there is another type of science that deals with the pasts, which can be called historical or origins science. When it comes to working out what happened in the past, science is limited because we cannot do experiments directly on past events, and history cannot be repeated. In origins science, observations made in the present are used to make inferences about the past. THe experiments that can be done in the present that relate to the past are often quite limited, so the inferences require a deal of guess work. The further in the past being studied the longer the chain of inferences involved, i.e. more guess work, and there is more room for non-scientific factors to influence the conclusions (such as religious belief (or unbelief) of the scientist). So what may be presented as \"science\" regarding the past may be little more than the scientist's own personal world view. Does this make sense to you? The conflicts between \"science\" and \"religion\" occur in this historical science, not in operational science (including sciences like genetics). Unfortunately, the respect earned by the successses of operational science confounds many into thinking that the conjectural claims arising from origins science carry the same authority. When it comes to historical science, it is not so much the evidence in the present that is debated, but the inferences about the past. Scientists who believe the Bible will come to a different conclusion about the past from those who ignore the Bible. Do you follow this? It is this wilful denial of God's Word that lies at the root of many disagreements over \"historical science\". \n [Some of the above I got from \"the Updated and Expanded Answers Book\" by Ken Ham, Jonathan Sarfati and Carl Wieland.]\n \n \nI understand how a general knowledge of a subject can be distorted into almost the opposite of what the truth is. \n \n \n It all comes back down to Pilate's question nearly 2000 years ago just before he handed Him over to the Jews to be killed and to die on a cross for our sins (including yours): \"What is truth?\"\n \n \nThe way you know your dating techniques are accurate is to use more than one method and compare the age given by each to each other. If the dates agree, then you can be sure you have the right answer. If they don&#8217;t agree, then you don&#8217;t have the right answer.\n \n \n This is explained on the internet site:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/negative1-8-2001.asp \n \n Hmm, I thought that I put up that link before on this thread, it may have been a different one! My memory is really bad. Oh well, the rebuttal to your statement is right on that link. It all has to do with assumptions and what age YOU want for the rock. I would throughouly suggest that you check it out to see how they really date rocks.\n \n The following comes from the article \"The Way it really is: little known facts about Radiometric dating\" on which the internet site is below:\n \"Someone may ask, &#8216;Why do geologists still use radiometric dating? Wouldn&#8217;t they have abandoned the method long ago if it was so unreliable?&#8217; Just because the calculated results are not the true ages does not mean that the method is completely useless. The dates calculated are based on the isotopic composition of the rock. And the composition is a characteristic of the molten lava from which the rock solidified. Therefore, rocks in the same area which give similar &#8216;dates&#8217; are likely to have formed from the same lava at about the same time during the Flood. So, although the assumptions behind the calculation are wrong and the dates are incorrect, there may be a pattern in the results that can help geologists understand the relationships between igneous rocks in a region. \n \n Contrary to the impression that we are given, radiometric dating does not prove that the Earth is millions of years old. The vast age has simply been assumed.2 The calculated radiometric &#8216;ages&#8217; depend on the assumptions that are made. The results are only accepted if they agree with what is already believed. The only foolproof method for determining the age of something is based on eyewitness reports and a written record. We have both in the Bible. And that is why creationists use the historical evidence in the Bible to constrain their interpretations of the geological evidence.\"\n \n From the same site later on in the article this comes from a Geological Guidebook in the Appendix:\n \"However, the appendix concludes with this qualification: &#8216;Also, the relative ages [of the radiometric dating results] must always be consistent with the geological evidence. &#8230; if a contradiction occurs, then the cause of the error needs to be established or the radiometric results are unacceptable&#8217;.\"\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v24/i4/radiometric.asp\n  \n It is not that radiometric dating methods are \"wrong\" and \"useless\", the assumptions behind them are flawed and hence, do not give a true age.\n \n \nCan you post a link or reference to the hundreds of examples cited by Woodmorappe?\n \n \n http://www.rae.org/mythdate.html \n The above link is a link to his book \"The Mythology of Modern Dating Methods\". AiG dubs it: \"A masterful demonstration of the fallacy of radioactive dating assumptions and techniques with citations of almost 500 articles by evolutionists. A solid refutation of the belief that radiometric dating proves the earth is old.\"\n \n \nThey don&#8217;t just throw out dates for no reason.\n \n \n You are right, they don't. If the date is out they can always end up making secondary assumptions to explain why it is \"incorrect\" to what they assumed the age of the rock, for example, is. \n \n \nEvolution is not used to date rocks. You continually refer to every science as evolutionary science which simply shows your ignorance of science in general.\n \n \n What posts have you been reading?? I am not ignorant of science, only historical science (which evolution, GTE - molecules to man evolution - and the dating methods are apart of), because they have assumptions that cannot be proved to be true. They rely on faith. I trust and believe in operation science, such as physics, chemistry, medical research, genetics, etc, as these are things that we can directly  observe and test experimentally and there is little room for speculation. You appear to be confused on the difference between historical and operational science, also as to which category evolution (GTE) falls into. The scientists often use the evolutionary timescale (i.e. billions of years). Sometimes you need to \"step back\" and have a look at the \"big picture\" and you will find that evolution isn't only just the genetic changes of a population, but is apart of a much grander theory, i.e. the origin of life - your own evolutionary scientists even admit this - molecules to man evolution. \n Matt.",

   "Thanks for replying kindly Whacky One without the usual false lie accusations. \n \nMy understanding of natural laws is that they are philosophy concepts. For example the \"law of identity\" is a natural law. Many of these laws of philosophy get broken by quantum theory, so they belong only to the realms of philosophy and not science or the real world.\n \n \n That is what I believe, and someone else has found a different source. It also says in the Glossary ofthe book that a \"Law\" is: \"a statement that describes a natural phenomenon; a principle\". Which pretty much must apply to everything related to that natural phenomenon! While a theory is: \"an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and it is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation.\" \n So from that we can conclude that a Law describes a natural phenomenon while a theory tries to describe or offer an explanation of the observed facts and laws, i.e. why are they the way that they are? \n \n \nTo me, the \"law\" of cause and effect is most accurately written these days as \"every effect has a cause, save for God and weird quantum stuff\". It isn't a universal law. It never was, as we always made an exception for God and these days we [may] have to make exceptions for quantum events.\n \n \n This new definition is also a bit iffy, and by it than yes, God may have a cause. But if we go by the traditional meaning, i.e. every cause has an effect (note: not every effect has a cause), than we will discover that since God has no starting point in time He has no cause, and hence does not violate Causality. The universe is different from God. It does have a start in time and hence has a cause, i.e. that of God. But in secular humanism (a belief without God and that natural processes are all there is) there is no cause. I was arguing Causality against a belief in atheist evolution (and atheistic big bang). To make exceptions is to make assumptions. \n \n \nIf one wants a cause for the Big Bang, one need look no further than God. \n \n \n Agreed, Causality doesn't apply to situations where there is a God. But for the atheist out there, he doesn't have a God to rely on to get him out of this mess and therefore must assume that it happened, even though it violates Causality, i.e. you must make exceptions as you point out. The Causality debate was over atheistic evolution and an atheistic belief in the big bang. Some of you people (who shall remain nameless) don't appear to catch onto this concept as well as some of the people on other forums that I have been on, e.g. astronomy.com forum.\n \n \nBig Bang Theory is mot \"athesitic or secular humanism evolution\". It does have an obvious cause: God.\n \n \n Okay, I'll give you that one. But when it comes to athestic evolution, there is no cause - such as the big bang and life from non-life (which is apart of evolutionary theory btw, GTE).\n \n \nThis is utterly untrue. Any mutation that adds a base pair adds information: more \"bits\" are required to represent the genome and thus it has more information. You have fallen for another creationist lie by claiming otherwise. Sorry. We most certainly do need evolution to explain genetics. Current DNA makes no sense if we try to assume that God created it as is. Current DNA in all organisms was created via evolution.\n \n \n Okay then, give me five mutations, no wait, I will make it easier for you. Give me the name of a single mutation that actually adds NEW information to the genome. Dr Lee Spetner (Isreali biophysicist who is \"uniquely qualified\" to comment on the role of mutations in the genome) says that there is not a single point mutation to which one can point to that actually adds NEW genetic information to the genome. I have not fallen for a creationist lie (btw, where is this open mind thing that you guys talk about? It sounds to me like you guys are already biased), it is what we observe. Creationists do not believe that God created everything the way that it is, for example, they do not believe that God created a poodle in the beginning. What they are saying is that God created specific kinds with a lot of genetic variation which - through time - has diversified (via natural selection, mutation and the reshuffling of genes) as the organisms have adapted to their environment. You have fallen for a straw man attack by evolutionists. You see, I am not the one who is fooled.\n \n \nThis is very disapointing AF. You have been shown lots of scientific evidence by people here that shows that Genesis cannot be true in a literal sense. There are thousands of books, papers, websites and people in the world that can provide you with tons more evidence. Just because you choose to close your eyes, sing \"lalala\" at the top of your voice, doesn't make the evidence go away.\n \n \n And to your last statement, no I don't. The reason I am here talking to you is the evidence. Please, everyone, try and understand this: we have the same evidence, the same science. The only difference between creation and evolution is the way in which they interpret the facts - which all stems back to their starting beliefs and assumptions. And I could say the same for you and every other person on this thread. There is no way for evolution to proceed. I have tried to show you how evolution has a broder defintion that your little one; how mutations + natural selection don't equal evolution, but in fact equal creation; a little bit of how the Earth and the universe is young; how there is only a handful of highly arguable transitional forms; that there is geological evidence for the flood; how the underlying assumptions of radiometric dating methods are flawed; how natural laws (Causality and 2nd Law of Thermodynamics) cannot allow evolution (atheistic evolution, and big bang) to proceed; that there is no evidence that humans have evolved; and that the Bible can be scientifically trusted; and so on. But what do you guys do? Immediately when I mention the word \"creationist\" or \"creation\" you think of lies and harden your hearts and refuse to listen. The Bible says they will be 'willingly ignorant'.\n \n I have presented scientific evidence that is valid and totally acceptable, but you immeadiately say that it is un-scientific and full of the usual lies without being able in many cases to back up your statement, and on those who do - and I don't really know which one to believe - I send an e-mail to AiG and ask them to explain themselves and if they are mis-leading. Because they are a Christian organisation and are bound by the Bible \"not to lie\" I believe what they say. In their reply they say that the evolutionists (especially in that one that I posted about there being no 3rd Stage SNRs in the universe) don't tell the whole quote or the whole truth. They have to lie to make the creationists look un-scientific and a bunch of liars, I must admit that it is a very effective technique. Other than that AiG or other creation scientists have made new hypotheses and stands based on experimental validation and observation. You openly accuse them of being liars, but your evolutionary websites lie and use straw man attacks. You appear to be that blinded by evolution that you don't know any better. And futher more you say to the creationists to have an \"open mind\", is calling creation scientists having an \"open mind\"? Of course not! How hypocritical! I admit that I am biased but I know some of the evolutionary arguments - more so than you know the creationary ones - and as a result I can see how science if applied through a creationary model fits the evidence exactly how we would expect it to if God exists and if the Bible is the Word of God. \n \n \nYou have made up this whole paragraph, surely? Darwin didn't get confused about genetics, as he didn't know about genetics. Whilst Mendel, who discovered genetics, did so around Darwin's time, he was ignored. \n \n \n I may have been mistaken on this, but the fact remains he never understood it (as you corrected me) because he never knew about it. Sorry about that! emoticon_emb If you saw (and had no knowledge of genetics) little puppies that had a variation outside that of the parents would you think that there is new information being added? I definitely would.\n \n Follow this. General Theory of Evolution (GTE) says basically molecules to man evolution (I can provide you with references to this if you want). Now a single celled creature has about 1 book of 500 pages of genetic information on it (for that to arise by chance out of \"pond-scum\" or lifeless chemicals with all the complex coded information in one go (without any intelligence, and hence no cause) would be basically impossible. It has to be assumed that it happened as it cannot be repeated, observed nor experimentally validated. Also, a single celled creature has \"irreducible complexity\" before the creature can function, i.e. all the parts must be there and arranged in the correct way before the cell can function (work). Now a Human has enough information in a single cell to fill a 1000 books of 500 pages fine print! Now to change a single celled creature into a Human will require the addition of nearly a whole library of books of very complex coded information! This amount of information must not only be new, i.e. must not have previously existed before, but most also make sense and be useful. Now remembering that athestic evolution (evolution without a God guided process) is just random and naturalistic processes with no intelligence. How do the evolutionists account for such an increase of very complex information (that neither you nor I could understand - unless we were taught it)? I don't think that I would be able to make up such a coding system in a billion years - and I have intelligence! Definitely more intelligence than mindless naturalistic processes of mutations and natural selection - more intelligence than just an accident or random changes. \n \n So where does all that information come from in books? Intelligence, some of the books you might not think so, but it does. The information comes from intelligence. But where does the information come from according to evolutionists? It comes from accidents. Accidental changes in the DNA in the bacterium eventually made a human being. These accidents are called mutations. It's like if you are typing on on a word processor and you hit a wrong key, you make a mistake in the information that you are copying. If you are copying a quote, for example, and you hit a wrong key, do you ever improve the spelling or the information in the quote that you are typing? Do you ever get more information by hitting the wrong key? I would hold your breath or you will go blue in the face waiting for it to happen, becuase accidents never cause information! This can be put into an example of how antibiotic resistance in bacteria is not due to an increase in meaningful information. The resistance to antibiotics in bacteria is caused by a LOSS of control over the production of the enzyme that breaks down penecillin so that much more of the enzyme is produced. So the bacteria becomes resistant because of a LOSS of genetic information, never a gain. \n \n Dr Lee Spetner in his book \"Not by Chance\" says that \"mutations will never produce the new complex information needed for evolution to proceed\". In fact, mutations are known by the diseases they cause. The TNR mutant is a classic example of a mutation. The Totally Naked Rooster. Has the rooster's situation ever been improved? Not really, it is going to freeze in winter and fry in summer. Not much of an improvment for the rooster. Now for reptile to bird evolution needs new information that was previously non-existant. Taking feathers off birds is easy, putting them on reptiles is a different matter. The reptile has radically different raspatory systems to the bird, reptiles have no beak, no feathers, birds are warm blooded, different shaped head, and so on. The reptile has no genetic information for making any of the information for making bird features. Mutations can't account for this addition, and neither can natural selection (as they both eliminate or mess up the genetic information in the genome). So basically game over. \n \n There is also the issue of irreducible complexity, as explained above. It is not possible for small step-wise mutations and natural selection to create such systems because a series of functional intermediates is impossible. Examples are the bacterial flagellum, the blood clotting system, the ATPase \"motor\", the signalling system in cells, the DNA-coded protein synthesis system, etc. [\"Answers to the 4 BIG questions!\" ~AiG]\n \n So the area of biology is especially good for refuting molecules to man evolution as none of the evidence is there for it. It is very powerful.\n \n \nEvolution is directionless.\n\n \n How can this be so if reptiles were supposed to evolve into birds, for exmpale? When change is in a \"down hill\" direction that is evidence of creation, as creationists say that mutations and/or natural selection always leads to a loss of genetic information - never a gain of useful information. This is based on what we observe and on Biblical passages.\n Matt.",

   "To Hank:\n What posts have you been reading?? I am not ignorant of science, only historical science (which evolution, GTE - molecules to man evolution - and the dating methods are apart of), because they have assumptions that cannot be proved to be true. They rely on faith. I trust and believe in operation science, such as physics, chemistry, medical research, genetics, etc, as these are things that we can directly  observe and test experimentally and there is little room for speculation. You appear to be confused on the difference between historical and operational science, also as to which category evolution (GTE) falls into. The scientists often use the evolutionary timescale (i.e. billions of years). Sometimes you need to \"step back\" and have a look at the \"big picture\" and you will find that evolution isn't only just the genetic changes of a population, but is apart of a much grander theory, i.e. the origin of life - your own evolutionary scientists even admit this - molecules to man evolution. \n Matt.\n\n \n Let's talk about SN1987A, how it provides us with a DIRECTLY observed and measurable distance to the star once known as Sk -69 202. This then gives us a direct measurment of the time since the star went Nova, some 160000 years ago. How then can the universe be younger that this?",

   "To Hank:\n \nThere is no way to know if there is only one universe at this time. And any statement that there is only one is simply opinion. There is nothing in science that precludes multiple universes. \n \n \n Well, lets just say that there is nothing to suggest that another universe exists - no evidence. Although science may well not preclude multiple universes there is no evidence to even suggest that it exists -- just like the Oort cloud. It has to be taken by faith as we cannot observe it's existence or try to explain by experimentally what and how this \"other universe\" would be like and behave. They may sometime in the future but I am not really suprised if they don't find any other universe. Due to observation we can say at the moment that there is only one universe.\n \n \nIn fact you have to ask, what is on the other side of our universe? Is there nothing for eternity? \n \n \n Good question. Well I believe that the universe is bounded (an assumption) as opposed to the evolutionary or secular humanist assumption that the universe is unbounded, i.e. no centre and no ends. May be it is a white hole? Hence, you wouldn't be able to get through it ----- this is in my opinion only.\n \n \nThe Bible also says that God stopped the sun in the sky. That verse was used to convict Galileo of heresy. Turns out that most people believe the earth rotates on an axis these days.\n \n \n Nothing is impossible for God. This is where you need to interpret the passage as neither of us was there. It also helps if you throughouly understand the events of Galileo and if you do, you would know that the saga involving Galileo was just old science clashing with new science. Answers in Genesis points out in their article that can be read on:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/243.asp \n several actions that may have resulted in Joshua's Long Day. AiG do not support the view that \"NASA computers have found Joshua's Long Day\" and dismiss it as an \"urban myth\". They do, however, point out this interesting point:\n \"Joshua&#8217;s command to the sun to stand still does not support geocentrism, i.e. the idea that the sun moves around the Earth. The Bible uses the language of appearance and observation.6\n \n Today people do exactly the same thing. For example, scientists who prepare weather reports for TV announce the times of &#8216;sunrise and sunset&#8217;. In fact, the mention of the moon also standing still seems to confirm both the divine authorship of the account and the fact that it is the Earth which moves. Since all Joshua needed was extra sunlight, and most ancients believed the sun moves, not the Earth, a human author of a fictitious account would only have needed to refer to the sun stopping.\"\n \n Remember that the Bible is a book of many miracles. They close the article with this:\n \"Miracles rest on testimony, not on scientific analyses. While it is interesting to speculate on how God might have performed any particular Biblical miracle, including Joshua&#8217;s long day, ultimately those claiming to be disciples of Jesus Christ (who authenticated the divine record of the Bible) must accept them, by faith.9 There is not one logical, scientific reason to claim that, given a God powerful enough to create a universe in six days, Joshua&#8217;s long day &#8216;could not have happened&#8217;. Those who balk at this account are almost invariably those who have already rejected 6-day creation through compromise with evolution &#8216;s fictitious long ages, and have thus rejected the authority of the Bible.\" Miracles happen quite often. People who have suffered some terrible diesase and should died - but survived - is an example. There is no medical reason why they are still alive, and logic tells you that they should be dead.\n Matt.",

   "To iamthetruth:\n \nLet's talk about SN1987A, how it provides us with a DIRECTLY observed and measurable distance to the star once known as Sk -69 202. This then gives us a direct measurment of the time since the star went Nova, some 160000 years ago. How then can the universe be younger that this?\n \n \n Via Dr Russ Humphreys new Relativistic Cosmology. I had observed the argument between several users over the light year but kept my opinion to myself. Actually, the 160,000 years that you are refering to is 160,000 light years. Light years is a measurement of distance - not time. This is a commonly misunderstood fact. Light travels, at 3X10^8 ms, so a light year is approximately 9X10^15 metres. Your theory that 1 light year = 1 year (Earth Standard Time - E.S.T.) would be correct in principle IF gravity was the same everywhere in the universe. But we know that this is not true. \n \n So what does this prove, you may ask? This brings a whole new realm into the ball game, that of General Relavitiy (GR) and frame of references. So, it has been proven that gravity has an effect on time. This is not to be confused with velocity's effect on time. The effect of gravity on time was first measured an atomic clock at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, ticked five microseconds per year slower than an identical clock at the National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado (about a mile above sea level), with both clocks being accurate to about one microsecond per year. This difference is exactly what general relativitiy predicts for the one mile difference in altitude. So which one is \"right time\"? They are both \"right\" in their individual frame of reference. So we know that clocks in low areas of gravity tick more quickly in those of large and high gravity. \n \n Consider this as an example. Imagine we have a glass cylinder. And on this glass cylinder there is a gravity dial. So we have someone step into this glass cylinder and we dial up the gravity so inside the cyclinder there is an intense gravitational field. Now the person inside the cyclinder doesn't notice anything - everything is going on just as it was before. But for someone else, looking at it from thin gravity into thick gravity (the relativistic aspect) it looks like everything is going in suuuuuppppppeeeerrrr slow motion. The reason why this is different is because the person in heavy gravity everything slowed down together by the same factor, i.e. his heart rate slowed down, wrist watch slowed down, etc. Let us say that they have an experiment to measure the speed of light. So after many decades they finally get up over there and flick the switch so the little light beam comes out of this testing device. Now here we are in thin gravity the light beam comes out, it oozes onto the first mirror and it just goes on and on and on, but from their point of view, what? It finally hits the last mirror bong? It hits that last mirror and it streaches out 186,000 miles and their clock ticks one second. So what speed for light do they get? 186,000 miles per second. To us it looked like it was going mm per century (the relativistic aspect) and yet you get the same speed for light. Yes the appearent speed changed, because all of the dimensions changed. Divide a big number by a big number, 10 by 10 is 1, and divide a little number by a little number, 3 by 3 is still 1. And so the ratio, distance per time makes the speed to come out to be the same, so the variable is not the speed of light, it is the flow of time. If we take that person out and put another person in, the opposite will happen - it will look like a video on fast forward! This does not apply to astronauts circuling the Earth.\n \n Now applying this principle to space, we get a similar thing. Taking Genesis literally Dr Humphreys has been able to come up with a new Relativistic Cosmology than explains how we can see light from stars billions of light years away in a young universe (6000 years). I explained this earlier, but I will quickly explain what happened on Day 4 of the Cration Week - the day that God made the heavenly bodies, such as the sun, moon and stars. ... Early on the fourth morning, God coalesces the clusters of atoms into stars and thermonuclear fusion ignites in them. The newly-formed stars find themselves grouped together in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. As the fourth day proceeds on Earth, the more distant stars age billions of years, while their light als o has the same billions of yers to travel to the Earth. While the light is on its way, space continues to expand, relativistically streching out the light waves and shifting the wavelengths toward the red side of the spectrum. Stars which are now farhest away have the greatest redshift, because the waves have been stretched the most. This progressive redshift is exactly what is observed. On the evening of the sixth day God stops the expansion. If you want to read the mathematics and science (as well as his theory) I would invite you to buy the book \"Starlight and Time\" by Dr Russell Humphreys. What I stated out was from a 1994 version. He has many more newer versions out now. \n \n So in order to answer your question, GR can be applied to show that the supernova renmenant is recent and revelant - not billions of years old as convential \"wisdom\" suggests. In a perfect world their hypothesis may be correct, but in the real world, their assumption is incorrect as there are many differences in gravity and GR can be used to explain. You see, astronomical distances are not much of a problem to the creation theory any more. \n \n I sent this to a fellow user:\n I agree with your assumption. And there is Biblical proof for this too, as outlined in Dr Russell Humphreys book \"Starlight and Time\". And so applying the Biblical assumption along with the evidence (observations) into GR we can get an explanation for as to why light can reach us from distant stars millions of light years away in a single day, Earth Standard Time (E.S.T). From this we can ask the evolutionists \"Why are you ignoring the measured effect of gravity on time?\" What is the evolutionists response? Exactly what 2 Peter chapter 3 said they would say. When confronted with evidence that makes evolutionism impossible what will evolutionists say? They deliberately ignore the facts, they just scoff at you \"Well I have more degrees than you have\" or \"What do you know anyway you're just a creationist, you're faith...\". They will scream and they will scoff and they will holler, but they won't address the facts, because they can't. But they will give it a name. What Stephen Hawking does is assume that there is no difference in gravity anywhere in the universe, just to save his belief in his theory. [I got some of the above information from a CD]",

But we know that this is not true. \n \n So what does this prove, you may ask? This brings a whole new realm into the ball game, that of General Relavitiy (GR) and frame of references. So, it has been proven that gravity has an effect on time. This is not to be confused with velocity's effect on time. The effect of gravity on time was first measured an atomic clock at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, ticked five microseconds per year slower than an identical clock at the National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado (about a mile above sea level), with both clocks being accurate to about one microsecond per year. This difference is exactly what general relativitiy predicts for the one mile difference in altitude. So which one is \"right time\"? They are both \"right\" in their individual frame of reference. So we know that clocks in low areas of gravity tick more quickly in those of large and high gravity. \n \n Consider this as an example. Imagine we have a glass cylinder. And on this glass cylinder there is a gravity dial. So we have someone step into this glass cylinder and we dial up the gravity so inside the cyclinder there is an intense gravitational field. Now the person inside the cyclinder doesn't notice anything - everything is going on just as it was before. But for someone else, looking at it from thin gravity into thick gravity (the relativistic aspect) it looks like everything is going in suuuuuppppppeeeerrrr slow motion. The reason why this is different is because the person in heavy gravity everything slowed down together by the same factor, i.e. his heart rate slowed down, wrist watch slowed down, etc. Let us say that they have an experiment to measure the speed of light. So after many decades they finally get up over there and flick the switch so the little light beam comes out of this testing device. Now here we are in thin gravity the light beam comes out, it oozes onto the first mirror and it just goes on and on and on, but from their point of view, what? It finally hits the last mirror bong? It hits that last mirror and it streaches out 186,000 miles and their clock ticks one second. So what speed for light do they get? 186,000 miles per second. To us it looked like it was going mm per century (the relativistic aspect) and yet you get the same speed for light. Yes the appearent speed changed, because all of the dimensions changed. Divide a big number by a big number, 10 by 10 is 1, and divide a little number by a little number, 3 by 3 is still 1. And so the ratio, distance per time makes the speed to come out to be the same, so the variable is not the speed of light, it is the flow of time. If we take that person out and put another person in, the opposite will happen - it will look like a video on fast forward! This does not apply to astronauts circuling the Earth.\n \n Now applying this principle to space, we get a similar thing. So in order to answer your question, GR can be applied to show that the supernova renmenant is recent and revelant - not billions of years old as convential \"wisdom\" suggests, using something called gravitational time dialation (see above for definition and how it works). In a perfect world their hypothesis may be correct, but in the real world, their assumption is incorrect as there are many differences in gravity and GR can be used to explain. You see, astronomical distances are not much of a problem to the creation theory any more. \n \n Hence, since GR must be taken into account (thanks to differences in gravity), 1 light year cannot = 1 year E.S.T. as time \"speeds up\" and \"slows down\" relative to Earth's frame of reference as the light moves in and out of low and high areas of gravity (once again relative to the Earth's frame of reference). So your simple idea of 1 light year = 1 year E.S.T. cannot work because of differences in gravity and how gravity affects the flow of time as predicted by Einstein.\n God Bless and may He keep you safe,\n Matt.",

The very fact that you might be travelling at a large fraction of the speed of light yourself and are experiencing time dilation effects has nothing to do with distances changing or the speed of light changing, in fact the speed of light as measured from your very fast frame of reference is, guess what, c, the speed of light!",

   "Please, call me Matt if you want. Secondly, I am interested in the evidence and hence, am interested in science. Thrirdly, does the secular humanist or evolutionist not try and make the evidence fit their belief/religion/theory? As I have said many times, creationists have a different interpretation of the evidence to the secular humanist, i.e. we have the same science (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, information scinces, astronomy) and we also have exactly the same facts (e.g. same stars, Earth, satellites, fossils, etc). The only difference is the interpretation of the facts and evidence. Now do you understand that? We have the same evidence and facts as we live in the same universe. So your (and others) opinion that the creationists lie and twist the evidence is quite mis-leading and twisted! It is just a different interpretation of the same evidence that you have. \n\n \n Science is irrespective of belief or religion. The evidence has to fit the theory. If it doesn&#8217;t fit the theory then the theory is thrown out. It&#8217;s the opposite with creationism and that&#8217;s how it is shown that creationism is not science. Creationist have the theory, they are just trying to make the evidence appear to support that theory.\n \n \nI am talking about both the big bang theory and the General Theory of Evolution (i.e. molecules to man evolution). \n\n \n Which is why we can tell you are fairly ignorant of evolution as it is neither big bang theory or molecules to man.\n \n \nActually, the Church is doing today what it did in Galileo's day! Did you know that Galileo was a creationist, or a Bible believing Christian? He realised that from the \"view of the day\" contradicted what was said in the Bible and when he tried to address it his enemies (from the Aristotlan idea) tried and succeeded in decieving the Pope into thinking that Galileo's new idea about the Earth rotating around the sun was contradicting the Bible. You see, when Galileo first published his ideas on the Earth orbiting the sun who was the people who first dismissed it and openly attacked his ideas? It was not the Church - they in fact were in support of it - it was the Aristotlean followers and the universities. The only way to shut him up was to decieve the the Church, and this is what they did. (You see, the Church had compromised with the so called \"science\" of the day and it is doing the same thing today, instead of letting the Bible be our foundation for science. Newton and many others found no conflict between science and the Bible; in fact they saw it as a way of finding more about the wonders of God and how He made everything). For more information of the conflict with Galileo (which is just really old science V new science; i.e. Aristotlean V Galileo) see the book \"The Myths of Science\" by Kirsten Birkett.\n\n \n Of course Galileo was a creationist. There was no scientific knowledge at the time of anything else. The church didn&#8217;t have anything to compromise as modern scientific methods had not been developed. That old excuse of Aristotelian science has been around for a while. The church loved the idea that the earth was the center of the universe. It fit right in with their theology of man being the crowning creation. I don&#8217;t need to look at someone&#8217;s interpretation of what happened, I can look directly at the history of the church and the transcript of the trial itself.\n \n Martin Luther was the leader of the Protestant movement and he said Galileo was an idiot for thinking something like that because the Bible definitely described the earth as the center of the solar system. So what&#8217;s your excuse for his beliefs? \n \n [quote]Yeah, but 99% of people didn't survive the flood! Today there is a big myth of atheism and science. Many today think that science is anti-God. Just to show you where I am heading in this: many claim that creationists are un-scientific and have religious views that affect the way that they do science, I aim to show you that evolutionists (taking the molecules to man, GTE, and the big bang idea) has the same affecting factors as the creationists. So hence, your statement above will be invalid. Atheists encourage this view by claiming that theirway of thinking is \"scientific\". In claiming this, they are merely redefining science to exclude God. In fact, science began to flourish only when the Biblical view of creation took root in Europe as teh Reformation spread its influence. Such a view of creation enables a scientific approach to investigate the world - that the created universe is real, consistent, understandable, and possbile ot investigate. \n \n Only a small group of creationist believe that science is anti-God. The church in general, at least until recently has fought scientific knowledge every step of the way. When they had the power, they persecuted free thinkers, put them in jail and even killed some. But the truth has a way of wining in the end. Religious dogma of this type has been proven wrong time after time and the church has been so embarrassed by that fact that it has for the most part seen it&#8217;s much better to stick to spiritual matters and leave scientific matters to the scientist. Of course there are still a small group that continue to embarrass themselves by clinging to this nonsense. \n \n \nBut is it science? Science has given us many wonderful things: men on the moon, cheap food, modern medicine, electricity, computers, and so on. All of these achievements involve doing experiments in the present, making inferences from the results and doing more experiments to test those ideas. Here the inferences, or conclusions, are closely related to the experiments and there is often little room for speculation. This type of science is called process, or operational science, and has given us many wonderful advances in knowledge that benefited mankind. \n However, there is another type of science that deals with the pasts, which can be called historical or origins science. When it comes to working out what happened in the past, science is limited because we cannot do experiments directly on past events, and history cannot be repeated. In origins science, observations made in the present are used to make inferences about the past. THe experiments that can be done in the present that relate to the past are often quite limited, so the inferences require a deal of guess work. The further in the past being studied the longer the chain of inferences involved, i.e. more guess work, and there is more room for non-scientific factors to influence the conclusions (such as religious belief (or unbelief) of the scientist). So what may be presented as \"science\" regarding the past may be little more than the scientist's own personal world view. Does this make sense to you? The conflicts between \"science\" and \"religion\" occur in this historical science, not in operational science (including sciences like genetics). Unfortunately, the respect earned by the successses of operational science confounds many into thinking that the conjectural claims arising from origins science carry the same authority. When it comes to historical science, it is not so much the evidence in the present that is debated, but the inferences about the past. Scientists who believe the Bible will come to a different conclusion about the past from those who ignore the Bible. Do you follow this? It is this wilful denial of God's Word that lies at the root of many disagreements over \"historical science\". \n [Some of the above I got from \"the Updated and Expanded Answers Book\" by Ken Ham, Jonathan Sarfati and Carl Wieland.]\n\n \n Of course you did. It&#8217;s creationist propaganda parroting which happens all the time on these forums because the individual is afraid to look at the evidence in an unbiased way because they are afraid of what they might discover. Creationist are now down to now trying to say that what is happening in the present can not be applied to what happened thousands of years ago. Of course that is pure garbage as we often use evidence of what happens today to infer what has happened in the past. The simple fact is that a massive amount of evidence from all different branches of science point to a old earth and the fact that evolution is true. \n \n \nIt all comes back down to Pilate's question nearly 2000 years ago just before he handed Him over to the Jews to be killed and to die on a cross for our sins (including yours): \"What is truth?\"\n\n \n Jesus was talking about spiritual truth, not scientific truth. And you should know that.\n \n \nIt is not that radiometric dating methods are \"wrong\" and \"useless\", the assumptions behind them are flawed and hence, do not give a true age.\n\n \n Okay if that is true, give me one assumption that is wrong and let&#8217;s discuss it.\n \n \nI am not ignorant of science, only historical science (which evolution, GTE - molecules to man evolution - and the dating methods are apart of), because they have assumptions that cannot be proved to be true. \n\n \n Okay you&#8217;re only ignorant of historical science. LOL.\n \n Let&#8217;s hear one assumption that is false.",

   "Garioch I agree that you need the right to disagree with people without being censored to have logical discussion. I don't have any problem with pointing out when statements are totally wrong. I do have a problem with you using the words \"stupid\", \"ignorant\", \"immature\" and \"liar\" when they are not necessary. I understand the perspective that there is no real difference between pointing out the factual errors in someones posts and calling them stupid. However I don't think such a perpective is the best one for this forum and I think admin thinks the same way. If you changed the wording but not the basic content of your posts I think you will be fine. \n \n \n\n I've looked over most of the posts on this board and I don't see where 7th_Arty ever declared him/herself to be the winner. What I saw were assertions that creationists were unable to respond - they lacked both the science and the education to do so in my eyes.\n \n\n \n \n \n 7th_Arty didn't say \"I'm the winner\" but I see no difference between saying \"I won the argument\" and \"creationists were unable to respond to my assertions\". If there is a difference I apologize.\n \n As for 7th_Arty's posts being abusive and \"unfriendly\", it really depends on peoples definitions. I define being abusive is attacking the poster directly as opposed to attacking their statement directly. I suppose its reasonable to believe that there is no real difference, but I am strong believer in that a modest effort to change the wording in your post makes it clear to people you are not out to hurt them which stops arguments. I don't think anyone here is malicious but I think its a good idea for people to always make sure nobody thinks people are malicious. To illustrate my definition I will show you what I think is the friendly and unfriendly way of making the same statement\n \n Unfriendly way of saying \"your wrong to say all dates estimated using radiometric techniques are wrong\"\n The nonsensical statement you made about radiometric dating is clear proof your an idiot.\n \n The friendly way of saying \"your wrong\"\n Your statement about radiometric is misleading because even though certain radiometric datings are clearly wrong, you cannot dismiss all radiometric measurements. The mathematic model is sound and their is a vast amount of data that supports carbon dating using objects to be 4000 years old, and objects dated 50000 years with carbon dating agree with the potassium/argon method and using different methods you can date the earth to be billions of years old and this agrees with what we know from cosmology. \n Many isolated errors in radiometric dating are easily explained. Mussels fresh from the shops are carbon dated as thousands of years old, but their source of carbon is thousands of years old, not years old like it is for terrestial organisms. So you simply date marine and terrestial organisms differently. You cannot point to specific mistakes in a vast body of work and expect everyone dismiss the whole body of work to be wrong.",

   "Hawking is not the be all and end all of cosmology. Cosmology is, in part, educated guesswork. To suggest that makes it the same as religious myth is patently untrue. Modern cosmology is an explanation of phenomena in as simple manner as possible. Your belief relies on things not being as they appear, cosmological theory relies on things being as they appear. Like all science it is based on the principal of observation. The distance to stars is measured in a variety of different ways. The closest are measured using parallax. I can explain in detail if you like. There are still many unsolved problems in cosmology, but that does not make the current theories incorrect, only incomplete, just as newtonian gravity is not incorrect, it is just a special case of a more general gravitational theory.\n \n I would be interested to hear more about these \"lots of astronomers\", presumably more than, say, 10% of the profession, who are convinced the big bang theory is incorrect. As far as I am aware, as a student of theoretical physics, it is the best fit to current observations, and the theories based on it are far reaching and largely consistent.

Most of your body's functionality carries on just fine without influence from the concious aspects of your brain. They are controlled via the brain stem. OK that is still the brain, but it's not the full story. The gut has it's own nervous system: the enteric nervous system that is at least as complex as that of the spinal cord. It acts largely independently of the brain and spine. Also there is your imune system that also acts largely independently of the brain.\n \n It's a poor analogy to view the brain as say a CPU in a computer, controlling it's every move. A better anology is to think of the body as a concert. The brain acts as a conductor of the orchestra: each organ pl,ays it's own tune and the brain coordinates them, keeping them in harmony. The anaology can be stretched a bit more to have the enteric nervous system and the immune system controlling the threaters lights and manning the bar during the interval, ie when they do there jobs is determined by the conductor, but having been activated, they then act out their own roles independently.\n \n \nThe blueprint of your body is contained in every cell in your body, from the cells in your hair to the cells in your toenails.\nAs previosuly stated, not all cells do have that \"blueprint\".

Singularities are avoided because the observed consequences of \"big crunches\" never reach zero size. In fact, should the universe begin a \"big crunch\" sort of process, string theory dictates that the universe could never be smaller than the size of a string, at which point it would actually begin expanding.\n",

So littlegod had an idea he knew that there was something called a singularity built into the dumpster, and that it used something called gravity to shrink down whatever you threw into it. He heard about another thing called electromagnetism and how gravity can be affected by it, so he put two and two together and came up with the four fundimental forces. He took his advanced calculations that he had written down on paper and rolled them up into a tube. He then wrapped the wire around the tube and ran the ends if the wires down into the bottom of the garbage disposal.\n He then took a magnet and dropped it through the paper tube that was wrapped in wire creating a momentary electric current and backfeeding the singularity causing a massive explosion of car parts wich is now our cosmos.\n There, I explained the big bang. emoticon_rolleyes",

On what basis then do you call yourself a Chirstian? Because you say so?\n Jesus Christ was the Creator of the Universe.Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. \n Joh 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God. \n Joh 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. \n Joh 1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. \n Joh 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. \n Joh 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. \n Joh 1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. \n Joh 1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. \n Joh 1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. \n Joh 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. \n Joh 1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not. \n \n He was not an evolutionist.\n Mat 19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? \n Mat 19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, \n Mat 19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? \n Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. \n \n Neither were the apostles.\n Rom 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: \n Rom 1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. \n Rom 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, \n He warned us about materialism:\n 2Pe 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, \n \n 2Pe 3:4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. \n 2Pe 3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: \n 2Pe 3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: \n \n Your god is the one you created in order to sound be accepted by the atheist. Science has not disproven one thing about the Bible. The fact that scientist has become so overwhelmingly atheistic should make any Christian either doubt them or their own faith. You have chosen the latter.\n Think about this Jo Bennett if you were alive in the first part of the last century you would have based your belief on the Piltdown Man.\n When you marry your faith to unproven science you can count on being a widow before long.\n Hugh Ross used to preach about the similarities in DNA between chimp DNA and ours. Now that the complete dissimilarity of the proteins has come to light he has to change his belief. The word of God never changes.\n \n Rev 22:19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. \n \n \n Pro 24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change: \n \n \n Mal 3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. \n \n \n The Big Bang is based on a long list of mathematically absurd assumptions. Any objections to it, and there are many from scientist who are atheist as well as those that are Christian , and Muslim , Jewish etc. are silenced by denial of funding publication etc.\n \n The Bible says the Earth was created first then the sun moon and stars . If you choose to believe in the mythical big bang you are willingly ignorant as Peter said. \n \n Jer 10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. \n \n This is precisely what you are doing. You cannot be a Bible believing Christian and an evolutionist, you must choose.

The Bible is the most authenticated book in antiquity. If it is as you say then there are no ancient text that can at all be taken seriously. Homers Illiad is a joke compared to the Bibles authenticity for example. There are over 20k copies of the New Testement and ancient scroolsof the Old Testement are virtually identical to modern text .\n \n You were educated in an atheistic system , did you expect to be taught the Bible was true?

You have bought into it hook , line and sinker.\n \n There is no way you could read the whole Bible and still accept both evolution and Christianity. They are diametrically opposed .\n The way to understand any text is to find what the author was trying to convay.You need to understand what is poetry , the Psalms and Proverbs for instance . what is parable , the Livingstones etc. , and what is history , the Genesis account of creation , the Ten Commandments etc.\n \n My suggestion to you is to get a good study guide and read it yourself.

You cannot please God without faith , to say He needs chance mutations and death to create is not faith it is ridicule.\n \n Read this carefully . The following passages are from the most authenticated text in the history of the world , the New Testement, It is Jesus Christ acknowleging Genesis as history and it's author Moses as a real person.\n \n From the Old Testament:\n Gen 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. \n \n From the New:\n \n \n Mat 19:1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; \n Mat 19:2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. \n Mat 19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? \n Mat 19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, \n Mat 19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? \n Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. \n Mat 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? \n Mat 19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. \n \n \n \n Mar 10:4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. \n Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. \n Mar 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. \n Mar 10:7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; \n Mar 10:8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. \n Mar 10:9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\n \n If you believe these seperate passages are so badly translated they both mean something else there is something wrong with your logic.\n \n \n Jesus Christ the creator of the Universe said Genesis was history and Moses was real.

If it is as you say then there are no ancient text that can at all be taken seriously. Homers Illiad is a joke compared to the Bibles authenticity for example. There are over 20k copies of the New Testement and ancient scroolsof the Old Testement are virtually identical to modern text?\n\n If you ask anyone who is versed in hebrew and you have the book of genesis in its origional hebrew text (thats before it was translated into aramaic) there is one passage that can be directly translated to \"With wisdom, God created the heavens, and the earth.\" Not in the beginning, like we grew up being taught by the 20,000 copies that you speak of.\n Dont you think that satan would have started with trying to **** with the words in this book if he were trying to discredit god and make humanity believe that either he or god didnt exist?",
