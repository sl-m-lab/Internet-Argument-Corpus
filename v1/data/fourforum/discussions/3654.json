This is a group of folks who cannot help themselves. We as a society have the choice of spending millions on institutions or finding a way to make meds available, get them working jobs of some sort. That is what the community mental health system does. BUT the system needs money to run and governments keep cutting the funds. If they are not funded, we have more homelessness, more people on street corners talking to invisable people, we have more people on SSDI. This is a great way to prevent those things. And who better to tax than the most wealthy.",

   "Do you have any proof that mental health facilities have been experiencing less funding?\n\n \n \n Gosh, that is tough! Each \"Community mental health center\" is funded by the state it is located. I can't speak for all the states but I can speak to California and Rhode Island. RI has experieced several different cuts, mostly from the Governor asking each state dept to cut 25% off there budget. It is about a 7 million cut in funding.\n \n California has expericed several different funding problems. I don't know the complete deatails but Prop 63 was in response to those cuts. \n \n I wish I could provide something better, but wait let me surf the web for a second.....(have an idea)\n \n http://www.nccbh.org/POLICY/alerts.htm\n \n http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Issue_Spotlights&Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&TPLID=5&ContentID=12904\n \n These links will provide some insite but the problem is more complicated than just posting a link. The number of uninsured mentally ill has risen, medicare and medicaid reimbursements have dropped, donations are down, prescription costs have risen but the federal medicaid dollars that support that haven't gone up with it. The cost of paying healthcare premiums has gone up, so more funding is going to pay employees than patients. I could keept going but I guess I have sorta painted the picture why the money is needed.",

   "Do you have any proof that mental health facilities have been experiencing less funding?\n\n \n I worked for a mental health facility called MCDS. I worked with clients that were very mentally handicapped. They were not able to give themselves showers and some couldn't even feed themselves. Taking care of each client took a lot of money, because there had to be special showers for their wheelchairs, medications, special beds, etc. It is not cheap. While working there we were informed that due to government cutbacks all the clients were going to be kicked out of the facility. Some were supposed to move back in with families, most of which could not support the expenses for the mentally handicapped client, so what they would have done with them we don't know. It's a very scary thing to think about. The same time that their funds got cut, the prisons were getting more funding. I don't think it's fair for people who do things out of their own free will to be gaining more than those who were more than likely born with the handicap. There has been much more proof of the funding being cut. It's very sad and very serious.",

I am sure you have seen \"Beautiful Mind\" and understand some of the mentally ill are genius, but illnesses like bi-polar depressiona and psychizophrenia can't put a damper on a great career.\n \n As for federal funding....Medicaid is a combination of federal dollars and state dollars. Both have been dwindling since the mid 80's. THe cost of living goes up but the support for these people doesn't. Funny to me how it is the republicans who are the right to life people are also the ones cutting the funding for those already living and can't make decisions for themself. Sure save the baby that has no voice, but not the adult who has no voice. That makes lots of sense right?",
