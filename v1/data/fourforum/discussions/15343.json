   "Philly.com : Man who clashed with cops over legal gun was also armed with audio recorder\n \n \nMARK FIORINO'S story has three elements that tend to get people worked up - gun rights, Philly police and YouTube.\n \n On a mild February afternoon, Fiorino, 25, decided to walk to an AutoZone on Frankford Avenue in Northeast Philly with the .40-caliber Glock he legally owns holstered in plain view on his left hip. His stroll ended when someone called out from behind: \"Yo, Junior, what are you doing?\"\n \n Fiorino wheeled and saw Sgt. Michael Dougherty aiming a handgun at him.\n \n What happened next would be hard to believe, except that Fiorino audio-recorded all of it: a tense, profanity-laced, 40-minute encounter with cops who told him that what he was doing - openly carrying a gun on the city's streets - was against the law.\n \n \"Do you know you can't openly carry here in Philadelphia?\" Dougherty asked, according to the YouTube clip.\"Yes, you can, if you have a license to carry firearms,\" Fiorino said. \"It's Directive 137. It's your own internal directive.\"\n \n The cops, department officials later admitted, were wrong. They didn't know that a person who has a license to carry a firearm can openly carry it in the city.\n \n But the story doesn't end there. How could it?\n \n After Fiorino posted his recordings on YouTube, they went viral. Members of pro-firearms forums on the Web took a particular interest in the incident.\n \n The Police Department heard about the YouTube clips. A new investigation was launched, and last month the District Attorney's Office decided to charge Fiorino with reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct because, a spokeswoman said, he refused to cooperate with police.\n \n Fiorino said he plans to sue the city whenever his criminal case is resolved.\n \n Police spokesman Lt. Ray Evers said the department believes that Fiorino wanted to get into a confrontation with cops, that he wanted to see them lose their cool so he later could file a lawsuit.\n \n Or, as one cop was overheard saying on the YouTube recording: \"He set us the f--- up, that's what the f--- he did.\"\n Terrified to be powerless\n \n Fiorino, an IT worker who lives in Montgomery County, grew up in Feltonville.\n \n A handful of his friends fell victim to random crimes over the years - a mugging here, a beatdown there, the kind of stuff that happens all the time in a big city.\n \n It was enough to make him think about being able to protect himself if he ever ran into trouble. \"It would be terrifying to me to be powerless,\" he said.\n \n So, about a year ago, Fiorino said, he got a firearms license and began openly carrying his .40-caliber Glock.\n \n \"I did research for quite a few years leading up to making a decision to carry,\" he said. \"I was ready to take on the responsibility.\"\n \n His gun went with him everywhere - to the store, you name it.\n \n After he began carrying, Fiorino said, he was stopped a handful of times by cops in Montgomery County and other parts of the state. The encounters were civil and quick, he said, and usually ended when an officer checked out his firearms license.\n \n He also had encounters with Philadelphia cops last year near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on South Street.\n \n \"Both times they told me what I was doing was illegal,\" he said. \"They patted me down and said, 'We don't care what you consent to.'\n \n \"The second time, they did an official confiscation, and it took me five months to get back my gun.\"\n \n It could be argued that Fiorino should have stopped openly carrying his gun because it invited police scrutiny. But that argument couldn't be more wrong, said John Pierce, co-founder of OpenCarry.org.\n \n Pierce, of Minnesota, said his website offers information on gun rights \"from a legal perspective, a public-policy perspective, not from a 'my cold, dead fingers' viewpoint.\"\n \n \"According to the Pennsylvania and U.S. constitutions, open carry is Mark's right,\" he said.\n \n \"To say he has to give up that right in order to stop being persecuted by the state, well, that doesn't sound like the America we want to live in.\"\n \n Pennsylvania allows citizens to openly carry firearms across the state, but with a simple caveat: A person who carries a weapon openly in Philadelphia also must be in possession of a firearms license.\n \n Fiorino said he was following the law on Feb. 13, when he decided to take a walk to AutoZone while he was in the Northeast, visiting his mom.\n \n It was a nice day, warm enough for him to head out without a jacket, leaving his holstered Glock fully exposed.\n \n Fiorino's firearms license was in his shirt pocket, he said, along with his driver's license.\n \n Oh, and a digital recorder.\n \n \n 'Get down on your knees'\n \n \n \n Fiorino was on Frankford near Placid Street when Sgt. Dougherty spotted him from his police cruiser, stopped and called out to him.\n \n An unnerving back-and-forth started to unfold like a bizarre routine. Dougherty would bark an order, and Fiorino would make an alternative suggestion.\n \n Fiorino offered to show Dougherty his driver's and firearms licenses. The cop told him to get on his knees.\n \n \"Excuse me?\" Fiorino said.\n \n \"Get down on your knees. Just obey what I'm saying,\" Dougherty said.\n \n \"Sir,\" Fiorino replied, \"I'm more than happy to stand here -\"\n \n \"If you make a move, I'm going to f------ shoot you,\" Dougherty snapped. \"I'm telling you right now, you make a move, and you're going down!\"\n \n \"Is this necessary?\" Fiorino said.\n \n It went on like that for a little while, until other officers responded to Dougherty's calls for backup.\n \n Fiorino was forced to the ground and shouted at as he tried to explain that he had a firearms license and was legally allowed to openly carry his weapon.\n \n \"You f------ come here looking for f------ problems? Where do you live?\" yelled one officer.\n \n \"I'm sorry, gentlemen,\" Fiorino said. \"If I'm under arrest, I have nothing left to say.\"\n \n \"F------ a------, shut the f--- up!\" the cop hollered.\n \n The cops discovered his recorder as they searched his pockets, and unleashed another string of expletives.\n \n Fiorino said he sat handcuffed in a police wagon while the officers made numerous phone calls to supervisors, trying to find out if they could lock him up.\n \n When they learned that they were in the wrong, they let him go.\n \n That might have been the end of the thing, too, if it hadn't been for the recordings.\n \n \n 'He did it intentionally'\n \n \n \n The weeks passed, but Fiorino couldn't stop thinking about what had happened to him on Frankford Avenue.\n \n \"They treated me like a criminal,\" he said.\n \n \"The organization that's supposed to be the embodiment of the law didn't even know some of the most important laws at the street level.\"\n \n He decided to put the recordings on YouTube.\n \n \"I wanted people to know this is an example of what can happen if you exercise your rights and freedom in Philadelphia,\" he said.\n \n Fiorino said he didn't lay a trap for the cops. He regularly carries a recorder with him in case he ever has to use his gun and then offer proof of what transpired, he said.\n \n \"I'm not trying to set anyone up,\" he said.\n \n \"It was a setup. He's done this kind of thing before,\" said Evers, the police spokesman, referring to Fiorino's encounters with authorities. \"He did it intentionally, and he audiotaped it.\"\n \n Evers said the department decided to take a second look at the case after learning about the recordings.\n \n Any number of things could have gone wrong during Fiorino's confrontation with Dougherty, Evers said.\n \n For one thing, Evers said, Fiorino could have been shot. Cops who raced to the scene could have gotten into a car accident or injured pedestrians.\n \n Ultimately, the D.A.'s Office decided to charge Fiorino with reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. He's scheduled for trial in July.\n \n Fiorino's attorney, Joseph Valvo, said the move to file criminal charges against Fiorino was retaliation for his posting the recordings on YouTube.\n \n \"They're embarrassed and using creative theories to come up with charges,\" he said.\n \n \n Up to speed\n \n \n \n If there is a positive to Fiorino's saga, it is this: The Police Department is trying to make sure none of its officers are ever again caught not knowing basic gun laws.\n \n \"Our officers weren't up to speed [because] we never really addressed it,\" said Lt. Francis Healy, the department's lawyer.\n \n \"In the last several weeks, we've done a lot of training and put out a lot of information about what is allowed and what's not allowed. Right now, our officers are better-versed on the subject matter.\"\n \n Healy said he emphasized the importance of officers being polite and professional if they have to stop a person who is legally carrying a firearm.\n \n \"You can use caution, but you don't need to curse them up and down and put a gun in their face,\" he said.\n \n At City Hall on Saturday, about 30 gun owners staged a protest of Fiorino's recent arrest.\n \n The protesters and cops got along fine.\n \n \"These aren't bad people,\" Healy said.\n",

   "Open-Carry Experiment Shows Cops Don't Know Their Own Gun Laws | News and Opinion | Philadelphia Weekly\n \n \nIt was late last week when gun-rights activist Mark Fiorino joined PW for a stroll around downtown Philly. The Montgomery County man, who was featured on the cover of yesterday's Daily News for his stance on carrying pistols openly, walks down 15th Street toward Sansom, attracting nary a look.\n \n Eventually, one man offers a double-take. The head turn probably has something to do with the fact that Fiorino's belt contains an openly holstered firearm alongside his cell phone and keys. After all, Fiorino's story hadn't yet appeared in the Daily News, so his face wasn't yet recognizeable.\n \n Surprisingly, that one brief stare was about the only bit of reaction Fiorino received on that particular day, a few days before the Daily News story broke. But minimal public feedback is often the norm. People typically go about their business unaware that someone like Fiorino has a gun strapped to his hip-even when it's in full view. \"For the most part, it's either a look or a dismissal or nobody notices,\" says Fiorino. And unbeknownst to many Pennsylvanians, \"open carry,\" or the act of carrying one's firearm unconcealed by clothing, is actually quite legal. Even in Philadelphia, legal gun owners who have a license can wear their holstered handguns in plain sight. In the rest of the state, open carry requires no license. Still, despite the law being quite clear on the issue, open-carry advocates like Fiorino sometimes find themselves in the crosshairs of an ignorant public.\n \n But what happens when the ignorance comes from the very people who are paid to uphold the law? For open carriers like Fiorino, it's a problem that can have dire consequences.\n \n Like the time he found himself with a gun pointed at his head. Back in February, when he was visiting his native Northeast Philadelphia, his gun attracted the attention of a passing city cop. After a 40-minute ordeal in which Fiorino was ordered to the ground and detained, the cops eventually cleared him for release, but not before they got in a few choice words. But it wasn't the profanity used by the responding officers-audio from Fiorino's recorder was posted to Youtube-that totally offended Fiorino. Rather, it was the lack of police knowledge regarding the open-carry law. \"I obviously did a ton of research beforehand,\" says Fiorino. Police, he says, ought to do the same.\n \n Not that Fiorino totally faults cops for having a heightened sense of awareness. But he does take issue with the fact that officers aren't being trained to respect law-abiding citizens. \"In my experience, in the city, it's always been negative,\" Fiorino says of his interaction with Philly cops, many of whom appear unaware of the legality of open carry. \"There's always a lot of attention with the police because they know you're armed and they automatically perceive you as a threat,\" he says.\n \n One city cop, who requested anonymity, said that he was unaware carrying a firearm openly within the city limits was legal. \"To see somebody carrying a gun in full view, it's kind of, I would say, scary in a big city,\" the officer says. But as Fiorino sat on a bench at Dilworth Plaza talking about his cause, very few eyes glanced his way. Passers-by didn't even seem to notice him-even though his gun was out in the open on his left hip. \"Nobody's screaming or running around,\" Fiorino says.\n \n Still, the officer maintains that the sight of a gun on someone without a badge could cause a problem. \"When people see you doing that, people assume you're a police officer,\" the cop says, adding that even off-duty, most city cops carry concealed. \"I think all guns should be concealed.\"\n \n Fiorino says open carry is meant to raise awareness, to let people know that they still have rights. And in Philadelphia, they are, thanks to people like Fiorino.\n \n \"Technically, the answer is yes,\" says Lt. Fran Healy, a special adviser to Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey. \"You can carry openly within Philadelphia as long as you have a license.\" Healy, who is also an attorney, doesn't dispute the claim that city cops are often ignorant on the open-carry law, which has been on the books since 1995. He says it's just never been a problem, that citizens were simply never observed carrying openly in the city. He adds that incidents such as Fiorino's have prompted the PPD to better train its officers. The training has come in various forms, Healy says, including educating beat officers during roll call and conducting \"teletype training,\" which is when a sergeant receives a message from the commissioner that is passed down to his or her subordinates. \"When they [officers on the street] know the law, that helps them respond better,\" he says. \"These [citizens] are decent people. They're not criminals.\"\n \n But Healy certainly understands why the sight of someone openly carrying a firearm might put off some cops. \"The bottom line is this: If I stop you and your behavior and conduct is such that I feel at risk ... I personally may have my gun out,\" he says. \"That doesn't mean I'm pointing it at your head. I don't know who or what you are yet.\"\n \n The other factor contributing to cops' confusion is that according to state law, a license is needed to carry openly in the city, but it's not required in the rest of the commonwealth. Because of that, officers don't technically have cause to detain an open carrier without reasonable articulable suspicion of a crime having been committed. But in Philly, because a license is needed, law enforcement officers contend they have authority to stop people to make sure they're legit. Gun-rights activists take issue with this, saying probable cause is still required for a police stop. They liken it to driving: Officers aren't legally allowed to stop everyone who is driving a car to ensure they're licensed, unless a violation has been committed.\n \n Healy, however, says it comes down to an \"officer safety\" issue, meaning if an open carrier is spotted, there might be brief police interaction. \"I think the officers are well justified in Philadelphia ... to do an investigation,\" he says. \"We just want to confirm that you're lawful, and we'll let you go on your way.\"\n Add to all that the convoluted wording of the state law, which essentially makes open carry de-facto legal: \"No person shall carry a firearm, rifle or shotgun at any time upon the public streets or upon any public property in a city of the first class unless:(1) such person is licensed to carry a firearm; or (2) such person is exempt from licensing under section 6106 of this title (relating to firearms not to be carried without a license). The second bullet point generally refers to law enforcement and others for whom their job requires the carrying of a gun. Because the law doesn't explicitly say open carry is legal, some question whether it really is. State law also doesn't make a distinction between open versus concealed carry. \"By not addressing it, the Legislature has left it open,\" Healy says. \"The statute is vague, which leaves a little bit of a problem.\"\n \n To gun-rights advocates, the law is quite clear. After all, if there isn't a law against something, anything, it's legal, right? Proponents of open carry were so adamant about getting their message out that they organized a rally in Center City last weekend. One of the activists was Derek Price, who on May 14 was strolling up the steps toward City Hall wearing black pants, a blue button-down shirt, a black vest and a gun on one hip. The Harleysville resident arrived for a gathering organized by members of the Pennsylvania Firearm Owners Association. \"Open carry, concealed carry, it's totally up to the individual,\" said Price, 38, who has been open carrying since getting his license in 2007. \n \n Price, like the others attending the rally, aim to make open carry more visible. One woman came up to Price, asking him to point her in the direction of the Ritz Carlton. \"Perception is everything,\" Price said.\n As more protesters arrived, it seemed as though the rally had the makings for some interesting feedback. Again, nothing. Here they were, a group of about 25 or so gun-toting average Joe's, walking through the outdoor plaza at City Hall, and nobody seemed to notice. \"We've been standing here, what, 20 minutes?\" Price asked. \"Nobody's complained.\"\n \n Finally, Healy arrived with officers from the department's Civil Affairs Unit, the armband-clad cops who monitor protests and labor disputes, and off the group went. During the next four hours, the gun-wearers and a handful of cops, all in plainclothes, strolled downtown Philadelphia. There were stops outside police headquarters and the District Attorney's Office. Since federal law was recently changed to allow for firearms in gun-friendly states to be brought into national parks, the group figured it would stop by and take a photo near the Liberty Bell, too. \"Exercising our Second Amendment where the Second Amendment was signed,\" one member could be heard calling out.\n \n Over the next four hours, the group walked, held signs and handed out pamphlets to members of the public. A few people cast stares. Some asked questions. None seemed worried or concerned in the least. That's the way it should be, the open carriers contend. Even Healy seemed pleased with the results of the peaceful protest. \"These interactions can be positive,\" he said at the rally. \"I'm looking at this as more of an educational thing on both sides.\"\n \n Ted Noga, the Pennsylvania Firearm Owners Association member who organized the rally, was also pleased that everything went off without a hitch that rainy Saturday. \"I'm quite impressed with the response by the police department,\" he said.\n \n Lt. Lisa King, head of the department's Gun Permits Unit, said her division is now working to amend language on a supplemental sheet accompanying the firearms license application that says a licensee must conceal. The wording on is old, she concedes. King, who attended the rally, says didn't even know the practice was legal before it was brought to her attention.\n \n \"It's definitely going to do something,\" says Josh Dillon, a Philly gun owner who typically carries concealed. Dillon, who carried openly on this day, says the whole aim of the event was to create awareness. Still, since he doesn't want to be harassed, he keeps it concealed. But that's not to say he opposes open carry. People can choose for themselves, he says.\n \n As for Fiorino, he's just glad the encounter in Northeast Philly sparked some awareness. \"I think that if people like myself don't get out there and do it, that often misinformation and ignorance continues to spread,\" he says.\n\n \n This kind of blatant ignorance by the police goes far beyond being inexcusable, it's absolutely unforgivable.",

   "You might be surprised at the number of laws police officers do not understand. They know quite a lot, particularly about laws they enforce all the time. But there are always laws which cover situations they rarely encounter that they have to learn about, sometimes on the fly. Heck I'm a prosecutor and I don't know all the laws I deal with off the top of my head. I just know where to find them and how to apply them. \n \n In circumstances where officers don't know whether they have a crime or not they are supposed to call someone for advice.

But nothing should have happened. The officers should have quickly realized the person was not a threat, and after that it should have been a brief and calm conversation while the officers who did not know the law called someone to find out if a crime was being committed or not. The recording should have been too boring to have made its way to the web. If the officers involved are embarrassed by having their actions broadcast to the web then they have themselves to blame.",
