   "Personally, I think the health bill already does too much to compromise women's health care since there is no public option and Medicare buy-in for people 55+. \n \n Another great irony is now a mostly male Democratic leadership that thinks taking away women's right to choose is a Christmas gift or bonus to the American people, of whom over 50% are women. Plus let's chip away at the rights of lower income women even more, at this charitable ho ho ho time of year!\n \n \nNOW President Condems Compromised Health Care Bill; Women's Access to Abortion Care Traded Away\n \n WASHINGTON - December 19 - The so-called health care reform bill now before the Senate, with the addition of Majority Leader Harry Reid's Manager's Amendment, amounts to a health insurance bill for half the population and a sweeping anti-abortion law for the rest of us. And by the way, it's the rest of us who voted the current leadership into both houses of Congress.\n \n The National Organization for Women is outraged that Senate leadership would cave in to Sen. Ben Nelson, offering a compromise that amounts to a Stupak-like ban on insurance coverage for abortion care. Right-wing ideologues like Nelson and the Catholic Bishops may not understand this, but abortion is health care. And health care reform is not true reform if it denies women coverage for the full range of reproductive health services.\n \n We call on all senators who consider themselves friends of women's rights to reject the Manager's Amendment, and if it remains, to defeat this cruelly over-compromised legislation.\n \n \n \n ###\n The National Organization for Women (NOW) is the largest organization of feminist activists in the United States. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n \n andmuchmore @ http://www.commondreams.org./newswire/2009/12/19\n \n\n \n \n If they pass this bill, it's strange, but I really do hope they pass it on Christmas Eve.\n \n It will show our Democratic Party up for the Grinches they truly are, in league with the Republicans. As they give a BIG BIG present to the health insurance industry.\n \n Likely though, this will dawn on their \"professional handlers\" in time (maybe not!), and anything that goes through will follow Christmas, so they can dodge the association that shows them up in a most poetically just fashion.\n \n 3 presidents behind a public option, control over Congress, 75% of the American people wanting a public option, over 50% saying they are less likely to vote without a public option, including 1/3rd of Democrats, and a major voters' mandate to go in and get public healthcare through, and with a pro-choice president.\n \n They can't do it because of John McCain's necking partner?\n \n Please. The American people are not that stupid, Washington. No matter how much FOX news you feed us, no matter how many television appearances your spinmeisters make today on other stations.\n \n Here's a photo in a Reuter's article showing some of the Jolly Good Ol' Boys prematurely celebrating their Macy's basement bargain buy for American women.\n \n Black Friday, indeed.\n \n ...",
