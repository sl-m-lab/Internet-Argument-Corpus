It's like being a vegetarian but not supporting a ban on eating meat, or like allowing voluntary euthanasia but not wanting to be euthanased yourself, when the time comes. There is an issue because some consider the feotus to be fully human, and hence abortion to be murder, while others consider the feotus to be a part of the carrier's body, and hence it's ok to do whatever they want with it.",

I choose to be single and YOU assumed it was because there was something wrong with me. Making men the center, end all be all of a woman's life will ultimately lead to sex. I know more women who put up with anything and anyone over being alone.\n \n Keep pushing comprehensive sex ed - and yes it should include abstinence, but not exclusively. \n \n Birth control should be really, really, really easy to get. So should health care.\n \n Stop treating sexuality like dirty secret. This country has such an unhealthy attitude about sex - we either use it to sell or condemn its practice. \n \n I like programs that force kids to care for dolls, eggs, etc. - as an attempt to give them idea of what being a full time parent is. Also let them hear real hard life tales. They should hear what its like to be 18 an a parent from an 18 year old parent. They should hear from AIDS patients and people who have had abortions. They should hear from doctors and police. They should hear about the ten year old who was abondonded down the street from me in his underwear because his parents don't want him anymore. Kids should not be sheltered from the realities they live in.\n \n We should know that mistakes are still going to happen, unwanted pregnancies are going to happen - and resources should be available to those mothers - doctors, medicine, support for their kids, ways to continue working or stay in school, counseling, ANYTHING they need. They should not be snubbed or demonized. How you expect a happy, healthy pregnancy from finger pointing and a \"that's what you get\" attitude is beyond me. And no, VoR - there are not enough resources - my own life experiences taught me that. And when somebody has come through this tells her story and how she did it, labels like \"welfare queen\" - aren't really going to inspire the next girl (JP).\n \n And lastly - you need to let women have autonomy, If you take it away at any time you send the message that they mere vessels, not worthy of their lives, and not to be trusted. Nobody makes correct choices, or does the right thing coming from that.\n \n Now, VoR, what are your ideas - or do you just have another sermon for us?",

   "would you elaborate?\n Like I said, I'm lazy. But since I provided a link to the many ways in which legal rights work, that's alright because all you have to do is click on the link and read.\n \nHow can you be so concerned about big peoples autonomy but you dont care about the little people's autonomy?\n I care about the right to personal autonomy so much that where a different right infringes upon it, whether it is the right of a fetus (not very likely) or an adult (very likely), that it must have primacy. \n \nI counted differently. Assuming personal autonomy is a right:\n Putting life before personal autonomy = one of each person's rights are violated(mother and fetus personal autonomy) for a total of 2 violated rights. Putting Personal autonomy before life = one of one person's rights are violated - that being the right to autonomy of the mother(the baby violates the mother's supposed \"personal autonomy\" at conception), and two of one person's rights are violated - that being autonomy and life of the baby. For a grand total of 3 rights violated.\n The fetus does not violate the mother's right to personal autonomy at conception. We violate that right on its behalf when we deny her the choice of aborting it. So that's one right that isn't violated by giving primacy to the right of personal autonomy. Likewise I fail to see how a fetus' personal autonomy is violated by preserving its right to life since the right to life and the right to personal autonomy are either independent, such that violating one does not violate the other, or derivative, such that personal autonomy automatically has primacy. Your accounting fails on these counts and the balance stands at 3:1 in favour of personal autonomy. \n \nHow so?\n The reasons I've given in this post are also elaborated further along in this post. \n \nThen what?\n The right to life does have primacy over personal autonomy! You violate one's personal autonomy - they still are living. You violate a person's right to life - they have no personal autonomy cause they are dead.\n Then I got distracted and went out to play frisbee. :)\n \n Let me finish that summation: \n \n If both mother and fetus have the same set of rights [life, personal autonomy] and the right to life has primacy over the right to personal autonomy, then we violate more rights than we preserve, as per the careful accounting of rights that I have provided. \n \n There, but I still need to address the mistake you make in putting the right to life over the right to personal autonomy:\n \n A person retains their right to personal autonomy whether they are able to exercise it or not, else feti and the unconscious would not have such a right. Dead people have the right to personal autonomy and we honour this through legally binding wills. Since a fetus is pre-conscious and makes no use of its personal autonomy, like a dead person or an unconscious person, aborting it does not violate that right. \n \nWe know that the fetus' personal autonomy is always violated in a pregnancy.\n Actually the fetus' personal autonomy is not violated at all in pregnancy or in an abortion, since that right is independent of the right to life.\n \n The idea of a fetus' personal autonomy being violated by abortion is false in any framework that posits the right to life and the right to autonomy as independent of each other. \n \n In a framework where the right to life is an extension of the right to personal autonomy, then the personal autonomy of the mother again takes precedence. Her right to personal autonomy would have to take precedence because violating it for the purpose of preserving the fetus' right to autonomy would entail that we can violate the fetus' right to autonomy for the same reason. \n \n Such a stalemated arrangement would indicate that the rights of the mother take precedence because her right to personal autonomy would then have to be weighed against specific derivative rights of the fetus, which is again a losing proposition for the fetus. Given that such a tie-breaker between competing rights of personal autonomy automatically priviledges the mother, personal autonomy automatically trumping life, defending a fetus against abortion on those grounds isn't going to work.\n \nSince personal autonomy trumps life, It would be better to err on the side of personal autonomy of the fetus and further secure this right and therefore abort it in order to end the violation of this right.\nI fail to see how aborting a child secures its personal autonomy rights. In fact aborting the child to protect its personal autonomy rights is self-contradictory because you are not giving it a choice in the matter where its choice is at issue and thus violate its personal autonomy rights by trying to protect them in such a fashion. \n \n I think you're missing the point that rights only trump each other when applied across agents, rather than to a single agent - in this case the fetus. The mother's right to personal autonomy only trumps the fetus' right to life. \n \nTherefore: To best secure this primary right to all babies we should mandate the abortion of all babies.\n That's the wonderful thing about regimented arguments, is that it's easy to identify mistakes. In this case your big mistake was missing out on how rights relate to those who have rights, the agents. I'd say nice try, but that was a pretty amateur mistake. \n \nNurglich, do you support the mandating of abortion of all babies?\n No, for the reasons that I have detailed in this post.",

The fact that the fetus cannot survive without the mother means that this violates the fetus' right to life rather than the fetus' right to personal autonomy, unless you derive the right to life from the right to autonomy in which case it still boils down to the mother's right to personal autonomy trumping the fetus' right to life.\n \nI was just trying to find an extreme example of where your framework (autonomy trumps life) could lead one to reason to.

Political systems that deny this right tend to be totalitarian, such as Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. \n \nAnd since rights come from laws to you can you show me where the right to personal autonomy is?\n Is asking you to read that link too much to ask? Legal rights exist within legal systems, and not necessarily through the mechanism of law, as the US Constitution amply illustrates with the implicit right to life. Many rights operate as background assumptions upon which the edifice of law is constructed, and others are instantiated by constitutions. \n \n If you have read my posts at all, you'll notice that I'm simply assuming that conditions are such that there is a right to personal autonomy. So when I say a system of legal rights that contains the right to life and the right to personal autonomy, I'm using a conditional and assuming these rights to be part of the antecedent proposition. So where the right to personal autonomy is explicitly stated is irrelevant. \n \n But now that you mention it, in the USA the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights recognizes the right to personal autonomy by guaranteeing the privacy of personal beliefs and associations. In Canada the right to personal autonomy is protected by Article Seven of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.",

In the USA, a person's legal rights are derived from the system of rights that underwrites the Constitution. If the law was changed with regards to the rights of a person, those rights would remain the same and the law would have to either instantiate them in a different way or violate them, much like a law can either elaborate on a constitutionally defined right or violate that right. \n \nAs for question three, if I choose to rank me above you then can I make you my slave?

However, if there is a substantial risk to the woman's life or if there are foetal abnormalities there is no time limit.\n \n To comply with the 1967 Abortion Act, two doctors must give their consent, stating that to continue with the pregnancy would present a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children.\n\n \n Our read the full wording of the 1967 Abortion Act here \n \n Our viability is the 24th week of pregnancy- when the act was revised in 1990 the view was that a foetus born before this time basically no chance of survival. That was the expert view of a large number of medical practitioners (the Act originally allowed an abortion to be requested up to the 28th week of pregnancy).\n \n This still holds today, although with modern techniques for dealing with premature birth some have argued that the viability threshold should be reduced to 22 or even 20 weeks.\n \n \n Off course, there are exceptions which allow an abortion to be performed right up until the end of the pregnancy, but these are based upon medical issues alone, and are not a matter of choice (ie. requesting an abortion because you want one) for the mother.\n \n So there you go chloe, that is how the choice is made, and you being one for expousing the absolute should appreciate in law there has to be a cut off point somewhere with regard to an issue like abortion.",

   "Chloe,\n \nHere is what you said\n \n That is advocating the killing of babies who are born but still attached by the umbilical cord.\n\n \n No, it is not. It is advocating her having the ability to separate herself. I said if she has to kill it to do this, so be it.\n \n After it has been born there is no situation I can think of where she must kill it to remove herself from caring for the child. \n \n \n\n technically you are right. Since the fetus gets o2 from the mother, and all organs need o2. I was thinking of the fetal heart and brain functioning on its own.\n\n \n The fetal heart does not function completely while the fetus is in the womb. Since the lungs are collapsed in the womb the heart has a hole in it to bypass the connection that would send blood to the lungs. When the baby takes its first breath that hole is closed and blood begins to flow to the lungs to be oxygenated.\n \n \n\n what Is your definition of attached then? That is pretty attached. I don't see how you can say that a baby breastfeeding is not attached.\n\n \n You do not need a definition to see the difference. If I were to put my hand on your shoulder we would be as attached as a breastfeeding baby. If I were to suck on your nipples or yours to mine, we would not be attached as a fetus is to the woman while in the womb.\n \n \n \n All women who give birth have the option to remove it from dependence? Well then, let all women give birth.\n\n \n Absolutely :) I am fully for letting all women give birth if they so choose.\n \n \n\n That goes to show that the pro-life position does not remove this option for women.\n\n \n I never said it did. What you wish to remove is her ability to do this before birth.\n \n \n\n Pregnant women do have just as much \"power\" as non-pregnant women. Pretty much anyone has the power to do whatever they want regardless of consequence. If abortion were outlawed, pregnant women would have the power to kill the child, only there would be a steeper consequence.\n\n \n This is an empty argument.\n \n Cone,\n \n\n You hold the exteme position that it is not a separate entity until the umbilical cord has been severed. Up until that point, the mother can do whatever she wants to do to it.\n\n \n No, no, no. You misunderstand. She can separate herself from it and stop caring for it, not \"do whatever she wants to do to it\".\n \n \n\n Thus, it is not the process of birth that gives a point of origin for the child's rights, but the process of severing the umbilical cord. This would make whoever severed the umbilical cord the one who bestowed rights to the child. If the person who severed the umbilical cord is the one who gave the child it's rights, does he/she also have the power to remove those rights whenever he/she pleases?\n\n \n Er, no. It is bestowed rights under our Constitution and the laws of our country. If rights are bestowed at conception, does that mean the mother and father confer rights? Can they now take them away whenever they please? This is an empty argument.\n \n \n\n A conjoined twin is attacthed to another creature. Which twin's rights takes precedence over the other?\n\n \n Whomever the body belongs to. Since they developed together, each has an equal claim to the body's resources. This is not the case with pregnancy.\n \n \n\n I believe I said birth was not an arbitrary point or reference earlier. But after further thought, I have now changed my mind. Some children are born after a full nine months; some are born after seven months; some 8 months etc. This seems then to be an arbitrary point of reference.\n\n \n How so? No matter how long the pregnancy takes, birth is a significant event that is easily marked, and the same separation happens from the mother.\n \n \n\n The point I was trying to make is that birth is not necessarily the only easily marked reference point.\n\n \n No, but it is the best.\n \n \n\n For instance, another easily marked reference point would be when the woman finds out she is pregnant.\n\n \n Is it? Do women routinely tell everyone when they find out they're pregnant? Should she be required to tell someone, or shall all women report to the police station to check them? Birth is a lot more easily marked than \"finding out she is pregnant\" for everyone involved.\n \n \n\n What you are basically saying so far as I understand is that even when abortion was illegal, people still obtained them. Because of this, we should just legalize abortion.\n\n \n No, that is not what I am saying. If you look at what you said and what I responded with, you will see that. You stated that abortion laws were practical to enforce, and I responded that they weren't enforced all that effectively (so they were not all that practical). That it is practical to enforce after birth is not my reason to legalize abortion, it was simply my point that it is more practical to enforce rights after birth than it is before birth.\n \n Zenodotus, (interesting name, btw, given you are not that hard-core about grammar)\n \n\n Your argument is as big a slipper slope as anyone else's, or it is equally arbitrary. You say that the mother should not have to provide nutrients against her will or without her consent. What makes providing bodily nutrients so different from those she buys at the store and hand feeds to the baby?\n\n \n She does not buy her body.\n \n \n\n There is no discernable difference.\n\n \n She does not buy her body.\n \n \n\n If I were to say that the mother is required to feed her child after birth, your line or reasoning would have to say that no, she can stop feeding her child at any time, pre or post birth. And if you disagreed with that, you would be making an arbitrary disconnect between forcing her to feed with bodily mechanisms, and forcing her to feed by external means (bottle, etc.).\n\n \n The disconnect is yours. I don't disagree with that. She can stop feeding her child at any time, pre or post birth. You yourself (I assume) agree that she can stop feeding her child post birth, since I assume you agree with adoption and safe-haven laws.\n \n \n\n If the mother can withdraw her care for the baby at any time, what's to stop her from leaving her 13 month old baby in the middle of a grassy field to die? If you think it is ok for her to leave it in a grassy field, then how about floating on a small piece of drift wood? The slippery slope there is obvious.\n\n \n If it is obvious, why has it not happened? Adoption has been around for a long time, yet there has been no rash of leaving children in grassy fields or floating on drift wood, which according to you is a logical step from morally allowing a mother to stop providing for her child (adoption). Recent laws allowing newborns to be left at fire-stations and hospitals have not led to infanticide (in fact, it has probably prevented it). You are creating connections where none exist.\n \n There is no good moral comparison between a born child and a fetus in the womb. A situation where there are a myriad of options open to the woman to rid herself of a born child does not compare well to a situation where there is only one option open to the woman.\n \n \n\n But perhaps you don't think she should be allowed to leave it in the middle of a grassy field. You don't think she should be allowed to actively go and put it somewhere. Ok, what if she is camping in the field, and then decides she doesn't want to care for it anymore, why should she have to bring it back? Or what if she is going on a nature walk, and decides not to care for it anymore? Again, the slippery slope is obvious.\n\n \n You ignore the fact that there is no other option for a woman much of the pregnancy. None other can possibly care for it, either actually or without physical trauma to the woman. After birth any other can care for a child, so in order to achieve the same end (not caring for the child) a woman with a born child can turn it over to another. During the pregnancy turning it over to another is not an option, yet she should still have the same right to stop caring for it.\n \n By your \"going out camping\" analogy, wouldn't adoption be immoral? And if it is so obvious, why has it not happened? If you must come up with extreme examples (what if the world ended and she was the only one left alive?) it does not argue well for your argument.",

So, no, I did not adovocate her being able to kill it after it has been birthed.\n \n \n\n The legal definitions of health have been expanded to allow abortion for whatever reason. If the reason is that she wants to kill the baby then she legally can.\n\n \n If she wants to abort for reasons of health, then I feel that is justified as well. \n \n \n\n I know of people who have only one functioning kidney - doesn't mean I can kill them. Also, there are many women who have had hysterectomies. You originally based an argument saying that the fetus doesn't have organs that function independently.\n\n \n No, I did not. The functioning of those organs have nothing to do with their development.\n \n \n\n It is attached. But hey its all relative anyway right? It doesnt matter if you think it is not. Some women may think it is and want to kill their baby.\n\n \n They do not have the right to kill their baby, they have the right to separate themselves from it and/or stop caring for it. With a born child they can do this without harming it, but they do not have that option before birth yet still retain the right to separate themselves. \n \n \n\n If the baby breastfeeding is attached (which it is - as you have not shown me why you think it is not or given me your definition of attached) then there is no difference in the woman who wants to abort the baby after birth but attached by the umbilical cord (for health reasons that actually mean any reason and no reason) and the woman who wants to abort the baby after birth but attached during breastfeeding (for health reasons / economic reasons that actually incorporate any reason and no reason at all).\n\n \n Only in your mind is there no difference. If you actually debated honestly and took my points on their own merits instead of making up my points for me, then you would see that. It is not attached as a fetus is attached to the womb.\n \n I have no interests in a semantics argument where we quote definitions at each other.",

However, it is not \"attached\"- it is possible for another woman to fufill the role of suckling the child, and the rearing to adulthood can (in theory) be carried by any person.\n \n By contrast, during pregnancy the mother is the only person who can provide the foetus with what it requires- their is no surrogate option, so you could use the term attached in this instance.",

   "Yes, adoption is one way to remove support without killing the child. But there are also other options of removal that require the death of the child. Why can't we exercise these options?\n\n \n Because they aren't necessary to facilitate the woman revoking her duty of care. That is all she is allowed to do. Not kill the child. She is allowed to stop caring for and supporting it. \n \n \nA newborn infant cannot eat any food without the aid/resources of another agent. If you put a newborn infant on a table and set some milk next to it, is the newborn infant going to drink the milk? The infant could starve to death with food sitting right next to it without any active restraint on the part of the mother.\n\n \n Quite true.\n \n \nSuppose the person providing the infant with the milk decides they do not wish to further expend their resources/support and actually feed the infant, what will happen? Now, suppose this happens in a home where no one is actively prevented from feeding the child, it just so happens that no one else does. You would obviously not object to the mother refusing to feed the child, an action that would bring about it's death.\n\n \n No, I do not. However, I do object to the negligence on her part by not informing someone responsible of her decision, in order that they may care for the baby.\n \n \nWhere does this duty originate from, and why does it exclude one from removing themselves from this duty via infanticide?\n\n \n I think it was an 1832 ruling from some judge in England who laid out the basics of the negligence laws. The parent never has the right to end the life of the child. They simply have the right to stop supporting it. During the pregnancy it is necessary to kill the child in order to prevent supporting it. After pregnancy it is not necessary. Thus when a parent chooses to stop supporting a child after birth, they cannot kill it, because it is not necessary to do so.\n \n \nWhat do you mean acceptable?\n\n \n Perhaps reasonable would have been a better word. I mean that in the same situation, and reasonable person could be expected to make the same decision.\n \n \nOk, I'll just assume you don't see how this statement is illogical.\n\n \n You are correct, the relevant sentence was poorly worded.\n \n \nIf no one wants to care for the baby, who will \"pick it up?\"\n\n \n It doesn't matter. So long as the mother has taken all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the child, she is justified in removing her support from it.\n \n By accepting the baby into her care, the mother owes it a duty of care. This duty of care extends to taking all reasonable options to find a new carer if the mother no longer wants to support the child herself.",

   "I'd be interested to know what Nurglitch has to say about the belief that morality is arbitrary (albeit in a way those of us that don't speak symbol-logic-ese can understand).\n The belief that morality is arbitrary, or that morality is agent-relative, is usually called moral relativism. The idea is that different people hold different opinions of what is moral, and therefore morality is different for everyone. The problem with this is that it assumes that people's moral opinions are the same as moral facts, and given the problem of error that cannot be the case.\n \n I think that a much stronger case can be made for moral objectivism because moral statements are normative statements ('should'), and those are necessarily statements about objectively knowable things. Conversely this means that moral relativism is inconsistent because its claim that morality is subjective conflicts with the objective decidability of normative statements. \n \n Dissent in moral opinion does not entail that morality and moral facts are relative, but dissent does entail that the recognition and appropriate use of those moral facts is fallible. \n \n I think it's better to say that although there are moral facts, people may have different ways of understanding those moral facts, and that some of those ways are better than others. That is not to say that if one side of a disagreement is wrong then the other side is necessarily right, but to say that one side may be right and the other wrong, or both may be wrong, or both may be right and are merely expressing it differently.\n \n This objectivity does not translate into moral facts being absolute. Moral facts themselves, like all facts, are necessarily particular and not universal and absolute. Certainly moral facts may be parsed and organized by their subject, their scope, and relatedness, but that organization is not the facts themselves but rather how we understand those facts. Moral facts qua moral opinions can only be understood by their relation to other possible moral facts, and that identification is only good so far as its margin of error. The fewer actual moral facts we can identify, the less accurate our conception of what those moral facts are, and the less accurate our moral opinions are. If we are to talk about moral facts then we must recognize that while there are moral facts, we may be wrong about what we claim to be moral facts.\n \n In practice this means that when you're discussing moral facts, you must acknowledge that all of the opinions on the table may be wrong, and that any claims about moral facts are just opinions. Certainly some opinions are better than others, due to reasons of consistency, parsimony, validity, and scope, but nowhere can a person simply assert that a moral fact is absolute without giving a reason to suppose that it must always be so.",

   "Sigma,\n \n An example of a moral fact might be that \"cheating is wrong\". Some people interpret this to mean that cheating should never be permitted, others interpret this to mean that cheating should be permitted in order to prevent worse things from happening. Still others interpret this to mean that whoever says that only thinks that cheating is wrong. A Kantian, for example, would interpret the fact that cheating is wrong by explaining how cheating contravenes the categorical imperative. \n \n The fact that normative statements are to be interpreted objectively is not the only reason for supposing that moral facts exist, or that we should treat morality as objective. There are also practical reasons for treating morality as objective - namely that we can discuss moral opinions in terms of error, treat moral statements in a logical manner where facts constitute constants, and give each other moral advice. \n \n I don't think I would go so far as to say that moral facts exist outside of minds capable of thinking about them, or to say that moral facts cannot be known, but rather I would say that the existence of moral facts is independent of the epistemological subject, like the existence of mathematical facts.",

I do not see how you can say the same of \"cheating is wrong\", unless something other than the human mind created these moral truths or they were created by physical universe.\n The 'truths' described by the human activities of mathematics and science are independent of human existence, just as the 'truths' described by the human activity of ethics are. A lack of humans to describe these 'truths', whether mathematically, scientifically, or morally is contingent to their truth-value.\n \nMathematical statements are also true by virtue of the meaning of the terms it contains; it does not need justification. Thus it is immune to the infinite regress. Value judgements do not share this virtue.\n Indeed, the pragmatic use of axiomatic systems to establish truth-values has been a great leap forward in mathematics and logic. Interestingly this is a justification, one that says under such-and-such axioms, so-and-so theorum is necessarily true. Truth, by this account, is something inherent to systems of representation, rather than some property of its objects. The advantage is, as you have mentioned, it avoids the infinite regress problem of foundationalist truth determining schemes. I advocate treating morality like this, as largely coherent systems of objectively decidable moral facts.\n \nI apologize if these points were address by the site you sent, I have only begun to look through it.\n Actually they aren't directly addressed by the SEP article. What the SEP article does is show the problems associated with traditional foundationalist accounts of moral facts, where moral facts are treated as atomic and absolute.\n \n Interestingly Campbell, like W.V.O Quine before him, advocates a naturalized moral epistemology wherein moral facts are understood through a reflective equilibrium between science (psychology and neuroscience mainly) and our common sense moral beliefs. This is something that logic, mathematics, and the better theories of natural science do with their 'facts', and I think that applying such a method to ethics allows us to treat it in a similarly objective fashion without the traditional foundationalist problems.\n \nHow is moral relativism ineffective? I have only seen you state that it conflicts with the implication of normative statements.\n Moral relativism tends to kill any constructive discussion of ethics between people, for one thing. It's hard to discuss what should be done when anybody's feelings on the matter are equally valid. I wouldn't do anything important where the opinon of an expert carries the same weight as some ignorant jackass. I wouldn't try to build an engine based on my feelings about mechanics, unless those feelings were anchored in long years of learning how engines actually work rather than how I feel that they work. \n \n Moral relativism confuses indicative propositions with evocative propositions - and I really don't want to go around saying \"I don't like it when my computer doesn't seem to work.\" when I want to say: \"My computer should be working.\" Basically moral relativism faces all of the same problems that solipsism does, except on a much more important level since I want to know what I should do rather than what I feel like doing. \n \n And to clear up a misunderstanding, I didn't state that moral relativism \"conflicts with the implication of normative statements\" so much as state that the position of moral relativism, that morality is subjective, conflicts with the objective or public use of normative statements. Ludwig Wittgenstein pointed out the absurdity of this in his 'private language argument'.\n \n Here's a link that explains it better: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/#7",

There is a lot of reading in both rl and online I wish to do and I would still like to continue the discussion, if you are willing.\n \n \nThe 'truths' described by the human activities of mathematics and science are independent of human existence, just as the 'truths' described by the human activity of ethics are. A lack of humans to describe these 'truths', whether mathematically, scientifically, or morally is contingent to their truth-value.\n\n \n I cannot accept this argument as it stands, partly because mathematic truths and scientific \"truths\" are true for different reasons, and applying both to moral truths is not valid, imo. Mathematic statements are analytical, and like the statement \"my sibling's daughter is my niece\", they are true by definition. A moral statement such as \"cheating is wrong\" is not.\n \n What you stated above also does not follow. Scientific \"truths\" refer to a subject and if that subject does not exist the \"truth\" is nonsensical. A scientific \"truth\" that refers to g is nonsensical if the Earth does not exist. Similarly, moral truths cannot exist if their subject, the human mind, did not exist unless some sort of Supreme Being created the moral truth, or it was created by the physical universe. Scientific \"truths\" are created by and are dependent on their subject, so it would follow that moral truths would be created by and are dependent on the human mind to exist. \n \n The only reason scientific \"truths\" are independent of humans is that they were not created by humans. A human cannot float, even if he or she genuinely does not believe gravity exists, yet a human can believe that cheating is morally correct. Humans did not create gravity or any other physical law, we have no dominion over them. Morals are created by us, thus it is mutable to our will.\n \n \n\n Indeed, the pragmatic use of axiomatic systems to establish truth-values has been a great leap forward in mathematics and logic. Interestingly this is a justification, one that says under such-and-such axioms, so-and-so theorum is necessarily true. Truth, by this account, is something inherent to systems of representation, rather than some property of its objects. The advantage is, as you have mentioned, it avoids the infinite regress problem of foundationalist truth determining schemes. I advocate treating morality like this, as largely coherent systems of objectively decidable moral facts.\n\n \n This is only true with analytic statements, which have universal definitions, ie the concept of \"niece\" is the daughter of a sibling. The concepts of \"cheating\" and \"wrong\" do not have universal definitions, the meanings are peculiar to both societies and individuals.\n \n \n\n Moral relativism tends to kill any constructive discussion of ethics between people, for one thing. It's hard to discuss what should be done when anybody's feelings on the matter are equally valid. I wouldn't do anything important where the opinon of an expert carries the same weight as some ignorant jackass. I wouldn't try to build an engine based on my feelings about mechanics, unless those feelings were anchored in long years of learning how engines actually work rather than how I feel that they work.\n\n \n I don't think that is a fair comparison, though.\n \n \n\n Moral relativism confuses indicative propositions with evocative propositions - and I really don't want to go around saying \"I don't like it when my computer doesn't seem to work.\" when I want to say: \"My computer should be working.\" Basically moral relativism faces all of the same problems that solipsism does, except on a much more important level since I want to know what I should do rather than what I feel like doing.\n\n \n Except that normative statements such as \"My computer should be working\" cannot be proven one way or the other. The computer is working exactly as it was designed, and it was not designed to turn on with whatever is preventing it from turning on. Whatever it \"should\" be doing is an opinion. What you are actually saying is that you don't like it when your computer doesn't do what you wish it to do.\n \n No, we don't speak on such terms, but that is because we don't normally think on those terms. We, as humans, have certain assumptions, which is why we have normative statements in the first place\n \n \n\n And to clear up a misunderstanding, I didn't state that moral relativism \"conflicts with the implication of normative statements\" so much as state that the position of moral relativism, that morality is subjective, conflicts with the objective or public use of normative statements. Ludwig Wittgenstein pointed out the absurdity of this in his 'private language argument'.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by \"objective or public use of normative statements\". From what I understand of language, the use of normative statements implies that the speaker believes a standard exists, that there is a way a computer \"ought\" to work, and this obviously conflicts with the stated position that no standard exists, that each computer is doing what it is designed to do even if it isn't \"working\". This is not an indication that an actual standard exists, however. Like I said, this seems to be a failure in the language itself to describe things rather than a failure of the philosophy itself.",

I'm not simply saying that I don't like it when my computer doesn't work like I want it to, although I could be using the phrase in that sense. I am saying that according to the rules by which computers work, and by the current physical state of my computer, it should be producing such-and-such outputs. \n \n My point is that normative statements merely rephrase indicative statements of conditionals in terms of predicate relations.

   "What scientific \"truths\" have bearerless names?\n Phlogiston, ether, vital spirits, etc. \n \nI am hardly an expert in this field, so I am not familiar with many of the terms used, but the Correspondance Theory seems a good representation of my view. Good thing there's a name for what I have, otherwise they wouldn't know how to treat me!\n That's why studying philosophy is handy, because whatever you or I think, someone else has thought it first. \n \nI'll rephrase what I said:\n g (in reference to Earth) is true iff it corresponds to the mass of Earth\n and\n g is false iff it does not correspond to any fact\n Yeah, that's the correspondance theory. \n \nI'm not sure if I phrased that correctly, so please let me know if this is incorrect. What is your specific objection to this? My usage or the theory itself? Using this, the scientific \"truth\" is false if it refers to a non-existent object.\n There's something called the under-determination problem, that notes that there may be multiple scientific theories to explain the same set phenomena - they may posit different sets of objects, more or less objects, and just about any variety of relations between them. This is a problem because 'objects' are really just a handy way of parsing sets of phenomena - it's useful to be able to represent things according to discrete logics. Scientific facts then, it seems, are not about objects but either about the systems that describe phenomena, or about the phenomena itself. If scientific facts are derived from the formal system used to represent them like mathematical facts, then they are work in the same manner as mathematical facts. If scientific facts are derived from the phenomena itself, then there needs to be some explanation for the connection between there being a fact in the world and a proposition in language that is independent of how we perceive that fact. Which is tricky, as study of the subject shows.\n \nThis seems to align more to the correspondence theory than the coherence theory. The coherence theory seems to maintain that truth is a function of belief, not of the truth-making system itself.\n In the coherence theory of truth the truth-making system is usually held to be composed of propositional beliefs. If your beliefs about mathematics cohere well to other mathematical beliefs so that they are 'logically true' of each other, then they are true. \n \nI'm not sure if this is an objection on your part or not. I have not forwarded the notion that truth is a function of observation, unless you are using it in a way I am not familiar.\n The problem, as I noted above, is that facts in the world are connected to representations of those facts through language. These facts are represented by our language, and these facts are known through our perceptions and our beliefs about those perceptions.\n \nWhat does an expert bring to a moral discussion that a jackass would not, assuming both knew the situation in its entirety?\n A bit like asking what a rocket-scientist brings to NASA that a jackass does not... An expert in ethics brings to ethics a large body of knowledge about the subject, such as different ways of evaluating the situation, experience in making those evaluations, and the ability to strongly justify her decision. Much like a rocket scientist knows lots about materials science, physics, chemistry, etc, has worked in aerospace, and can actually build working rockets. Not to say experts are infallible, but just to say that experts are less fallible than jackasses. \n \nWhether or not it \"should\" is opinion. Whether or not it \"will\" is not. I'm not trying to be argumentative, but I don't think using semantics is a valid criticism of moral relavitism.\n Not 'semantics' in terms of arguing over the meaning of words, but pointing out how they work in different senses or moods. I'm not saying that a indicative 'will' is synonymous with a normative 'should', although it is synonymous to indicative abuses of 'should', because obviously the meaning is different in that the former is a statement of material implication and the latter is a statement of a predicate relation.\n \n Basically they use the same components in different ways. The first to indicate states of the world, and the second to discuss the value of hypothetical states of the world. And mathematics and logic demonstrate that we can discuss the value of hypothetical states of any universe of objects. \n \n Speaking of which, I had a look at these dictionary entries, and I thought you might find them interesting, especially the parts about 'should' as intransitive auxiliary verb of 'should' and as intransitive auxiliary verb of 'shall' - talk about amphiboly!\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=should\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=will \n \nI meant we do not say \"My computer is not working in the manner I wish\" instead of \"My computer should work\" because we do not think in that way.\n I think that people think both ways. In fact I find it a constant source of discuss to determine whether a person is complaining about their actually computer not working, or not just working like they think it should. \n \nI read the section, but am not convinced this is a failing in the philosophy. Assumptions about the world have shaped our language, and moral relativism does not conform well to that assumption. In a similar way, optical illusions work to exploit the assumptions our brain makes about the way the world is supposed to be. It isn't a direct comparison, just an example of how innate assumptions do not conform well to things that run counter to them.\n Oh, I'm not saying that we don't have intuitions about things and that those intuitions aren't infallible (take Euclidian geometry for example). However, people have been having intuitions about relativism for years, and when formally examined those intuitions have typically been found wanting. Wittgenstein in particular is notable for putting paid to the idea that public things like languages, morality, etc, can be done privately or subjectively.\n \n This isn't a semantic argument in the sense that we're just arguing about meanings, but rather a semantic argument about the truth-value of moral propositions, and in the analytic tradition the problem usually boils down to logic.",
