There is no outcome which the GOD hypothesis cannot explain including contradictory ones. God could have made the world last Tuesday and we would not know it. Such a property of a hypothesis places that hypothesis beyond the reach of scientific proof or disproof. Or for that matter any kind of proof or disproof which is rational. All of geology all the fossil record, even the bible itself could well be simply GOD made deceptions or jokes, presumably we would be unable to tell given GODs powers over the universe.\n \n However working under the assumption that GOD is not deliberately and maliciously planting evidence or distorting the data and that following the physical evidence is a valid approach - then the hypothesis that the world was created 6000 years ago is fully falsified and by multiple independent lines of evidence. Heck we have climate records gong back much further than that based on isotope ratio work. We have frozen mammoths older than that. We have human remains older than that. We have animal remains older than that. We most certainly have geological formations older than that. And even the moon (which requires the earth) is older than that. The mountains I am near are something like 250 million years old for instance. Petroleum deposits are certainly older than 6000 years. The sun has been operating for more than 6000 years by all the available evidence. And the universe itself appears to be about 14 billion years old. Is any of this disproof of the hypothesis that GOD (a tri-omni being) made it all in 6 days about 6000 years ago - nope of course not. Like I said GOD could have made it last Tuesday so far as we can prove or disprove. Or this AM so far as that goes. Tri-omni is capable of literally anything you wish.",

   "Creationists and rational people share facts, but only rationalists are able to put them together in viable theory. \n\n \n \n You're not chemist99a - it's always interesting how atheists are often quick to answer for each other, yet creationists, at least on these forums seldom if ever do. I honestly wonder if that's because creationists are so heavily outnumbered here, or if there are other reasons. It doesn't square with the way creationists are constantly accused of blindly following dogma, while atheists claim to be so open and reasonable. Those who are \"open\" should have more difficulty representing each other than those who are blindly following one thing, it would seem to me. Oh well. \n \n Let's look at what \"rationalists\" are. From dictionary.com;\n \n \nRATIONALISM \n 1. the principle or habit of accepting reason as the supreme authority in matters of opinion, belief, or conduct. \n \n 2.Philosophy. \n a.the doctrine that reason alone is a source of knowledge and is independent of experience. \n b.(in the philosophies of Descartes, Spinoza, etc.) the doctrine that all knowledge is expressible in self-evident propositions or their consequences. \n \n 3.Theology. the doctrine that human reason, unaided by divine revelation, is an adequate or the sole guide to all attainable religious truth. \n\n \n We see that rationalists consider reason to be independent of experience, and independent of divine revelation. Experience tells us how people of past generations reacted to changes in human activity, and divine revelation addresses a REALITY that science draws a blank on - origins. By tossing those two things out, some rationalists seem to be able to put together a godless viable theory, and call it a fact. It's nice amusement for themselves, but it's not reality. \n \n \n \nNo dear... evolution is a fact. there are many theories about how it happened. \n\n \n It would depend on what the definition of evolution is this week. \n \n \n \nOf course theories aren't facts. But everything about science is a theory, except observable facts. Evolution is one of the many observable facts. We see it in operation. \n\n \n No dear, our lives are too short for us to observe it. \n \n \nWe have numerous theories of cosmology, a couple of theories of gravity, various theories of quantum mechanics, and a selection of theories about evolution of which Darwinian ones are only a subset.\n \n Science is about building theories, or models of the universe that are tested against the real universe.

Three posters have changed the subject, and gotten me into a largely unrelated discussion. No one has seriously taken issue with unkerpaulie, a non-Christian, for saying it.

   "Everyone's life has meaning for themselves. Christianity is about his life having a BIG meaning for everyone. If there is no original sin, and no importance in the cross, his sacrifice, his gift to all who accept it, his life can still have meaning to all in ways comparable to people like Americas founders, but not in the BIG way that the entire Bible teaches, and all organized western denominations claim.\n\n \n So even if Jesus never existed that does not change the doctrine of christians. What difference will it make to them if Jesus was entirely fictional? The doctrine remains and the BIG meaning also remains for those who adopt the doctrine and adhere to it. It is the DOCTRINE which carries the BIG MEANING not the historical Jesus who may or may not have had actual existense! And its the DOCTRINE of original sin, not the fact of it which carries meaning for the adherents of the idea. In other words the fact or fiction of Jesus matters not at all.",

Duh! \n \n \nI honestly wonder if that's because creationists are so heavily outnumbered here, or if there are other reasons. \n\n \n Out-thought.\n \n \nIt doesn't square with the way creationists are constantly accused of blindly following dogma, while atheists claim to be so open and reasonable.\n\n \n Must be difficult for believers to realise that given logic and certain premises, only a few answers are possible.\n \n \nThose who are \"open\" should have more difficulty representing each other than those who are blindly following one thing, it would seem to me. Oh well. \n\n \n Believers are so blind they don't even realise they are blindly following. Atheists, on the other hand, have to work it our for themselves.

Reason has to deal with experience, however. Divine revelation is not part of anyone's experence, however keen they may be to convince themselves it is.\n \n \nExperience tells us how people of past generations reacted to changes in human activity, and divine revelation addresses a REALITY that science draws a blank on - origins. By tossing those two things out, some rationalists seem to be able to put together a godless viable theory, and call it a fact. It's nice amusement for themselves, but it's not reality. \n\n \n Sorry, but you have given us no reason to suppose your version of god is a reality. It's just your version. I suppose you can amuse yourself by making up your god, but you really need more than that to convince rational thinkers.\n \n \nScience is increasingly about money and power, and opposing religion because it gets in the way.

Come to think of it WWII also fits that bill for me personally - I was not present.

Cabbages and Kings. Yes we learn about global warming and we learn that we do not know enough to unambiguously attribute a cause debate will continue in the community till its more highly clarified, but at the moment the bulk of the community believes that GW is at least partially due to mans actions. I anticipate that the minority view that what we are currently observing (ie actual global warming) will be rendered nearly extinct. Not that it will matter, because non-scientists are not particulary interested in such conclusions - they only want to act on their faith that their actions have nothing to do with it so that they can remain comfortable and unaffected.

Atheism is much much older than evolution as is not founded on Darwin or his successors. Its founded on empirical evidence and logic, however it is a BELIEF and is not subject to either proof or disproof. Science itself is agnostic. It makes no affirmations of either theology or its complement (atheism). My personal belief is that atheism is valid.

Science and evolution are all your faith has - conflicting paths of study do tend to send evolutionists into a panic. \n\n \n Panic? Do you think that if evolution vanished tomorrow as a viable theory that atheism would be impacted? How so? Atheism has a lot more going for it than Science (which in fact does not support either Atheism or Theism) or evolution (which is also agnostic not atheistic). Biologists would not discard evolution unless and until a more satisfactory theory was worked out. Noble prizes would be awarded, PhDs would be earned, new knowledge would be gained and good time would be had by all. Certainly not panic.

Unfortunately you are not seeing panic, you are merely observing the normal debate and shaking out which is applied to any scientific theory.

And they never seem to debate each other. \n \n \nActual scientists have to be agnostic about the issue since GOD cannot be proven NOT to exist, nor can GOD be proven to exist. \n\n \n Actual scientists like Richard Dawkins? His books are best sellers - books that attempt to use evolution to disprove God. \n \n \n \nNeither is the civil war. Still I think the documents and artifacts are convincing don't you? At least as to the likelyhood that there WAS a civil war? Of course I could be wrong and so could everyone else. Come to think of it WWII also fits that bill for me personally - I was not present. On the other hand when I step out of my house I see mountains that I think are about 250 million years old on an Earth which is about 4 billion plus years old embedded in a universe which is approximately 13-14 billion years old. I am sorry you cannot share that experience and limit yourself to only 6000 years or so. How limiting is your imagination. Oh yes nobody has experienced those 6000 years either! Are you sure the world was not created last Tuesday? I did experience last Tuesday unless GOD is messing with my mind! \n\n \n If you equate our knowledge of WW2 with our knowledge of what happened billions of years ago that's your business. If you see mountains and tell me that you see 250 million years of age with no faith involved, okay. I guarantee the fun I have with this rivals the fun you have with creationists. :)\n \n \n \nHow about those scriptures! As to their age they are NOT 4000 years old only about 3,000 at the most, and there are older holy works than what you have in the bible. How about the ancient Egyptian works of theology for which in some cases the originals exist? Does their age impact upon the truth of what is written within? \n\n \n Sources? \n \n \nActually no thats a bit of rhetorical flourish engaged in by Jefferson in order to incite the locals to rebel against their King who was far away and not terribly competent. The government of the US was in fact accomplished by the articles of confederation and later the US Constitution. I am not certain about the articles, but the constitution refers to the creator precisely zero times. \n\n \n So the Declaration was rhetorical flourish? Has this been recently discovered by evolution? \n \n \n \nYep for 30 plus years. \n\n \n That wasn't a question to you personally, or anyone personally. It was directed in general about science, to another poster. \n \n \nEven discovered a couple of new things and helped bring a few products to market by doing so. Great fun, great challenges. \n\n \n More of those products of evolutionary thought? \n \n \n \nCetainly, Science is not an authority on faith except in respect to possible genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might give rise to it. \n\n \n That's a big \"except\"!! Evolutionists can tell us all about those genetics and biochemical things that explain the \"disease\" of religion and what can be done about it can't they? Dawkins has done it - I'm sure there are others. \n \n \n \nAnd science is not an authority on GOD. But then again why would science choose to be - it would not be science then. \n\n \n Science is making itself an authority on how insignificant God is. The more they theorize about evolution, the less important God becomes. God is in their way!\n \n \n \n \nWe learn many things. Cabbages and Kings. Yes we learn about global warming and we learn that we do not know enough to unambiguously attribute a cause debate will continue in the community till its more highly clarified, but at the moment the bulk of the community believes that GW is at least partially due to mans actions. I anticipate that the minority view that what we are currently observing (ie actual global warming) will be rendered nearly extinct. Not that it will matter, because non-scientists are not particulary interested in such conclusions - they only want to act on their faith that their actions have nothing to do with it so that they can remain comfortable and unaffected. \n\n \n Non-scientists are just faithful sheep, aren't they? If only the U.S. founders were alive today, only scientists would be allowed to vote or hold office. If we can get rid of creationists, maybe we can get this changed. \n \n \nScience can only provide the best conclusions we can reach. If leaders do not act on them so be it.\n\n \n All scientists will someday be in agreement on global warming? How long do you think that will be? Entire books are being written on it - that don't agree with each other.",

   "Actually not! Especially the nude mice. And Corn, wheat, potatoes are just as impressive as any medical technology - they are what many of us live on! They all evolved and corn in particular in its modern form is the result of applying evolutionary theory and NDS to breeding increasingly more efficient and effective varieties. You can find a great deal about the genetics of corn and the breeding of disease resistant corn varieties on the net. I'll let you do the home work. As to wheat and evolution in a similar context look up the green revolution of the 1960s and study the development of the dwarf wheats. Enjoy. Oh yes it was not GOD but rather the Rockefeller Foundation, Norman Bourlaug, and his mentor E.C. Stakeman. And of course these days we are using evolutionary concepts to deploy GE corns while at the same time avoiding so far as possible some of the evolutionary consequences of such strains. Oh yes you should examine the development of multiline small grains as part of an integrated pest control strategy. That particular technology is rooted deep into the evolutionary war between hosts and pathogens. Enjoy.\n\n \n No links?

Human beings are stubborn entities and many of us will fight to defend our beliefs even when facts to the contrary begin to accumulate. All the atheists I know are human. Us scientist agnostics are as bad about that as any others, but we are trained to give our beliefs up when the evidence runs to much against our ideas. For example Fred Hoyle held tightly to the steady state theory of the universe until the evidence in support of th Big Bang model became overwhelmingly more convincing - and of course the BB itself may be overwhelmed in the future. Hoyle was about the last holdout though.\n\n \n I sure would like to know more about that training. Is it integrated into science classes, or is it a separate class?

Previously the ideas all invoked intelligence, or non-material causes. Just as organic chemistry did until Wohler. And of course to be sceintific only material causes can be invoked in a scientific theory.\n \n And once more with feeling - ATHEISM preceded Darwin and indeed preceded western science by centuries and centuries.

Perhaps the mega evanglists should fund some private research using a grants mechanism. Much of the research done in the US is in fact done privately in non-academic institutions. The DI for example is actively seeking research work to establish the scientific validity of ID. All it takes is money and dedication and certainly they have plenty of both.

   "Actually, a study of geology is often too great a challenge for a Creationist, because the scientific evidence completely refutes a literal interpretation of the biblical account. Here are the stories of some fundamentalist geologists who were forced by the evidence to change their minds:\n \n http://members.aol.com/dwise1/cre_ev/creationists.html\n \n One of the featured ex-Creationist geologists is Glenn R. Morton. The website opens the section on his story thus:\n \n \nGlenn R. Morton is a practicing petroleum geologist and a former young-earth creationist and writer of young-earth creationist articles (27 articles and notes published in the Creation Research Society Quarterly). Even though creation science ended up driving him to verge of becoming an atheist, he is a Christian whose attempts at a scientifically accurate harmonization are described on his web site, DMD Publishing Co.\n \n Morton's story was the first real indication I had that creation science destroys faith. At the 1986 International Conference on Creationism, after he delivered his paper critical of Flood Geology, John Morris of the Institute for Creation Research challenged him. Morton chopped Morris off at the ankles with two questions, the second of which was \"How old is the earth?\" To which Morris responded, \"If the earth is more than 10,000 years old then Scripture has no meaning.\" Morton then said that he had hired several geology graduates of Christian Heritage College [which formerly housed the ICR], and that all of them suffered severe crises of faith. They were utterly unprepared to face the geological facts every petroleum geologist deals with on a daily basis.\n \n What I did not know at the time was that Morton was himself fast approaching his own crisis of faith, because the hard facts of geology kept showing him that the teachings of creation science were utterly false, teachings that creation science had taught him had to be true if Christianity were to have any meaning. Out of that crisis of faith was born Morton's attempt at harmonization. \n\n \n Morton himself has a website devoted to his particular journey away from fundamentalist Creationism, together with that of several others here:\n \n http://home.entouch.net/dmd/person.htm\n \n Morton's own story in his own words is here:\n \n Why I left Young-earth Creationism--by Glenn Morton\n \n Fact is, if you are a geologist, it's pretty hard to stick to fundamentalist Christian beliefs about the book of Genesis, because none of them make any sense in the light of actual data. However, when people choose to put credulous religious belief ahead of science, no amount of data in the world will ever convince them they are wrong.\n \n Marc strikes me as one of these people... there is no amount of evidence you could possibly put together that would shake his faith. This is the antithesis of science.",

Precisely what new facts would you like to put on the table? \n\n \n I would like to see science put an amount of effort comparable to many other things it does, to the study of the likelihood of a planet going around a star billions of times, without veering off course.

Somebody told me to watch a VHS tape that proved it false, that analyzed the documentation of those moon trips, with todays technology and a critical eye. My mind was made up not to believe it as I started watching, but when it was done I knew - it was all a scientific con game. When science has the money, it can make us believe anything it wants. I must admit, even in 1969 I was wondering why the spacemen weren't jumping 25 feet off the ground there, since gravity was supposed to be 1/6 of the earths. They would jump about 3 feet, hang there a little, (slowed down tape) and settle back down. The tape showed no star canopy from the moon. (can't see stars when there's no air, according to NASA) Also can't reproduce a perfect star canopy on a movie set, can we NASA? The shadows were a big part of the analogy. They couldn't reproduce one light source with the distance away as the sun. The shadows clearly showed it. \n \n Lost a lot of my faith in science that day.

   "It does not so far as I know but faith is given absolute priority in various places so facts are not the issue are they. After all if the evidence indicates a very ancient earth then thats just a temptation to test ones faith is it not? \n\n \n Yes, its a case of man thinking himself more capable than he is. If he's the highest possible form of intelligence, as atheism believes, then it makes sense that atheists are going to believe man to be more capable of something than a Christian would. \n \n Isn't it possible, with radiometric dating, that the rocks and the various other material geologists date are very old, while existing long before the earth actually settled into its orbit around the sun? (or was placed there by God) Couldn't a young earth, in its present form, be made up of much older material? Or is this something else that will never be studied, because temperatures and water similar to today would have had to exist for billions of years for evolution to work? A very old earth, young in its relationship with the sun, would very much destroy evolution. \n \n \n \n \nNope, I do not convert nor am I convertable. Conversion is not my thing if people hold mistaken ideas thats their problem. I might argue with them but its no foul if they disagree. \n\n \n Well that's the way I am too, at least we can agree on that. \n \n \n \nNope he produced the first credible scientific description of a process which could lead to the observed diversity of living organisms. Previously the ideas all invoked intelligence, or non-material causes. Just as organic chemistry did until Wohler. And of course to be sceintific only material causes can be invoked in a scientific theory.\n \n And once more with feeling - ATHEISM preceded Darwin and indeed preceded western science by centuries and centuries. \n\n \n Then for centuries and centuries, what did atheists do to support their beliefs with nothing but intelligence or non material causes? An \"I-don't-know but-we'll-find-it-someday\" attitude? Waiting for someone like Darwin, waving money around? \n \n \nDarwin did not invent it, Darwin did not advocate it. Darwin set out to explain how species might evolve a biological problem rather than a problem in theology or subjective belief. \n\n \n \"Did not advocate it\"? An outline of his life shows he did. He was bitter about the loss of his daughter. He wanted to make God go away. \n \n \n \n \nSorry but science is agnostic no matter what forum it finds itself in. Its the nature of the beast. You think it atheistic simply because its not supportive of your beliefs in GOD. I have met others who think science is theistic because it does not claim to falsify the existense of GOD. Truth is that science when asked about GOD has to say \"I don't know\" which is the default hypothesis. To answer otherwise as a scientist is not logical. \n\n \n You said this in post #99; \"Science is not an authority on faith except in respect to possible genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might give rise to it.\"\n \n Now lets pull something else of yours up from below, in this post, when I asked who should define science; \"Practioners of the noble art and craft of doing science - who else?\"\n \n So it's okay for those who practice science to determine whether or not it is science for them to study genetic and biochemical mechanisms that cause faith in someones brain? They can do that, because science is what they do, and they can define it that way? \n \n NOW, founders and students of Intelligent Design are practioners of the noble art and craft of searching for EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN NATURE. Those practioners declare that art and craft is not religious, but they aren't allowed to do that!  The practioners of science inform them that they ARE RELIGIOUS! The practioners of ID do not get to define themselves! \n \n Resolved; Science is NOT neutral, socially or in politics. \n \n Would you like to take the negative in a formal debate? emoticon_xangel When you claim science says \"I don't know\" you're not being a very good rationalist. You're disregarding FACTS. I'd like to show them to you in a structured debate. You'd be taking a politically correct negative - you can do it!! But I'll make my points. :)\n \n \n \n \nDawkins is operating outside the limits of science if and when he claims to be able to state that GOD does not exist. At best he could answer that he does not (as a scientist) know. He like everyone else is perfectly free to express his personal belief. I for example personally believe that atheisim is valid, but I do not state that within a scientific contest - its a personal belief.\n\n \n We'll discuss Dawkins in the formal debate. \n \n \n \nWhat a chuckle. Atheism is a belief not an organization like say a megachurch which preaches against any rational belief which conflicts with the operators personal preferences. And often the ACLU defends Annon-scientific conflicts - the ACLU is interested in civil liberties and law neither one of which are scientific in nature. As to the American Atheists website - well probably not such a thing is easily funded out of small change these days. As to the \"Academic Bill or Rights\" do you have a copy of that document somewhere? And why do you think it should be established anywhere at all? \n\n \n We'll discuss finances in the formal debate. \n \n The Academic Bill of Rights discussion has been going on, though not many here have had much to say on it. \n \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10187\n \n \n \nBillions of dollars change hands every day big deal. And if you think that there never being any satisfactory theories is a good idea then you are the enemy of the human enterprise. And if you intend to enforce unsatisfactory theories such as creationism through the courts - well you might do it, but you will eventually be most unhappy with the outcome. \n\n \n What theory deemed \"satisfactory\" vs. \"unsatisfactory\" should not be determined by one special interest, in a free society. \n \n \n \nFirst of all you have to have such evidence and then it has to be evaluated carefully. So far as I can see no credible evidence supporting a 6000 year old earth has yet emerged nor has credible evidence which would falsify the current hypothesis. But yes you are correct if the earth is only 6000 years old then Darwinian evolution would be down the tubes. Now show that the earth is only 6000 years old and ya got it made. \n\n \n The Discovery Institute has a chance of doing just that. But the resourses of time and money of their enemies is quite a challange for them to overcome. It is not hard to tell the difference between an honest shakedown vs. an unleashing of attack dogs. \n \n \n \nAn ancient earth is necessary. An earth which does not change for billions of years is NOT necessary, environmental variation is important to evolution in fact. As to mathematically impossible - well if you play the lottery for a billion years something is likely to turn up in your favor! And scientists do not fear a young earth, they just have confidence that its a failed hypothesis and that the current estimates are the best fit to the available observations. If you have credible new data to the contrary then put it on the table. You could change the world and win fame and fortune after all.\n\n \n NASA isn't worried about moon landing evaluations either. No one can match their war chest. The astronauts have all slipped into oblivion, haven't they? I don't know if those who made that tape I watched are still alive or not, but I'm sure they stopped sleeping with their windows open.

They can do that, because science is what they do, and they can define it that way?\n\n \n Well lets ask this. Would you have scientists determine what is and is not GOD? The community of practitioners of a field so far as I know are always the people who define what that field is and how its practiced. Lawyers define what the practice of law IS, physicians, plumbers, gardners, and a host of others. WHO else would be sufficiently acquainted with a field than the practitioners????????\n \n And provided that the genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might lead to religion are accessible to empirical experimentation and investigation they are fair game for science and scientists. Any material process which is accessible is grist for the mill of science. Would you somehow restrict the scope of scientific investigation to avoid any possible study of such things? On what basis might I ask? That man was not meant to know? Well if we were not meant to know, then presumably any such studies would fail. No harm in giving it a go is there?\n \n \nNOW, founders and students of Intelligent Design are practioners of the noble art and craft of searching for EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN NATURE.

The practioners of ID do not get to define themselves!\n\n \n Sure they do and they have done exactly that. But so far as empirical science their efforts are a bust. Of course that could change tomorrow and when they publish some evidence which actually is scientifically supportive of their hypothesis then I will be glad to study their materials, methods, and conclusions. As to not being religious - well the major proponents have all indicated that they consider the \"intelligent designer\" to be their personally concieved GOD. Given that they are religious and ID is religious. And the courts have after reviewing the relationships and connections declared ID to be religious. On the other hand they have as much right as anyone else to carry out their own empirical investigations and compete in the universe of competing ideas. I do not think they will achieve much , but they are free to compete. Oh yes - we all define ourselves please note!\n \n \nResolved; Science is NOT neutral, socially or in politics. \n\n \n Its obvious that any enterprise performed by humans will not be unbiased. Scientific conclusions are necessarily biased and non-neutral. For example a physics PhD would not be neutral if asked whether weight was the determinant of how long it takes an object to fall to the ground from the top of a tower. He will likely tell you that objects as diverse as a grape and a lead ball will hit the ground at about the same time even though the two objects have very different weights. That of course is discriminatory against the theories which hold otherwise, but it cannot be helped. How could that scientist be neutral in a society which holds as a general rule that the heavier object falls fastest? He cannot if he wishes to maintain his scientific integrity.",

The technical term is telling a lie.\n \n In summary Science and scientists cannot do science and remain neutral on matters of social and political debate.

On the other hand if you know virtually nothing of the tools and techniques by which someone else reached a conclusion after expending perhaps the bulk of his life on it any rational person is likely ,to weigh your determination rather lightly. And given the relatively low social status of scientists and the lack of interest by most scientists in who believes what except for those they consider serious students of the issue, its not scientists who make such determinations in general. Take DOVER for instance, the scientists all appeared only as witnesses, told the truth as they understood it, and then the judge sorted it all out on a social-political foundation. The trial even though not favorable to the teaching of creationism in the public schools certainly did not force any particular theory on creationism advocates. The issue was the religious nature of creationism/ID and whether teaching a religious concept as if its science violates the constitutional prohibition on the state offering statuatory support to a specific religion! Plus of course whats taught in the public schools is not the practice of science, its the current (well not current but delayed) consensus of the scientific community as to the most highly supported scientific theories.

   "The same way that pre-biblical humans came to hold religious viewpoints, Evolution did not lead to atheism. Its fairly easy to take the intellectual stance that there are no GODs. Have you ever seen one? Do you believe your senses? Are those senses and your reason the way you survive and deal sucessfuly with the world around you? Is the idea of a GOD necessary to explain the world, or is it more likely that you do not know it all yet but can learn over time? Logic and reason are very old human capabilities. We invented \"GOD\" in the same way that engineers invented Murphy! As a placeholder for things about which we are ignorant at a given point in time. Much like the mapmakers of old -not having complete knowledge of the earths geography- put in \"here there be monsters\" and as knowledge accumulated took those signs down and replaced them with the best information they had.\n\n \n It may be easy to take the intellectual stance that there is no God when you're young, but it seems to me it would get harder and harder the older you get. There's so much order and complexity in the very small part of the universe that we've been able to observe, and yet this one little world we live on exibits so much more of it than any we can observe anywhere else.

Mans time here is going by lightening fast, by the way. There are roughly 6 billion people on the planet now, there were only about 3 billion 52 short years ago when I was born.

   "Well lets ask this. Would you have scientists determine what is and is not GOD? \n\n \n They are politically attempting to determine what is not God at the present. \n \n \n \n \nThe community of practitioners of a field so far as I know are always the people who define what that field is and how its practiced. Lawyers define what the practice of law IS, physicians, plumbers, gardners, and a host of others. WHO else would be sufficiently acquainted with a field than the practitioners????????\n \n And provided that the genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might lead to religion are accessible to empirical experimentation and investigation they are fair game for science and scientists. \n\n \n No they're not, they're called ID and they're blocked by the courts, from public funding and from public education. Separation of church and state. So that atheism and state can continue their loving relationship. \n \n \nAny material process which is accessible is grist for the mill of science. Would you somehow restrict the scope of scientific investigation to avoid any possible study of such things? On what basis might I ask? That man was not meant to know? Well if we were not meant to know, then presumably any such studies would fail. No harm in giving it a go is there? \n\n \n ANY material process would include evidence of design. Not the identity of the designer, just evidence of design. When a large part of the material process is evidence against design, for social and political gain, there is a double standard. \n \n \n \nSure they do and they have done exactly that. But so far as empirical science their efforts are a bust. \n \n \n There has also been a major bust in evolution. The recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life. Darwin knew nothing about them. Chances of them arising by chance decreases exponentially. A William Dembski analogy shows it very well. I don't remember what he was applying it to, but I've posted it at these forums before, don't remember exactly where. I remember the basics. A combination lock with a left-right-left combination and a 1 to 39 numbered dial has a one in 64,000 probability of being opened by chance. (40x40x40) That could be the equivalent of mice spontaniously generating from dirty hay, as was believed by some in Darwins day. A somewhat more complicated combination would be turned in 5 directions, left-right-left-right-left, with a 1 to 99 numbered dial. When we multiply 100x100x100x100x100, we don't get 64,000 any more, we get 10 BILLION. It's a good analogy - it shows that what Darwin believed happened by chance and what todays atheists believe happened by chance are not even remotely comparable. \n \n \nOf course that could change tomorrow and when they publish some evidence which actually is scientifically supportive of their hypothesis then I will be glad to study their materials, methods, and conclusions. As to not being religious - well the major proponents have all indicated that they consider the \"intelligent designer\" to be their personally concieved GOD. Given that they are religious and ID is religious. \n\n \n What is the difference between proponents of ID admitting they are religious, as opposed to most biologists today who admit they are atheist? Why is one trusted and the other not? A double standard. \n \n \n \nAnd the courts have after reviewing the relationships and connections declared ID to be religious. On the other hand they have as much right as anyone else to carry out their own empirical investigations and compete in the universe of competing ideas. I do not think they will achieve much , but they are free to compete. Oh yes - we all define ourselves please note! \n\n \n Without public money and future generations minds, I'm sure you're right about what they'll achieve. If they achieve something, heavily funded atheist attack dogs combined with indoctrination of students in schools should void it out very well. \n \n \nIts obvious that any enterprise performed by humans will not be unbiased. Scientific conclusions are necessarily biased and non-neutral. For example a physics PhD would not be neutral if asked whether weight was the determinant of how long it takes an object to fall to the ground from the top of a tower. He will likely tell you that objects as diverse as a grape and a lead ball will hit the ground at about the same time even though the two objects have very different weights. That of course is discriminatory against the theories which hold otherwise, but it cannot be helped. How could that scientist be neutral in a society which holds as a general rule that the heavier object falls fastest? He cannot if he wishes to maintain his scientific integrity.\n\n \n Apples and oranges. That kind of non-neutrality does not have social and political implications.",

   "By no means since I agree that science (or at least scientists) are not neutral. They tend to call em as they see em and that cannot be neutral \n\n \n In a society such as the U.S. they should stop short of that. \n \n \nAnd when one does not know then the ONLY rational response is \"I don't know\". When its impossible to test a hypothesis the only answer is \"I don't know, and I cannot know\". \"I don't know\" is in fact the starting point for every major scientific investigation. If one knew there is no need to spend the time and effort involved in doing the science. No \"good\" rationalist would reply \"Sure I know the answer to that\" when he does not. The technical term is telling a lie. \n\n \n I agree, Richard Dawkins writes books full of lies. Or are they just his personal opinion, so that makes them allright? Is it allright when college professors make his books (and others like them) required reading for a science course? \n \n \nIn summary Science and scientists cannot do science and remain neutral on matters of social and political debate. Its literally impossible since the science will almost certainly support one side of such debates more than another. \n\n \n The science won't, but the human scientists will. There is a big difference. \n \n \nScientists should be truthful you know thats one of the ideals of the field.\n\n \n They're not always truthful with the \"I don't know\" part.

I do enjoy tangling with you - you put your thoughts in print very well, and keep the insults down. I just wish I had more time. I can make time for another formal debate though.

   "Without public money and future generations minds, I'm sure you're right about what they'll achieve. \n\n \n You still don't get it do you. One does not get either public money or to teach future researchers a theory unless and until one has good empirical research to support that hypothesis and reject most if not all the alternatives. First you develop a substantiated hypothesis and ONLY then can you expect either public money OR to teach it to young minds. The geocentric model of the solar system was what was taught for centuries UNTIL the heliocentric model became the clear winner with regard to evidence and logic. THEN and only then was the heliocentric model taught in the schools and universities. And perhaps you recall that not only was public funding denied to the heliocentric researchers the church actually burned one of them at the stake and silenced another for many years. Have you noticed storm troopers entering the offices of DI to shut them down - nope you have not. Do you expect to? Nope.\n \n The DI reseach program will achieve whatever it achieves, nobody is intefering with them and its a free country. They can publish their results through many channels. And if they scientific community finds their evidence convincing then it may be eventually taught as science. So far of course there is no such evidence.",

   "I agree, Richard Dawkins writes books full of lies. Or are they just his personal opinion, so that makes them allright? Is it allright when college professors make his books (and others like them) required reading for a science course?\n\n \n Dawkins is like yourself a free agent so far as his opinions go. Nowhere that I know of has he claimed to have a scientific falsification of the GOD hypothesis. Its clear to all concerned that he is expressing his opinion - which is what he is entitled to do as a person. He bases his opinion upon what he knows of science and his opinion is that the GOD hypothesis is most most unlikely. That happens to be my opinion also and I to do not claim to have a scientific falsification of the GOD hypothesis. In principle it cannot be falsified scientifically and I do not know it to be false. But I do judge it to be minimally likely.\n \n In summary Science and scientists cannot do science and remain neutral on matters of social and political debate. Its literally impossible since the science will almost certainly support one side of such debates more than another.\n \n \nThe science won't, but the human scientists will. There is a big difference.\n\n \n Nope in any issue where a scientific conclusion (and by that I mean a formal conclusion) can be reached its very unlikely that that conclusion will support every social-political viewpoint equally. Thus such a conclusion cannot be neutral even though it may be (and should be) scientifically objective. As the courtroom formulation goes - \"To a near scientific certainty these data mean that.......\"\n \n \n Scientists should be truthful you know thats one of the ideals of the field.\n \n \nThey're not always truthful with the \"I don't know\" part.

Science need not be neutral or \"balanced\" {whatever balanced means after the assault of FOX news on the word} it should be objective and self critical. I will add that I have earned a fair amount of my retirement fund by pointing out non-objectivity and non-self-critical elements of prosecution forensic chemists testimony in varous courtrooms.

   "Actually it gets easier and easier as one accumulates more empirical knowledge. The probability of the GOD hypothesis being true shrinks and shrinks and shrinks. Sufficiently so that one has to BELIEVE that its actually zero - although one cannot prove that as a scientific hypothesis. \n\n \n While one may accumulate slightly more empirical knowledge, he also accumulates more knowledge in other things. Science is not the only form of knowledge. (hmmm, maybe I should put that in my sig - I say it all the time and no one seems to notice) As one gets older, his own mortality and inperfection gets more and more clear. He watches children grow, goes to more funerals. Friendships, daily activities, priorities, they all can change. King Solomon, who wrote the book of Proverbs, was a very wise man. I believe older people have an easier time understanding what he wrote than do younger people.\n \n \n \n \nNice try but that implies that you have an actual way of measuring complexity which you clearly do not. \n\n \n It can be compared. Nothing we see through a telescope comes close to matching the complexity of.....computers. Or something much more complex than computers - the human body. \n \n \nDo you really think that the earth is more complex than the galaxy, or the local group, or the non-earth component of the entire universel? Its a most insane assumption. \n\n \n I think so. What do we see but dead rocks and energy through our telescopes? There's nothing out there complex enough to come here and say hello to us. \n \n \n \n \nIts also easy to believe that we should have invaded Iraq and that we should stay there forever. \n\n \n It's real easy to believe we should have invaded Iraq. I'm glad Saddam Hussein is dead. If only we'd invaded Germany in 1940, millions of people wouldn't have been killed. \n \n \n \nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. For all either of us know the human population could start dropping and go to 100 million or so before stabilizing. And yes things are going to happen - thats what time is for to keep everything from happening at once. \n\n \n I'm just trying to show an evolutionist the difference between the fast reality we can obviously see, vs. the billions of years ideology of evolution that we can't see. Logic tells me they don't both happen in the same natural environment. \n \n \nIf indeed you need GOD to explain the world to you, then you are woefully lacking in both vision and imagination. \n\n \n I plead guilty as charged - I don't have the imagination of an atheist. \n \n \n \nWell you are not an atheist and I am. I by no means believe as you describe. Indeed as a scientist I understand and know that the ancients had economies, trade with each other, and even pretty decent civil engineering. Your projections about what I as an atheist believe are totally off base from what I DO think. \n\n \n Well okay that's fine. As you get older, doesn't it get a little more perplexing when trying to describe how \"smart\" someone is? Very smart people are Christians - very simple people are Christians. Very smart people are atheists - very simple people are atheists. Some very simple people lead long, happy, productive lives, while some very smart people OD on recreational drugs in their twenties, or go bankrupt and kill themselves. The Bible relates to these things, does evolution? \n \n \nAgain you are not and expecting EVERYBODY to understand money management is just plain insane esp in view of the abundant empirical evidence to the contrary. And why would you think that human nature would change much. The romans had the gladatorial contests, we have Monday night football and pro wrestling. Bread and circuses are ever popular. \n\n \n If we would utilize Biblical principes with all the communications capabilities that we have, with the labor saving devices we have, the toys many of us have to play with, we could all work one day a week and live like Kings. Increasing laziness and a decrease in human decency outlined in the Bible keep us working more hours than ever. (the ever shrinking number of us not on the public dole, that is)\n \n \n \nWell lets see the data. What proportion of ancient Romans who carried credit cards were in arrears? What proportion had subprime loans outstanding? How many had 401Ks and how many handled their stock investments online? And I would like you to provide a specific reference in the holy texts of Christian doctrine which make the prediction that money management skills will devolve and that treatment of humans will devolve. By the way do you have data on the slave counts in ancient Rome and those in say Cleveland today? Would you like to count Roman crucifixions against legal execution rates today? Would you provide a good count of the number of Christians lit afire on the White House lawn compared to those in Neros Garden? \n\n \n You're not making good comparisons. It would be better to compare Romans citizens attitudes during its buildup, its glory days, to its citizens attitudes shortly before its fall. Another good comparison would be morals and attitude in the U.S. 100 years ago vs its morals and attitudes today. Or its moral attitudes in the 60s compared to today. I was alive in the 60s. There was no MTV. \n \n \nTo my eyes you are suffering from a strong positive bias toward conditions in past history which of course you did not observe or experience. Do you think the 1 st century after christ was a golden age or something? If so why? Or do you think the 14'th century in England was a golden age?\n\n \n You do partly have me there, I tend to nostalgize the past more than I should, and I'm glad I didn't live in the 14th century, or the 1930's for that matter. But modern technology should advance us more than it does. For just about every step forward, we take one step back it seems. Goes with Biblical predictions more than it does with evolution \"logic\".",

In any case I suspect things might have worked out rather less in our favor if we had started as early as say June 1940.

   "Please be specific as to what discoveries about what species you are referring to. I can hardly evaluate a nonspecific argument like you attempted there. \n\n \n You're a chemist and you have to ask me that? Okay, I'll try to present it in laymans terms so that you can understand. :p \n \n Up until the 1950's, the 'light' microscope could only reach down to one tenth the size of a bacterial cell. In the 50's, the new 'electron' microscope could magnify an object 500,000 times. Many new subcellular structures were discovered! The simple cell suddenly became immensely complicated. Here's an outline of it from Behe;\n \n \n The microscopes of the 18th and 19th centuries showed that the growth was very small, apparantly living cells. So it seemed reasonable that simple living organisms could arise spontaneously from liquids. \n \n The key to persuading people was the portrayal of cells being simple. One of the chief advocates of the theory of spontaneous generation during the middle of the 19th century was Ernst Haeckel, a great admirer of Dawkins and an eager popularizer of Darwin theory. From the limited view of cells that microscopes provided, Haeckel believed that the cell was a \"simple lump of albuminous combination of carbon\", not much different from a piece of microscopic jello. So it seemed to Haeckel that such simple life, with no internal organs, could be produced easily from inanimate material. Now of course, we know better. \n\n \n link\n \n To keep it basic, I could have been referring to the bacterial flagellum, and the most recent discoveries of DNA. \n \n Do you think it violates separation of church and state to require students in public science classes to read \"Darwins Black Box\", while no violation happens when students are required to read \"The Blind Watchmaker\"? \n \n \n \nYes one would think that the probability of a complex lifeform arising by chance would be smaller than the probability of a simpler lifeform arising by chance. But as I recall Dumbskis analysis the rate of probability change is factorial rather than exponential. \n\n \n Please try not to go only by Dembski. Go by your own knowledge of cells, as opposed to the complete lack of knowledge of them by Darwin and all his helpers. Can you put your atheism aside for just a moment? No, you can't. Neither can any scientist. We're imperfect humans. \n \n \n \nWell I can help you since I have read Dembskis stuff. His analysis does not hold up because the individual steps in the evolutionary process are NOT independent events. Nor does he consider the mutliple paths to a functional protein (organ, appendage etc) which exist in nature. \n\n \n If they're not independent, if they have to work together and be in order, wouldn't they be even more improbable? \n \n \nFrankly his probability analysis is a joke among professionals in statistics and probability and his analyis (an argument from improbability) is both flawed mathematically and philosophically. I have refuted Dr D previously in considerable depth. I won't get into it here its just too long. Among other things he ignores the fact that probability analyses are not applicable after the improbable event has in fact occurred. Its a long argument not suitable for a quick explanation. But basically Dr D is wrong.\n\n \n How about Dawkins probability analysis in his conclusions? Are they not equal \"jokes\" since you're always telling me that science is always saying \"I don't know\"? Is Dr. Dawkins equally wrong? Or do \"jokes\" generally arise from worldviews, and the source of paychecks?\n \n An \"argument from improbability\" is actually a very logical argument. Sometimes I wonder if all these \"collegiate fallacy lists\" weren't inspired by a desperate attempt to establish the \"argument from improbability\" as something to be quickly disregarded, to protect evolution from question, as more and more complexity in biology is discovered.",

I just remembered another good part - in one freeze frame, there was a soft drink bottle on the lunar surface!! Apparantly they weren't the first ones there!! No special holes in the face plates for 60's style glass bottles!!\n \n Another thing that creates doubt about the moon landings is the time gone by - the seeming lack of interest over the last 28 years. There was a newpaper article about 5 years ago that I wish I'd kept, but didn't, probably because I remember what it said so clearly. The question was asked about future moon visits, and unfortunately if we go back it has to be done completely from scratch. It seems that ALL knowledge and records of it have been lost. Darn cleanin ladies!!!!!! emoticon_mad You'd think after all the millions of tax dollars spent a little better eye would have been kept out for them!\n \n \n \n \nHere's an experiment you can do in your own home.

Freeze frames showed the light shimmering off them hahahahahaha\n \n \n \n \nEver noticed how few stars are visible on a night when the moon is full? \n\n \n NO. Except for a small area around the moon, they are everywhere! \n \n \nI happen to be an amateur astrophotographer, and I know that if I want to take a picture of a starscape I have to crank the ISO up to 1600 and leave the shutter open for a couple of minutes, otherwise nothing will register. However, I can take a picture of the moon at low ISO in 1/500th second, a difference in brightness of about 480,000. It's impossible to expose both the moon and stars correctly in the same shot - I invite you to find a picture anywhere that contradicts this. Either the moon will be a white disc, or the stars will be invisible. Exposures based on the brightness of the moon's surface inevitably make the sky appear black. \n\n \n Photography has improved greatly since 1969. If they go back, maybe they'll be able to get some star canopy pictures. May be kind of improbable though. But that doesn't stop evolution!!\n \n \n \n \nNo marc, they didn't. Acquaint yourself with a concept known as 'perspective'. Also, the 'halo' effect sometimes mentioned is visible right here on earth. Go up in a light aircraft on a sunny day and watch the plane's shadow. As you fly higher and higher you'll notice a bright 'halo' appear around it. This happens because you can't see any shadows in that area: all shadows are hidden behind the objects casting them, be they buildings or blades of grass.\n\n \n \"Perspective\" is what it was all about. A huge, artifical light on a movie set can't duplicate a light that's actually 93 million miles away. If two planes are flying 50 feet away from each other, the shadows will be 50 feet away from each other on the ground, if it's actually the sun making the shadows. If it's an artificial light, they will not. \n \n At first glance the shadows from your link don't look as contrasted as what I saw in that tape. I'll have to check it out more carefully. \n \n Didn't notice a \"halo\" on the moon, just a pop bottle.",

There is nothing irreducibly complex about said flagellum nor does it support ID. The flagellum is evolved just like the other structures of the cell - its an aggregation of protein subunits coded for by genes. And such proteins have an ancestral linage. Indeed this has been in part recently elucidated by biochemists/geneticists/molecular biologists. Because the flagellar motor in particular is very interesting to biologists it has recieved INTENSE study. You may wish to read some of that literature. In the meantime you may wish to read some of the latest \"discoveries of DNA\". I offer this link to a recent study, mind you there are some claims here that remain controversial, but that will settle out as more people pile it on.\n \n \nScience 11 May 2007:\n Vol. 316. no. 5826, p. 799\n DOI: 10.1126/science.316.5826.799c\n \n Highlights of the recent literature\n The evolutionary origins of complex organs, which in their current state of assembly feature many distinct components that apparently have no function in isolation, have long been debated. Liu and Ochman have unraveled the history of the origins of bacterial flagella by using a phylogenetic profiling method applied across whole genome sequences to identify a set of 24 core genes in the common ancestor of bacteria. The members of this core set were probably derived from a single gene that had undergone a combination of successive duplication, loss, transfer, and diversification events. The evolution of the flagellar components apparently followed the present-day order of assembly, with the oldest proteins (the rotary motor) being those proximal to the bacterial inner membrane and the most recent (the filament monomers) being the most distal. Hence, the flagellum probably started life as a simple proton-driven transporter that evolved into a more elaborate secretory apparatus--of a sort still found in bacteria today in the form of the type III secretion system--and finally into the self-secretory motility organelle of modern species. -- CA\n\n \n And the abstract of the paper:\n \n \nElucidating the origins of complex biological structures has been\n one of the major challenges of evolutionary studies. The bacterial\n flagellum is a primary example of a complex apparatus whose\n origins and evolutionary history have proven difficult to reconstruct.\n The gene clusters encoding the components of the flagellum\n can include <50 genes, but these clusters vary greatly in their\n numbers and contents among bacterial phyla. To investigate how\n this diversity arose, we identified all homologs of all flagellar\n proteins encoded in the complete genome sequences of 41 flagellated\n species from 11 bacterial phyla. Based on the phylogenetic\n occurrence and histories of each of these proteins, we could\n distinguish an ancient core set of 24 structural genes that were\n present in the common ancestor to all Bacteria. Within a genome,\n many of these core genes show sequence similarity only to other\n flagellar core genes, indicating that they were derived from one\n another, and the relationships among these genes suggest the\n probable order in which the structural components of the bacterial\n flagellum arose. These results show that core components of the\n bacterial flagellum originated through the successive duplication\n and modification of a few, or perhaps even a single, precursor\n gene.\n\n \n The full text is available for your reading pleasure at PNAS link below.\n \n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0700266104v1",

Dawkins is profoundly atheist and supports no religion and criticizes all equally. If I were teaching biology at that level then Dawkins would not necessarily be my first choice, but its a pretty good inoculation against the argument from design. In later work I would much prefer to have the students read Paley since he made the best extant argument from design and is a much better writer than the current advocates of ID and he has the courage to speak to who the designer might be. Plus of course its a classic of English prose writing and argumentation - do the students good if it were to be studied side by side with Darwins work. But it would take the better part of a 6 week period to do it justice. Probably best done in college. If you want to play the arguments out in their detailed whole then the argument by Paley and its demolition by Darwin is very educational and is something most educated people should study.",

In 1662, Hooke gained appointment as Curator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society, and took responsibility for experiments performed at its meetings.\n \n In 1665 he published a book entitled Micrographia which contained a number of microscopic and telescopic observations, and some original observations in biology. Hooke coined the biological term cell, so called because his observations of plant cells reminded him of monks' cells which were called \"cellula.\" He is often credited with the discovery of the cell, although his microscope was very basic. Hooke's design was used by the Dutchman Anton van Leeuwenhoek, described as the father of microbiology.\n\n \n And by 1850 the knowledge of the cell was considerably advanced over Hookes. The following brief time line of discoveries in light microscopy indicates the history before and for sometime after Darwin.\n \n \n1655 Hooke uses a compound microscope to describe small pores in sections of cork he calls \"cells\".\n 1674 Leeuwenhoek reports his discovery of protozoa. He sees bacteria for the first time nine years later.\n 1833 Brown publishes his microscopic observations of orchids, clearly describing the cell nucleus.\n 1838 Schleiden and Schwann propose the cell theory, stating that the nucleated cell is the unit of structure and function in plants and animals.\n 1857 Kolliker describes mitrochondria in muscle cells.\n 1876 Abb\u00e9 analyzes the effects of diffraction on image formation in the microscope and shows how to optimize microscope design.\n 1879 Flemming describes with great clarity chromosome behavior during mitosis in animals.\n 1881 Retzius describes many animal tissues with a detail that has not been surpassed by any other light microscopist. During the next two decades, he, Cajal, and other histologists develop staining methods and lay the foundations of microscopic anatomy.\n 1882 Koch uses aniline dyes to stain microorganisms and identifies the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and cholera. In the following two decades, other bacteriologists, such as Klebs and Pasteur, identify the causative agents of many other diseases by examining stained preparations under the microscope.\n 1886 Zeiss makes a series of lenses, to the design of Abb\u00e9, that enable microscopists to resolve structures at the theoretical limits of visible light.\n 1898 Golgi first sees and describes the Golgi apparatus by staining cells with silver nitrate.\n\n \n Full time line at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.table.1721\n \n Interesting is it not.\n \n As to subcellular organelles the time line this gives a summary of sorts.\n \n \nElectron Microscopy and Subcellular Fractionation\n \n Mitochondria and the Golgi complex are at the limit of resolution by the light microscope; the visualization of smaller organelles had to wait for the development of electron microscopes. However, a parallel interest in taking cells apart and studying the nature of the separated components also yielded invaluable information; the existence of lysosomes was established before they were seen. Information as to the chemical nature and function of organelles was sought as early as 1934 by Bensley and Hoerr,26 who made a crude preparation of mitochondria. Claude in 1940-1946 used similar procedures with a crucial difference.27,28 He insisted on quantitative criteria, examining the total recovery of an enzyme or chemical constituent and its relative concentrations in the fractions he prepared by differential centrifugation, rather than preparing a single fraction. He also examined the size, shape and fine structure of the particulates in the separated fractions and used an isotonic medium for homogenisation. In 1948 Hogeboom, Schneider and Palade29 improved his methodology by using a Potter-Elvehjem homogeniser to achieve quantitative gentle breakage of liver cells and sucrose in place of saline. They were then able to show that most of Claude's \"large granules\" had the elongated shape of mitochondria and stained with Janus Green, a specific stain for this organelle.\n \n Enzymes such as cytochrome oxidase, which appeared mostly in the large granule fraction, were clearly mitochondrial. There were also enzymes such as glucose 6-phosphatase, which appeared primarily in the smaller \"microsomal\" fraction. However, the work of de Duve from 1949 onwards demonstrated the existence of a group of enzymes, which were sedimented in the large granule fraction only if relatively high speeds were used in its preparation. The large granule fraction could be separated into a heavy and a light fraction. The former contained the respiratory activity characteristic of mitochondria but the light fraction contained variegated hydrolases. These were only measurable when the preparation had been subjected to hypotonic media, detergents or other insults to membrane integrity. From these results, de Duve hypothesised the existence of organelles containing primarily hydrolases and named them lysosomes. 30\n \n Electron microscopy had meanwhile progressed to a generally available method of investigation. This necessitated the development of adequate fixing, staining, embedding and sectioning techniques as well as the development of the instruments themselves.31 In 1952, Palade published high resolution pictures of mitochondria.32 In 1954, Dalton and Felix (among others) published pictures of the Golgi complex,33 which showed that it contained cisternae and vesicles and stained with osmium tetroxide, as had the disputed structure seen by light microscopy. However, the electron microscope also revealed structures which the light microscope was completely unable to resolve. The varying forms but almost ubiquitous existence of the endoplasmic reticulum could be seen and shown to contribute largely to Claude's microsomal fraction. By a lucky chance, Porter, Claude and Fullam first saw the endoplasmic reticulum in whole tissue cells as a \"lace-like\" structure in 1945.34 As sectioning techniques improved over the next ten years, the endoplasmic reticulum had to be recognized in slices which were much smaller than the mesh size of the reticulum. The continuous nature of the meshes could only be demonstrated by tedious serial sectioning, although much more detailed structure could be observed and many different tissues examined to show the ubiquity of the organelle.35\n \n Lysosomes were identified with the pericanalicular dense bodies described by Rouiller in 1954 by examination of partially purified preparations and by the development of a method for acid phosphatase localisation at both light and electron microscopic levels.36 Peroxisomes were reported by electron microscopy as microbodies in liver and kidney at about the same time, although their identity with the bodies carrying non-latent uricase and other enzymes involved with hydrogen peroxide was only established in the early sixties.37top link\n Radiolabelling and the Dynamic Nature of Organelles\n \n In addition to the clearly recognizable organelles, the electron microscope showed that cells contained a multiplicity of vesicles; the components of the secretory and endocytic pathways. The dynamic nature of such vesicles and of most other organelles began to be revealed when, in 1967, Jamieson and Palade used radioactive tracers and electron microscopic autoradiography. 38 They showed that newly synthesized secretory proteins during, or shortly after, synthesis, crossed the rough (ribosome-studded) endoplasmic reticulum and then moved from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi region and thence to secretory granules. By 1975, Palade, if not every worker in the field, believed that movement of material through these organelles depended on vesicular traffic.39\n \n Appreciation of the endocytic system was more diffuse. Phagocytosis was observed as early as 1887, but the fact that endocytosis was of widespread occurrence in animal cells was recognized only in the mid 1950s by electron microscopy.35 Coated pits and vesicles were observed in oocytes as early as 1964,40 but the ability of coated pits to concentrate endocytic receptors before pinching off to form coated vesicles was only recognised in 1976.41 In 1973 Heuser and Reece42 suggested that plasma membrane components inserted during exocytosis in synapses might be recycled. Quantitative electron microscopic investigations in 1976 by Steinman, Brodie and Cohn43 showed that tissue culture cells internalized plasma membrane at a rate which greatly exceeded their biosynthetic capacity. Therefore, a mechanism had to exist whereby endocytosed membrane could be recycled to the plasma membrane. Only by the 1980's was it widely accepted that endocytosed vesicles fused with an intracellular organelle called the endosome from which recycling to the plasma membrane could occur and also delivery to lysosomes and the trans-Golgi network.44 By this stage there was also widespread recognition of the various vesicle traffic pathways involved in exocytosis, endocytosis, transcytosis and biogenesis of organelles\n\n \n Just in case you need to know the history of these things.\n \n And in case you never read it you should read the original report of DNA by Watson and Crick. Here it is in its beautiful totality complete with their famous understated conclusion.\n \n \nWatson and Crick's 1953 Nature paper proposing a double helix structure for DNA:\n \n \n \n A structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\n 2 April 1953\n MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS\n \n We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.). This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest.\n \n A structure for nucleic acid has already been proposed by Pauling and Corey (1). They kindly made their manuscript available to us in advance of publication. Their model consists of three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the fibre axis, and the bases on the outside. In our opinion, this structure is unsatisfactory for two reasons: (1) We believe that the material which gives the X-ray diagrams is the salt, not the free acid. Without the acidic hydrogen atoms it is not clear what forces would hold the structure together, especially as the negatively charged phosphates near the axis will repel each other. (2) Some of the van der Waals distances appear to be too small.\n \n Another three-chain structure has also been suggested by Fraser (in the press). In his model the phosphates are on the outside and the bases on the inside, linked together by hydrogen bonds. This structure as described is rather ill-defined, and for this reason we shall not comment on it.\n Figure 1\n \n This figure is purely diagrammatic. The two ribbons symbolize the\n two phophate-sugar chains, and the horizonal rods the pairs of\n bases holding the chains together. The vertical line marks the\n fibre axis.\n \n We wish to put forward a radically different structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid. This structure has two helical chains each coiled round the same axis (see diagram). We have made the usual chemical assumptions, namely, that each chain consists of phosphate diester groups joining \u00df-D-deoxyribofuranose residues with 3',5' linkages. The two chains (but not their bases) are related by a dyad perpendicular to the fibre axis. Both chains follow right- handed helices, but owing to the dyad the sequences of the atoms in the two chains run in opposite directions. Each chain loosely resembles Furberg's (2) model No. 1; that is, the bases are on the inside of the helix and the phosphates on the outside. The configuration of the sugar and the atoms near it is close to Furberg's 'standard configuration', the sugar being roughly perpendicular to the attached base. There is a residue on each every 3.4 A. in the z-direction. We have assumed an angle of 36\u00b0 between adjacent residues in the same chain, so that the structure repeats after 10 residues on each chain, that is, after 34 A. The distance of a phosphorus atom from the fibre axis is 10 A. As the phosphates are on the outside, cations have easy access to them.\n \n The structure is an open one, and its water content is rather high. At lower water contents we would expect the bases to tilt so that the structure could become more compact.\n \n The novel feature of the structure is the manner in which the two chains are held together by the purine and pyrimidine bases. The planes of the bases are perpendicular to the fibre axis. The are joined together in pairs, a single base from the other chain, so that the two lie side by side with identical z-co-ordinates. One of the pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine for bonding to occur. The hydrogen bonds are made as follows : purine position 1 to pyrimidine position 1 ; purine position 6 to pyrimidine position 6.\n \n If it is assumed that the bases only occur in the structure in the most plausible tautomeric forms (that is, with the keto rather than the enol configurations) it is found that only specific pairs of bases can bond together. These pairs are : adenine (purine) with thymine (pyrimidine), and guanine (purine) with cytosine (pyrimidine).\n \n In other words, if an adenine forms one member of a pair, on either chain, then on these assumptions the other member must be thymine ; similarly for guanine and cytosine. The sequence of bases on a single chain does not appear to be restricted in any way. However, if only specific pairs of bases can be formed, it follows that if the sequence of bases on one chain is given, then the sequence on the other chain is automatically determined.\n \n It has been found experimentally (3,4) that the ratio of the amounts of adenine to thymine, and the ration of guanine to cytosine, are always bery close to unity for deoxyribose nucleic acid.\n \n It is probably impossible to build this structure with a ribose sugar in place of the deoxyribose, as the extra oxygen atom would make too close a van der Waals contact. The previously published X-ray data (5,6) on deoxyribose nucleic acid are insufficient for a rigorous test of our structure. So far as we can tell, it is roughly compatible with the experimental data, but it must be regarded as unproved until it has been checked against more exact results. Some of these are given in the following communications. We were not aware of the details of the results presented there when we devised our structure, which rests mainly though not entirely on published experimental data and stereochemical arguments.\n \n It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\n \n Full details of the structure, including the conditions assumed in building it, together with a set of co-ordinates for the atoms, will be published elsewhere.\n \n We are much indebted to Dr. Jerry Donohue for constant advice and criticism, especially on interatomic distances. We have also been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College, London. One of us (J. D. W.) has been aided by a fellowship from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.\n \n J. D. WATSON F. H. C.

   "If they're not independent, if they have to work together and be in order, wouldn't they be even more improbable? \n\n \n Nope. Do not know anything about proabililty and statistics? I don't have the time and this is not the place to teach you. But consider this.\n \n I have a large number of pennies available and I wish to obtain the flipped sequence of HHTHT.\n \n If I simply flip coins five at a time till I get the sequence and the coins fall independently then all possible sequences are equally probable. \n \n Now lets make the process dependent. I toss five coins till I get a sequence with at least one correct hit in some position. My chance of NOT getting such a sequence on a given toss is (1/32!) and falls off quickly on sucessive tosses! In other words I likely get one position right on toss one, nearly cetainly by toss 2. I then take that sequence and duplicate it as many times as I wish. I then pick up all the coins in the incorrect positions and toss them 4 at a time till I get at least one more correct (1/16 chance of not getting it on the first toss!). I then repeat the process with smaller and smaller numbers of coins - 3,2,1 until I generate the desired sequence. You will have to trust me that the total tosses required to reach the desired sequnce is considerably different when one starts each attempt with a partial solution rather than starting from scratch - and evolution DOES NOT start from scratch. It holds on to prior results and builds upon them. It does not start from a blank slate.\n \n And while I am at it please understand the the probability analyses ususally employed by IDers do not take into account the fact that MORE THAN ONE protein sequence will be functional. How many we don't know but its a lot more than one. Many regions of enzymes for example can be altered greatly and not materially alter the function. The IDers make the unjustified assumption that only one sequence will serve the function while it may be hundreds of thousands of variants will do so. Very convenient not to mention that little point is it not.",

   "How about Dawkins probability analysis in his conclusions? Are they not equal \"jokes\" since you're always telling me that science is always saying \"I don't know\"? Is Dr. Dawkins equally wrong? Or do \"jokes\" generally arise from worldviews, and the source of paychecks?\n \n\n \n Science is not required to say \"I don't know\" when its able to reach a conclusion based on hypothesis testing. Dawkins is allowed to claim he knows some things. \n \n \nAn \"argument from improbability\" is actually a very logical argument.\n \n \n Its logical alright as long as the assumptions are valid, and in the ID analysis they are usually not. Logic alone cannot assure a valid result relative to reality. The premise of independence of events for example is invalid, the premise (often unstated but implied) that only one sequence of AAs can fulfill a given function is flawed, and the premise that the highly improbable is impossible is also flawed. In addition the whole process may be invalidated by the fact that probability only really applies to contingent events - events which have yet to occurr. If an event has occurred its current probability is exactly 1.0 regardless of what its probability may have been prior to its occurrence. So in principle the actual probability of a given protein which already exists existing is 1.0 not virtually zero. For example the contingent probabilty of you existing is so close to zero as to not bear thinking about - yet there you are you exist so your probability is 1.0. Likewise for the universe as a whole I might add.\n \n \nSometimes I wonder if all these \"collegiate fallacy lists\" weren't inspired by a desperate attempt to establish the \"argument from improbability\" as something to be quickly disregarded, to protect evolution from question, as more and more complexity in biology is discovered.\n\n \n Most likely not I would say, what would be the need. And to understand complexity in biology and evolution as to its origins I urge you and anyone else interested to read the Adami paper. http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/97/9/4463",

   "If atheist theories like abiogenesis, Tiktaalik Roseae, or similar claim that they don't represent an atheist point of view and were hauled into court and disected like ID was, do you think the verdict would have been similar? If not, why not?\n\n \n As I have pointed out previously using biblical sources both the bible and biologists support abiogenesis. The only difference is whether GOD made living organisms from non-living matter or whether that phase transition is inherent in the way matter behaves. Both Christians and Scientists believe in abiogenesis.

   "If only it were a perfect world. I would agree with you if \"science\" didn't get so political when it sought to silence the concept of ID. It makes its one sided applications so noticeable, and in a free country, subject to scrutiny. Many in science don't like it, and as we can see, many on 4forums don't like it. Too bad.\n\n \n The arena in which the IDers chose to take on the evolutionists was the courts. IDs core leaders are themselves lawyers, they understood what they were getting into. Courtrooms are not scientific in their nature, indeed they cannot be as a general rule. That I think is why DI chose the court arena instead of the scientific one to pursue their own political aims. Why did they do this? Because scientifically they stand no chance at all of making their arguments stick. They stand a better chance in court, but that does not guarantee that they will prevail. So far they have not - mainly because of the quality of the experts who oppose them. Experts who can stand up to a determined cross-examination by an advocate for the opposing POV are much more convincing than those who cannot do so. Look at the Dover transcripts and you will see how easily Behe was \"impeached\" on the stand during his cross-exam. He did not know his stuff well enough and shaded the truth and he got nailed for it - BIG TIME in fact. And it was not all that nuanced an attack. I know a true master of that particular argumentative game and Behe would have been weeping on the stand for mercy under the kinds of attack he would muster. Behe in effect got off easy.",

   "OK an all in one reply.\n \n \nThey STOPPED SHORT when they blocked ID. They need to stop short when they promote atheism. They brought it on themselves, with their double standard.\n\n \n Nobody stopped short of a conclusion in the case of ID. The scientists on both sides presented their analysis. The court made the decision as to the significance and weight to be given those conclusions. Thats how courts function - they are not scientific venues.\n \n \nSo block one in the courts, and let the other flow freely. Give one public funding and exposure in public education, and let the other have at it on its own. BLOCK free and open dissection of it all.\n\n \n The real issue is exposure in public education - particulary at the introductory basic levels. What is taught is and should be the current consensus of the relevant scientific community. ID is not the current consensus and there is no room for it under the current state of its evidence. Likewise public money is used to fund work which is judged likely to be of high quality and of value to the public. ID having no empirical foundation does not meet that criterion as of yet. Like others seeking public money they need a base upon which to stand to support their contentions that their work would be well founded and of value to the public. So far thats not the case. It could be if they would ever get around to doing science instead of chasing legal ghosts.\n \n As to dissection. The argument from design has been dissected up down and sideways and its never been found yet to have any significant merit based on empirical evidence. That does not mean that it never will, but till it does it remains fully dissected and dead as a doornail. Like a frog in biology class.\n \n \nBut do they all make it to court? Who determines if some scientific theory should be scrutinized by a court? Someone with money and an agenda, yes. Who else??\n\n \n Of course not science is not done in courtrooms - its a perfectly awful venue to do science since the rules employed are not designed to find truth and the parties are necessarily polarized by the process. In the case of DOVER the ACLU came to the aid of the defendants who thought their children would potentially be taught a religious doctrine in the guise of science, and the DI came to the aid of the school board which chose to try to defend its stance on the Pandas Thumb. I think the DI thought it would be \"easy meat\" but they turned out to be wrong and as a result set a precedent very unfavorable to their cause. Such is the way of the world. I do not weep for them. They could have spent the money better on seeking scientific truth rather than legal victories.\n \n \nScience declares that the Milky Way Galaxy is about 100,000 light years across. It seems like if that and all other details of the galaxy can be proclaimed, finding some complexity in near stars/planets shouldn't be much of a challange.\n\n \n When you are able to see a human being or a computer from 100 lightyears from earth give me a call! Consider for a moment your argument based on our ability to resolve cellular subsystems with EM. Our instruments for examining planets and such are even less capable of seeing organisms like ourselves or our artifacts at 100 light years than Hookes microscope could pick out the machinery of protein synthesis in the 1700s!\n \n \nHow do you think this would do if it were taken to court? I know atheists love it and they are very skilled at making hopes and dreams look like facts. If they throw out improbability it's a big help to them also. When I get more time I'll have to look at your Dover links and see if probabilities and improbabilities were mentioned anywhere in that case.\n\n \n It would do quite well. Especially so if Behe appeared on the stand and his testimony in previous federal courts was used against him as its allowed to be. He has NO EMPIRICAL evidence to present only theory and a demonstrably flawed calculation of probability. An expert statistics guy and good cross-exam guy would demolish him in an hour or less during cross. Indeed he might not be allowed to take the stand at all given his past statements, the judge might disqualify him due to Dover. In contrast the abiogenesis folks can point to some progress in cracking the nut and to laboratory creation of numerous subsystems from non-living matter. And then there is that virus thing you know as well as several promising hypotheses of actual abiogenesis chemistry. And then you know we have made self-replicating peptides which turn out to be fairly simple structures. All of that supports the concept that abiogenesis is in principle possible. Exactly what path was followed we may never know, but clearly some path was.\n \n \nNo, it's not biased. It's logical evidence, much the same as improbability is logical evidence.\n\n \n Sorry but its not logical evidence - its EMPIRICAL evidence. Logic is often deceptive and science uses both logic and empirical means and where logic and empirical evidence part ways empirical rules the roost. But anyway at least you recognize that a lack of evidence for an alternative view does not necessarily mean that those who present the evidence are biased against the alternative. Its progress. By the way the improbability argument IS logical evidence, but its logic is flawed because the premises it rests on are highly questionable. There is no empirical evidence in the argument.\n \n I\nn the same way, do you believe the improbabilities of evolution (which are plentiful) creates a bias against evolution simply because there remains so many in the general public who refuse to accept godless evolution just because atheist scientists say they should?\n\n \n No I do however have every reason to believe that Behe has gotten it profoundly wrong and that his premises do not hold water empirically. I do not need to worry much about whether or not his argument is biased when its demonstrably incorrect!",

   "It's funny, though - none of the 'moon landings were faked' sites actually have an image of that soft drink bottle. The claims are based on what a handful of people thought they saw for a split second on their 1950's tv sets - in fuzzy black and white. \n\n \n My memory is fuzzy on that - seems like it was on the tapes I referred to. After a quick google search, I think the names of those who produced the tapes were David Percy and James Collier. Seems to me the bottle was in a zoomed in freeze frame. And the tv sets weren't 50's - the Apollo space flights were in the late 60's / early 70's. And I know that it was After Feb. 2002 when I watched the tapes. Don't know just when Percy and Collier made them however. \n \n \n \nNASA no longer have a functional rocket capable of lunar insertion, so yes, they would have to start from scratch. And they would probably not be allowed to use the same technology, since health and safety was a little more... relaxed during the cold war. \n\n \n There was a lot more to it than \"lunar insertion\". There was breaking free from earths gravity, life support for the entire trip, a lunar orbiter capable of human support, the list would be long. Mountains of plans, drawings specifications, details. The news article I saw claimed everything was completely gone. \n \n \n \nNo, they show light shimmering off the few inches of aerial that juts out of the backpack. No glints anywhere higher up. And you can clearly see from the footage that the astronaut is not 'dangling' from his pack as would be mandated by such an arrangement. \n\n \n The shimmering light I saw went several feet in the air as I recall. The one thing that really stands out in my mind is how one of them was helping another one up as he was squatting down doing something, and all of a sudden he jumped up like a jack in the box!! Like someone jerked on his wires a little to hard. :p \n \n I realize Percy and Collier could have sped their tape up. Not much question one side or the other was faking it. The reaction I got by bringing it up here surprised me however, blind faith in science may be more intense than I thought. I may start a new thread on this, not so much for an argument over pictures or what Percy and Collier started, but just some review of it after 38 years. The phrase was \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind\". It seems to me after 38 years we would see some evidence of that giant leap. What would that evidence be? That we threw away ALL the documentation of it and forgot it all? \n \n \n \n \nOh really? You can clearly see the Milky Way on a night with a full moon? How about if the moon were ten times closer? Or you were stood on it? You know, if it were effectively daytime. \n\n \n I can see plenty of stars, in....75 % of the sky where the moon isn't. \n \n \n \n \nNot in terms of dynamic range it hasn't. Ansel Adams managed to eke ten stops of detail out of black and white film using special processing techniques. That's a contrast ratio of around 1024-1. But to get the full moon exposed as anything other than a pure white disc and still pick up Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, you would need a dynamic range of over 10,000-1. \n\n \n Something else I'd like to get into with some posters here - have you ever \"scaled down\" the universe, to try to get some kind of a handle on just how far away one light year, or one hundred thousand light years is? Making the earth one inch in diameter for example, and reducing everything else accordingly? Pretty amazing what science tells us they can see. I did some of it long ago, if I remember right with the earth one inch, the sun is 900+ feet away, about 9 feet in diameter. I can buy that, but the Milky Way galaxie 100,000 light years across? Is there ever a point in space where science says it doesn't know? \n \n \n \n \nIf perspective is what it was all about, why are you talking about something completely different? Perspective is why shadows that are in fact parallel appear to converge as they recede from the viewer. \n\n \n It has several meanings, I was referring to the way shadows oppose one point of light in a direction opposite from that light. If the light is close, they won't be parallel. If the light is 93 million miles away, they should be perfectly parallel. \n \n \nSome 'fake' sites claim multiple lights were used. For heaven's sake, why would they do that? \n\n \n You actually meant \"For Darwin's sake\" right? Just a typo? emoticon_xclown \n \n Because no matter how big the movie studio is, you can't easily fake ONE light that's 93 million miles away with one light that's much closer. \n \n \n \n\"Hey, guys, I know we're trying to fake the moon landing and all but I'm really not happy with the lighting I'm getting here; could you rig up a few more spots?\" \n\n \n I'll finish if for you. \"We're trying to do a sun 93 million miles away, just that one big light way over at that wall aint gettin it done. It's going to take multiple lights to do the trick. Maybe I'm being picky, the science worshiping public probably won't notice a few messed up shadows, but we gotta do the best we can. We got it made though, the big bucks will be rolling in soon after we get this done and throw all the drawings away. Toss me a coke!! \n \n \n \nAny hypothesis that requires thousands of ordinary people to be masterfully cunning and tight-lipped conspirators and thundering XXXXXX should be setting off alarm bells all over your head. \n\n \n It's happening in the global warming farce right now! It's a thing called MONEY, my friend. \n \n \nIndeed, the fact it doesn't speaks volumes for how you look at the world. The fake lunar landing 'conspiracy'; the great atheist 'conspiracy'. Everywhere you look, people are conspiring against you, out to fool you, make you look stupid, attack your beliefs, and you're ready and willing to swallow anything, no matter how ridiculous or poorly thought out, so long as it panders to that paranoia. \n\n \n It's not just me, there's more going on in the U.S. than how it's represented at 4forums. I don't know how old you are - I grew up in the 1960's and I know there were problems. But we weren't being overrun with Mexicans, we didn't have an internet saturated with porn, we didn't have busy bridges falling down with trucks and cars on them, we didn't have random drug testing in so many occupations, and we didn't have most of the public (and the government) drowning in debt. \n \n Who's more paranoid, myself or obvious_child? I can't help but wonder if, while he's riding his tricycle on the sidewalk, he doesn't see a church and go into a major rage. I wonder if he's ever vandalized a church building. \n \n \nI would not like to live in the world you inhabit, marc.\n\n \n There is a culture war going on in Western civilization if you haven't noticed. You're mistaking what you see as \"paranoia\" for an interest in it, a desire to discuss it, and my belief that one notable domestic wrong turn may have as much to do with our survival, or failure to survive, as a wrong turn in the war on terrorism.",

If you want to find all the engineering details then they are probably stored in that famous warehouse along with the Ark.\n \n If we had it to do over we would not do it the same way you realize. Apollo was in fact done with technology of the mid 1960s at the latest. Things have changed greatly since. Probably launch from orbit these days after hauling most of the mass up on the shuttles to the international space station.",

   "It's not just me, there's more going on in the U.S. than how it's represented at 4forums. I don't know how old you are - I grew up in the 1960's and I know there were problems. But we weren't being overrun with Mexicans, we didn't have an internet saturated with porn, we didn't have busy bridges falling down with trucks and cars on them, we didn't have random drug testing in so many occupations, and we didn't have most of the public (and the government) drowning in debt.\n \n\n \n I grew up in the 1960s also. Do you remember the counter \"culture\"? Do you remember Deep Throat. We did not have the internet, but all communication channels can be expected to carry pornography even bathroom walls. As to Mexicans - look out your window - how many do you see? As to bridges - chuckle chuckle the one that fell down recently was BUILT in 1967s and the last I heard the problem was a DESIGN FLAW carried over from that era!!!! And of course we have always had structural failures now and again. As to debt - well we had a lot of debt relative to GNP in those days, indeed we were still paying down mAnoney borrowed to fight WWII, Korea, and of course the ongoing war in Vietnam., not to mention the massive costs of building all those nuclear weapons, maintaining SAC, developing nuclear navy systems, polaris missles, and so on and so forth. There was more than enough private debt in those days also.",

It's probably a simple mistranslation an can be fixed through reason.\n \n \nThe tone of recent discussion in this thread leads me to believe you are serious! \n \n To make such a statement full of gnosticism must in fact mean you know something everyone else doesn't. Will you reveal your secret mystical knowledge to us? \n \n Now I wonder how you know that...oh that's right, you have faith! Strong-atheists need something to hold onto don't they? Honestly, provide at least some evidence to substantiate your claim or your beliefs are nothing more than delusions. \n \n In response to the OP, I'm a bit disappointed, but not shocked to see this topic degenerate so quickly into a battle of insults because though I am new to this particular forum I see the same garbage everywhere else. I care not to contribute to the original discussion myself, but I will echo those who stated literal creationism has been debunked and that Big Bang-creationism is an almost an unassailable position.\n\n \n Of coarse I'm serious!\n \n My secrets: God created the univese. Jesus is God's son. We all need to accept Jesus into our hearts and ask him to forgive us of our sins. I'm not very good at keeping secrets.\n \n I'd like to see the evos provide logical evidence, too.\n \n If you don't like debating 'garbage', then I suggest not debating. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Wasn't the Big Bang already disproven years ago by the creo scientist Kent Hovind?\n \n \nAh yes the oldest con game in the world. Set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules, then use the guilt effect to control the test subject. The Christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale. And even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on. In Adams fall we sinned all. Guilt is the father of ........ economic returns!\n\n \n So I take it you don't accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible? Why is it impossible? Or better yet, why don't we al just evolve into perfect, anti-sinning creatures with 500 IQ points a piece?\n \n \nThe only evidence *for* a cosmic ethical adjudicator is a cobbled-together set of books claiming that a talking snake made our ancestors commit a \"sin\" (when they didn't even know what a sin was) which could easily have been avoided if he had put the tree in an out of the way place rather than in the middle of the garden where they lived - all of which he had to know about in advance being omniscient - then after a few botched attempts at sorting things out, he sent an avatar of himself to soak up the blame for this \"sin\" which apparently follows down the family lines like some genetic defect! Does this make sense to you?!\n \n What exactly are you after evidence *for*?\n\n \n The Bible is more complicated and revered than a cobbled-together set of books. It was written by many of the wisest men in history, and each one of them was inspired by God.\n \n Creos are looking (and have found) evidence to prove that God created the universe and that no evolution has ever occured (with the exception of micro-evolution).\n \n \nNow now I always liked the talking snake, the whole story is put together quite well and would make a good opera. As to whether one should base all of human civilization, philosophy, and society upon an opera plot is another question entirely. Frankly I think its a mistake to do so.\n\n \n You probably liked the talking snake because he creted your religion.\n \n I doubt the Bible would make a good opera. It's too long and boring and too many people would want to sue the produser for making a religious play.\n \n \nPerhaps not, but I don't believe it is unreasonable assumption for myself to make of his beliefs that because he believes Jesus Christ is fiction, he consequently believes the Christian God is fiction aswell. The story of Christ can be tested by history, but the Christian God is in another realm and one would require mystical knowledge in order to state said God does or does not exist.\n \n Indeed he is as disbelief is still belief - he expresses the denial of God which is unique to strong atheists. Furthermore, he claims that Doctrine essential to Christianity is wrong. I've heard this all before...but where...oh, that's right, from Richard Dawkins!\n \n I have not made any claims here other than this: \"your beliefs are based on faith.\" It was the strong-atheists I responded to that first claimed an absolute, therefore the burden of proof would be on them to evidence Jesus Christ is a fictional character and that Sin is a man-made concept. \n \n \n I did add, but as I clearly stated, it does not pertain to the original discussion about evidence for or against God because I am not providing evidence for or against God.\n \n I made it up, and I can explain it in a few sentences. I will reference to the label of \"literal-creationism\" which is obviously creationism as the Bible states it literally happened (6,000 years ago). \"Big-Bang creationism\" would simply be creationism reconciled with the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and evolution. God, in all His creativity, setup the Big Bang and let the ball start rolling, so to speak.\n \n I agree, Ockham's Razor eliminates the need for God, however, people will believe what they want. Who are you to and other strong-atheists to evangelize your beliefs to eveyone? \"God does not exist\", and \"Sin is a fairy tale to scare people\", etc, etc, etc.\n\n \n We don't need mystical knowledge. We just need faith and a disproval for evolution (which has been found).\n \n Richard Dawkins! Oh, I used to love that guy when I was a kid! he was so funny!\n \n Since we have the Bible as our proof, the evos need to disprove the Bible or prove evolution to go on with the age-old debate.\n \n You know what would be funny? What if someone were to try to post evidence against God?\n \n The Big Bang has been proved incorrect.\n \n \nSo far, there is no evidence that \"Jesus Christ\" is not fictional. There are many reasons to consider the stories that talk about Jesus to have very many mythical elements, such as, divinity, being born of a virgin, resurrection,\n having dead people walk around when being executed, being a miracle worker, \n and little things like that which are internal evidence that Jesus Christ is fictional. The way that \"Jesus\" mirrors the cult of Augustus Caesar is , to me, strong evidence that \"Jesus Christ\" is fictional.\n \n So many of the stories about Jesus contradict our experiences of how the world works. You call those 'miracles'. I call them 'Evidence Jesus is Fictional'.\n\n \n Evidence for Jesus: The Bible. Christianity (all of his followers). God. The miracles he worked.\n Evidence against Jesus: Loaded words. Circular reasoning. The belief that Jesus did not commit miracles because they were 'against science' (by the way, God made the laws of physics; he can adjust them at will.\n \n \nI believe that's true, and I'm sure many scientists don't. So there you have it, who is right? Could it be that many scientists believe it's possible to add a fact and a theory, and come up with a fact for the sum of the two? Or might they think that multiple additions, such as five facts + one theory equals a fact? Or maybe one fact + one theory + one hypothesis + one guess + one lick + one promise all equal a fact as long as it supports atheism? \n \n Actual facts are pretty hard to come by IMO. They should be so clear that they shouldn't be disputed. I even believe it's possible to add two facts and not always get a fact for the sum. The slightest bit of human desire or emotion changes it from a fact to a theory. To not acknowledge that science does this for political reasons all the time could be a VERY self destructive act, considering its eternal consequences.\n\n \n So true. This is why I like debating: we get to argue great evidence for both sides of almost every arguement.\n \n \nNo, but it takes away the ~original sin~ part, the most important part of Christianity - the huge price Jesus paid for it, and subsequential sin. If that's made trivial, then Jesus life wasn't important.\n\n \n Everybodies life is imortant, but you are correct for the most part. However, the trouble comes when you try to disprove the OT.\n \n \nIt depends on what ones worldview is, and his/her definition of what a fact is. Many belive the Bible has facts and evidence in it as well, and it has stood the test of time.\n\n \n You got that right!\n \n \nThey (and much of the scientific community) do it because religion gets in the way of many things they want to do. They want to be involved in political decisions concerning scientific things. Loads of money and power hang in the balance.\n\n \n Very good way of putting it. I suppose we do get in the way with all of our trivial disproofs and other irritations. Oh, well, better learn to live with it...\n \n \nExactly.. and that is one reason I am not a Christian.\n \n Of course, even if you took Genesis seriously, there wouldn't be 'original sin' as the Christians proclaim it anyway.\n\n \n Jesus died for you and you don't even pay him back by believing him?!\n \n Yes, there was an origional sin. Adam and Eve disobeyed God directly by eating the forbidden fruit.\n \n \nWell, perhaps you should do some reading. But now that I have given you one example of a christian preaching hate and bigotry, would you another example...or did that satisfy your requirements. \n \n Well, that's just your cross to bear. I don't feel sorry for myself in the least. \n But if you want to go on worrying about me...you go right ahead. \n \n Because the fact that you need it explained to you in the first place is the best part. \n \n As is the majority of organized religion. What's your point?\n\n \n That satisfied my requirements. Poor Phelps.\n \n Will do. In fact, as long as I can, I'm going to try to persuade you to step into the light of God's glory.\n \n Ah, okay. So, I'll be waiting for your answer, whenever you'll tell me.\n \n Yep. Evereysingle one (with the exeption of Creationism and the religions that fall under it, of course).\n \n \nActually its a hypothesis which is as of this date unfalsified.\n\n \n Haven't you watched my movie yet? http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6814048597272982882\n \n \nAs a moral story book yes. Not as a scientific journal. The Bible was used for more then 600 years as a historical literal, scientific book. But in less then 50 it went from accepted fact to a mere story book. The bible isn't even mentioned in science classes in reputable schools.\n\n \n Ya, I heard. They took creation out of schools because of some sue-happy evos. However, in the tounament section, there were two debates on this subject that might just change your mind. http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=7108 & http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6828\n \n \nWhich is amusing as you use the products of those so called non-facts every day. How is it that you can reject the science which brings you great products? Geology is wrong but gasoline is real? What kind of asinine logic is that?\n \n So me getting angry makes gravity not true? I see you haven't changed at bit. You don't win many discussions do you? \n \n Exactly. Hence why politics needs to get out of science and why Bush should have never started his bullying of sciences to get what he wanted.\n\n \n Not all of geology has been disproven.\n \n EDIT: Hence why politics should get out of science and why science should be reformatted...\n \n \nYou are entitled to your opinion, you are not entitled to your own facts.emoticon_xagree \n \n No scientist I know of considers scientific theories or hypotheses as being facts. Facts are empirical in nature and theories attempt to provide an integration of those facts into a single rational structure.\n \n Not really. For example the sun is shining, its raining, its 85 degrees outside are readily discernable types of facts. On the other hand the error of Newtonian mechanics regarding the orbit of Mercury are more difficult to measure as is the cosmic background radiation spectrum. And I might point out that facts and theories are not amenable to simple mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. The concept simply does not fit. And its not human emotion that converts facts to theory - its human reason.\n\n \n Which is exactly why we are debating: to see whos opinion is actually a fact.\n \n Would this be considered the difference between our two theories of the universe's origins: In the biginning, God... vs. In the biginning dirt....\n \n Human emotion converts fact to theory, not the other way around.\n \n \nWhere does Richard Dawkins say this? I'm currently re-reading The God Delusion, so I'll keep my eye out.\n \n Right. And how does this help us in any way? Do you also attribute a divine aspect to lightning and clouds?\n \n Who are you religious types to force your religion on children? To scatter the icons and monuments to your myriad variations of nonsense across the countryside? And to do it all with tax breaks?! Just who is it who has spent the last 2000 years proselytizing?!\n\n \n Richard Dawkins basically states this when he proposed that the Big Bang created the universe and evolution created life.\n \n The Big Bang has been disproven.\n \n We are not the only religious people here, CO, you are too. You let something you believe in (evolution) account for the creation of the universe.\n \n You were on page 5.\n \n No, I don't read Sun Tzu. Yes, it is relevant. \"Although numbers don't win a war, they sure do help.\"\n \n Yes, I do believe I can win this if it is just me vs. one evo.\n \n God created the world as he said in the Bible. Just because we only have the Bible for evidence doesn't make the whole idea a lie. There, does that make me the first creo to stand my ground?",
