   "Alright, I spent a good deal of time the past week putting this all together in a word document before I posted it here in its entirety. This thread seeks to challenge the current consensus that Jesus Christ was a historical figure. To do this, first we need to define what we mean by \"Jesus Christ.\" I find that this is a very broad catchall phrase that can mean the god-man depicted in the NT Gospels to a shadowy figure standing behind layers of Q and other sayings source material. The first character, the god-man, can very easily be dismissed. That Jesus Christ never existed. \n \n On the latter extreme, dismissing the shadowy figure that served as an inspiration for the stories about the god-man is a bit more difficult. But I would argue that with current scholarship we are on the cusp of dismissing that inspirational source for the Jesus story as well, not with the certainty that we dismiss the god-man Jesus Christ, but with a more likely than not certainty. \n \n I think we (and defining \"we\" I mean those who care about history and interpreting the available evidence to argue to the best explanation) can pretty well dismiss any thought that someone named \"Jesus Christ\" preached in Galilee, traveled to Rome, created a disturbance in the Temple and was crucified by the Romans. That Jesus Christ simply never existed.\n \n So where do we start with this project? I will say this: not with Paul. Not with the Gospels. We know from Paul that Christianity was well-established throughout the Roman empire by the time of Paul, so we have to examine the millieu in which \"Jesus Christ\" emerged: Palestine of the first century, heavily influenced by Platonist philosophy, Greek mystery religions, and the weight of history on the Jewish nation. \n \n So the start of Christianity does not begin with Jesus Christ at all, but with Jewish documents that pre-exist but foreshadow \"Jesus Christ.\" Apologists consider these prophecies about Jesus Christ. Non-christians who argue for an HJ (Historical Jesus) seem to avoid discussing them altogether. But when we consider the emergence of early Christian thought in the first century, it is impossible to simply ignore the currents of thought that clearly presage Jesus. If we dismiss prophecy at work, then we are really left with an evolution of the idea of Jesus. \n \n The state of current NT scholarship on Jesus Christ tends to ignore or dismiss this evidence altogether. The consensus that has developed around the idea of an historical Jesus is really built on the identification of layers of sayings that served as sources for the gospels. I'll discuss these later, but for now, let me say that in fact Q1, Q2, Q3 point more to a MJ (Mythical Jesus) than to a HJ (Historical Jesus). If these are layers of sayings added on over the years, then they are clearly not Jesus sayings. If we say then that the earliest layer, Q1, might be authentically Jesus, I'd say we have no way to show that. The sayings in Q1 could come from anywhere and just have been compiled into a \"Jesus say\" collection. The source for Q1 is so obscure that we can not draw out any positive statements to attribute them to an historical figure. In fact, many are probably derived from cynic/stoic sayings.\n \n So first: I think our best start when talking about the origins of christianity come from second and first century BCE Judaism. This is a time when hellenistic influences had strongly pervaded Palestinian culture. Greek gods were worshipped openly. The Maccabbeans seemed to fulfill the Messianic desires of the Jewish people and then ultimately failed, themselves tarnished by blasphemy. Josephus documents time and again, Jewish martyrs leading the people to doom at the hands of the Romans. It is in this millieu that the idea of the suffering servant merged with the platonist influenced idea of the Logos described by Philo. Let's start with Isaiah 52/53:\n \n52:13 See, my servant will act wisely ; \n he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. \n \n 14 Just as there were many who were appalled at him -\n his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man \n and his form marred beyond human likeness- \n \n 15 so will he sprinkle many nations, \n and kings will shut their mouths because of him. \n For what they were not told, they will see, \n and what they have not heard, they will understand.\n \n 53:1 Who has believed our message \n and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? \n \n 2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, \n and like a root out of dry ground. \n He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, \n nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. \n \n 3 He was despised and rejected by men, \n a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. \n Like one from whom men hide their faces \n he was despised, and we esteemed him not. \n \n 4 Surely he took up our infirmities \n and carried our sorrows, \n yet we considered him stricken by God, \n smitten by him, and afflicted. \n \n 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, \n he was crushed for our iniquities; \n the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, \n and by his wounds we are healed. \n \n 6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, \n each of us has turned to his own way; \n and the LORD has laid on him \n the iniquity of us all. \n \n 7 He was oppressed and afflicted, \n yet he did not open his mouth; \n he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, \n and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, \n so he did not open his mouth. \n \n 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away. \n And who can speak of his descendants? \n For he was cut off from the land of the living; \n for the transgression of my people he was stricken. \n \n 9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, \n and with the rich in his death, \n though he had done no violence, \n nor was any deceit in his mouth. \n \n 10 Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, \n and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, \n he will see his offspring and prolong his days, \n and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. \n \n 11 After the suffering of his soul, \n he will see the light of life and be satisfied ; \n by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, \n and he will bear their iniquities. \n \n 12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, \n and he will divide the spoils with the strong, \n because he poured out his life unto death, \n and was numbered with the transgressors. \n For he bore the sin of many, \n and made intercession for the transgressors.\n\n \n We readily see from this that the suffering servant is not the Jesus Christ described in the New Testament. In particular, there is no hint that Jesus Christ was \"disfigured\" or \"marred\" in any way. It is unlikely that this detail would not have been noted if it were true. Yet we can also see that the idea of the mediator between humanity and God suffering for the sins of humanity was well-established before there was a Jesus Christ. Note that the idea here isn't that this will happen in the future, but that it has happened. That is important because my argument is that the same notion was applied by early Christians to Jesus Christ. That the sacrifice of Jesus Christ already happened in the mythical past, just as it occurred here in Isaiah. (Note here that the suffering servant motif of Isaiah is usually interpreted as an allegory for the nation of Israel, which I believe is an accurate interpretation. Robert G. (not M!) Price argues that the Gospel of Mark continues this idea with Jesus Christ being an allegory for Israel.\n \n Isaiah doesn't link the idea of the suffering servant to a \"son of God\" but another Jewish document, the Wisdom of Solomon, does. \n \n In the Wisdom of Solomon, the suffering servant is explicitly identified as the son of God:\n \n[12] Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education.\n [13] He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.\n [14] He was made to reprove our thoughts.\n [15] He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion.\n [16] We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.\n [17] Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.\n [18] For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.\n [19] Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.\n [20] Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.\n\n \n So here we have really all the elements we need for the evolution of the idea of the suffering servant into the idea that \"Jesus Christ\" was this figure. The apologist protestation that a religion with a crucified figure would not fly clearly does not hold considering here in the Wisdom of Solomon we already have the \"Son of God\" condemned to a \"shameful death.\"\n \n But there is further evidence that all the elements we need for Jesus Christ existed in first century Palestine. This comes from Philo:\n \nTo his Logos, his chief messenger, highest in age and honor, the Father of all has given the special prerogative to stand on the border and separate the creature from the Creator. This same Logos both pleads with the Immortal as suppliant for afflicted mortality and acts as ambassador of the ruler to the subject. He glories in this prerogative and proudly describes it in these words: \"I stand between the Lord with you.\" (Philo, quis rerum divinarum here 42.405)\n\n \n Notice how this idea dovetails with the ideas in Hebrews:\n \nHebrews 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are-yet was without sin. 16Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.\n\n \n Here we see the idea Jesus can plead for us because he has been through what we have been. Remember that Hebrews is a later document--an important one and I'll get to that later. But the point here is that Jesus is the intermediary between humanity and God, just as Philo described the Logos. We can see this also here:\n \nHeb 7:23 Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; 24but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. 25Therefore he is able to save completely[c] those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. \n\n \n So we can see a clear flow from pre-christian Jewish thought to early christian views. Hebrews is fairly late but is still mostly untainted by the idea of recent earthly incarnation. If I have time, I will go into Hebrews in more depth.\n \n I have not touched on this here and I'm not going to go into it in detail unless it comes out in the ensuing discussion (if there is any), but the figure of \"Wisdom\" was first envisioned as female, but seems to have flowed into the idea of Logos which then became transformed by Christians into \"Jesus Christ\". A nice clean evolution that the evidence testifies to.\n \n I want to consider one more thing before turning to the earliest christian notions of Jesus Christ. Traditions abound even today of ridding our sorrows and burdens through the sacrifice of a symbolic \"man\". This is the idea behind wickerman, the Burning Man, and Zozobra. In ancient times, this was a prevalent custom. The cult of Dionysus evolved from sacrificing an actual human as a stand-in for Dionysus, to burning an effigy of Dionysus. Now this is mostly an aside, but you can see how this idea fits with the suffering servant motif in Isaiah and the Wisdom of Solomon. I think the idea of the sacrificed and risen God comes from this sort of custom and was mostly practiced as a mystery-religion, a jewish-inspired mystery religion that may have been more popular with gentiles from the start than with jews.\n \n I will continue in a subsequent post.",

   "So far, I've asked you to consider pre-Christian Jewish thought. Now I will turn to Paul. I think Paul is the smoking gun on the historical Jesus. Before I get deeply into Paul though I want to address the issue of the argument from silence. My argument on Paul does not rest only on what Paul does not say about Jesus, but also what he does say. What is Paul's \"Jesus Christ?\" What does he envision (and envision is the right word for it). Note here, though, as far as silence goes, it extends far beyond Paul. In fact, other than the Gospels supposed to have been written in the 70's through the 100s, we have no details about Jesus Christ's passion, the virgin birth, the empty tomb. Ignatius is the first to say Jesus Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate and that is around 100 CE and he seems unaware of any further details. I would argue that Mark is dependent in part on Antiquities and Wars of Josephus and was probably not written much before 100 CE. Thus there was little or no legend yet concerning Jesus's crucifixion at the hands of Pilate. Paul, for his part, has no knowledge of that, for Paul Jesus was crucified by the \"archons\" the heavenly rulers of the age. We'll get into that now.\n \n Scholars for ages have shrugged their shoulders at Paul. His silence on Jesus is described as perplexing, paradoxical, unfortunate, curious, etc. I argue it is none of those. Paul is not silent on Jesus and, in fact, is very clear about what he envisions Jesus to be. It is not that Paul is silent, it is that scholars are looking for Paul to say things he has no knowledge about<b></b>: the details of the life of someone who, to Paul, did not recently, if ever, live on Earth. Again, this interpretation is more consistent with the evidence. We don't need an ad hoc explanation (he wasn't interested in teh life of Jesus, his purpose wasn't to expound on the life and teachings of Jesus, etc.) we can just look at what Paul actually does say. And what does Paul say?\n \n To Paul, Jesus is the revealed mystery:\n \nRomans 16:25 Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, 26but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him- 27to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen. \n\n Note that this is the \"mystery hidden for long ages past, but now revealed...\" Not recently incarnated and taught by He Himself and in fact not revealed by an earthly incarnation but \"made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God.\" How can Paul be more clear than that? Paul gets his information about Jesus not from any stories about an earthly ministry, but from scripture. This is Paul's source. He says it over and over again:\n \n1 cor 2:7 No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. \n\n \n3For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... \n\n \n Note here that Paul says these things happened according to the scriptures. His source is not a story of a recent ministry of Jesus Christ. He has learned nothing from those who supposedly knew Jesus (Peter and James). No he has learned about Jesus from scripture...and revelation, just as everybody else did:\nGalatians 1:11 I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. 12I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. \n\n \n Curious wording for someone who converted to christianity within a few years of the crucifixion and personally knew some of the key players, including the First Apostle. But I would argue that Paul actually represents an intermediate period of christianity as it emerges out of the \"mystery religion\" phase. So we've advanced past the age of the suffering servant but i'd say we have about a half century or so of development of this religion. Now the suffering servant/Logos is identified as \"Jesus Christ\" and has adopted explicitly the crucifixion as the means of the shameful death. \n \n Here, with this explanation, we have no paradox, no perplexing silence. Indeed, Paul is not one to be silent as his personality that comes through large and clear in his letters demonstrates. Paul lays it all out there and we, with 2,000 years of indoctrination by orthodox christianity burdening us, have difficulty reading Paul for what Paul is and seeing what he believed in: A Christ who took human form crucified by evil demons in some mythic or mystical past. A Christ who has evolved directly out of the suffering servant/logos motifs common in Judaism just a half century or so before. A Christ eternaly present but only now revealed by inspired reading of scripture and revelation. This is clearly the Christ that Paul preaches.\n \n Now, not only Paul, what we find is an evolution of thought about Jesus over time from this notion of Paul's to the idea that Jesus lived on Earth during the time of Pontius Pilate. Again, this is curious if Jesus really did live on Earth during the time of Pontius Pilate. If that were the case, we should find references all over in early christian writings to the events of the life of Jesus. But, in fact, we don't until the turn of the century (with the exception of the Gospels which I think emerged at the turn of the century. We have no outside attestation before the mid-100s to any of these gospels.). So we have a paradox if we accept the traditional view (yet another one) that is wiped clean if we just accept the notion that \"Jesus Christ\" was an idea that evolved into \"Jesus of Nazareth\" not the other way around.\n \n One more thing, another paradox. If Jesus Christ was crucified based on trumped up charges and false witness just a short time before Paul's conversion, I find it hard to believe that Paul would have this to say:\n \nRomans 13:1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 7Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. \n\n \n I think it is a hard sell to argue that Paul believed in a Jesus Christ crucified by Pilate at the behest of a scheming group of city councilors based on this verse.",

   "I'm going to address a couple of objections that might be raised at this point. One is Galatians 4:4:\nGalatians 4:4But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, 5to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. 6Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \"Abba, Father.\" \n\n \n This passage is often cited as evidence that Paul is talking about an historical figure who lived recently on earth. There are three main points to make about this passage. First, it is clear that the idea of human sacrifice for the purpose of redemption was deeply rooted from the beginning in the suffering servant motif. We have already seen that in Isaiah 53 and the Wisdom of Solomon. So by the logic of this religious belief, the Son had to be born of woman. Hebrews explains this:\n \n \nHeb 2:14 Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil- 15and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. 16For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. 17For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for[f]the sins of the people. 18Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. \n\n \n I will get into Hebrews probably in its own post. For now, try to understand the logic of this belief system. The suffering servant had to be made human in order to become the High Priest. The high priest/Logos motif in Hebrews is especially strong and makes it one of the most interesting documents in the New Testament.\n \n So this is the logic of the system similar to the logic of the Dionysus cult which actually sacrificed a human stand-in for the god (later they would burn an effigy). The sacrifice was to be a human sacrifice--the core foundational belief of Christianity. \n \n Note, here, too though that it was a HUMAN sacrified who then becomes exalted by God:\n \nHeb 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. \n\n \n This was part of the suffering servant motif, that by the sacrifice, the \"Son of God\" becomes exalted, not before. Here is the same idea from Paul:\n \nPhilippians 2:8And being found in appearance as a man, \n he humbled himself \n and became obedient to death- \n even death on a cross! \n 9Therefore God exalted him to the highest place \n and gave him the name that is above every name, \n 10that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, \n in heaven and on earth and under the earth, \n 11and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, \n to the glory of God the Father. \n \n\n \n Again, here, the idea is repeated: the suffering servant becomes Jesus Christ by his sacrifice. \n \n So the idea in Galatians 4 is only stating the obvious: the sacrifice was human. This brings no closer to the fictional Passion found first in the Gospel of Mark. Here we have no mention of Pontius Pilate, the Virgin Mary. We won't for many, many long decades. No one mentions \"born of the Virgin Mary\", \"crucified under Pontius Pilate\". Those are ideas that come much later in time.\n \n -\n \n Second, referring back to Gal 4, we see Paul begin to compare the birth of Jesus Christ to Ishmael and Isaac:\n \nGalatians 4:21 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? 22For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. 23His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise. \n\n \n Now Paul says something very important:\n24These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. 25Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. 26But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. \n\n \n Here Paul takes these births, just a few verses later, to be figurative. The new Jerusalem, the kingdom of God, is our mother, just as it is the mother of Jesus Christ. There is no Virgin Mary, Bethlehem, Nazareth in Paul's view of the birth of Jesus.\n \n Finally, on this objection, note that Paul says God sent the \"Spirit of his Son\". Again, this points to something other than a Jesus Christ preaching in Galilean synagogues (there is a question as to whether there were synagogues in Galilee in the first half of the first century, before the destruction of the Temple, by the way).\n \n The second objection (I've encountered in the past) also stems from Galatians. In first chapter of Galatians, Paul explains:\n \nGal 1:18Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter[b] and stayed with him fifteen days. 19I saw none of the other apostles-only James, the Lord's brother. \n\n \n Note that this is 3 years after his conversion, possibly less than a decade after the alleged crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Since Paul refers to James as \"the Lord's brother\" this is often interpreted as meaning that James was a blood brother to the person \"Jesus Christ.\" I don't think so. First, it is out of context within everything else Paul says about Jesus. Nowhere does he refer to any details of the life of Jesus on earth, but suddenly here is flesh and blood of the Savior. Second, if this were the brother of \"Jesus Christ\" one would think that Paul would give him the time of day, but he doesn't. Instead, he refers to Peter, James, and John as those \"reputed to be pillars\" (Gal 2:7) and tells us:\n \nGal 2:6As for those who seemed to be important-whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearance-those men added nothing to my message. \n\n \n Hardly the attitude one would take when meeting the brother of your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I think we can glean from Galatians, both the attitude here toward \"those reputed to be pillars\" and the later confrontation with Peter that Paul did not view them as people with any superior knowledge of Jesus Christ. Paul does not think they knew the living, human Jesus Christ. There is no evidence of that. I think Paul's designation of James as \"the Lord's brother\" is a title, an honorific, and it could be that Paul was using it sarcasticly. Certainly that is his tone toward Peter and James throughout most of Galatians. In fact, Paul makes clear that they all received their information in the same way:\n \n1 Cor 15:3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. \n\n \n Note in this interesting passage that Jesus appears separately to Peter and Twelve and James and all the apostles, suggesting 2 different groups of people. Also note that he never refers to either Peter or James as \"disciples\" of Christ which would mean they were actual students of Jesus Christ, but as \"apostles\" or messengers of Jesus Christ. I think it is pretty clear that Paul has no knowledge of Peter, James, and John actually knowing a Jesus Christ who walked on earth.\n \n I think that takes care of the two most significant objections to my analysis of Paul. Now I want you to remember that I am arguing to the best evidence. When looking at Paul we have to look from within the context of Paul and the times he is writing. So when Paul says \"born of woman\" we tend to automatically picture the fairy tale story from Matthew and Luke about Mary and Joseph and hosts of angels. \n \n But there is no reason for us to assume a priori that Paul has any knowledge of that. If we are trying to determine how these ideas developed, or at least entertaining the possibility that Jesus Christ was an evolved idea, then we must glean from Paul what we can without reference to later works that might impose their picture on our picture of Paul. I think that is very difficult to do. But I argue that if you do that successfully you see that Paul knows next to nothing about these Gospel stories and that would be awfully strange, a huge paradox.",

   "Okay. I am trying to do this without writing a book, so I am keeping these posts as short as I can. I know I am not the most concise writer.\n \n So I've tried to show that the idea that Paul had in mind of Jesus Christ connects well and evolves out of the \"suffering servant\" motif of Isaiah 53 and the Wisdom of Solomon. Paul's sources for Jesus are not the supposed \"oral tradition\" that finally gets written down by Mark around 70 CE, but revelation and scriptural readings. Paul learns nothing from men, even the \"reputed pillars\" who by Christian tradition actually knew Jesus Christ. Paul shows no interest in the details of the life of Jesus.\n \n So here we have an interesting problem for the traditional view: Paul's disinclination to discuss details of the life of Jesus is shared by all christian writers from the time that these events are said to have occurred until about the turn of the second century, the Gospels excepted (assuming relatively traditional dating of the Gospels). The traditional explanation for this is \"well, they just had no occassion or reason to recount the boring details of the life of Jesus\". This makes no sense since they are often writing about the teaching of Jesus, but the words that come out of the mouth of Jesus are mostly from the Old Testament. This is true of 1 Clement even from around 96 CE. Even at this late date, the author of Clement makes no reference to stories coming from oral tradition or quotes of a living Jesus Christ. Instead, he quotes scripture. As do all of the christian writers of this period.\n \n Here is another example, from Barnabas:\n \nBarnabas 5:2\n For the scripture concerning Him containeth some things relating to\n Israel, and some things relating to us. And it speaketh thus; He\n was wounded for your transgressions, and He hath been bruised for\n our sins; by His stripes we were healed. As a sheep He was led to\n slaughter, as a lamb is dumb before his shearer\n\n \n Here again the \"scripture concerning him\" refers to Isaiah 53! \n \n5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, \n he was crushed for our iniquities; \n the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, \n and by his wounds we are healed. \n \n\n \n Here is:\n \nBarnabas 5:13\n But He Himself desired so to suffer; for it was necessary for Him to\n suffer on a tree. For he that prophesied said concerning Him, Spare\n My soul form the sword; and, Pierce My flesh with nails, for the\n congregations of evil-doers have risen up against Me.\n\n \n Direct from Psalm 22:\n \nPsalm 22:16 Dogs have surrounded me; \n a band of evil men has encircled me, \n they have pierced [c] my hands and my feet. \n\n \nPsalm 22:20 Deliver my life from the sword, \n my precious life from the power of the dogs.\n\n \n As we will see later (Part V?), Psalm 22 is also the source for Mark's crucifixion scene.\n \n So here we have Barnabas, traditionally dated to around 80 CE, mining scripture for details about the life of Jesus. We find nothing here to confirm an existing oral tradition dating back to actual events in Palestine during the time of Pontius Pilate.",

   "Okay. So let's move ahead to the turn of the second century. I want to look at the First Letter of Clement. This letter is traditionally dated to around 95-96 CE although all these dates are wildly tenative (another problem for providing a foundation on which an HJ can stand). So by this time, it is thought that the Gospel of Mark has been around for 25 years (I'll get into the dating of Mark later), Matthew a decade or so, maybe Luke has made its appearance and John out on his island is right now setting shaky pen to paper. All these things are happening, yet the powerful Bishop of Rome, writing his reprimand to the usurpers in Corinth is blissfully unaware of any of it. \n \n The First Letter of Clement betrays no knowledge of the life and times of Jesus Christ. \"Clement\"'s vision of Christ has not advanced too far from Paul's, except that he does seem to believe in a vague sort of way that Jesus Christ lived and died on earth, not in some heavenly, mysitical realm, crucified by archons. But still, there is nothing about the passion, Pontius Pilate is yet to make his appearance in the Christ myth, golgotha, weeping marys, angels blazing (or simple young men) at tomb entrances are not in the awareness of Clement.\n \n I'll give some concrete examples, but think how extraordinary that is. This is after the supposed Gospels have been written, at least 2 of 4. This is one of the most prominent members of the developing Church of Rome writing an admonishment. Yet he does not attribute anything he has to say to any Gospel teaching or any teaching of Jesus!\n \n I think Clement shoots down 2 theories:\n \n 1. Early dating of the Gospels. Clement would not have written as though the Gospels did not exist if he were aware of them.\n \n 2. Existence of any form of concrete oral tradition about the life and times of Jesus. At most, awareness of Jesus's life on earth was vague with little concept of where and when things took place. Sayings have become attached to this legend, but the sources of those saying are obscure. \n \n And Clement did have occasion to mention Jesus. In a list of the sufferings brought to righteous men of the Bible due to the jealousy of their foes (Clement is admonishing a group that has taken over the church in Corinth), after he has listed ancient examples: Aaron, Moses, Dathan, Cain and Abel, Clement says:\nClement 5:1\n But to stop giving ancient examples, let us come to those who became athletic contenders in quite recent times. We should consider the noble examples of our own generation.\n 2 Because of jealously and envy the greatest and most upright pillars were persecuted, and they struggled in the contest even to death. \n\n \n Here, what a perfect place to recount the passion of the Lord! Surely that story for centuries since its appearance has offered fodder for Christians, its image ubiquitous. Jesus brought to trial by the jealous Sanhedrin and convicted on trumped up charges? But no. Not a mention from Clement of the suffering of the earthly Jesus. Instead, his examples of \"our generation\" are Peter and Paul who have been dead and gone at least 30 years. \n \n When Clement does refer to Jesus Christ, he nearly always references the Old Testament:\n \n \nClement 14:3\n We should treat one another kindly, according to the compassion and sweet character of the one who made us.\n 3 For it is written, \"Those who are kind will inhabit the land, and the innocent will be left upon it; but those who break the law will be destroyed from it.\" \n\n \n Why not quote Jesus here? Who knows? But Clement instead turns to Proverbs and Psalms for his material. I would argue that it is because the Gospels do not exist at this time. Further, there is little knowledge about what Jesus said and did that has yet been developed. But there is some, so for instance, Clement says:\n \nClement 13:1\n ...We should especially remember the words the Lord Jesus spoke when teaching about gentleness and patience.\n 2 For he said: \"Show mercy, that you may be shown mercy; forgive that you that it will be forgiven you. As you do, so it will be done to you; as you give, so it will be given you; as you judge, so you will be judged; as you show kindness, so will kindness be shown to you; the amount you dispense will be the amount you receive.\" \n\n \n Here it is in Matthew, spread out in verses over 3 chapters:\n \nMatthew 5:7\n 7Blessed are the merciful, \n for they will be shown mercy. \n \n Mathew 6:14-15\n 14For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n \n Matthew 7:1-2\n 1\"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. \n \n Matthew 7:12\n 12So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. \n\n \n In Luke, this teaching has a more precise presentation, all occurring in Luke 6:31-38. \n \n My feeling here is that Matthew 7:12 provides the answer: this was a common rehearsal of the Law and the Prophets that had become over time attributed to a teaching of Jesus Christ. Clement does not reference Matthew or Luke for this teaching and, in fact, in none of the manifestations of it, does it appear to have been quoted from the same source.\n \n Another instance of this is 46:8 which is also found in Matthew 26:24 and Luke 17:2. Again, here, though it would seem that Clement is quoting from these gospels, he makes no reference to them:\n \n1 clem 46:7-8\n ...Remember the words of our Lord Jesus,\n 8 for he said, \"Woe to that person! It would have been good for him to not be born, rather than cause one of my chosen to stumble. Better for him to have a millstone cast about his neck and be drowned in the sea than to have corrupted my chosen.\"\n \n\n \n Here is the version in Matthew:\n \nMatthew 26:23-24\n 23Jesus replied, \"The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. 24The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" \n\n \n Here it is in Luke:\n \nLuke 17:1Jesus said to his disciples: \"Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come. 2It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin. 3So watch yourselves. \n \"If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 4If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him.\" \n\n \n Again, it does not appear that Clement was quoting either of these passages. And his lead in \"Remember the words...\" signifies a bit of oral tradition rather a written a source which traditionally is referenced by the words \"it is written\". \n \n Another important feature of Clement is his view of what \"gospel\" means. In past posts, I've pointed out that the word \"gospel\" did not originally mean stories about the life of Jesus or good news about the coming of the Kingdom of God, but that it was used in the Roman Empire to refer to news about the emperor, perhaps a proclamation that Emperor so-and-so has succeeded so-and-so. A gospel, then was viewed as a short pronouncement or proclamation. That is certainly how Paul uses it. Clement? The same as Paul:\n \n1 clem 42:1\n The apostles were given the gospel for us by the Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was sent forth from God. \n\n \n1 clem 47:1-3\n Take up the epistle of that blessed apostle, Paul.\n 2 What did he write to you at first, at the beginning of his proclamation of the gospel? \n\n \n Here Clement references the \"gospel\" but betrays no awareness of THE Gospels. The gospel for Clement like Paul is Christ crucified, risen and the coming of the kingdom of God. \n \n \n But Clement does not stand alone in his ignorance about THE Gospels at this time. It is uniform throughout the Christian world. No one quotes from the Gospels until, in fact, Marcion's gospel in the mid-second century. Not until Iraneaus (around 180) is there any reference to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Another early reference is a syriac document from around 140 CE. So from all this I would conclude that the Gospels emerged around the turn of the second century. That as late as about 100 CE there was no knowledge of the details of the life of Jesus.\n \n Just in passing let me mention the Shepherd of Hermas. This is a document dated to the early second century. Like Clement, the Shepherd reveals nothing from the Gospels, but does refer to the parable of the master's vineyard. However, the parable is not cited to either an earthly Jesus (and in fact it comes to Hermas in a vision) or a Gospel and has different take than its later manifestations. The view in Shepherd is clearly adoptionist, a tendency that I mentioned in passing in the Paul post and comes through clearly also in Hebrews. Again, another example that there just was no story resembling the Gospel story by the turn of the second century that was known to important christians. (Shepherd by the way is thought to have been written by the brother of Pius, bishop of Rome.)",
