   "I am not a Christian, very far from it in fact. I believe that religion has been corrupted and Christianity especially is not what it should be for most people. However, not being a Christian does not make me a bad person who will go to Hell. I work hard and attend college, have great friends and family, like to help others and basically just live life. I do not \"fear God\" or follow guidelines or rules from a book, I know what is right and wrong in my heart. \n \n That being said, I will be going in for an abortion this upcoming Saturday. I found out that I was pregnant about a week ago. I live with my boyfriend of 3 years, I'm sure we won't get married and that is okay, I don't need marriage to make myself feel whole as a person. We had always discussed that if I ever got pregnant we would have an abortion because we would not be fit parents. I'm still in college and he does not want children. We are also still both very young, I'm twenty-one and he is twenty-seven. When it actually happened it was very surreal. I had never imagined being pregnant and having to have an abortion, let alone this being my first pregnant experience. For the first few days I fell into a depression. I had extreme feelings of guilt, shame and anger towards myself. I thought, \"I have a baby inside me, my baby, how could I kill it!?\". I was also upset that my boyfriend didn't seem to be as upset or scared as I was, I felt as if I was carrying the entire burden. I did not think I was going to get over it, I thought I would have to leave my boyfriend because of everything, I didn't think I'd be able to look at him. I was angry and hurt and felt alone. After a few days things began to calm down. Even going in for the ultra-sound was not as traumatic as the first few days were. I suppose that I'd either come to terms with what I was going to be doing or had just suppressed all my emotions in order to not go crazy and kill myself. Now as I write this, I suppose I'm doing okay as I wait for the fateful day.\n \n The reason I'm writing this is because I want people to understand, Christian or not, that women who have abortions are not murdering barbarians. We are daughters, sisters, lovers and friends. We all have our own reasons for going through with it. It's possible that some do it for selfish reasons, maybe because they're not ready to give up their partying ways. However, it's not right to condemn all of us because of the actions of a few. Many of us, including myself, are not happy with this decision. It can eat us up inside and sometimes destroy us. Some of us are strong enough or have enough support from loved ones to cope with what we have had to do. We will never get over it, never stop thinking about the \"what ifs\", but it was a decision that we had to make for one reason or another. \n \n I've always considered myself to be \"pro-choice\" because I'm concerned with women's reproductive rights and a women's power and control over her own body. But let me tell you, after going through it yourself it is a completely different ball-game. I'm still pro-choice and probably always will be. This decision that I've made to abort my unborn but very much alive baby is going to be the hardest decision of my life. I hope that my letter has given some insight to the people who only have opinions and no experience. Please stop focusing on whether or not \"Jesus\" or whoever says that is wrong and consider that nobody likes to make this decision and nobody wants to kill a human life, life just sometimes has unfortunate circumstances. We are not barbaric killers, just people who make mistakes like everybody else. \n \n Sincerely,\n \n D",

   "I am very sorry that you have had this unpleasant experience and that you have had to make this medical decision.\n \n Thank you for sharing your story. It sounds like you have thought a great deal about your decision and have made a wise choice. I hope that you are rechecking your contraceptive practices and, if your boyfriend feels that he never wants to have any children, he should choose to have a vasectomy so that you won't be put through this sort of thing again. I hope that this is something you two can discuss honestly.\n \n I have never had to have an induced abortion but I am very aware that in most instances, women feel enormously relieved after the completion of the procedure. It is never a happy choice to make but the alternatives often promise to be far worse.\n \n Good luck!",

   "Listen, I had an abortion at your age and here it is 18 years later, I resent my decision, so much that I would give my own life, if I could turn back time and undo what I did then.\n \n But I can't go back in time so I just go on, and try not to think about it too much. When I do think about it, I always ask myself, \"why couldn't I turn around and walk out those doors when I first walked in\" \n \n Honestly, it's hard for me to read your post and what you will do on Saturday. I feel helpless, and sad for you, and your newly child.\n \n No one can say with certainty how you will feel and how an abortion affects you until after it is done. It may never bother you, or it may haunt you for the rest of your life. Everyone deals with abortion differently and only time will tell how it will affect you, if at all.\n \n I know you are 21 and I do remember what it was like to be 21. Have you spoken to your parents or any other loved one, besides your boyfriend? You don't need to speak to anyone, however, sometimes people who love us unconditionally, can give us input and even support to help you make a decision that will have a life-long impact.\n \n This week, a girl about 17 came in to the office where I work, with her mom, who was about early 40s with a baby in her arms. A natural assumption was the baby belongs to the woman in her 40s but the baby belonged to the teenager. \n \n What does this teenager have that we didn't have at 21? And the answer was right in front of me, the mom. Her mom was her support and anchor. Granted we all have different types of support and people we rely on, and sometimes, we have no one. Sometimes, we don't want to rely on anyone. You being 21 perhaps feel, you can handle this on your own, and there is no doubt you can handle this on your own. But more often than not, abortion is one of those topics we like to keep private especially if we plan on having one. \n \n You posting in a forum, gives you anonymity, no one knows you and perhaps you are looking for some kind of feedback, probably reassurance from the pro-choice side, perhaps even from the pro-life side. But let me tell you, neither side will be there for you in the end. Don't get me wrong, to a degree both sides \"care\", but at the end of the day, you're left alone to deal with the aftermath, and you'll pick up your own pieces. If you have an abortion and it does affect you, the pro-choice side can't take away your pain...ever. On the flip side however, if you kept your child, pro-lifers will be hard to find when you are struggling financially. \n \n However, the people that do care for you unconditionally, is not your boyfriend, but the folks who raised you, your parents, possibly your grandparents, your siblings, your best friends. You're only 21 and yes you are an adult and probably a responsible adult at that, however, you need to realize that being a responsible and mature person is not about an age number, or if you can handle things on your own, but a mature, responsible person is a person than can open up and talk with loved ones, even sometimes admitting that you may have made a mistake. We all make mistakes, we're only human, and frankly, I'll probably be making mistakes when I'm 80 years old. But when we do make mistakes, life altering mistakes, you must not go it alone, open up to those who have been there in your life. \n \n It may feel awkward opening up to others on such a private topic, you may feel that you let them down and possibly yourself, but the opposite is true. Opening up to others and admitting that you're not perfect and would like advice is the most responsible thing you can do for yourself and your child.\n \n I do not want you to have an abortion, but maybe you can postpone it one more week and think about it for one more week, and talk to others that love you (your boyfriend does not count).\n \n In the event you keep your appointment on Saturday, all I can say is I'm sorry, that you have to go through this event. I hope you will be okay.",

   "and consider that nobody likes to make this decision and nobody wants to kill a human life, life just sometimes has unfortunate circumstances. We are not barbaric killers, just people who make mistakes like everybody else.\n I'm a little confused by this and it seems you may be confused yourself.\n \n If you have so much doubt about your decision then perhaps you aren't making the correct one. Often times people conflict with what they want and what they know to be right. \n \n I really hate how some pro-lifers go around talking hate to people that have abortions....yes it is wrong but so is making someone feel worthless. Regardless of what a pro-lifer does, abortion is still going to be wrong...I think many people miss this point. If some pushy, arrogant, selfish, a-hole came up to me and started preaching to me how theft is wrong I would probably be turned off by him but I would still have to realize that it isn't these people that decide what is wrong....right and wrong just are what they are (an absolute if you will). Since you don't believe in a God you say you trust your heart. I can advise that you should be careful of this as some tend to make their heart believe what is right is what they want....a foolish mistake. \n \n Anyway, it seems like we are all trying to suck to you here...I doubt you will change your mind but it seems you are confused and should probably give it another week atleast.\n \n Hope this helps...if you wanted any help that is",

   "If there are 2 things I know VERY well, they are making mistakes that haunt you for the rest of your life, the kindo fmistakes that you see every time you close your eyes, that rob you of sleep, and that you would give your life to go back and correctt, and BS self justifications. BS justifications are usually made immediatly preceeding a mistake such as the above, and immeditaly following. In some cases, they last for years after. While they may sometimes sound good to other people, they do not mean #### when you are sitting in the dark on the couch while your family sleeps and try not to think of yourself as a monster.\n \n I accidentally shot a 7 yr old girl once. It was dark, and she was holding a stick, and it looked like a rifle. I turned myself in to be court martialed. There was a lengthy investigation and the shooting was found to be justifiable. Every man in my unit said that they were preparing to shoot her, I was just a little quicker. It was not an accident. She did not get hit with a stray bullet. I put the sights of an MP5 on her forehead and pulled the trigger. The, just to be sure that I had done the job, I fired twice at her center of mass, hitting her twice in the chest. We were not on a regular combat mission but rather a special recovery, so I was firing special hollow point ammo. It made an absolute mess of her head. Her mother and a brother (maybe 12) were less than 20 yards away, just out of sight (if I had been able to see them I would have recognized the situation for what it was and not fired). \n \n That experience has tainted the rest of my life. I see that little girl everywhere. The first tiem I held every one of my children (I have 3 now), I have seen that little girl and her destroyed head. Pretty much every time that anything good happens to me, EVER, it occurs to me that she will never get that kind of chance.\n \n I can sit there and give you BS justifications all day for how it happened, and how it was not really my fault. I can show you the results of a fairly intensive investigation that shows how it happened and how it was not may fault. I can show you statements for the 14 men who were with me that night explaining how it happened and how it was not my fault. I still feel like a murderer. Given the chance, I would gladly go back and kill myself and every member of my unit to keep her from having been killed. Unfortunatly, I don't get that chance so I live with my mistake. Even today, it is not uncommon to look at my 4 yr old and see that little girl. \n \n If you were not thinking of this thing as a baby, I would not worry about you, I would imagine that you would be fine. I don't really have strong opinions when it comes to abortion. I could not care less what jesus would do, and if there is indeed a god following the christian model, I think he is a sadistic ##### and I want nothing to do with him. \n \n When you are saying things like \"I have a baby inside me, my baby, how could I kill it!?\" (from your first post in this thread), there is a problem. \n \n In the abortion debate there is a huge amount of back and forth about when a baby becomes a baby, at what point it is viable, at what point life begins, etc.. \n \n At the end of the day, none of that means a damn thing in your case. In your case what matters is what YOU think. In this case, you seem to think that this is a living baby, and that you are killing it, and your justifications seem primarily aimed at convincing people that you are not a monster.\n \n I have never seen anybody actually work to justify personal things to strangers. When it appears that they are doing so, it generally seems that they are trying to justify things to themselves. \n \n In the real world, whether you have an abortion or not has no effect on me. In fact, whether you die tomorrow or live to be 120 and ide of old age, I will probably never know and really could not care less.\n \n You owe it to yourself to think REAL HARD abotu how you are going to think of this late on. From your post, it looks like there is a VERY STRONG possibility that you will spend the rest of your life believing that you killed a baby because you were not ready to give up partying. If that is the case DO NOT DO IT. Trust me, you do not want a mistake that you make when you are little more than a kid to taint every joyful occasion for the rest of your life. Been there, done that, got the T shirt, and it was NOT a good experiment.\n \n If, on the other hand, you do NOT believe that this is a baby, then go for it. Some people have abortions and think no more of it than they would trimming a hang nail. Some people kill the same way, regardless of the target. There are guys in my unit who would have dropped that little girl and never lost a seconds sleep over it. I am not one of them, and it does not seem like you are one of those who can have an aboriton and then forget about it.\n \n Legality does not matter. Religous implications do not matter. Other peoples moral considerations do not matter. What matters is YOU and what YOU are going to think about yourself in 5 years. \n \n As far as the whoel smoking and drinking thing, I would not worry about it much. My wife didn't know she was pregnant until she was over two months along. We were still partying pretty hard. She smoked about a pack and a half a day and we were going out drinking almost every night. My daughter is 4 now and scores above the 95th percentile in all categories, except intelligence, where she is off the chart. \n \n Think about the above when you make the decision. We are not talking abotu something that may make you a little sad for a while, we are talking about somethign with the potential to taint the rest of your life. If that is what is going to happen, it isn't worth it.\n \n If you decide not to terminate, go talk to your folks and start trying to figure out what is best for the baby. If you are on your parents insurance, there is a good chance that it will not cover the pregnancy (though it should cover any complications which arise from the pregnancy). Every state has state insurance programs for pregnant women (a requirement for receiving medicare funds) that will provide prenatal and delivery care, as well as care for 2 months following the babys birth, either free of charge or at an extremely reduced rate (the highest permissable cost is a $20 copay per appointment). \n \n If you think adoption would be best (and if you don't think you can handle having a baby, this may be best), you can walk into any adoption agency, explain the situation, and they will give you an entire stack of profiles of peope who will pay your medical and living expenses while you are pregnant in return for the chance to adopt the baby. My wifes brother and his wife have adopted 2 kids, and the available arrangements are incredibly flexible...from \"I don't even want to see the baby when it is born\" to \"I want to be able to stop by and see my son/daughter whenever I want\". Lot of options.\n \n You are not that far along. You have time to stop and think about this...and think HARD. It is all well and good for folks like Simone to refer to it as simply a \"medical procedure\" and blow it off. Especially since she has apparently never had to make the decision. I have a funny feeling that she is one of the lucky majority who sleeps just fine at night, and does not see the corpses of her mistakes when she closes her eyes. \n \n I am sure that you haev been through a painful breakup. Everybody has. If you are going into this thinking \"this is a baby and I am killing it because I am not ready and I want to keep partying\" the pain you are going to feel is a million times worse than that, and you will feel it for the rest of your life. You will probably learn to sheve it, if not, you will go bonkers and off yourself. But it will always be there. \n \n Anyway, this has turned into a novel, and I don't mean to preach. Like I said, though, I am an expert in BS self justification and mistakes that haunt you for the rest of your life. I know botht he former and the latter when I see them. The excuses you are throwing out here like \"not ready\" and \"may have screwed it up by drinking and smoking\" are not good enough. They won't last a year, and they both boil down to your fault. If you are going to come up with excuses, you need one that are totally not your fault and that will last for years. Trust me on this. You do nto what to go into a situation like this with bad excuses. Make sure they are damn good, because it is not others you have to convince, it is yourself.",

I am not really a person who believes in the whole concept of \"bad words\", I only believe in bad intentions. You can use the most innocuous words and have the worst intentions (which is what you do a lot of the time Steeeve). Besides, I've cussed before and they have ### it out so why not with this particular word...is it maybe because NOBODY CARES!? And If I'm going to get banned for insulting someone than why don't people get banned for calling people XXXXXX, XXXXXX etc that I see all the time. Sorry for hurting your feelings enough to get you to report me for something so ridiculous. Get over it.\n \n Anyway...I figured that you would assume that if what I said after \"BTW\" had absolutely nothing to do with anything you had said that you would just assume that I was talking to someone else. Not making myself clearer is the only thing I apologize for, which created this whole mess in the first place.\n \n If my post did go through or it just ended up somewhere else i'm sorry for repeating myself but I just wanted to make myself heard.\n\n \n We have had many people banned or warned for posting in the manner you are currently posting in...\n \n In case you failed to read the rules when you joined they are linked here: http://4forums.com/political/faq.php?faq=vb_faq#faq_new_faq_rules\n \n Be respectful on these forums or do us all a favor and don't post.",

Most all reporting posts that are name calling (such as calling someone an XXX randomly) are deleted. It has happened to me before.\n \n \"Do not use signatures that are likely it antagonize others\" This one came from a few people that would put stuff in their signatures to try and make another member look a certain way. It normally mispresented and thus they are not allowed anymore. It is a newer rule and a good one at that.\n \n \nThat is just rediculous and goes against free-speech, even if nobody likes what they have to say. \n You said this in response to this rule: \n Bigoted, racist, prejudiced or broad-brushed statements are not allowed. \n \n Now considering \"free speech\" doesn't apply to a forum that you are not paying for and someone else owns, I would say your thoughts are irrelevant.

   ". NOT ME!\n \n Nobody on this board knows anything about what it's like to have to make the decision to kill your unborn child. YOU ALL JUST THINK YOU KNOW\n\n \n I suggest you go back and read Caprii's post. It looks like she does know because she has dealt with it. She said:\n \n \nListen, I had an abortion at your age and here it is 18 years later, I resent my decision, so much that I would give my own life, if I could turn back time and undo what I did then.\n \n But I can't go back in time so I just go on, and try not to think about it too much. When I do think about it, I always ask myself, \"why couldn't I turn around and walk out those doors when I first walked in\" \n \n Honestly, it's hard for me to read your post and what you will do on Saturday. I feel helpless, and sad for you, and your newly child.\n \n\n \n The point I made to you in a previous thread which it sounds like Bell made to you in a PM is that you, as someone who is young and inexperieinced, needed to talk to the more experienced and more importantly to those you trusted. It sounds like you made your own choice, and listened to know one. I hope that is not true. I hope you sought good personal counsel. Many here have not denigrated your choice, merely pointed out that there may be effects of your choice that you cannot yet forsee. This is why it is important to talk with folks with experience. \n \n If you ever buy a home (in case you have not) I would hope you would talk with someone you trust who has been through the process rather than just go out and buy one. Big decisions should never be trusted to just one person's view (or even two really). People who are older are revered in most societies (othern than western culture). After all they got to be that old.\n \n I do hope you do not neglect the possible future effects of your choice. Daewoo was not trying to guilt you but to relate to you. Please see that. The internet is a lousy place to get advice or even opinions. You have no idea who you are talking to, really. YOu don't know me from the corner grocer or the guy on release from the county jail. You only know what I tell you. Kind of nutty to be listening to all of us now isn't it.\n \n EF",

Seek out people that you are able to trust and surround yourself with that community. If there was only one other person you trusted beside your boyfriend I would say you are missing a key component to your life. My wife is in her late fortys and has gone through some terrible times because of an abortion she chose to have early in life. All for good reasons at the time. She has worked through it though.\n \n If you never learn to trust others with yourself, you will find life to miserable. People who go to 12 step groups learn this lesson quickly.
