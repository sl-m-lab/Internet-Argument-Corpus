   "How would you control corporations? Anything that denies a corporation of its legal personhood thereby making shareholders personally liable for what the corporation does will eliminate the purpose of the corporation and thus destroy the corporation.\n\n \n Liability protection is the primary reason for a corporation, but not the only and why does that protection need to be dependant on being recognized as an entity with the same rights as a living person. That was not the intent behind the concept and a simple rewording of relevant law and poof you have liability protection plus you can get a handle on campaign finance. \n \n \nHowever, we can separate a corporation's directors and officers from its shareholders and make them personally liable for anything a corporation does at their direction. If a corporation violates the law, we can send its directors and officers to jail. And if a corporation's directors or officers mismanage the corporation for their own benefit, we can hold them personally liable.\n\n \n You can't regulate that management will act morally or responsibly, they are arguably prohibited from doing so. They are legally obligated to protect the interests of the stockholders. The best one can hope for is enforcement of current laws concerning negligence, make the ability of current government regulators to impose fines in ways that discourage violations. If 2nd offenses mandated management's termination (boards would be wise to tie any golden parachute to be void if this occurs) expedite imposition of fines and appeals process preventing lengthy and expensive circumstances that encourage making a deal. Change accounting and reporting methods to conform to one standard (believe it or not they aren't), 3rd or 4th offenses are considered willfull and gross negligence and subject to criminal prosecution of management. 5th violation and corporate charter is revoked management and board are prohibited from acting in the same capacity for 2 years.",
