   "Evolution is a process of successive alterations of DNA nucleotide sequences and gene groupings, copying errors, replication repeats, deletions, translocations, enzymatic lysis of nucleotide sequences, viral DNA insertions, radiation damage to nucleotide sequences, the effects of transposon genes, and perhaps extra cellular toxic insults that lead to phenotypic changes in the animal or plant. These changes more often than not lead to the death or non-survival of the organism, (i.e. a dead end.) But the occasional or rare one that survives, does so because the change is either survival neutral or advantageous. If the latter then the organism may be more successful than its ancestor and even replace or displace that ancestor.\n \n Evolution appears to proceed in a number of steps, some so gradual that they are not apparent except over long periods of time (Darwinian Natural Selection), and some occur rather radically in a relatively brief time of thousands or hundreds of thousand years, which is brief in geological time (Punctuated Equilibrium.) Some of the natural selection may be animal generated (sexual selection of certain male or female characteristics.)\n \n Those who study the evidence conclude that Evolution is as much of a fact as gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong subatomic forces, the spherical Earth, the Heliocentric Solar System, the Universe composed of galaxies containing billions of stars, grouped clusters of galaxies, super clusters of clusters of galaxies, light (visible) matter and dark (invisible) matter, and a universe estimated at 12-16 billion years old.\n \n The Theory is not evolution, but natural selection. A theory is a scientific, evidence based explanation of a phenomenon. Why do Christian and Islamic Fundamentalists reject the every fact of evolution? I think it is because they do not understand the evidence or do not wish to understand the evidence because it contradicts their need to believe that everything today was as it was when it was created by a magical act of conjuring with words, by a God or Gods.\n \n So Evolution, accepted as fact by scientists, unbelievers, and liberal Christians (Theistic Evolution.) Believers in Magical Creation by God are fighting evolution in the United States.\n \n What is the evidence proving Evolution? What is the evidence proving Magical Creation?\n \n The most obvious evidence for evolution is that rock solid evidence that one can see, feel, compare, and date. That is fossil evidence. We know for a fact that there are fossils. We further know that the fossils of animals and plants are different at successive periods of geological history. We know that the more primitive fossils are found in the oldest sedimentary layers. We know that some fossils show successive gradual changes in successively younger sediments. We know that hundreds of thousands of animals have ceased to live after certain points of time (extinction). We know that new forms of animals keep making appearances at thousands of points of time. We can trace individual animals through long sequences of their evolution from more primitive forms (horses, rhinoceroses, whales, and primates including human ones.\n \n There is often a challenge to our dating system. That it is imprecise. True it can vary by thousands of years for carbon, and a million or so with K-Argon. But when we are talking about ages of 70 million or 240 million years (a 5 million year two standard deviation) is rather trivial. Some claim that isotope delay is variable, but this is unsupported by any evidence. We can test isotope dating, by other crossed evidence.\n \n We know for a fact that there are tectonic plates making up the Earth's Crust. These plates are propelled by upwelling and down welling currents in the hot magma of the Earth's mantle. The result is that the plates drift slowly as the up welling at a rift zone pushes the left and right edges of two plates apart at about 2 cm per year. We know that this rate is constant for two reasons. The continental drift has been measured by satellite laser measurements for about 20 years and has remained consistently at 2 cm per year. \n \n We know that measurements of sediment, a long period type of measurement, average out dry years from wet years, and are remarkably consistent across the oceanic floor. We know that Earths magnetic poles reverse N to S and back to S to N every 10 or 11 thousand years. This causes Ferro-magnetic minerals to line up in those fields while liquid. It cools and the iron containing crystals remain aligned that way. When the field later reverses the newer oceanic plate shows the reversed polarity. Deep drilling of the ocean floor has shown these bands of alternating polarity reversals from the mid-oceanic ridge where they form all the way to the continental edges.\n \n Using these two measurements of tectonic plate and continental drift, we can estimate the age of sediments and igneous rocks at the continental margins. Using both the magnetic field polarity reversals and satellite measurements of 2 cm/yr we can estimate that Cameroon in Africa started separation from the bulge of Brazil 220 million ago in the late Permian Period. (We divide the distance traveled by the velocity of 2 cm/yr.)\n \n Then we use isotope dating of igneous rock on the Brazil coast and the Cameroon coast and get 240-220 million years. By geological timescales this is like hitting bulls eye with a bullet at 600 metres. Thus the accuracy of isotope measurement of fossil ages is supported by collateral evidence of continental drift velocities, ocean floor polarity shift bands, and by a less specific but generally approximate date of sedimentary layering rates. Knowing that we can safely estimate the approximate ages of fossils, and group them phenotypically/anatomically, we can write much of the story of Evolution for the past 500 million years with only minor gaps that are surprisingly few considering the length of the total record.\n \n We know that over vast periods of time millions of animals and plants have appeared and later became extinct in so many separate periods that a single time origin is easily debunked.\n \n Now with the DNA genome projects for humans and several other animals we know new ways to measure evolution as well as explain the mechanisms. DNA mutation rates are relatively predictable and constant for various families of animals. We can use these mutational rates to back date the approximate time that humans and Chimps separated from our common ancestor, 5-7 million years ago. The fossil evidence suggested 8 million years and the debate goes on about the slight difference but to me the closeness is more important than the difference. Chimps and we diverged from a common ancestor sometime between 5-8 million years ago. The very divergence may have taken a million or more years.\n \n Additionally the Human Genome project has shown us that old genes are not discarded entirely. Some are used at transitional stages of our own human embryology. We, you and I, go through a single cell form (like protozoa), a cell clump form (like slime molds), a blastomere (ball of cells like a living volvox), a two layered phase (like a coelenterate), a primitive chordate with a notochord, a fish like stage with gill slits, to a transitional stage between fish and amphibians (gill slits, tail, and legs), a reptile like stage, primitive mammal, and advanced mammal stages (best observed in the addition of newer evolved brain sections.) The old parts such as gill slits are recycled into ear bones, labyrinthine and cochlear parts of the ear, and parts of the vocal apparatus. Often a child is born with a residual gill slit (branchial cleft cyst) or even a tail.\n \n In summary the evidence for animal and plant evolution over 2 billion years is supported by fossil evidence, chronological dating cross checked by three other methods, by DNA comparisons of species, and most vividly by human embryology.\n \n Cuchulainn",

   "Fish to Amphibian Transition\n \n Copyright 1997 G.R.Morton. \n \n This may be freely distributed as long as no change is made to the text and no charge is made.\n \n http://www.glenn.morton.btinternet.co.uk/transit.htm \n \n Creationists claim that there are no transitional forms. This claim is made over and over as if it were a mantra. The plain fact is that there are transitional sequences but they never discuss the details. This is a sequence of fossils which occupy the transition from fish to amphibian.\n \n 378 MYR ago- Panderichthys--These are lobe-finned fish. Panderichthys was a rhipidistian,osteolepiform fish. The skull bones of these fish are bone for bone equivalents to the skull bones of the earliest tetrapods. (Carroll 1988, p. 160). These are the only fish whose fin bones fit the tetrapod pattern of humerus, ulna and radius in the forelimb and femur, tibia and fibula in the hindlimb. (Thomson, 1991, p. 488), Yet these limbs still have fins on them (Coates, 1994,p. 174). Their brain case is so much like that of the earliest tetrapod, they were originally classified as tetrapods until a complete skeleton was found. Then is was proven that they were really still fish. (Ahlberg and Milner, 1994, p. 508). This fish also had lungs and nostrils (Vorobyeva and Schulze, 1991, p.87) but also had gills. These things really looked like tetrapods until you see the fins. The teeth had infolding enamel which is identical to that of the earliest tetrapods. Unlike all fish but like the tetrapods, the Panderichthys have lost the dorsal and anal fins, leaving 4 fins in the place where legs would be in the Tetrapods.(Ahlberg and Milner, p.508). This contradicts Gish's claim that there is no fossil which shows loss of fins. (Gish, 1978, p. 78-79). Unlike fish, Panderichthys had a tail, like the amphibians with the fins stretched out along the top (Carroll, 1995, p. 389; Carroll, 1996, p. 19). \n This is not a Panderichthys, but it is a related lobe-finned Devonian fish out of my personal collection. It gives some idea of what they looked like. \n \n \n Panderichthyids and all other osteolepiform fish had a choana, a hole between the nasal passage and the mouth. This hole is missing in all other lobe-finned fish. It allowed air to pass from the nose into the mouth.. But Panderichthys also had external nostrils which were in the same position as those of the early tetrapods. (Schultze, 1991, p. 58). The lower jaws of panderichthyids had broad coronoids with fangs (Ahlberg 1991, p. 299)\n \n 370--Fish similar to Sauripterus. A very recent discovery in Pennsylvania by Daeschler and Shubin (1998, p. 133; Kinney, 1998) is of a fish which has fins, which is not unusual, except that inside of the fins were 8 fingers attached in a similar way to those of the earliest amphibians (see below). While many doubt that this creature is on the direct line of descent between fish and amphibians, the existence of fins with 'fingers' is illustrative of the fact that intermediate forms (broadly defined) do exist. Interestingly, as we shall see some of the earliest amphibians also had 8 digits on their hands. \n \n \n 368-Elginerpeton is a very primitive tetrapod found at Scat Craig, Scotland. Its lower jaw had coronoid fangs as did Panderichthys but they were smaller (Ahlberg 1991, p. 299). The very primitive limb bones found with it include an Ichthyostega-like tibia and an ilia and shoulder girdle comparable to the future Hynerpeton. There are no hands or feet found with the fossil so while the animal is quite tetrapod like in the parts which have been preserved, the final proof of its tetrapod status is missing. (Carroll, 1996, p. 19)\n \n 368 MYR- Obruchevichthys was found in Latvia and Russia but is only known from a partial mandible. The similarity between this mandible and Elginerpeton caused Ahlberg (1991) to reclassify this as a tetrapod. This creature also shows the coronoid fangs of the Panderichthys but they were also smaller than the panderichthyid fangs. Daeschler notes that this animal also has the parasymphysial fans of a tetrapod. (Daeschler, 2000, p. 307) \n 365-363 MYR -Hynerpeton-more advanced legs and pelvic girdle than Ichthyostega. (Carroll, 1996, p. 19) The coronoid fangs are not present. It lacked internal gills (Daeschler et al, 1994, p 641). There is no mention of feet having been found in Daeshler's report. The shape of the pectoral girdle implies both an aquatic and a terrestrial lifestyle. \n \n 365-363 MYR -Densignathus rowei--known only from the jaw but it is transitional between fish and amphibians. It has the parasymphysial fang of a stem tetrapod but also the coronoid fangs of a fish. As noted above Daeschler says this combination is also found in Obruchevichthys, Ventastega and Metaxygnathus. (Daeschler, 2000, p. 307). The earlier fish had a closed manidbular canal while the early amphibians had an open mandibular canal. Densignathus rowei is intermediate with a partially enclosed mandibular canal. Once again a transitional trait.\n \n 363 MYR-Ichthyostega-- Is the first animal with feet but the feet are different than most tetrapod feet. They are much like Acanthostega but has 7 digits on his hindlimb. His legs were only good for being in water. They could not support his weight. (Coates and Clack, 1990, p. 67) These are half evolved legs since they have more digits than the normal tetrapod but fewer bony rays than the fish and they are unable to support the weight. This contradicts Gish's statement that there are no half-evolved feet. (Gish, 1978, p. 79) . Ichthyostega had external nasal openings and a choana like that of the Panderichthys (Schultze, 1990, p. 35). He has lungs and gills. His tail was long with fins above and below like that Panderichthys and Acanthostega. (Carroll, 1992, p. 46). His legs were tetrapod having humerus, ulna and radius in the forelimb and femur, tibia and fibula in the hindlimb. (see diagram Carroll, 1992, p. 46). \n \n 363 MYR- Acanthostega- has four legs, lungs but still has internal gills. (Coates and Clack , 1991, p. 234) He has 8 digits on his front leg (see second picture below); seven on his back feet. (Carroll, 1995, p. 389) His legs could not support his weight either. (Coats and Clack, 1990, p. 66-67). Ahlberg (1991, p. 301) points out that the front legs were more fish-like than the back legs. He has fishlike lower arm bones (Coates and Clack 1990, p. 67). Once again, contrary to Gish (1978, p. 79), these are still half-evolved legs. He also retains a caudal fin (Coates, 1994, p. 175) and an elongated tail with fins stretched out along the top. (Carroll, 1995, p. 389). The stapes, the bone which eventually became part of the hearing apparatus in tetrapods was still used for ventilation of the gills (Clack,1989, p. 426). \n \n Acanthostega served from http://www.sciencenews.org/Sn_arc99/5_22_99/bob1a.jpg \n \n Reconstruction of Acanthostega gunnari is reproduced here by the kind permission of Dr. Jennifer Clack \n \n One thing that the earliest tetrapods lacked were hands that could flex. We can curl our fingers and toes because of the arrangement of the tendons in our digits. None of the above tetrapods could do this simple trick because they lacked a notch in the flexor surface on the phalanges. Because of this, walking on a rocky surface, which requires the ability to curl the paws around various obstacles, would have been difficult for the early tetrapods. Acanthostega and Ichthyostega would only have been able to bend their hands slightly (Monastersky, 1999, p. 329). Thus, while they had hands, they were partially evolved hands. It wasn't until the evolution of Casineria kiddi, that these notches are found on each phalange. (Paton et al, 1999, p. 512)\n \n 350 MYR ago. Pederpes finneyae- This creature was discovered at Dumbarton, Scotland. It has 5 toes on each foot with the exception of a small relict finger/toe on the forepaw. Because of this, this creature is transitional between the later amphibians and Acanthostega and Ichthyostega discussed above (Carroll, 2002, p. 35). This creature has a primitive stapes, the bone used in hearing and it resembles that of Acanthostega rather than those of the later amphibians. The expanded triangular flair on the ribs resemble those of Ichthyostega. (Clack, 2002, p. 74). But, unlike the early tetrapods this creature has a \"clearly distinguishable metatarsals that are bilaterally and proximodistally asymmetric.\" (Clack, 2002, p.75). This is a trait which it shares only with the later terrestrially adapted amphibians. Thus, once again, this creature shows intermediate or transitional traits. Those who erroneously claim transitional forms don't exist, haven't looked at the data.\n \n 340 MYR ago. Fully evolved amphibians.

   "Harpagus bidentatus\n \n IBEROMESORNIS\n (pronounces eye-BER-oh-mes-OR-nis) Iberomesornis (meaning \"Iberian=Spanish intermediate bird\") was a small, early, toothed bird that lived during the early Cretaceous period. It was capable of powered flight. It had tiny, spiky teeth in its beak and was the size of a sparrow. Its hip was primitive compared to modern birds; its ilium, ischium, and pubis were all parallel and directed backward. Iberomesornis was named by paleontologists Sanz and Bonaparte in 1992. Fossils were found in Spain. The type species is I. romeralli.\n \n ICHTHYORNIS\n Ichthyornis (meaning \"fish bird\") were 8 inch (20 cm) long, toothed, tern-like, extinct bird that date from the late Cretaceous period. It had a large head and beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds. It lived in flocks nesting on shorelines, and hunted for fish over the seas. Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas, USA, by a member of paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh's Yale University expedition. Fossils have been found in Kansas and Texas, USA and Alberta, Canada.

   "THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\n \n Life began over 3500 million years ago. Animals (multicellular heterotrophs) originated 700 million years ago. The most important period in animal evolution was the Cambrian: 505 - 540 million years ago. It was during the Cambrian that most invertebrate phyla originated. The Cambrian explosion was the nearly simultaneous appearance of virtually all invertebrate phyla in a very short period of time (5-10 million years).\n \n What was life like before the Cambrian?\n \n There was animal life before the Cambrian. Pre-Cambrian animals are called the \"Ediacaran fauna\" (after the Ediacara hills in southern Australia where an Australian geologist (Spriggs) discovered pre-Cambrian fossils in 1946. There are several thousand fossil specimens that represent a number of marine animals: cniderian-like animals (of many body forms, some like modern jellyfish, others like stalked, branched fronds); platyhelminth-like animals (elongated, flattened worms), and annelid-like animals (segmented worms of various shapes and forms).\n \n The Ediacaran fauna is very controversial. Some scientists say these animals were the ancestors to the Cambrian fauna, others say they went extinct before the Cambrian: \"failed experiments\" that left behind no ancestors. Some even say they weren't animals at all, but were elaborately shaped lichens. Most believe, however, that the Ediacaran animals were the ancestors of the Cambrian animals.\n \n What was the earth like in the Cambrian?\n \n It was quite different to our modern world. The continents were not well-separated and mostly spread out along the equator or in the southern hemisphere. Canada straddled the equator, Australia was in the northern hemisphere. Life only existed in the sea, the land was sterile and desert-like. The sea was just as salty as it is now, and the atmosphere was similar to ours (possibly a little less oxygen). The earth rotated a little faster, one year would have been about 400 days.\n \n What was life like in the Cambrian?\n \n It was very different to anything that came before it. In a short span of evolutionary time (5 - 10 Ma), there was enormous radiation in body forms. Suddenly there were animals with exoskeletons and hunters and scavengers. There were molluscs and echinoderms and early chordates and arthropods and just about all the modern-day phyla. There were some weird animals that are nothing like modern species. It is easier to say what was not present than to list what was there: there were no insects, vertebrates or plants (they all evolved later, on land) and there were no Bryozoans (they are the only phylum to evolve after the Cambrian).\n \n Was the Cambrian explosion a real burst of disparity in body forms or was it merely a burst in fossilisation?\n \n Did the sudden increase in invertebrate fossils result from the evolution of new phyla in the Cambrian, or does it reflect the evolution of hard parts that fossilised more easily? It is true that the Cambrian saw the start of exoskeletal parts that fossilised well. Maybe we see the huge increase in diversity and disparity because these hard parts suddenly show up in the fossil record, but in fact soft-bodied animals were present before this, so there was no real explosion in body forms or species.\n \n It is unlikely that it was merely an increase in fossils because:\n \n Soft-bodied animals can fossilise. The Ediacaran fauna (soft-bodied) fossilised, and the soft-bodied animals of the Cambrian fossilised. So why don't we find any of the Cambrian soft-bodied animals in the pre-Cambrian fossil beds? The Cambrian explosion shows an increase in both the hard-bodied and soft-bodied fauna.\n \n There are no pre-Cambrian trace fossils (i.e. tracks, scratches, burrows etc., trace fossils are common and easily preserved) that would suggest the Cambrian animals were present, so it is unlikely that the animals were present but just didn't fossilise. \n What caused the Cambrian explosion?\n \n This is unknown and hotly debated. There were 200 million years of only simple animals then- BAM!- nearly the full spectrum of the present-day phyla were there. What was the trigger?\n \n Maybe there was an environmental trigger, like a change in climate; but there is no evidence of this. Possibly there was a genetic trigger, like the evolution of neural tissue. [the evolution of nerve tissue may have opened the door to a whole range of alternatives, like cephalisation, bilateral symmetry, movement etc.]. But neural tissue didn't evolve in the early Cambrian, it was already present in the Ediacaran fauna (cniderians have nerve networks, platyhelminthes have nerves, ganglia, bilateral symmetry etc). So it's unlikely that this was the trigger for the huge radiation in forms.\n \n Maybe there was a biological trigger. I find the most plausible explanation to be that the diversity of form was caused by the evolution of predation. There was no evidence of predation prior to the explosion, and lots of evidence after it: suddenly there are weapons and defence systems (e.g. shields, mimicry, camouflage, behavioural protection and predator deterrents). Selection pressures generated on predators as well as on prey could cause massive and rapid evolutionary changes. There is no doubt that predation played a major role in the evolution of the Cambrian animals, but whether it was the trigger for the diversification of the fauna is still debated.\n \n What fossils do we have from the Cambrian period?\n \n There are many Cambrian fossil beds, but most of them contain only hard parts (e.g. exoskeletons, spicules). There are three sites that contain both hard and soft bodied Cambrian animals:\n \n The Burgess Shale in Canada\n \n The Sirius Passet in Greenland\n \n The Chengjian in China.\n \n These three sites show us that about 95% of Cambrian animals were soft-bodied. Typical Cambrian fossil beds (i.e. those with only hard-part preservation) contain only 5% of the Cambrian fauna. The three sites with soft-bodied preservation are very important sites because it is from them that we get a picture of Cambrian life. The most famous (and first documented) of these sites is the Burgess Shale.\n \n \n THE BURGESS SHALE FOSSILS \n \n \n Aysheaia\n Hallucigenia\n Marella\n Trilobite\n Anomelocaris\n Wiwaxia\n \n \n \n \n In 1909 Charles Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale fossils in the Rocky mountains on the west coast of Canada.\n \n Walcott was a high-school dropout who:\n \n headed the Smithsonian (the big USA Museum/Research institute); become a world-famous geologist; became a world-famous palaeontologist; is called the grandfather of the space age because of his work as the chairman of the Aeronautics National Advisory Committee, and was very famous in WWII because he played a big role in applying science to warfare and his ideas influenced how battles were fought. \n \n \n During the Cambrian, the Burgess Shale site would have been equatorial. The animals lived in a warm, shallow sea on a submarine escarpment at the base of a limestone cliff that was built by reef-forming algae. The area of the seafloor where they lived was not stable. It lies on a fault and has a lot of tectonic activity, as evidenced by the fact that it is now the Rocky mountains. The sea floor in that region was prone to \"slumping\". There were big fissures on the sea floor and slumping occurred at the fissures when there was any tectonic activity, earthquakes or even big storms. During slumping, the sediment breaks off at a fissure and starts sliding downwards into deeper waters. The blocks of sediment break up on the way down and when it hits the bottom of the slump it is a huge cloud of fine-grained sediment. Obviously all the animals that were living on or in (or even above) the sediment would have been carried along in the slump, and they would have been entombed in the settling dust afterwards. It is thought that the animals would have died during the slide (they were preserved in all sorts of directions, some on their heads, some upside down etc). During the slide, the animals would have undergone large changes in temperature, huge amounts of silt that would have suffocated them and a rapid decrease in oxygen. The bottom of the slump was a deep and anoxic environment in which no animals lived (which we know because the fossils sediments show no trace fossils, e.g. burrows, footprints, scratch marks). The dead animals were protected from scavengers and decomposing bacteria because the water was anaerobic (devoid of oxygen).The silt was so fine that it separated the appendages of the little animals and resulted in very clear and detailed fossils. These freak conditions resulted in some of the loveliest and most well-preserved fossils we have.\n \n Today the fossils occur in sheets of easily separated shale. There are thousands and thousands of specimens covering a period of millions of years. Most of the specimens are arthropods (37%). Trilobites are extremely common. There are representatives of all the major phyla we know today and there are also fossils of animals that are so weird we don't know what they are.\n \n (cont. on next page)",

   "I have picked out 7 of the fossil animals to show you here:\n \n Marella splendens: The most common Burgess Shale fossil. About 2cm long. A strange head shield with four long, backward sweeping spines. Cylindrical, segmented body with 25 somites, each with a pair of biramous appendages (jointed leg + feathery gill branch). It is blind as it has no eyes. It is an arthropod.\n \n Hallucigenia sparsa: Bizarre animals with seven pairs of movable spines below a cylindrical body. Seven vertical tentacles dorsally, each terminating in a pincer-like appendage. Globular head. Rare fossil. Up to 3cm long. \n \n Aysheaia pedunculata: caterpillar-shaped with a pair of anterior appendages and 10 pairs of short, conical legs. The trunk is annulated and the mouth is surrounded by finger-like projections. It resembles the modern-day Onycophoran (Peripatus) and has characteristics of both annelids and arthropods: annelid-like eye and muscular wall with thin cuticle; arthropod-like tracheal system and coelom. (Extant Onycophorans are terrestrial, Aysheaia was marine). Rare fossil. 1-6 cm long. \n \n Wiwaxia: a slug-like animals covered in dorsal sclerites. Double row of spines. The ventral surface was naked. Jaw with a scraper-like structure, ventral muscular foot. Crawled along the surface. Rare fossil. 3-50 mm.\n \n Anomelocaris: The genus name means \"strange shrimp\". A small shrimp without a head. Up to 20 cm long. \n \n Peytoia: a strange jellyfish-like animals that looks like a tinned pineapple ring. \n \n Trilobites: Tri (three) lobe (lobes): three lobes to their bodies. Arthropod: chitinous exoskeleton, jointed limbs, segmented bodies. Marine, benthic. Extremely common fossils, over 500 species. Most were a few cm long, but some got up to 70 cm.\n \n \n \n An interesting observation about the trilobites: many specimens had bite marks, but just about all the bites are on the RHS, so either their was one predator (probably Anomalocaris) that was of a single handedness; or trilobites (all species) had a tendency to escape in the same direction when threatened).\n \n \n Why is the Burgess Shale interesting?\n \n It allows us to picture Cambrian life, to examine the early representatives of the invertebrates. It raises some big questions about evolution, like 'Would life today be totally different if we replayed the tape?'. It shows how science works: how mistakes are made and ideas develop. To look at these issues, we'll go through the historic sequence of events.\n \n First, Walcott found the fossils in 1909. He did an excellent job of collecting, documenting and writing about them. What he did (and what any of us would have done in those days) is that he shoehorned each animal into a modern day phylum, without considering the possibility that there were different phyla in the Cambrian. Modern invertebrate phyla need not have been present in the Cambrian, and there may have been other phyla then that have since gone extinct. But Walcott fitted each specimen into one of our modern categories.\n \n Nothing much happened with the Burgess Shale fossils after Walcott died. Then in the 60s and 70s, a team of three scientists from Cambridge decided to have a new look at them: Harry Whittington and two graduate students: Simon Conway-Morris and Derek Briggs. They restudied Walcott's fossils and excavated more from the Burgess Shale deposits. They made very detailed studies of the fossils, even dissecting out very fine layers of shale to see hidden parts. Their basic conclusions were that the fossils were far less like modern-day animals than Walcott had alleged. They listed many species as \"from unknown phyla\" and started coining new phyla for many of them.\n \n In 1989, Steven Jay Gould wrote a book \"Wonderful Life\" that was all about the Burgess Shale fossils and what they tell us about evolution and life. The three heroes of his book were the 3 Cambridge scientists and he even suggested they get the Nobel prize for their exceptional work because it profoundly changed the way we look at the world. His book had two main points:\n \n The Burgess Shale fauna are much more diverse than modern-day animals...there were far more phyla then, and only some of these body plans have survived to the present. So disparity can be represented as a cone: lots of species in Cambrian, and far fewer now. \n Contingency: He says that more than half the Cambrian phyla are now extinct (due to mass extinction events) and that mass extinction kills off animals indiscriminately. The phyla that survived were no \"better\" than the phyla that died off...it is total chance whether an animal dies in a mass extinction (it doesn't matter how well adapted animal is...if its in the path of the comet, that's it). Contingency therefore plays a huge role in evolution. History is unpredictable due to the effect of random, chance events. If you played back the tape of life on earth, say from just after the Cambrian explosion, a totally different world would result. For example, what if the trilobites had not gone extinct.... maybe they would have become the dominant life form and invaded the land. The life we see around us today is largely due to a number of chance events, and if some small changes had been made, the world would be a very different place. \n \n Gould's book was popular with scientists and non-scientists alike (although some scientists criticised his views from the start). It had a big impact on the way many people think about evolution. Since then, more work has been done on the fossils, other Cambrian fossil beds (with soft body preservation) have been worked, and ideas have been changing. In 1998, Simon Conway-Morris (one of the Cambridge Three) wrote a book \"The Crucible of Creation\" which turns every thing on its head once again. It gives a very different picture to Gould's. It is very critical of Gould (causing some heated mud-slinging). It takes a new look at the fossils as well as a new look at the conclusions to be drawn from them.\n \n New look at the fossils:\n \n Hallucigenia: It was originally interpreted by Conway-Morris as an animal that walked on 7 pairs of rigid spines. Along its back was a row of 7 tentacles, each terminating in a pincer-like appendage. It was unlike any animal ever described and Conway-Morris suggested it be put into a new phylum. But there was always this nagging problem of how it walks on rigid spines. Then scientists working at the Chengjian site in China found a specimen that was intermediate between Hallucigenia and an Onycophoran: it had shorter spines and a double row of tentacles. On re-examining the Burgess specimens, they found a second row of tentacles hidden underneath the body. So, if you turn the specimen upside down, it becomes a lobopod.\n \n Anomalocaris and Peytoia: The headless shrimp and the pineapple-ring jellyfish were found to be parts of a single animal (now called Anomalocaris canadensis). The shrimps were the front appendages and the jellyfish was the mouth (entire specimen found by Whittington in 1981). Anomalocaris was probably the largest Cambrian predator (about 60cm, but the ones found at Chengjian are up to 2m long). Some had pieces of trilobites in their guts. They were probably the terrors of the Cambrian sea.\n \n It turns out that virtually every specimen can be placed in a modern-day phylum. It's possible that not a single new phylum needs to be raised to account for the entire Burgess Shale fauna. Walcott got it pretty much right. For example, Walcott called Wiwaxia an annelid: a polychaete worm. Everyone laughed at that one...it was obvious that it was similar to a mollusc (like a chiton, radula, foot, plates etc) but didn't quite fit there, so must be a new phylum. Now recent work has looked at the sclerites and found that they are very much like polychaete parapodia with setae etc. It IS very similar to polychaetes as Walcott had said.\n \n \n New molecular work has shown that annelids and molluscs are in fact quite closely related. Also shows that nematoda and arthropoda are closely related. Originally it was thought that annelids and arthropods were close and Onycophorans were their common ancestors...now not so sure about this. The relationship of annelids, arthropods, molluscs and nematoda is still unclear.\n \n \n So it seems like it is NOT true that there were more phyla in the Cambrian than there are today. The diagram of disparity is not like a cone, but more like a very rapid increase in the number of phyla in the Cambrian, and then stayed more or less the same thereafter (there is only one new phylum that has evolved since the Cambrian....Bryozoa). This has major implications because it means that the phyla did not become extinct in mass extinctions, and so contingency has maybe not played such a major role.\n \n \n Note that this refers to the phylum level. At the species level, contingency obviously plays a major role. Many species become extinct at mass extinctions, and it is a random pattern of extinction. But at the phylum level this appears not to be the case, all the original phyla survived the mass extinctions.\n \n Everyone agrees that the number of species has increased since the Cambrian. There are probably twice the number of species now than there were in the Cambrian (event though there were so many big mass extinctions along the way).\n \n \n It seems like the major body plans were established in the Cambrian and have remained very conservative thereafter. E.g. mollusca: huge radiation in species and lots of variety in shape, but still stuck to the basic body plan of unsegmented, triploblastic, protostome, coelomate with an open blood system etc. So there has been an increase in diversity (number of species) but not in disparity (number of body plans).\n \n (cont. on next page)",

   "Conway-Morris' ideas about contingency follow this idea through: he says that if you play the tape of life over again, contingency would not have such a profound effect. You would arrive at a modern world not very different to this one. This is because ecology and anatomy allow for only so many solutions to the problems of life (like breathing, moving, eating, reproducing etc) and these are going to evolve along fairly predictable patterns. The \"real\" range of possibilities is actually quite restricted and animals will stumble upon the same solutions to problems many times. Examples:\n \n The eye evolved independently in many groups.\n \n Both placental and marsupial mammals produced a sabre-toothed large cat carnivore on separate continents.\n \n Dolphins evolved from dog-like animals but they are now shaped just like a fish because that's the best shape to be in order to move through the water\n . \n Intelligence arose separately in octopus and humans.\n \n Given a new beginning, the re-emergence of life forms has a basic predictability. The details may differ, but the basics will be the same. You will always get gut endoparasite, there will always be small flying insect-like things, there will always be fish-like things. The differences between the two worlds would be trivial.\n \n \n One contingency may have been very important:\n \n It would not be a trivial effect if the dominant, intelligent, powerful, so-called 'superior' life form in the parallel universe were incapable of destroying the planet the way we do. Maybe a chance event that prevented it from wreaking havoc would be enough of a contingency to change the entire future of life on earth.\n \n \n \n HOX GENES\n \n Our understanding of the relationship between animals has come from detailed examination of their body plans. Animals with a common anatomical body plan are put into a single phylum. We use features like the number of cell layers, the type of symmetry, patterns of embryonic development. Recently there has been a huge surge in research and understanding of body plans and phylogenetic relationships because of the discovery of HOX genes in the 80s.\n \n What are hox genes?\n \n How does a single fertilised egg develop into a whole, functioning, complex animal? What tells each of the cells in the developing embryo that it must switch on some of its genes and switch off others so that it becomes the appropriate cell type? What is organising the highly controlled and complicated network of well-timed events during embryogenesis? The answer is: Hox genes. They orchestrate development. They determine where the head of the animal grows relative to the rest of the body, and control where the body parts are positioned. They are developmental genes that switch other genes on and off. They are called selector genes because their expression within a region of the embryo causes its cells to select a particular route of morphological development.\n \n How do they work?\n \n The hox gene makes a protein that binds to DNA in a way that turns the DNA (gene) on or off. Hox genes code for proteins called homeodomain proteins (60 amino acid long sequence). These are regulatory proteins that recognise and bind to specific sequences of DNA and switch these genes on and off at specific stages.\n \n How many are there and where are they?\n \n All animals have hox genes, from sponges to kangaroos to snails. Hox genes occur in clusters on the chromosomes. Different species have different numbers of hox genes. More complex animals have more hox genes. Invertebrates have a single cluster of hox genes on a single chromosome. Nematodes have 4 individual hox genes within the cluster. Flies have 8 hox genes in the cluster. In the vertebrates, the clusters have duplicated so that mice have 4 clusters (each on a separate chromosome) and within each cluster they have up to 10 individual hox genes. The more complex the body of the animals, the more hox genes are needed to control its development. Different hox genes control different parts of the body, e.g. one of the hox genes controls head development, another controls the abdomen.\n \n What happens when they mutate?\n \n When mutated, hox genes produce dramatic effects on the structure of the animal, such as replacing body parts with a structure normally found elsewhere. They are master genes that affect and control gene expression of many subordinate genes. Experimental changes in these genes therefore cause major alterations, like legs growing out of eye balls. Some human birth defects are thought to be caused by hox gene mutations, e.g. cleft palate. A drug (retino acid) which is used to treat acne, seems to interfere with hox genes and cause human birth defects.\n \n What is unusual about hox genes?\n \n They have two unusual properties: they show colinearity, and they are highly conservative.\n \n Colinearity: Genes are usually in a totally random order on chromosomes and there is very little rhyme or reason in the order they appear. However, this is not true for hox genes. There is a strict correspondence between the order of the hox genes on the chromosome and the order of the body section they control. In the fruitfly, the 8 hox genes line up in a cluster along the chromosome, and each one affects a different part of the body. They line up in the same order as the parts of the fly they affected: the first gene controls the development of the mouth, the second the face, the third the top of the head, the fourth the neck, the fifth the thorax, the sixth the front half of abdomen, the seventh the rear half of abdomen, and the eighth controls various other parts of abdomen. We don't know why hox genes are colinear, but it may have something to do with the fact that animals develop from the front to the back. The colinear expression of the hox genes follows a temporal sequence, so maybe each hox gene switches on the next one in the line.\n \n Conservative: All animals have hox genes and, amazingly, all hox genes are very similar to each other. If you compare a single hox gene (MSX gene) from sea urchins and mice: both of them consist of about 180 nucleotides, and both code for a protein of about 60 amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in the sea urchin and the mouse differ only in a single amino acid. The rest have remained the same over 600 million years of evolution. Hox genes are so amazingly conservative that geneticists do all sorts of weird things like remove a hox gene from a fly and replace it with the equivalent human hox gene and produce an absolutely normal fly. This conservatism has a major implication, it means that hox gene evolved only once and so all animals evolved from a single ancestor.\n \n (cont. on next post)",

   "How can we use hox genes to understand phylogeny?\n \n It is difficult to determine the relationship between the various phyla because the body plans appeared in a very short time and have remained essentially unchanged since then. The evolutionary information in most genes is lost by random mutations over this evolutionary time scale. Hox genes, however, evolved very early on and are very conservative. Since the hox genes are what regulate the body plan, their evolution has paralleled the stasis of the body plans they created. The original function of hox genes was probably to specify the fundamental anterior-posterior axis of early animals. Once such a system of control had evolved, it could be modified to produce new body shapes for the different animal phyla. The more complex body plans needed more hox genes [achieved through gene duplication within a single cluster (all invertebrates) and through cluster duplication (vertebrates)]. So one can examine the number of hox genes at various points on the phylogeny. We are starting to get some interesting ideas about the relationships between the phyla.\n \n Arthropods and vertebrates:\n \n An interesting point to emerge from Hox gene research is that arthropods and vertebrates are upside down versions of each other. Looking at two of the hox genes: one makes cells become part of the back and the other makes them become part of the belly. In arthropods and vertebrates, they are the opposite way around. The same hox gene has the opposite effect in arthropods and vertebrates. The common ancestor of the arthropods and vertebrates must have split into two forms, one that took to walking on its back and one that took to walking on its belly. One line became the vertebrates the other became the arthropods. Supporting evidence is from the fact that the central nervous system (CNS) of arthropods is ventral while the CNS of vertebrates is dorsal.\n \n \n The big question obviously is: what the #%^@ happened to hox genes during the Cambrian explosion?\n \n BIODIVERSITY: MARINE VS TERRESTRIAL\n \n There is an interesting pattern in biodiversity between the marine and terrestrial environments. Most phyla are marine but most species are terrestrial.\n \n There are about 35 phyla, 28 of these are marine (13 exclusively so).\n \n Eleven phyla are terrestrial (1 exclusively).\n \n We do not knows how many species there are, but definitely most species are terrestrial (there are more species of insects than of every other animals species combined.)\n \n \n \n Why is there greater phylum diversity in the sea but greater species diversity on land? This is hotly debated.\n \n Possibly there are more phyla in the sea because marine conditions make it possible for a greater range of body forms to exist (no constraints on drying out, support, temperature control, oxygen supply etc. For example, a cniderian body plan could never exist in a terrestrial habitat). All phyla evolved in the sea and the invasion of land was secondary, so only those body plans that were preadapted for life on land could conquer it.\n \n Why fewer species in the sea? There are fewer barriers to gene flow in the sea so maybe less chance of speciation. Marine species tend to be more widely distributed, so if something wipes them out in one area, they can recolonise the area from the remainder of their range. Possibly the marine environment is less variable, more homogenous (? questionable).\n \n \n \n \n References:\n \n Books:\n \n Stephen Jay Gould (1989) Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History.
