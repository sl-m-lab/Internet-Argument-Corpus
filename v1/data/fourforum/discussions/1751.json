   "Gay marriage is looming large in the national debate. It seems likely that Bush will force an amendment that defines marriage as something strictly between a man and a woman. I'm a heterosexual married man and I don't claim to have my mind all around the issue of gay rights. However, I was wondering what would happen if all married couples who believed gays deserve equal protection and the right to marry, if all these husbands and wives, jammed the system by filing for divorce, what impact it would have on the policy makers and institutions that depend on people being clearly defined as married. I know this would send shivers down the spines of the religious right who view marriage as the bedrock of civilization.",
