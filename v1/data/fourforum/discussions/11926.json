   "Leave it to someone on the left to punish someone for thinking for themselves ...\n \n Reid is apparently trying to get Lieberman removed from his position ...\n \n \"WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Joe Lieberman's affiliation with Democrats was in question after a meeting Thursday with Majority Leader Harry Reid, steamed over the Connecticut independent's high-profile support of John McCain for president.\n \n Reid, in a sternly worded statement after the 45-minute meeting, said no official decisions have been made. But an aide to the Nevada Democrat said Reid was leaning toward removing Lieberman as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential.\n \n \"While I understand that Sen. Lieberman has voted with Democrats a majority of the time, his comments and actions have raised serious concerns among many in our caucus,\" Reid said.\n \n Lieberman was Democrat Al Gore's vice presidential running mate eight years ago. He switched to an independent after he failed to win the Democratic Senate primary in Connecticut in 2006. Lieberman won the general election as an independent but is still registered as a Democrat.\n \n Although he aligns himself with Senate Democrats, Lieberman angered many Democrats for when he used a prime-time speech at the Republican convention this summer to criticize Barack Obama as an untested candidate beholden to Democratic interest groups. Republican McCain had considered making Lieberman, a longtime friend, his running mate this year before settling on Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.\n \n Bouncing Lieberman from his committee post would require the approval of the Democratic caucus, which is expected to meet this month.\n \n \"I want to spend some time in the next few days thinking about what Sen. Reid and I discussed what my options are at this point,\" Lieberman said. \"He promised me that he would do the same and we would continue these conversations.\"\n \n Republicans have said they would welcome Lieberman to their caucus.\n \n Democrats in the past had tolerated Lieberman's political straddling because he held their slim 51-49 majority in his hands. Now that Democrats have strengthened their hold in the Senate to at least 55 seats as a result of Tuesday's election, Lieberman no longer is vital to their majority control.\" More at My Way News - Reid looking to remove Lieberman as committee head",

   "From the same man that said:\n \n \nIt's time to move America forward, and this is the team that will do it,\" said Reid about his new leadership team. \"We're going to focus on bipartisanship. We're going to lead an open government. And we're going to deliver results. From Iraq to the economy, Americans want change, and the Senate Majority - - led by this distinguished, talented, experienced group - - is going to fight for change next Congress.\"\n\n \n The article is right on...now that the Dems don't need him, he is going to be kicked to the curb like a bag of smelly garbage. Reid talks about bipartisanship, but clearly does not want to practice it. Reid should understand that part of being bipartisan is accepting that people have their own opinions, and while he may not like Liebermans position, he should respect that Lieberman does not just have to fall into party lines. I applaud Lieberman for being able to put aside partisan feelings and speak against Obama and support McCain. It shows that he is true to his opinions, and follows his conscience no matter what may be thought of him by his cohorts. This is the kind of bipartisan politician that the democrats should be trying to embrace right now. \n \n With congressional approval ratings lower than the Bush administrations, perhaps Reid (and Pelosi for that matter), might want to focus on actually getting things done rather than fighting against that which they advocate. Just a thought.",
