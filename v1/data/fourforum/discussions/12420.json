   "When does a human organism become a human person?\n \n When does a human being become a human person?\n \n When does a living human body become a living human person?\n \nMany contemporary authors prominent in bioethical circles distinguish sharply between being a human being and being a human person. These authors claim that for an entity to be regarded as a person, it must have developed at least incipiently exercisable cognitive capacities or abilities..... \n \n (Another view} distinguishes between a living human body and a living human person.\n\n What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. May\n \n There is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:\n \n Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 \n \n One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.\n \n According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:\n \n \nA baby may look helpless. It can't walk, talk, think symbolically or overhaul the nation's banking system. Yet as social emulsifiers go, nothing can beat a happily babbling baby. A baby is born knowing how to work the crowd. A toothless smile here, a musical squeal there, and even hard-nosed cynics grow soft in the head and weak in the knees.\n \n In the view of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the extraordinary social skills of an infant are at the heart of what makes us human. Through its ability to solicit and secure the attentive care not just of its mother but of many others in its sensory purview, a baby promotes many of the behaviors and emotions that we prize in ourselves and that often distinguish us from other animals, including a willingness to share, to cooperate with strangers, to relax one's guard, uncurl one's lip and widen one's pronoun circle beyond the stifling confines of me, myself and mine.\n \n As Dr. Hrdy argues in her latest book, \"Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding,\" which will be published by Harvard University Press in April, human babies are so outrageously dependent on their elders for such a long time that humanity would never have made it without a break from the great ape model of child-rearing. Chimpanzee and gorilla mothers are capable of rearing their offspring pretty much through their own powers, but human mothers are not.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/science/03angi.html.\n \n I've had three children, which gave me an opportunity to observe intimately the development of infants. Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are. At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence. \"No! No! No!\" are the bywords of a two-year-old. \"No! I won't! And you can't make me!\"",

   "Simone, just some advice, in case you don't mind:\n \n I'm afraid that you have once again made a poll that is not inclusive of large chunks of the population. The pro-choice side is largely represented by the first two choices. I highly doubt that you will have anyone on this forum choose any of the last three choices. Meanwhile, you have completely exclude the standard pro-life belief of personhood beginning at conception.\n \n In any poll about the beginning of personhood, you really need at least the three minimum choices of:\n 1. Conception\n 2. Beginning of third trimester\n 3. Birth\n \n If you don't have all of those three, then you exclude large chunks of the population from your poll. It is only a small minority of respondents (at least in this forum) that would pick anything other than one of those three.\n \n Either way, my choice would be 2. Beginning of third trimester or, in your poll, the first one \"In the third trimester, occurrence of critical cognitive skills.\". \n \n Also, you would need to reword it from \"When Were You in Existence as You?\" to \"When Were You First in Existence as You?\" if you want to get at the point that I think you are trying to get at since, after all, right now as well as a moment before my death I will be in existence as me.\n \n ----------\n \n As for your three questions:\n \n When does a human organism become a human person?\n At the beginning of mental existence, around the beginning of the third trimester.\n \n When does a human being become a human person?\n Since human being is defined as human person, then my answer is the same as above.\n \n When does a living human body become a living human person?\n Same time as the first two answers.",
