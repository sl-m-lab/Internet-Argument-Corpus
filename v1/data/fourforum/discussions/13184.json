   "As derived from my exploratory campaign website.\n \n \n \n \n 1) FACT : THE US CONSTITUTION IS NOT IN EFFECT.\n \n The purpose of the Constitution is to set as law, the limits of the power of the government. \n \n YET....\n \n In 1933, FDR declared a state of Emergency, using the War and Emergency Powers Act of 1873, and that emergency has never been ended, in fact they have added several more on top of that. \n See : Senate report 93-549 FOR PROOF!\n \n or see http:/ /famguardian.org/Subjects/LawAndGovt/Articles/SenateReport93-549.htm\n or see http:/ /thecnc.org/Documents/SR93549.htm\n or.... google search for searchable sites, with the report.\n \n DURING a declared state of emergency, using the War and Emergency Powers Act of 1873, the Federal government is NO LONGER limited to any rules put forth in the Constitution, and gains, unlimited war powers. And they used it, to slowly DO ALL THE THINGS THE FOUNDING FATHERS TRIED TO AVIOD, LITERALLY, by establishing the Constitution as law! (That is what it is for! Supposed to be for!!)\n \n \n \n \n 2) Every politician in congress, including the president, swears an oath, TO UPHOLD, DEFEND, AND PROTECT THE U.S. CONSTITUTION!!!\n \n And they have all failed... or worse, are willing conspirators in the continuation of a completely un-constitutional government and system, which is no longer a legitimate government and functions as a for profit corporation OWNED by international investors.\n THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ROBBED, and every congressman knows this, and they violate their oaths of office with each day that they do not stand against it!!!\n \n \n \n \n 3) The supreme court members... know.. that the emergencies are still in place, and willingly accept it, and instead of ruling based on the RULE OF LAW of the Constitution, now rule based on vague perspectives about the intent, which arguably is not what they should be or are supposed to do. If the Constitution is the rule of law, then it should be just that, and as such, its exact wording determines the law, not opinions there of. Their job should be to fully recognize the meaning and intent, and rule based on the words. \n BUT... They know... legally... if an emergency is in place, then legally, the Federal Government has unlimited powers, and only needs to adhere to the principles enough so as to be able to fool the public by making the argument that they follow it as a guide.\n It is not supposed to be a guide, it is supposed to be the rule of law, in clear english.\n \n \n \n \n \n 4)The school systems..teach this... as the NEW DEAL OF 1933... but... the government run schools.. DONT TEACH THE DETAILS... THEY DONT ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT... and they use it, to be able to say, the people are informed, and therefore have their implied consent, since they were informed. Which is just a sham., because they dont teach enough information to allow the people to understand what they have lost.\n \n \n \n \n 5) In 1933, FDR forced all Americans into Federal citizenship, which gives the Federal Government the power to impose any laws as statutes that they see fit, over the people, and they did so, so as to enforce taxation, and over the past 80 years, have robbed us all of every shred of freedom the American people once had, by raising the children of America to think that the existing statute court system, is constitutional, WHEN IN FACT, IT IS NOT.. IT IS A SHAM.. a crime against freedom, and they have used it to fill the prisons with literally millions of people, who under the Constitution should never of been arrested in the first place, all of which, HAS NOT MADE US SAFER, since they reduced the punishment for REAL CRIMINALS, in exchange for the power to make endless laws... it was a rip off... Now, REAL violent criminals, get to watch TV, instead of doing hard labor, and the rest of the people must obey 66 million laws. \n (see...< FREEDOM verses CIVIL LIBERTIES )\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was an experiment in law, started in 1933... a sham... and it doesnt work.\n THE ACLU AND CIVIL LIBERTIES WERE CREATED IN 1933!! TO REPLACE OUR REAL CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM!! (Which they took away!!!)\n THAT IS A FACT! \n \n \n \n \n We want our freedom back, ( Constitutional freedom, NOT ACLU civil liberties ) And we want the ACLU dissolved, and the common law justice of the Constitution restored, which will CLOSE the REVOLVING DOOR PRISONS for good, by providing real punishment for real crimes, as a real deterrent.\n \n \n \n \n \n Basically, we want, and should all demand, loudly, that the Constitution be restored!\n \n Anything less is un-acceptable.\n \n \n AND THE ONLY WAY TO RESTORE THE CONSTITUTION, is to demand that all declared states of emergency, are ended!!!!\n \n PERIOD.\n \n The emergencies must end, and constitutional law restored.\n \n And any argument to the contrary to its restoration as law, should be considered an act of treason against that CONSTITUTION!!\n \n They must not be allowed to wave the flag, and sing the praises of the Constitution, and SPIT on it at the same time.\n \n WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 80 YEARS.\n \n \n \n Dont be fooled America, take back your country!\n \n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion",

   "let me link this site....... Senate Report - War and Emergency Powers Acts\n \n ------------ Senate Report - War and Emergency Powers Acts\n \n \n \n \n When the Southern states walked out of Congress on March 27, 1861, the quorum to conduct business under the Constitution was lost. The only votes that Congress could lawfully take, under Parliamentary Law, were those to set the time to reconvene, take a vote to get a quorum, and vote to adjourn and set a date, time, and place to reconvene at a later time, but instead, Congress abandoned the House and Senate without setting a date to reconvene. Under the parliamentary law of Congress, when this happened, Congress became sine die (pronounced see-na dee-a; literally \"without day\") and thus when Congress adjourned sine die, it ceased to exist as a lawful deliberative body, and the only lawful, constitutional power that could declare war was no longer lawful, or in session. \n \n The Southern states, by virtue of their secession from the Union, also ceased to exist sine die, and some state legislatures in the Northern bloc also adjourned sine die, and thus, all the states which were parties to creating the Constitution ceased to exist. President Lincoln executed the first executive order written by any President on April 15, 1861, Executive Order 1, and the nation has been ruled by the President under executive order ever since. When Congress eventually did reconvene, it was reconvened under the military authority of the Commander-in-Chief and not by Rules of Order for Parliamentary bodies or by Constitutional Law; placing the American people under martial rule ever since that national emergency declared by President Lincoln. The Constitution for the United States of America temporarily ceased to be the law of the land, and the President, Congress, and the Courts unlawfully presumed that they were free to remake the nation in their own image, whereas, lawfully, no constitutional provisions were in place which afforded power to any of the actions which were taken which presumed to place the nation under the new form of control. \n \n President Lincoln knew that he had no authority to issue any executive order, and thus he commissioned General Orders No. 100 (April 24, 1863) as a special field code to govern his actions under martial law and which justified the seizure of power, which extended the laws of the District of Columbia, and which fictionally implemented the provisions of Article I, Section 8, Clauses 17-18 of the Constitution beyond the boundaries of Washington, D.C. and into the several states. General Orders No. 100, also called the Lieber Instructions and the Lieber Code, extended The Laws of War and International Law onto American soil, and the United States government became the presumed conqueror of the people and the land. \n Martial rule was kept secret and has never ended, the nation has been ruled under Military Law by the Commander of Chief of that military; the President, under his assumed executive powers and according to his executive orders. Constitutional law under the original Constitution is enforced only as a matter of keeping the public peace under the provisions of General Orders No. 100 under martial rule. Under Martial Law, title is a mere fiction, since all property belongs to the military except for that property which the Commander-in-Chief may, in his benevolence, exempt from taxation and seizure and upon which he allows the enemy to reside. \n \n President Lincoln was assassinated before he could complete plans for reestablishing constitutional government in the Southern States and end the martial rule by executive order, and the 14th Article in Amendment to the Constitution created a new citizenship status for the new expanded jurisdiction. New laws for the District of Columbia were established and passed by Congress in 1871, supplanting those established Feb. 27, 1801 and May 3, 1802. The District of Columbia was re-incorporated in 1872, and all states in the Union were reformed as Franchisees of the Federal Corporation so that a new Union of the United States could be created. The key to when the states became Federal Franchisees is related to the date when such states enacted the Field Code in law. The Field Code was a codification of the common law that was adopted first by New York and then by California in 1872, and shortly afterwards the Lieber Code was used to bring the United States into the 1874 Brussels Conference and into the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. \n \n In 1917, the Trading with the Enemy Act (Public Law 65-91, 65th Congress, Session I, Chapters 105, 106, October 6, 1917) was passed and which defined, regulated and punished trading with enemies, who were then required by that act to be licensed by the government to do business. The National Banking System Act (Public Law 73-1, 73rd Congress, Session I, Chapter 1, March 9, 1933), Executive Proclamation 2038 (March 6, 1933), Executive Proclamation 2039 (March 9, 1933), and Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260 prove that in 1933, the United States Government formed under the executive privilege of the original martial rule went bankrupt, and a new state of national emergency was declared under which United States citizens were named as the enemy to the government and the banking system as per the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act. The legal system provided for in the Constitution was formally changed in 1938 through the Supreme Court decision in the case of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 US 64, 82 L.Ed. 1188. \n \n On April 25, 1938, the Supreme Court overturned the standing precedents of the prior 150 years concerning \"COMMON LAW\" in the federal government. \n THERE IS NO FEDERAL COMMON LAW, AND CONGRESS HAS NO POWER TO DECLARE SUBSTANTIVE RULES OF COMMON LAW applicable IN A STATE, WHETHER they be LOCAL or GENERAL in their nature, be they COMMERCIAL LAW or a part of LAW OF TORTS.\" (See: ERIE RAILROAD CO. vs. THOMPKINS, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188) \n \n The significance is that since the Erie Decision, no cases are allowed to be cited that are prior to 1938. There can be no mixing of the old law with the new law. The Common Law is the fountain source of Substantive and Remedial Rights, if not our very Liberties. (See also: Who is Running America?) \n In 1945 the United States gave up any remaining national sovereignty when it signed the United Nations Treaty, making all American citizens subject to United Nations jurisdiction. The \"constitution\" of the United Nations may be compared to that of the old Soviet Union. \n \n Documentation - \n Executive Order 1 - http://www.historyplace.com/lincoln/proc-1.htm; \n General Orders No. 100 (April 24, 1863) \"Lieber Code\" -\n http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fle...EBER-CODE.txt; \n Senate Report 93-549 (93rd Congress, 1st Session, 1973) - \n http://www.barefootsworld.net/war_ep1.html; \n The Trading with the Enemy Act (Public Law 65-91, 65th Congress, Session I, Chapters 105, 106, October 6, 1917); \n National Banking System Act (Public Law 73-1, 73rd Congress, Session I, Chapter 1, March 9, 1933); \n Executive Proclamation 2038 (March 6, 1933); Executive Proclamation 2039 (March 9, 1933); \n Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260; \n Title 12 USC, Section 95a - http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95.html; \n Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 US 64, 82 L.Ed. 1188; \n and the United Nations Treaty. \n \n All documentation is available through your local government document repository library branch or at the Library of Congress.\n \n Observations - Arguments which suggest that the Treaty of Paris of 1783 was not a lawful or legal treaty of peace between warring nations and that the American Colonies never really attained or obtained lawful or legal sovereignty, must also presume, by their own argument, that the Constitution for the united States of America and the Bill of Rights were never organic documents of true lawful or legal standing. \n \n Conclusion - The Constitution for the united States of America and the Bill of Rights are no longer in effect in their original form or where they conflict with the United Nations Treaty and other international agreements. Citizens of the several States of the Union who were formerly sovereigns protected by the common law are now United States citizens and are thus subjects to International Admiralty jurisdiction.\n \n \n \n wake up people...",

   "I support the disolution of the IRS and the income tax. Along with SS and medicaid/medicare taxes and the removal of the federal gov't from any and all things not proscribed by law within the framework of the Constitution. But to be perfectly honest, the law that the IRS bases the code on completely and irrefuteably exempts all private enterprises and private earned money from work. Don't believe me? Take a look at the actual laws the code itself, not what the IRS publishes. The IRS has lied to you and stolen more than half your pay for your entire life. Find out how you too can actually make a difference in the way our gov't operates. Go to losthorizons.com/Cracking_the_Code for the truth. I've read the book and then went to the actual titles in the US Code of laws and found that the things contained on that site are 100% true as far as the contents of the book and what its author says. I can't verify all the refund checks posted there of refunds issued for 100% of all SS, medicare, medicaid and income taxes. But there are well over $10,000,000.00 worth of them from people all across the U.S. saying they are. Save your country and your rights as a US citizen before it is too late. Just go check it out and then read the actual laws in the Title having to do with the IRS. You need to go to the first website mentioned to understand what you will be looking for when going to gpoaccess.gov/uscode/browse.htm\n when at the gov't site scroll down to Title 26. That is the one for the IRS. Have fun and try not to get too angry. Just channel that anger toward the changes that have to take place in this corrupt gov't we are subject to.\n Let everyone you know in on this information. Now more than ever the rights of the individual are at stake. Fight for what our grandfathers died for, what the founding fathers fought and died for. We owe it to them, and to the future generations of this once free land of liberty.",
