   "If this shows why he is getting so much protest it would tend to suggest that it is because the protesters are mentally retarded and have no idea what is going on.\n \n First, there are no bailouts in the bill these putzes are talking about. The bill gives the power to seize these institutions and liquidate them. Exactly the same as the FDIC can do with a regular bank. That is pretty much the EXACT opposite of a bailout. \n \n These XXXXXX are pretending to be champions of the taxpayer when, in fact, they are doing the EXACT opposite. If we block this bill we end up in the same situation that we are in now...where we have to make a choice between letting giant, interconnected companies fail and literally destroy the US economy OR we can bail them out.\n \n This bill would give us a third option....seize them and unwind them. No bailout, no public money. We did not have this option during the run up to the recent financial crisis because it would have been illegal for them to seize the companies in some cases and in others because the FDIC simply did not have the resources to seize and liquidate these massive companies. \n \n Personally I was all for seizing them and unwinding them when it originally happened. \n \n Stopping this bill will almost certainly result in future bailouts. Passing it virtually assures that there will not be any.",

   "I believe what Daewoo is talking about is basically this:\n [*]Seize the failed bank[*]clean up assets and see what exactly is left[*]Sell the assets for what they are worth\n This leaves a lot of stockholders broke and upper management on the streets but it is basically the same as letting them fail. The question quickly becomes \"why doesn't another bank just do the same thing\". A good question but I think as the crisis has shown you don't know who is in trouble and who isn't. You basically end up selling it to everyone and hoping for the best. I think Switzerland did this some time ago and it worked out great. \n \n I think I disagree with Daewoo about what we SHOULD have done. I think we should have let the big banks totally fail and see what happens. Nothing like cold water to the face in the morning to wake up a nation. I think the bailout will do much more long-term harm than a short-term collapse. \n \n I honestly haven't read the entire 1300+ page bill...I've only taken some of the main points so I don't know what to be true...yet. Can you, Jyoshu, point me to what section of the bill is in question? Is it Title II?",

Is it Title II?\n\n \n The problem with letting them fail completely was that the FDIC did not have anywhere NEAR the money in their insurance fund to cover the depositors. That would leave us trying to raise money to cover the depositors (via bond sales) while our financial system essentially collapsed. \n \n IMO when it comes to the financial reform and opposition to it that your average american has extremely strong feelings about it, but absolutely NO IDEA what the hell is going on. I dont think they realize how crooked the game was that led up to the last little crisis and how badly they got (And are still getting) screwed. I mean....banks were packaging and selling MBS paper while at the same time not only shorting the paper they just sold to their clients as AAA rated securities, but taking out massive CDS coverage on them because they KNEW the paper they just sold to your retirement fund was junk. Then when they got caught they claimed that it just showed how complete the separation between their in house investing and investment banking branches were. You would have to mentally retarded to believe that.\n \n Now we have Americans lining up to oppose regulation that would stop that kind of thing. We have Americans who read articles like the one in the OP and are actually foolish enough to believe that somehow a bill that sets up a framework for the seizure and dissolution of systemically critical but insolvent financial institutions somehow equates to a government takeover of the financial system. \n \n Krugman wrote an article the other day that talked about how this bill was being represented. One of the claims he makes is that several months ago a top republican adviser circulated a memo stating that in order to block financial regulation they needed to tie it to big bailouts. \n \n To be honest I have apparently once again underestimated the stupidity of the American people because I would not have believed that you could tie a bill to big bailouts that is specifically designed to allow for the seizure and liquidation of financial institutions, which is literally the exact opposite of a bailout. \n \n It is ALL OVER THE PLACE now.

Teabaggers all over the country are up in arms about \"the bailout bill\".\nlike I said, I haven't read the Dodd bill yet. Chris Dodd is known for coming up with some whacked out ideas so to be a skeptic is not a bad thing. Are you familiar with what provision in the bill the people are worried about? That would certainly save time. Like 3 or 4 of the sections just create more government oversight agencies. I'm always a little worried about them because they turn into nice retirement jobs for former CEOs. Check out the PCAOB after SOX. I literally had a PCAOB manager tell me the top people are basically part time making about $150k and are former big 4 partners. Now 150k is about 60% less (or more) than what they used to be getting but they are basically retired! They golf all day...goodness. The conservation got started after an accounting professor friend asked the guy why they (at the time) only came up with FOUR standards since existence. That was roughly 1 every couple years. \n \n Anyway, I've really gotta look closely at the bill. If we learned anything from the health care bill you have side A, side B, and the truth is somewhere on another planet.",

He likes misleading crapola:\n \nPimps, weasels and ACORN: The truth is slowly catching up with the smears\n The old aphorism that a lie can make it halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on came to mind last week when News Hits found a little-noted story about the group ACORN, which we've been keeping an eye on since this rag recently wrote abut the right-wing attack machine's attempts to crush the anti-poverty group.\n \n Many of you have probably seen the videos of conservative operative James O'Keefe dressed in a comically outrageous pimp getup that he purportedly wore last summer while accompanying a woman posing as a prostitute and visiting a number of ACORN offices to seek advice regarding ways to hide their ill-gotten gains from the IRS.\n \n The widely publicized video clips, fueled by the propagandists at FOX News and other right-wing distortionists, went viral. In other words, this deception wore the winged sandals of Mercury while the truth got bogged down in cement overshoes.\n\n Metro Times - News+Views: Pimps, weasels and ACORN\n \n And, for more factual coverage on ACORN see:\n The BRAD BLOG : Covering the Coverage: Reaction to ACORN 'Pimp' Hoax, Condemnation of NYTimes Continues...\n \n and other Breitbart crapola:\n The BRAD BLOG : AP: Breitbart Deceptively Posted Wrong Video as 'PROOF' Tea Baggers Didn't Hurl N-Word at Dems",
