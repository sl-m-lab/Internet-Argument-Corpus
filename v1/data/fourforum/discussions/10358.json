   "I am a creationist. I reject evolution because I have seen it disproved so many times (see Google Video: 100 reasons why evolution is so stupid).\n\n \n Clearly a video that is not worth watching, except for a good laugh. Sorry mate, but Creationists haven't even managed to put a dent in evolution as a fact, let alone in any particular theory of evolution. They are a bunch of bibliolators.\n \n \n I have believed that God created everything 'in the beginning' for as long as I can remember. There was a time in my life where I believed that God created evolution, but after seeing the video, I changed to total creationist.\n\n \n Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it.\n \n \nAlso, I think that evolution in itself is sort of a religion, as it tries to explain the creation of the universe and of all life. \n\n \n You must be thinking of physics... last I looked, biologists weren't trying to explain the the creation of the universe. However, we have an excellent handle on the evolution of species, and some pretty reasonable ideas about the origin of life, which is more than your bible ever came up with. I mean... some invisible, bearded guy-in-the-sky zapped it all into existence? Fairytales.\n \n \nI am an Episcopalian Christian, so it would be perfectly fine if I started believing in evolution as long as I still believed that God played some part in it. If I did not believe in God, I would not be a true Christian, but an atheist. Different people interpret the Scripture in different ways, some literally and some metaphorically. If you take the Scripture metaphorically, it does not mean you are not Christian, all you have to believe to be Christian is that God (and possibly evolution) created everything, and that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n \n There is no such thing as \"believing in\" evolution. I 'believe in \" evolution the same way as I \"believe in\" the earth orbiting the sun. It's just a fact of life to be accepted as real, along with countless others. You don't \"believe in\" evolution any more than you \"believe in\" the sun rising.\n \n You call evolution a religion. The problem is that religion seems to be the only thing you understand, and when your only tool is a hammer, i suppose every problem starts looking like a nail, so you call evolution a religion. It's as much of a religion as gravity.\n \n There are lots of Christians with the common sense to accept the reality of the world as it is, and that means accepting evolution as a fact of life. An early Christian pointed out that when believers insist on denying reality to support a theological position, they make a laughing stock of themselves and bring their religion into disrepute. This is what Creationists do. Know who that Christian was? St. Augustine: here's a relevant quote:\n \n \n\"Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.... Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by these who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.\" -- St. Augustine, The Literal Meaning of Genesis, translated and annotated by John Hammond Taylor, S.J., 2 vols. (New York: Newman Press, 1982). \n\n \n Evolution doesn't need religion, let alone Christianity, to make it work, and we don't need it to understand how evolution works. Christians who deny evolution to preserve their misunderstanding of the bible, however, are denying reality and doing themselves a disservice. If they view Christianity as being incompatible with evolution, they will have to hold that Christianity is incompatible with science in general. Most Christians are sensible enough not to go that far, and realise that if their religious belief is at odds with reality, it is pointless wishing reality would change; it's the belief that has to be modified.\n \n Creationists haven't figured this out yet.",
