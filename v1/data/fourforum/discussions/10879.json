There doesn't appear to be any objective criteria by which one can judge any particular version of Christianity: all information on which to base a belief is in the bible and therefore subject to endless interpretation.",

I mean, come on, if the bible was written by GOD then why does it conclude that the world is flat and the edge of the sea is guarded by monsters. Christianity is no different than cavemen drawing pictures of the herds on the cave walls so that the animals will come back the next year. Please, and transsubstantiation, drinking blood? Christ!",

   "As a description of the Universe, or even of an area beyond the Eastern Med, it falls flat on its face. Even today I doubt we could produce a description that would stand in the face of future discoveries. IIRC Jo B. predicted that the Standard Model would be replaced within 40 years.\n As such the random notions of bronze age barbarians simply aren't going to cut the mustard.\n At this point in time we have a range of translations of the text which all ultimately rely on interpreting at least one dead language be that ancient Hebrew or Latin. These could contain any number of phrases which won't convey their orginal intent, so the text is unreliable, and that's without considering the personal bias of the interpreter be that you or a priest, etc.\n As such the possibility of there being a correct interpretation now are as close to nil as makes no difference. Much less that anyone has actually succeeded in doing so.\n I think Galileo had the best idea.",
