Why couldn't this be a little different that the official line?\n\n To step in for Duck,\n Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson's if he weren't the pope? We wouldn't. The whole point is that he is the pope. We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals. (By the way he's 84  years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly.) So we don't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson's. We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church.\n \n But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion:\n \n Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Exodus 21:22-25, Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20  \n \n It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10  (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset.\n \n The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject: \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp  \n Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture.\n \n In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity (including scripture), there are some essentials that must be noticed. The Bible unequivocally \"tells\" us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life. \n \n Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. \n \n Abortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"\n \n Whereas, Christ says, \"This is my body, which is given up for you.\" \n \n \"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die.",

But if you can find in reading chicken guts, the richness and depth of thought that you find in the Catholic Church, then you are indeed a powerful mystic and soothsayer.\n \n The Church and its priests do not seek to erase the love and sexual feelings that men naturally have toward women (in your words they do not seek to act like they don't \"want some\"). They seek to control them and sacrifice them for a higher love. They are not pretending that they do not exist. If they don't then you are probably dealing with an unhealthy individual who may not be fit for the priesthood.\n \n Secondly, there is much basis to the Catholic Church's teachings on celibacy. It is not without foundation. These are not made up laws with made up enforcement.\n \n Thirdly, if you believe celibacy to be related to the perversion of pedophilia then I have a few questions for you:\n \n Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children?\n \n If for some reason, your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction?\n \n If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children?\n \n And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate?\n \n Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy.",

   "Your thesis is full of errors, Sigma. As many people don't understand in modern time, you don't seem to understand the reality and nature of sex, and what it is. In addition, you don't seem to understand the Catholic Church; I don't claim to understand it fully either, neither do I claim that the church is perfect, but you're clearly in a very closed-minded state where you believe that the Catholic Church only can be evil, as you want to keep your anti-theistic views. The truth of the matter is, there is absolutely no evidence that celibacy causes pedophilia, and in addition no evidence that the Church is evil as you make it to be. \n \n First of all, celibacy is not dogma, but is practiced only by one branch of the Catholic Church, the Western (Roman) Rite, and even then allows some exceptions, though rare. In fact, celibacy is only a symbol of obedience and commitment to the Church, and not to the family life. If it were dogmatic, we would have biblical evidence requiring priests to live celibate lives, but the only biblical evidence we have is Paul saying it was a good thing for the religious to live celibate lives. The Western Rite has kept this tradition since the 900s, I believe, but many other Catholics (such as Byzantine, Russian, Ruthenian, Anglican-Converts, Melkite, Coptic, Ethiopian, Maronite, etc.) still follow the original church law that allowed priests to marry. \n \n The Catholic Church's view on sex is the following: Sex is to keep a marriage united, and for procreation. If you use sex in any other terms, it can be detrimental to a relationship. Sex is NOT to be used when two people simply \"love\" eachother, as it means a lot more than that. Sex means absolute commitment to a relationship and willingness to have what nature brings, children. As for celibacy in the priesthood, this has absolutely nothing to do with not being able to control sexual desires and using children to fulfill them. In fact, if celibacy caused priests to molest children, it would be much more common than it is- a very, very, small number of priests molest children. Priests can easily have sexual relationships with adults, more easily than having them with children. What the church is actually suffering from is a miscommunication with men and women suffering from the homosexual disorder. Many Catholics believe that homosexuals simply \"choose\" to be homosexual, and that they can easily have relationships with the opposite sex, but such events don't occur. Especially for homosexual women, relationships with the oppisate sex can be very difficult. Hence, homosexuals seek the religious life to stay away from sin and be accepted in the Catholic community- I know of a few priests who have done this. Though this can be a good thing, many homosexuals also have pedophile tendancies, and this is where we get that VERY SMALL portion of the population that molests children.\n \n About the Catholic Church being an \"evil business\", I can't help but think that you have been completely brianwashed by popular belief in society today among non-religious and many protestants alike. The Catholic Church is no business, and is certainly not inherently evil, although much evil is in the church (mainly because this is satan's biggest threat). \n \n \nParcum that statement is blatently false and HIGHLY ignorant. 1) Pedophilia is the sexual attraction to CHILDREN.

Archives of Sexual Behavior reported that 86% of 229 convicted child molesters identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual. 2) We're not talking about rape, but about molestation.

More specifically I would be interested to hear how sexual immorality is inherent or inevitable because of certain Church dogma/doctrine. Have you ever read the Catechism's statements on sexuality?\n \n How is celibacy related? Would you answer these questions:\n \n Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children?\n \n If for some reason, your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction?\n \n If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children?\n \n And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate?\n \n Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy.\n \n Saying that the \"pedophilia\" scandal is related to homosexuality is not a dismissal. It has a basis due to the fact that most cases are ephebophelia, not pedophilia.

Homosexuals are attracted to other adults. \n \n \n Parcum's terminology may be a little off. Ephebophelia may be due to homosexuality in the priesthood even if pedophilia is not. Most of the cases of the scandal were ephebophilia.

The Catholic Church provides plenty of rules on all sorts of behavior as well as position statements on all kinds of political and social issues ranging from poverty to war to the death penalty and the church has certainly sided with the political left as well as the political right depending on the issue.

Interracial fights were a daily, and I mean DAILY, occurance. And the bussed whites were typically easy targets, unless they adopted the same behaviors as the troublemaking blacks. We formed loose gangs that countered the gang mentality that prevailed in the black neighborhood that we were bussed to. Now, with that background, I can assure you that single, poor black women have ZERO control over many of their sons once their sons are physically big enough to drop Mom in a heartbeat (and by \"drop\", I mean physically knock her on her XXX).\n While you may have been raised in a middle-class white neighborhood in which kids didn't challenge their \"scrawny\" moms, in \"the hood\", it's a constant occurance and many single Moms live in fear from their kids who are twice their size and angry.

That's why the number is high. I find that morally repulsive.\n \n\n Okey dokey - call it what you like. I am just saying that it isn't likely going on behind the backs of a line-up of loving fathers. \n\n Agreed, nor are they likely loving mothers themselves to be fair. \n \n\n What are you talking about???!!!!\n Where did I say that men can't have any input? As I recall I said the opposite of that. What I did  say is, whatever laws there are regarding abortion, they will not come close to impacting the lives of men as much as they will women. That's because women get pregnant. Those are just the facts. Why is this offensive or hard to grasp???\n\n Here's your statement that I was responding to:\n \n\n And non(e) of this changes the fact that it doesn't impact men in any real way.

After LBJ's War on Poverty and <$6Trillion dollars in social engineering spending, that rate is now over 70% in many inner cities. Is there a relationship between Welfare and illegitimacy? YOU BETCHA! And who controlled the Whitehouse, House of Representatives and Senate during the rise of the Welfare Nation? Bleeding heart liberals like LBJ, Ted Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey.\n \n\n How mightily our nation has prospered with the unpaid laborers, the fruits of which we still enjoy today--even if the denizens of the inner city have not been allowed that privilege.\n\n Again, your history is shaky. The impact of slavery was far less than your mellifluous statement above implies. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution, slavery's economic impact was almost exclusively in the South and even there it was losing its benefit in the early 1800's when many slaves were being freed because it wasn't economically-sound to keep them.\n \n\n Well! Bully for all of your illustrious ancestors!\n\n Do I detect a note of sarcasm? :) \n \n\n Alas! Only if the grave mistakes of history could be written off in 7 generations or so. But, that is not the way of the real world.\n\n \n As I said above, the last international slave ship landed in 1804. The last slave was freed in 1865, 141 years ago. Affirmative Action, Welfare, quotas, set-asides, etc., have all been put in place to redress past discrimination. So, my question to you is \"how long does it take? 300 years? 500 years? a millenium?\" Japan and Germany went from burned out, bombed out countries to world powers in less than 1/4 of the time since slavery ended at a cost that was far less.",

   "Being pro-life has no relationship to being anti-woman. That's an absurd assertion. Being Pro-life is about advocating for the fetus, not against the Mom.\nBut advocating for the embryo or fetus means advocating the restriction in the woman's Constitutional right to control her own body.\n \n It means demanding that the woman can be FORCED to give off her bodily resources against her will.\n \n As such, it is rather hard to be PL and not a mysogynist, unless your PL leanings go towards reducing the need for abortions rather than restricting the access to abortion.\n \n Yes, it is entirely possible to be prolife by seeking to encourage the woman to not about through support and better prevention. However, most PL don't go that route and instead go the misogynistic route of trying to take the woman's rights away.\n \n Using the stick instead of the carrot is what makes so many PL into misoginists.\n \n Note that if you instead focused on reducing the NEED for an abortion through better prevention and more support of pregnant women, then you would have instant support from the prochoice community. IF PL had put energy into that direction instead of the misogynistic one of controlling women, the number of abortions today would be much, much less. However, the PL generally have gone the other way, to ward moralistic/theocratic punitive enslavement of women instead. They chose to be misogynists instead of supportive of the woman.\n \n hence, it is REALLY hard for PC to believe that PL is not about using abortion as a means of subjugating women. So how can we NOT see you as misogynists? If you truly wanted to reduce the number of abortions, you could have long ago. Instead, you have chosen the attempt at restricting women, and years of legal battles have done little to reduce the numbers. If those funds from both sides had been sunk into sex-ed, better and more available contraception and support of women who ARE pregnant, how many abortions do you think would happen today? half? one third? one tenth?",

Supp., at 1222-1223. Appellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that the State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest. As noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation. \n \n A. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \"person\" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, [410 U.S. 113, 157] for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument. 51 On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument 52 that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n The Constitution does not define \"person\" in so many words. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to \"person.\" The first, in defining \"citizens,\" speaks of \"persons born or naturalized in the United States.\" The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause. \"Person\" is used in other places in the Constitution: in the listing of qualifications for Representatives and Senators, Art. I, 2, cl. 2, and 3, cl. 3; in the Apportionment Clause, Art. I, 2, cl. 3; 53 in the Migration and Importation provision, Art. I, 9, cl. 1; in the Emolument Clause, Art. I, 9, cl. 8; in the Electors provisions, Art. II, 1, cl. 2, and the superseded cl. 3; in the provision outlining qualifications for the office of President, Art. II, 1, cl. 5; in the Extradition provisions, Art. IV, 2, cl. 2, and the superseded Fugitive Slave Clause 3; and in the Fifth, Twelfth, and Twenty-second Amendments, as well as in 2 and 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application. 54 [410 U.S. 113, 158] \n \n All this, together with our observation, supra, that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word \"person,\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn. 55 This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented. McGarvey v. Magee-Womens Hospital, 340 F. Supp. 751 (WD Pa. 1972); Byrn v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp., 31 N. Y. 2d 194, 286 N. E. 2d 887 (1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-434; Abele v. Markle, 351 F. Supp. 224 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-730. Cf. Cheaney v. State, ___ Ind., at ___, 285 N. E. 2d, at 270; Montana v. Rogers, 278 F.2d 68, 72 (CA7 1960), aff'd sub nom. Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308 (1961); Keeler v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 3d 619, 470 P.2d 617 (1970); State v. Dickinson, 28 [410 U.S. 113, 159] Ohio St. 2d 65, 275 N. E. 2d 599 (1971). Indeed, our decision in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection. \n \n This conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the contentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other considerations. \n \n B. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed. 1965). The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt and Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and Meyer were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly. \n \n Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. [410 U.S. 113, 160] \n \n It should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live birth. This was the belief of the Stoics. 56 It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith. 57 It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family. 58 As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening. Physicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes \"viable,\" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. 59 Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. 60 The Aristotelian theory of \"mediate animation,\" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this \"ensoulment\" theory from those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from [410 U.S. 113, 161] the moment of conception. 61 The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a \"process\" over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the \"morning-after\" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs. 62 \n \n In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive. 63 That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In most States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few [410 U.S. 113, 162] courts have squarely so held. 64 In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal injuries. 65 Such an action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life. Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians ad litem. 66 Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.",

   "Simone,\n \nMen in our culture are worshipped as being next to God in the Christian religion and are not encouraged to grow up into responsible, real human beings with respect for women.\n \n I was fortunate to grow up in a relatively non-Christian culture where more was expected from men--and I never ran into any major problems of abuse and disrespect until I lived for a spell in very Roman Catholic Alburquerque, New Mexico.\n\n Although disrespect of women may be a behavior of Christian men, I do not believe you would find it the norm. When it occurs, it is not an upholding of Christian doctrine but rather a contradiction of it. One need only read Ephesians 5:21-33  to see the teaching of Christianity on this subject in its very beginning.\n \n \nYou cite a great many instances of truth. Unfortunately, if a female is considered as having morally \"slipped\" under these strict rules she has lowered her status to that of a prostitute and is no longer respected and protected--in fact, her life may be subject to abuse and possible death--something like the Middle Eastern culture you cite in your next paragraph.\n\n This may also happen to some degree in Christian culture but again, it is not a teaching of Christianity but a contradiction of it. To go back to the beginning as we did before we need only look at scripture. \n \n John 8: 3-11: The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. \n \n But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. \n \n At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" \n \n \"No one, sir,\" she said. \n \n \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\" \n \n Jesus has mercy and does not condemn the woman. But notice what he says last, \"Go and sin no more.\" In that statement he acknowledges the fact that what she had done was, in fact, sinful. He also tells her that she must repent and quit sinning. He speaks the truth boldly (ruthless honesty mingled with mercy) as you say your culture would. Perhaps, the Christian culture is rapped (unjustly) for speaking the truth that some things are sins, and repentance is necessary. I'm not sure it can be rapped for not showing mercy in the face of sin.",

Some individuals did not adhere to these rules and they were not well thought of. But we didn't go around being hypocritical about the \"sanctity of the marriage,\" and yammering on and on about it, we just honored the vows.\n\n 1.

   "Finally, to end my loquacious tirade I must make two distinctions concerning Steen's assertion that a woman carrying a baby to term can be likened slavery. The comparison breaks down on two important points that come to mind:\n \n 1. Slaves did not initiate their slavery of their own volition. They were mislead or forcibly bound and abducted. Women becoming pregnant, in the vast majority of cases, engage willfully in an action that knowingly brings about their so called \"slavery.\" They give informed consent, in effect, by engaging in an act that has known consequences. So it cannot be a slavery. It may be more aptly described as indentured servitude but even that is a poor description.\n \n 2. I would guess that most slaves, even in the midst of the dire and dreadful circumstances in which they existed, would still choose slavery to save their children. They would choose to bind themselves and their children rather than kill them. I do not believe many would sacrifice their children for freedom. Although many might sacrifice themselves for their children's freedom. It seems that most even endured a life of misery for themselves rather than suicide.",

Does this imply an objective standard of morality? How does this gel with the tradtional pro-choice position that morality is relative to situation of the mother, etc.\nI do not judge myself to have moral superiority. I just live by what I judge to be the right way. Furthermore, I do not see what abortion has to do with morality. Abortion is not something that is subject to a moral judgment. It is a private decision between a woman and her physician and anyone who intrudes into that intimate and privileged discussion betwen a woman and her physician is practicing medicine without a license and is imposing his or her medical misjudgments upon another without having the qualifications to do so.\n \n \n2.

I am merely saying that was the custom within my family, that family members felt it had great value in stabilizing the family and that we are stong believers in real family values.

It's not about being unfit. It's about trying to fulfill a role that is contrary to one's nature. As Father Fessio explained Sunday on Meet the Press, the Church is spoken of in scripture as the bride of Christ and Christ is the bridgegroom.

Paul decrees, we must all obey, right or wrong.\n\n Simone,\n I would guess that you, like the others who cite only the \"submit\" sentence of Ephesians 5 might not have ever read it in its entirety. Let me post it for you so that you can see for yourself that Paul does not say an unsuitable man may be privileged enough to gain the submission of his wife. Nor does he say that she must obey him right or wrong.\n \n Ephesians 5\n \n 21 Submit to one another   out of reverence for Christ. \n 22Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n 25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her  26to make her holy, cleansing[1] her by the washing with water through the word, 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[2] 32This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. \n \n Submit to one another? What does that mean? You mean the wife isn't the only one to have to submit?\n \n How much did Christ love the Church? He died for it. So Paul tells men that they must love their wives enough to die for her. (There is no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for one he loves). \n \n Paul then tells men to love their wives as their own bodies.\n \n So if a man is not acting Christlike--if he is acting in an abusive, immoral, wrong way then there is no obligation for his wife to submit to him.\n \n Out of time. More on your other post later. I do wonder why you now say you don't consider yourself morally superior though when in the previous post you declared yourself to be morally superior.

No he has not, nevermind the fact that Mass has been proven on several occasions to be a pedophile, molester priests. More dog and pony show. Sure cops do look out for each other, but they don't even remotely come close to the Vatican. You do know there are a sizable number of former police behind bars? Can you say the same for the Catholic Church? No, you can't. Interesting how you've avoided the specific problem the Church has done. Have the cops moved known repeat offenders around the country without telling the public? \n \n \nNo, that was my attempt to show how ludicrous your argument was\n\n \n You're in serious trouble if you think you just did that. You're skills are getting rusty. \n \n \nTo think that a small percentage of US priests represent all of Catholicism is ridiculous\n\n \n Do you not understand how the actions of the seat of the Church have on the entire religion?",

   "Linus,\n \nI don't have to because the poster asked, \"I would be interested to hear of the two pro-abortion saints you mentioned.\" So two \"pro-abortion\" saints are named. \n But if you personally want proof, here. \n St. Augustine reversed centuries of Christian teaching in Western Europe, and returned to the Aristotelian concept of \"delayed ensoulment.\" He wrote that a human soul cannot live in an unformed body. Thus the fetus wasn't alive before it had formed body. \n \n St. Jerome wrote, \"The seed gradually takes shape in the uterus, and it [abortion] does not count as killing until the individual elements have acquired their external appearance and their limbs\" \n \n St. Thomas Aquinas considered abortion of an \"animated\" fetus as murder. So before five months it was okay to have an abortion. \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm\n\n Your terminology is misleading and your assertion is false. There were never and will never be any Catholic Saints who are \"pro-abortion.\" \n \n The information you cite does not refute the fact that the Church has always condemned abortion. It does show that there has been some theological debate as to when a person was \"ensouled.\" This stemmed partly from the fact that the process of pregnancy was not fully known. Augustine chose the point of \"quickening\" or first movement as the point of ensoulment because that very well might have been the first evidence of life in the womb at that time. But as soon as it was deemed that a soul was present then abortion was denounced as an evil. He was pro-life from the instant he knew life was there. For Christians, teaching on protecting human life in the womb has never been a gray area. Although knowledge of when that life began has been enlightened by science and technology--the child in the womb has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view--at the time when it was known that life/soul was present then the being was deemed worthy of protection.",

This would make them, as you pro-lifers like to say, \"pro-abortion.\"\n\n What do you think their idea of a fetus prior to quickening/animation was? \n \n Quoting from your site:\n In ancient times, the \"delayed ensoulment\" belief of Aristotle (384-322 BCE) was widely accepted in Pagan Greece and Rome. He taught that a fetus originally has a vegetable  soul. This evolves into an animal soul later in gestation. Finally the fetus is \"animated\" with a human soul.  \n \n St. Augustine (354-430 CE) reversed centuries of Christian teaching in Western Europe, and returned to the Aristotelian concept of \"delayed ensoulment.\" He wrote 7 that a human soul cannot live in an unformed body. Thus, early in pregnancy, an abortion is not murder because no soul is destroyed (or, more accurately, only a vegetable or animal soul is terminated).\n \n If they had a belief in a vegetable and animal soul do you think they thought it was the same as ending the life of a human soul? Do you think those saints would be \"pro-abortion\" as you term it in the modern age? \n \n Also, remember that the teaching or writing of one saint is not the teaching of the Church as a whole.\n \n \nActually it does. \n \n Actually it doesn't.\n \n \nSo theology works alongside with anatomy now? This is moot...theology is not based on science but instead belief. Even the belief that ensoulment beginning at conception doesn't make any sense and goes against the nature of Christian dualism.\n\n True theology works in concert with all things.\n \n Please elaborate your ideas on Christian dualism and its conflict with ensoulment at conception.",

   "Simone,\n \nI do not judge myself to have moral superiority. I just live by what I judge to be the right way. Furthermore, I do not see what abortion has to do with morality. Abortion is not something that is subject to a moral judgment. It is a private decision between a woman and her physician and anyone who intrudes into that intimate and privileged discussion betwen a woman and her physician is practicing medicine without a license and is imposing his or her medical misjudgments upon another without having the qualifications to do so.\n\n \nPost 100 pg. 20\n I grew up in the very Christian American Midwest but I lived in a tribal Scandinavian family where we had our own rules of conduct, which rules were generally morally superior to the Christian culture surrounding us.\n\n You do not believe abortion to be a moral question? I assume with this statement that you believe in allowing abortion up to the point of birth. If so, then you are one of the most extreme pro-choicers around. If you do believe this being in the womb is worthy of protection at some point--any point along the way--then you have given it some sort of right as a person. If that enters in then this is a moral question. \n \n Do you believe abandonment of a pregnant mother by the father a moral issue? Or is it simply a legal, financial, or medical decision?\n \n Do you believe an assault on a pregnant mother that results in injury to the zygote/fetus/embryo to be a moral issue or something other? \n \n \nPost 112, pg. 23\n I am not saying that I believe it to be good. I am merely saying that was the custom within my family, that family members felt it had great value in stabilizing the family and that we are stong believers in real family values. OK, they were snotty about people who did not honor the vows of their marital contracts so they were guilty of judgment in that regard.\n\n \nIn general, marriages were love matches and life-long without infidelities. Some individuals did not adhere to these rules and they were not well thought of. But we didn't go around being hypocritical about the \"sanctity of the marriage,\" and yammering on and on about it, we just honored the vows.\n \n I am trying to understand now why you say you don't believe a life long marriage to be \"good\" yet those who did not adhere to this mode were badly thought of. I'm trying to understand why a life-long marriage is not necessarily a \"good\" thing in your opinion yet it involved love, fidelity, and honor. These things are not good?\n \n \nWe kept our snotty thoughts and statements to ourselves and did not go around intruding into the marriages of others who did not follow our customs and tell them they had to do it our way. OK, it was bad to have snotty thoughts and to gossip about marital dereliction but, geeze, the gossip was so witty\n\n So you said what you thought and spoke the truth but you didn't say what you thought or speak the truth in relation to marriage? You thought about the ideas that life-long, love-match, loyal marriages were good yet you didn't speak about it? And when one speaks about it as Christians generally do then that is \"intruding into the marriages of others?\" and not simply speaking the truth about one's beliefs? I need a break. I'm a bit dizzy.\n \n \nI'm saying that probably my family has been observing these rules for generations and generations and may have even been doing so before the advent of Christianity. It was just the decent thing to do. Christianity had nothing at all to do with it.\n\n I'm glad that you are finally admitting that you agree with Christianity so much.",

When a fetus reaches the point at which it is viable outside of the womb abortion is strictly controlled (as it should be) and allowable only in cases of possible death to the pregnant woman or of extreme health hazard to her. As long as a fertized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus is dependent upon a woman's body for continued life it is a woman's choice to decree whether or not she yields her body to the welfare of the aforesaid entities. I do believe that women should, whenever possible, decide to terminate as early as possible in the course of the pregnancy as this is the medically safest time for abortion.\n \n Maximus, you are welcome at any time to cede ownership of your body to a fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus, etc., with my good wishes. It is your body after all and it is not my responsibility to dictate to you what you do with it--as long as you are not harming yourself or others. \n \nDo you believe abandonment of a pregnant mother by the father a moral issue? Or is it simply a legal, financial, or medical decision?\nAbandonment of a pregnant woman is so common throughout the world that we have not begun in the slightest degree to acquaint men with their responsibilities in regard to their sexuality. Men are empowered by patriarchal religions to have sexual access to as many women as they can seduce, rape, kidnap or otherwise secure with very few consequences, in most cases the victims, the women themselves, are punished for the transgressions of the men as if they were the criminal. \n \n This has been the case until very recently in most of the Christian world. I am intimately acquainted with views on the issue of rape within the United States because I was part of a public relations campaign to educate Americans about the issue of rape--that a woman is not the cause of rape because she was \"slutty,\" \"dressed provocatively,\" \"was in the wrong place,\" \"because she wore trousers,\" \"because she was riding a bike,\" (I was kicked out of a courtroom over the last statement because I screamed in outrage at the stupid judge who made the last pronouncement in regard to a rape victim. I have had prominent men in the media industry tell me that the rape victim \"should just lean back and enjoy it.\" Unfortunately, there are still a lot of people in America who still hold these views and a great many more in the rest of the world.\n \nDo you believe an assault on a pregnant mother that results in injury to the zygote/fetus/embryo to be a moral issue or something other?\nAn attack on a woman is an attack on a woman and should be punished by law.\n \n Are you assuming that a woman could be viciously attacked and only the fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus would suffer injury?\n \nI am trying to understand now why you say you don't believe a life long marriage to be \"good\" yet those who did not adhere to this mode were badly thought of. I'm trying to understand why a life-long marriage is not necessarily a \"good\" thing in your opinion yet it involved love, fidelity, and honor. These things are not good?\nUm, Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out precisely where I stated that life-long marriage is not good, I am trying to understand your muddled statement also.\n \nSo you said what you thought and spoke the truth but you didn't say what you thought or speak the truth in relation to marriage? You thought about the ideas that life-long, love-match, loyal marriages were good yet you didn't speak about it? And when one speaks about it as Christians generally do then that is \"intruding into the marriages of others?\" and not simply speaking the truth about one's beliefs? I need a break. I'm a bit dizzy.\nMaximus, what are you trying to say? I happen to espouse a great many beliefs about what morality is but I do not burden others with the weight of my various beliefs.\n \n What is your point?\n \nI'm glad that you are finally admitting that you agree with Christianity so much.\nNo, it's not that I agree with Christianity, it's that much of Christianity agrees with me. After all, the views of my honorable ancestors were around long before the advent of Christianity and if Christians chose to adopt many of our values, excellent!",

Here's the article.\n \n \n\n Wednesday, March 30, 2005\n Teen: Girl consented to abortion with bat\n Lawyer asks judge to dismiss charge against 16-year-old Richmond boy.\n By Jim Lynch / The Detroit News\n \n A 16-year-old Richmond boy could not have assaulted his girlfriend because she consented to being beaten with a miniature baseball bat to induce her miscarriage, his attorney argued Tuesday. \n \n The boy faces a felony charge of intentional conduct against a pregnant individual resulting in miscarriage or stillbirth, which could result in his remaining in custody until age 21. \n \n He is alleged to have struck his 16-year-old Armada Township girlfriend in the stomach over three weeks. \n \n Defense attorney Miranda Massie made arguments to support her request for a dismissal in the case. Judge Matt Switalski is expected to rule later on the argument. \n \n \"If you consent, there is no assault, plain and simple,\" she said, adding, \"there is no Michigan law to the contrary.\" \n \n By asking her \"best friend and boyfriend\" to hit her with the bat, Massie argued the girl, now 17, was exercising her right to have an abortion. \n \n Therese Tobin, chief trial attorney for the Macomb Prosecutor's Office, said there is no state law that says a person can consent to battery. And she added, \"a person is not free to get an abortion at certain stages without public intervention.\" \n \n The judge questioned whether the girl, at 16, was in a position to offer her consent. \n \n \"Did she enter into a valid contract?\" he asked. \"... In essence, she's getting herself an abortion without availing herself of what the Legislature says she has to do.\" \n \n Switalski asked the defense to submit answers to a series of questions concerning the consent argument by April 8. \n \n Defense attorneys also plan to use the cause of death as a basis for dismissing the charges. Switalski did not hear arguments on that issue Tuesday. \n \n In January, Macomb County Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Spitz ruled the fetus died of premature birth associated with trauma to the mother. \n \n In a brief filed earlier this month, Massie argued that there is no scientific way to determine exactly what caused the miscarriage in this case. \n \n \"Causation of miscarriage and fetal death defies scientific determination more than 50 percent of the time,\" she wrote. \n \n \"In this case, there was no prenatal medical care or observation and no medical care or observation at the time of the miscarriage, making reliable assessment of the cause of (the girl's) miscarriage impossible.\" \n http://www.detnews.com/2005/macomb/0504/05/C05-133229.htm \n",

Inside the priests place, priests lived opposite to what they told to the public. They are living in luxury with unlimited good wine and good foods every meals.\n \n Inside priests talked about sex, their stealing stories and all the bad things without fear.\n \n I stayed there, priests telephoned and talked with me to request me to have sex with them openly.\n \n Priests intruded my bedroom and stole things and money from us.\n \n Priests used a lot of dirty tricks to get me into bed with them.\n \n Priests slience for what they did and protected each other after crime happening.\n \n Listen, those Roman Catholic priests who harmed us are still in and out of America as a good Catholic university professors, director, and spiritual director. One of them is the well-known book author and poet for Catholic studies.\n \n =====================================\n I am writing to let the world know about how do the bad priests live in Rome,Italy.\n In a place call Convitto S. Tommaso (Via Degli Ibernesi 20, 00184 Rome, Italy Tel: 0669791601)\n The bad priests team up and cover up for one another. Here are what bad things they did to the general publics and against the general law and orders:\n 1. The Philippine Sister sleeps with the Fathers in Convitto S Tommaso in order to keep her job to stay in Rome not return to Philippine.\n 2. The head of the Father ( Father Luke) regularly calls the Sister to sleep with him in his room at night.\n 3. The head of the Father (Irish Fahter Luke) also lead every priest in Convitto S Tommasso drink. Every priests enjoy drinking unlimited supply of both white and red wine during their lunch and dinner time with plentiful and luxury supply of foods served by Philippine servant. Fathers are chatting women issue, travel Europe issues, and eating issues during their meals time with laughters.\n 4. Those Bad Fathers team up to cheat the tourists and innocent youngests money, valuable possession in Rome.\n You can find those bad fathers hide those cheating and stolen GOLD AND JEWEL somewhere in Convitto S Tommasso.\n 5. The bad Fathers against the Italian Law without feeling guilty - the walk into the public transportation often without paying ticket.\n 6. They use dirty tricks to decieve teenagers and kids to have fun sex with them.\n \n Those bad priests students from Convitto S Tommasso have learned that committing a crime is okay in Rome and the other Fathers will help them to cover up.\n Therefore,when they return to their own country, they just go on what they did in Rome - continuous to do bad things to harm to the general public and the society!",

   "Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out to me where I stated that abortion should be allowed to the point of birth.\n \n I hold views in accord with United States law in this regard. When a fetus reaches the point at which it is viable outside of the womb abortion is strictly controlled (as it should be) and allowable only in cases of possible death to the pregnant woman or of extreme health hazard to her. As long as a fertized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus is dependent upon a woman's body for continued life it is a woman's choice to decree whether or not she yields her body to the welfare of the aforesaid entities. I do believe that women should, whenever possible, decide to terminate as early as possible in the course of the pregnancy as this is the medically safest time for abortion.\n \n Maximus, you are welcome at any time to cede ownership of your body to a fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus, etc., with my good wishes. It is your body after all and it is not my responsibility to dictate to you what you do with it--as long as you are not harming yourself or others. \n Abandonment of a pregnant woman is so common throughout the world that we have not begun in the slightest degree to acquaint men with their responsibilities in regard to their sexuality. Men are empowered by patriarchal religions to have sexual access to as many women as they can seduce, rape, kidnap or otherwise secure with very few consequences, in most cases the victims, the women themselves, are punished for the transgressions of the men as if they were the criminal. \n \n This has been the case until very recently in most of the Christian world. I am intimately acquainted with views on the issue of rape within the United States because I was part of a public relations campaign to educate Americans about the issue of rape--that a woman is not the cause of rape because she was \"slutty,\" \"dressed provocatively,\" \"was in the wrong place,\" \"because she wore trousers,\" \"because she was riding a bike,\" (I was kicked out of a courtroom over the last statement because I screamed in outrage at the stupid judge who made the last pronouncement in regard to a rape victim. I have had prominent men in the media industry tell me that the rape victim \"should just lean back and enjoy it.\" Unfortunately, there are still a lot of people in America who still hold these views and a great many more in the rest of the world.\n An attack on a woman is an attack on a woman and should be punished by law.\n \n Are you assuming that a woman could be viciously attacked and only the fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus would suffer injury?\n Um, Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out precisely where I stated that life-long marriage is not good, I am trying to understand your muddled statement also.\n Maximus, what are you trying to say? I happen to espouse a great many beliefs about what morality is but I do not burden others with the weight of my various beliefs.\n \n What is your point?\n No, it's not that I agree with Christianity, it's that much of Christianity agrees with me. After all, the views of my honorable ancestors were around long before the advent of Christianity and if Christians chose to adopt many of our values, excellent!\nAnd a bit of disagreement followed.",

I spent 6 years in a catholic school, I looked for a God the hardest I could. I did believe in one for awhile, but then I found, when I was older, logic. I started questioning in depth the christian dogma. And after months and months of pondering this question, it became obvious that there was no \"Judge Judy\" type god. I found that the followers were blind. That may be a harsh word, but the fact of the matter is, they want to believe in a God. A higher power. It consoles them, it makes them feel better. It also answers their questions about life. I've studied some of Einstein's theories, and I still cant understand half of it. However, for less intelligent people who can't understand almost all of it, resort to a blind belief dogma. It makes them feel better, and they now understand how things work. Its the lazy way out, and they become so immersed in it that soon they can't get out.\n \n \n \n \n \nI believe that the Holy Bible teaches the truth and so I say the following about abortion (as to whether or not it is an acceptable practice). It addresses the age old question, \"When does life in the womb begin?\"\n\n \n There is no question about \"life\" in the womb, as \"life\" has been in the womb before the baby got in there. The question is \"when does intelligent life begin\" or \"when does a person start existing, not just a clump of cells?\".\n \n \n \n \n \n\" You [God] watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed ... \" - Psalm 139:15-16 (New Living Translation)\n\n \n Bible quotes are meaningless. The bible has no weight, and therefore is irrelevant in a debate like this.",

   "Peteratwar said, \"Consider God and his teaching shining as a white light upon the earth. Mankind and their thinking acts as a prism. Gods thinking is split by that prism into many colours. Which is the correct one ? How can there be any wrong ones ?\"\n \n Good question:\n \n Many religions teach that we are gods. Atheism says there is no God. Christianity (along with Judaism and Islam) teach that we are a creation of God and that God is the Creator of all things. Jesus claimed He was God in the flesh. He either was or He wasn't - it can't be both. There is a verse in the Bible that addresses your question, \"Which is the correct one ? How can there be any wrong ones?\"\n \n There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.\n - Proverbs 14:12\n \n I came here to give you solid, verifiable evidence that the Bible is, in fact, true. I'm not saying that I can prove by the use of physical evidence that Jesus was (and therefore still is) God (that takes saving faith) but I can prove to you that the Bible (in particular, the Old Testament) is historically accurate. But first, check this out ...\n \n Ever notice how logical and well ordered musical notes are? That music has an audible 'range' and that all the varieties of music we have come to know and enjoy all come from just 12 notes? And how there are harmonies, and how there can be only one musician or hundreds at a time and it all sounds good but in different ways? How it's a language unto itself that transends the barriers of different societies, customs and languages? And all the different instruments that work in harmony with each other? How can a single cell in a woman's womb grow, thru binary division, to become flesh, and bones, and organs, and hair and blood and my oh my how complex the human body is (and to think that our body is made of just water and dirt) - and all of it orchestrated to work in harmony together - like a symphony? And we haven't even touched on what the soul is, and personality and emotions and reasoning and the human mind ? \n \n Consider the earth, what makes it continue to turn on it's axis (after all, it turns in an environment that contains air so there is resistance to motion since it's not in the vacuum of space)? How can it be that the sun (a huge thermo-nuclear reactor) is perfectly placed at exactly the correct distance from the earth to ensure a very specific temperature range and to exert a pull to keep us from floating off into space? The earth turns on its axis at about 1000 mph while the earth travels through space (thereby meeting the definition of a spaceship - yes, we are space travellers) around the sun at about 67,000 mph while our solar system is in movement within the Milky Way galaxy which is in movement through space?\n \n Ever compare an aerial view of a hurricane with a photo of a galaxy (do an image search for hurricane Francis and M-51, the Whirlpool Galaxy).\n \n \"Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind?\" - Job 38:36 \n \n Did you know that it's a verifiable fact that there are more ancient manuscripts in existance for the books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible than any other historical document(s)? Ever heard of the Tell el-Amarna tablets, the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III of Assyria, the Moabite Stone (also called Stele of Mesha, king of Moab and last I heard it was on display at the Louvre in Paris) and don't pass this one by ... the terra cotta and baked clay cylinder of Sennacherib, king of Assyria - all which confirm the historical accuracy of recorded events in the Old Testament (names of Israelite King(s), places, events, wars with Israel, etc).\n \n You wanted proof that would show you whether or not the Bible was true, now you have some proof that is based on verifiable historical evidence.",

It states that since the synagogue authorities allowed Jesus to preach, then Jesus couldn't possibly be a carpenter. Does that make any sense to any of you? I mean, I'm a janitor by trade and my pastor allows me to preach sometimes, yet I'm still a janitor by trade. Did the Jews have some kind of law forbidding a carpenter from preaching? Nope. Also, I do not recall Jesus needing anyone's permission to do anything. He was, after all, God. God doesn't need our permission, we need His. The only place I know of in the New Testament where someone commands Jesus was His mom Mary - when she said, \"there's no more wine.\" and He said, \"woman, what's that to me?\" and she turns to the servant and says, \"do whatever He tells you to do.\" And so began Jesus' ministry. But then God did say \"Honor your mother and your father.\" and He sure did set a wonderful example.\n \n Mark 6:3 (KJV) \n Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?

As I mentioned earlier, it's God's opinion I seek, not my own. Afterall, He's the one who invented opinons, and thinking and reasoning, the earth, all creation and the spirit realm ....
