   "The very basis for claims of Papal Authority stem from the New Testament passage: ?Thou art Peter; and on this rock I will build My church? and I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.? (Mat 16:18-19).\n \n But, how did the early church view this passage? Is the Catholic claim so clear-cut?\n A survey of early church fathers commentaries 1 shows seventeen Fathers thought of the rock as Peter, forty-four thought it referred to Peter?s confession of faith, sixteen thought Christ himself was the rock, while eight thought that the rock meant all of the Apostles. Thus 80% of these Church Fathers did not recognise ?the rock? as meaning Peter alone. Such a claim of Catholic commission therefore is not so clear.\n \n St. Augustine of Hippo wrote 2 ?See what praises follow this faith. ?Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build this Church.? What meaneth, ?Upon this rock I will build My Church??\n Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, ?Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,? saith He, ?I will build My Church.?\n \n St. Cyprian stated 3 ?Faith is the foundation of the Church, for it was not of the person but of the faith of St. Peter that it was said that the gates of hell should not prevail against it; it sis the confession of faith that has vanquished hell. Jesus Christ is the Rock. He did not deny the grace of His name when He called him Peter, because he borrowed from the rock the constancy and solidity of his faith. Endeavour then, thyself to be a rock ? thy rock is thy faith, and faith is the foundation of the Church. If thou art a rock, thou shalt be in the Church for the Church is built upon the rock??\n \n Turning again to St. Augustine 4 ?Therefore Peter is so called from the rock; not the rock from Peter; as Christ is not called Christ from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. ?Therefore,? He saith, ?Thou art Peter; and upon this Rock? which thou hast confessed, upon this Rock which thou hast acknowledged saying, ?Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, will I build My Church:? that is upon Myself, the Son of the living God, ?will I build My Church.? I will build thee upon Myself, not Myself upon thee. For men who wish to be built upon men, said, ?I am of Paul: and I of Appollos; and I of Cephas,? (1 Cor. 1:12) who is Peter, but upon the Rock, said ?But I am of Christ.\n And when the Apostle Paul ascertained that he was chose, and Christ despised, he said, ?Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?? (1 Cor. 1:13) And, as not in the name of Paul, so neither in the name of Peter; but in the name of Christ: that Peter might be built upon the Rock, not the Rock upon Peter.?\n \n Further, the power of binding and loosing is given to all the Apostles (Mat 18:18). Thus to turn to St. Augustine once more 5 ?He had not the primacy over the disciples (in discipulos) but among the disciples (in disipulis). His primacy among the disciples was the same as that of Stephen among the deacons?\n \n 1 by Jean de Launoy Epist. Vii., Opp. Vol. V., pt 2. p.99, Geneva, 1731\n quoted in Michael Whelton?s ?Two Paths: Papal Monarchy ? Collegial Tradition?, p27\n 2 Homily X on John V. 1-3 (quoted in ibid, pp27-8)\n 3 De Catholicae Ecclesia Unitate, cap. 4-5 (quoted in ibid, p28)\n 4 Sermon XXVI Matt.

One can look in the current Catechism of the Catholic Church and read that--Paragraph 424. But the confession of Peter cannot be seperated from the person of Peter.\n\n \n And the confession is not so separated. However, as shown, the Early Church did not believe that 'rock' necessarily meant Peter at all.\n \n \nIt is also true that the power to bind and loose is given to all the apostles but the keys to the kingdom were only given to one.\n\n \n However, as shown above, this did not mean that Peter was established as some type of clerical king.\n \n Acts 15:2 ?This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.?\n \n That a) they were in dispute, and b) they sought the other elders, not Peter alone.\n \n When we look at the first council, that of Jerusalem (Acts 15) it was presided over by James, who also rendered the final judgment, even as Peter was present?. \n ?When they finished, James spoke up:?It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.?\n \n Eusebius wrote ?This James, whom the early Christians surnamed the Righteous because of his outstanding virtue, was the first, as the records tell us, to be elected to the Episcopal throne of the Jerusalem church. Clement, in Outlines Book VI, puts it thus: ?Peter, James, and John, after the Ascension of the Saviour, did not claim pre-eminence because the Saviour had especially honoured them, but chose James the Righteous as Bishop of Jerusalem? 1\n \n Acts 15:22\n ?Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers.?\n That is, the council in session decided, not a pontiff.\n \n Thus, St. Cyprian says 2\n ?For neither did Peter, whom first the Lord chose? when Paul disputed with him afterwards about the circumcision, claim anything to himself insolently, nor arrogantly assume anything, so as to say that he held primacy, and that he out to be obeyed to novices and those lately come.?\n \n The claim too of Peter?s succession falls down in light of the fact that he founded many churches, not just Rome. My own church is Antiochian, a See established by Peter before he went to Rome.\n \n Rome became first in honour because it was the political centre of the Roman world? thus it was because of politics, not spirituality that saw Rome?s place established.\n Canon 6 of the First Council of Nicea 3 ?Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise, in Antioch and the other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges.\n \n St. Cyprian says 4 ?In the administration of the Church each bishop has the free discretion of his own will, having to account only to the Lord for his actions. None of us may set himself up as bishop of bishops, nor compel his brothers to obey him; every bishop of the Church has full liberty and complete power; as he cannot be judged by another, neither can he judge another.?\n \n Ignatius of Antioch thus addresses a letter 5 ?to the Church that is in charge of affairs in Roman quarters.? He doesn?t say ?To the church that is in charge everywhere throughout the Christian world.?\n \n Pope St. Victor (189-199) is sometimes claimed by Catholics as the first to demonstrate supreme power over the whole Christian world. The Church in Asia Minor celebrated Easter on a different day from the rest of the Christian churches, and although he initiated a synod to investigate, this was done by request, not command.\n Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus wrote to St. Victor 6 ??Victor and the Roman Church?, that is, the Church in Rome.\n Eusebius says 7 ?There is extant to this day a letter from those who attended a conference in Palestine presided over by Bishop Theophilus of Caesarea and Narcissus of Jerusalem; and from those at Rome a similar one, arising out of the same controversy, which names Victor as bishop. There are others from the Pontic bishops, presided over by Palmas as the senior; from the Gallic province, over which Irenaeus was archbishop, and from the bishops in Osrhoene and the cities of that region. There are personal letters from Bishop Bacchyllus of Corinth and very many more, who voiced the same opinion and judgment and gave the same vote. All these laid down one single rule ? the rule already stated.?\n \n Thus the decree came from the conference, not from the Pope. Polycrates disputed the council, however. Eusebius said 8 ?Thereupon Victor, head of the Roman Church attempted at one stroke to cut off from the common unity all the Asian diocese, together with the neighboring churches, on the ground of heterodoxy.?\n NOTE: Attempted?\n He failed because ??this was not tot the taste of all the bishops: they replied with a request that he would turn his mind to the things that make for peace and unity and love towards his neighbours. We still possess the words of these men who very sternly rebuked Victor. Among them was Irenaeus, who wrote on behalf of the Christians for whom he was responsible for in Gaul.?\n \n This hardly suggest universal over-lordship.\n \n 1 The History of the Church ?

James was presiding because the council was in the church over which he presided.\n\n \n There are a few important things.\n a) James presided, not Peter\n b) When someone spoke, whomever it was, no one else spoke over them.

Pope Pius XI claimed that the 3rd Ecumenical Council established papal supremacy.\n But Cyril said...\n \"Peter and John were both Apostles and saints and adorned with equal honours and powers\"\n P G Migne, 76:65 quoted in Michael Whelton's \"Two Paths: Papal Monarchy : Collegial Tradition\" p55.\n \n In fact, specifically in this debate, Pope Celestine held a synod in Rome in which he condemned Nestorius. He then wrote to Cyril informing him of this decision.\n \n Importantly, Cyril convened a council in Alexandria to discuss the issues raised in the Pope's letter, and they too condemned Nestorius. This is important, because even though the Pope had ruled on this, and had informed Cyril, Cyril did not just 'obey', but instead called a council of those in his own See. This was because as Cyril understood it, he was the boss of his own area. What was ruled in Rome did not affect him.",

   "The Pretence of Popes goes back a long way...\n \n Third Ecumenical Council: Ephesus (431) \n The Council of Ephesus, of more than 200 bishops, presided over by St. Cyril of Alexandria representing Pope Celestine I, defined the true personal unity of Christ, declared Mary the Mother of God (theotokos) against Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and renewed the condemnation of Pelagius. \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04423f.htm\n \n This lie stems from Pius XI's declaration (in Lux Veritatis) that Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria was a papal legate.\n \n Pope Celestine never refers to Patriarch Cyril as legate in correspondence to the Council, and only describes Arcadius, Projetus, and Philip as those who \"filled the place of the Apostolic See\"\n Mansi - VI, 1337\n quoted in Michael Whelton's \"Two Paths: Papal Monarchy : Collegial Tradition\", p61\n The fact that he sent legates at all shows that Cyril did not represent him.\n \n \n Three months before the Council had been called, Pope Celestin had issued an excommunication on Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople. The Council, however, ignored this and treated Nestorius as the proper Patriarch of Constantinople. The council then proceeded to examine the evidence and pronounced its own sentence: \"The holy Synod...to Nestorius the new Judas: Know that for thy impious doctrines thou was deposed by the holy Synod agreeably to the laws of the Church\"\n Mansi -IV, 1227 \n quoted in Ibid, pp57-8\n \n That is, they ignored the excommunication of Celestine and judged him for themselves. Pope Pius XI tried to put a spin on this saying that they merely ratified Celestine's sentence. This is not so, as shown Nestorius was accepted with honour, until the sentence was passed. The Emperor himself had invited Nestorius \"...In November the emperor, not regarding the papal condemnation as definitive, had already convoked a general council...\"\n Leo Donald Davis (a Jesuit) \"The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787)\" Their History and Theology\", Liturgical Press, Minnesota, 1990, p153.\n quoted in Ibid, p59\n \n Further, Roman Catholic historian Bishop Maret says \"The Pope pronounced in the affair of Nestorius a canonical judgment clothed with all the authority of his see. He had prescribed its execution. Yet, however, three months after this sentence and before its execution, all the episcopate is invited to examine afresh and to decide freely the question in dispute...\"\n Du Concile generale et de la paix religieuse - vol1, page 183, Bishop Henri Maret Paris, 1869\n quoted in Ibid, p60",

   "Origen said...\n \n 11. The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples Like Him.\n \n But if you suppose that upon that one Peter only the whole church is built by God, what would you say about John the son of thunder or each one of the Apostles? Shall we otherwise dare to say, that against Peter in particular the gates of Hades shall not prevail, but that they shall prevail against the other Apostles and the perfect? Does not the saying previously made, \"The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it,\"71 hold in regard to all and in the case of each of them? And also the saying, \"Upon this rock I will build My church\"?72 Are the keys of the kingdom of heaven given by the Lord to Peter only, and will no other of the blessed receive them? But if this promise, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,\"73 be common to the others, how shall not all the things previously spoken of, and the things which are subjoined as having been addressed to Peter, be common to them? For in this place these words seem to be addressed as to Peter only, \"Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,\"74 etc; but in the Gospel of John the Saviour having given the Holy Spirit unto the disciples by breathing upon them said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit,\"75 etc. Many then will say to the Saviour, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"but not all who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it by the revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself taking away the veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after this \"with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord\"76 they may speak through the Spirit of God saying concerning Him, \"Lord Jesus,\" and to Him, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"77 And if any one says this to Him, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto Him but through the Father in heaven, he will obtain the things that were spoken according to the letter of the Gospel to that Peter, but, as the spirit of the Gospel teaches, to every one who becomes such as that Peter was. For all bear the surname of \"rock\" who are the imitators of Christ, that is, of the spiritual rock which followed those who are being saved,78 that they may drink from it the spiritual draught.  But these bear the surname of the rock just as Christ does. But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from Him they are called Christians, and from the rock, Peters. And taking occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is Wisdom.79 And so in regard to all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the saints; and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, \"Thou art Peter,\" etc., down to the words, \"prevail against it.\" But what is the \"it\"? Is it the rock upon which Christ builds the church, or is it the church? For the phrase is ambiguous. Or is it as if the rock and the church were one and the same? This I think to be true; for neither against the rock on which Christ builds the church, nor against the church will the gates of Hades prevail; just as the way of a serpent upon a rock, according to what is written in the Proverbs,80 cannot be found. Now, if the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the rock,81 is incapable of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is outside the rock and the church, but have no power against it.\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-10/anf10-48.htm",

Dogma, simply, is necessary.\n \n \"...purity was preserved by dogmatic definitions and exclusions. It could not possibly have been preserved by anything else.\" Dogma is what condemned heresy and preserved orthodoxy. \"Nothing else but dogma could have resisted the riot of imaginative invention with which the pessimists were waging their war against nature...\" \"There will be no end to the weary debates about liberalising theology, until people face the fact that the only liberal part of it is really the dogmatic part.\" Dogma remains necessary to this day because there are no less \"imaginative inventions\" now as there were then although some are repeats.**\n \n Jesus was not afraid to proclaim dogma, nor is His Church.\n \n When you say that you are reluctant to lay down dogma it may be that you are afraid to lay down dogma. It may mean that you have no uniting authority that will allow you to enforce dogma. Do the Orthodox have any power that would allow them to cause an effect on the universal church? If not, then where is its universality? It does not seem as though it is the  Orthodox Church. It seems as if it is the many Orthodox churches.\n \n The same problem that is happening in the Anglican Church with ordaining a homosexual bishop could conceivably occur in the Orthodox churches. Or any number of doctrinal errors or inventions could occur...because there is no uniting, binding authority on the churches as a whole.\n \n Lack of this authority that is outside of a single church, lack of the authority that is truly international and universal, leads to a loose association of single, national churches with single, national authority.\n \n **(you guessed it! quotes are from G.K.

It's 31, not 13.\n You are correct, it does say that Peter is given the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, alone.\n \n Origen himself stated his chapter (quoted earlier) The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples Like Him... which is in fact from the same source; the Commentary on Matthew.\n \n See Chapter 14\n \n 14.IN WHAT SENSE THE \"KEYS\" ARE GIVEN TO PETER, AND EVERY PETER. LIMITATIONS OF THIS POWER. \n \n That the keys are given to all those like Peter!\n see...\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen-matthew.html\n \n And so again Origen believes that Peter means 'Peter-like'. He states it in two chapters. I would guess then your quote is therefore out of context\n \n \n But, suppose you were right...\n How then does this support the Papacy? Peter founded the Church in Antioch. St. Ignatius of Antioch, a well-venerated writer, was thus equally conferred with Peter's blessing as the members of the many other churches Peter founded. And so it was, that the rock-faith of Peter founded many Christian communities.\n \n It is not uncommon that individual Apostles were granted special gifts...\n John was the only one who was allowed to rest his head on Jesus, and who took sole care of the Theotokos Mary, and was called her son, by Jesus Himself, thus making him a brother of Christ.\n \n John was the only of the 12 not martyred.
