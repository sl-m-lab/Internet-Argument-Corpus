   "People are generally compelled to apologize from 2 sources:\n \n (a) at gunpoint i.e. apologize or you will be fired (no pun intended)\n (b) by natural contrition engendered by pure self-determined emotion\n \n Apology (b) is authentic by the absence of external or foreign compulsion. Conversely apology (a) is false, corrupted by external influence.\n \n People are compelled to 'find' god from 2 sources:\n \n (a) at the pulpit i.e. forced-fed beginning from playschool\n (b) by self-revelation i.e. through the pure intercession of god himself\n \n Revelation (b) strikes a minority of people, many of whom are coincidentally locked away in institutions, with reincarnated Caesars and Napoleons. Revelation (a) afflicting the vast majority of 'believers' is as with apology by gunpoint, false. This form of belief is wholly artifical entirely fabricated / taught by impure coercion. \n \n Ergo religion preached is religion forced. At once faith is corrupted with the preacher's first violent thump against the guardrail.",
