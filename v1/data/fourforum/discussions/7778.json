   "The US Jewish Lobby seems to be highly interested in a new wave of Moslem riots in Europe to be caused by republishment of cartoons depicting Muhammad by many European newspapers. Of cause, further unrest is to be centralized in Europe over again and the whole plan is to be brought into action by notorious Jews - for example, Jewish oligarch Boris Berezovski, who is currently having his residence in England, is about to organize a travelling exhibit of the cartoons on Muhammad in a number of European states. The rumor has it that it was namely Berezovski who paid Danish cartoonists and arranged first publication in Jullands-Posten with the help of his long-time friend Flemming Rose, cultural editor in JP. Do I need to explain that the sight of faithful Moslems being furious about the exhibit and smashing down in wrath banking-houses and stores and setting afire publishing houses, is only designed to persuade Europeans that Islam is a dangerous religion to deal with and new crusades by the US against countries of the Middle East - Iran in particular - are highly needed. In this context I'd like to warn Mr Berezovski that he is dancing on a volcano. There are pretty many Moslems in England too and who knows, maybe one of them succeeds in taking his life.",
