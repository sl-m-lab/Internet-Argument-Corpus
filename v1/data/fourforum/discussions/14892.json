Voters are not required to list a political party, but are instructed to write at least the first three letters of any party they want to be affiliated with. The state of Arizona recognizes dozens of affiliations.\n \n Records obtained by CNN show Loughner chose to write IND on one form, and independent (misspelled) on the second form.\n \n Roads said Loughner voted in the general elections in 2006 and 2008, but did not vote in 2010. The county lists his voter status as inactive after mail sent to his address was twice returned as undeliverable.\n \n By definition you're guilty of practicing intellectual dishonesty.

   "Well I for one have already asked everyone to slow and remember the victims and their families. I may be wrong for feeling this way, but when I see death and tragedy wielded as a club to try and bludgeon others&#8212;by implying those who disagree with you are being &#8220;watched&#8221; and are somehow kindred spirits with the alleged shooter&#8212;I see insincerity. I know the temptation is great. I know it is hard to resist the allure of using this tragedy as an excuse to claim a false moral superiority over people you have never met. I&#8217;m not one to wrap up my respect for the dead around a rock so I can throw it at the heads of those &#8220;cowardly fanatics&#8221; I hate even though I have never met them just because they own a gun. I have no interest in telling the victims and their families &#8220;excuse me for a moment while I use your pain to lob verbal bombs at people who had nothing to do with this.&#8221; \n \n I see now there are people capable of doing this, but I would be ashamed to be thought of as one of them. \n \n I&#8217;ll just say it again. Innocent people have been murdered and wounded. Pray for them and their families. Pray also for justice&#8212;pray that the man who is responsible for choosing to commit these crimes is punished. But do not suggest that he is a coward because he sought the shelter of a fundamental right to remain silent. It only encourages fools to believe that a man must be guilty until he can prove himself innocent. Even if you abhor the crimes, as I do, or hate and want to blame the weapon used, as some do, please remember that we are not entitled to pick and choose who is allowed the protections our criminal justice system provides. I have experience with this, and I know this is a very dangerous and foolish road to travel. Justice will be done regardless of whether he elects to remain silent&#8212;indeed&#8212;justice will only be done if the government respects all of the pre-trial and trial rights our system of criminal justice provides. Thankfully those who are investigating this tragedy seem to understand this, and we need to do so as well. \n \n And if you don&#8217;t believe in God then that&#8217;s fine with me&#8212;it's your life and I don&#8217;t pretend to control it. I respectfully ask that everyone follow their own advice and check their hatred of others at the keyboard when they post their condolences. There is a time to love and a time to hate, I just suggest that the time to hate is not now.",

He was opposed to immigration reform (RW) - which the Congresswoman supported and the Federal Judge was hearing a major case on; he was opposed to health care reform (RW) - which the Congresswoman voted in favor of; and he did not think the Congresswoman was trustworthy on gun issues since she has been supporting the President on these other issues. Like many of you fanatics, he was a \"you're either with us or against us\" sorta fella (extreme right wing). In addition, he was an anti-Semite, reading literature by Adolph Hitler - which is also a right-wing position, not \"pinko Karl Marx\" as you so ignorantly put it; in this regard, the Congresswoman is Jewish, and was Arizona's first Jewish woman representative, as well as the youngest woman to ever serve for Arizona. One can also easily discern that he was likely another insecure-with-his-manhood young fellow, making him a sexist, attached to his bang-bang like the rest of you are, as your artificial replacement appendage for what you lack in real character or personhood.

   "Well I for one have already asked everyone to slow and remember the victims and their families. I may be wrong for feeling this way, but when I see death and tragedy wielded as a club to try and bludgeon others-by implying those who disagree with you are being \"watched\" and are somehow kindred spirits with the alleged shooter-I see insincerity. I know the temptation is great. I know it is hard to resist the allure of using this tragedy as an excuse to claim a false moral superiority over people you have never met. I'm not one to wrap up my respect for the dead around a rock so I can throw it at the heads of those \"cowardly fanatics\" I hate even though I have never met them just because they own a gun. I have no interest in telling the victims and their families \"excuse me for a moment while I use your pain to lob verbal bombs at people who had nothing to do with this.\" \n \n I see now there are people capable of doing this, but I would be ashamed to be thought of as one of them. \n \n I'll just say it again. Innocent people have been murdered and wounded. Pray for them and their families. Pray also for justice-pray that the man who is responsible for choosing to commit these crimes is punished. But do not suggest that he is a coward because he sought the shelter of a fundamental right to remain silent. It only encourages fools to believe that a man must be guilty until he can prove himself innocent. Even if you abhor the crimes, as I do, or hate and want to blame the weapon used, as some do, please remember that we are not entitled to pick and choose who is allowed the protections our criminal justice system provides. I have experience with this, and I know this is a very dangerous and foolish road to travel. Justice will be done regardless of whether he elects to remain silent-indeed-justice will only be done if the government respects all of the pre-trial and trial rights our system of criminal justice provides. Thankfully those who are investigating this tragedy seem to understand this, and we need to do so as well. \n \n And if you don't believe in God then that's fine with me-it's your life and I don't pretend to control it. I respectfully ask that everyone follow their own advice and check their hatred of others at the keyboard when they post their condolences. There is a time to love and a time to hate, I just suggest that the time to hate is not now.\n\n \n BRYAN, look at his opening post and I will give you a chance to rephrase.",

   "Well here you are again Brady declaring an all out assault on the rights of the people and trying to use the actions of one deranged individual as an example of why the entire country should feel compelled to change its laws. That's exactly what happened with the Dunblane shooting but we won't allow it to happen here.\n \n You could've easily started a new thread to post this dribble but for some strange reason you decided to resurrect a thread started by the former J Miro who was banned for continued sexual harassment of other members.

Giffords, Others in Tucson Most Recent Mass Shooting Involving Legal Concealed Weapons Holder, VPC Concealed Carry Killers February Update (02/11/2011)\n \n And the insansity continues. Gun nuts are still demanding weaker gun laws.\n\n \n So where to begin with tearing this Violence Policy Center dribble apart and making you look foolish? There's so many ways to go about it and only so little time to actually formulate a post.\n \n I could start by showing that a significant number of the cases being cited by the Violence Policy Center haven't even been determined in a court of law which would show they've basically determined all parties are guilty before the verdict is even in.\n \n Or I could show the number of people in Chicago that were shot to death in the year preceding the end of the city's handgun ban meaning that everyone who was shot was done so with illegally possessed weapons. In 2007 the number of cases determined to be genuine homicide was 442 according to statistics provided by the FBI. \n \n Meanwhile according to the Violence Policy Center the number of people \"murdered\" by people with concealed carry permits is 288 from 2007 until now. Comparatively that's a rate of 72 per year in places where people are freely allowed to carry guns verses the 400+ in Chicago where only the police are allowed to carry guns. And let's not forget Chicago is a place where nobody was legally allowed to own a handgun, no store could even sell a handgun within city territory.\n \n So let's review. Since 2007 supposedly 288 people were murdered in incidents that involved a concealed carry permit. That's around 72 people each year for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The homicide statistics for Chicago in those same years has been 442, 510, 458 and 435. Added up that's 288 compared to 1,845. That's a rate of more than 6 to 1. For every 1 person supposedly murdered by someone with a concealed carry permit, illegally possessed weaponry in Chicago was responsible for eat least 6 people being murdered.\n \n That's enough number crunching to cast doubt on the validity of the Violence Policy Center and their position regarding \"concealed carry killers\" now I can get on to another more relevant topic.\n \n You're claiming that Loughner was legally concealing his Glock Model 19 before opening fire on Giffords and 19 other people. You claim this simply because in the time preceding the shooting he hid his gun underneath his jacket/coat before pulling it out and shooting. \n \n What you're doing here is trying to split hairs and make a technical point. But it simply doesn't work that way. Just because he hid his gun out of sight doesn't mean he was carrying it concealed, nor is there any evidence to suggest that he was fully within the law to do so and can't face prosecution for his actions. Simply because Loughner hid the gun with a piece of clothing is no more carrying concealed, than a person's concealed weapon being considered \"open carry\" because the wind caught their coat and blew it open.\n \n Simply because something exists by reason of a technicality doesn't mean that's actually correct. New Jersey loves to pull this trick, arresting people for possession of a firearm because they stop for gas or directions or a bathroom break because at the time of the arrest their vehicle was stationary and they supposedly don't qualify for the \"traveling exception\" the law provides.\n \n You really don't make sense Brady. For Loughner's actions you blame the existence of the Glock Model 19, the fact that Loughner was able to buy it (because he wasn't entered into the NICS system) the availability of the so-called \"high-capacity ammunition magazines\" the law in Arizona at the time, the conservative news media, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, the National Rifle Association, republicans, etc. but you don't blame Loughner himself. You look for somebody to blame for his actions because supposedly he isn't responsible for what he did. Well it just doesn't work that way. The only one responsible for Loughner's actions is Loughner himself. Nobody compelled him to be a murderer, he wasn't forced to do what he did. He did it simply because that's what HE HIMSELF wanted to do. Blame him and him exclusively.",
