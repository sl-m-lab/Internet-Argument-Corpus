Indeed, Jewish ethics requires the idea that humans decide for themselves how to act. This is so because temptation, and with it the possibility of sin, allows people to choose good and thus have moral merit.

   "Well, I see several interesting questions have been brought up. Well, I'm a Catholic, so I'll try to explain a little about original sin. Firstly, remember that what we're dealing with here is pretty abstract philosophical and theological speculation, so we're not talking about particular cases, just general concepts.\n \n First of all, unlike Judaism, Catholicism (I specify because I'm not sure what other Christian denominations think about this) does not endorse the existence of two \"equal tendencies\" or \"inclinations\" in the soul. On one side, we have our divine souls, created in the likeness of God. The potencies of the soul, intelligence and free will, therefore, are naturally inclined to goodness (intelligence has a natural tendency towards truth (instead of ignorance) and free will has a natural tendency toward doing goodness). This is what God put into us. \n \n Original sin is a corruption of this. I know that many Protestant denominations claim that original sin is a degradation of the human person, making them innately evil and incapable of saving themselves through their own free actions (effectively claiming you are either saved or condemned from conception, regardless of what you do in life). Catholicism claims that original sin is merely a corruption. Adam and Eve were the first people to use their God-given free will in an \"incorrect\" manner (i.e. disobeying God and knowingly doing evil), thereby transferring to all of us (their \"descendants\") the capacity to do the same. In other words, original sin is the capacity we have to be evil, it is not an action in itself, but rather an \"ability\" given to our free will by Adam and Eve's fateful mistake. This entails the weakness of out action in the face of temptation, so original sin not only makes us capable of doing evil, but it also weakens our previously perfect intelligence in the face of temptation (the desire to do evil).\n \n For the greater scheme of things, original sin also entails a corruption of Creation itself: death. With original sin came the first divine punishment. By casting us from His light and condemning us to be mortal, God put Adam and Eve in an imperfect world, in which evil is capable of existing (something which in the Beginning was not possible outside of the free action of man). This means that it is only through sin (and firstly through original sin) that the world is destroyed and degraded, and not through the action (or \"wrath\") of God.\n \n In broader terms, original sin does not mean we are all innately evil, by no means is this true, it means that our freedom of will has been weakened, and our knowledge of evil (which we previously lacked) makes us capable of falling into sin willingly, instead of going to God. Baptism is a sacrament that cleanses the soul from the stain of that first mistake, but it does not eliminate the consequences: corruption of the will and the mind, death and degradation of Creation. So, what Christians are called to do is to \"join the armies of Christ\" and attempt not only to stay away from sin (which is I think pretty much the Jewish ideal), but also to follow in the steps of Christ: giving ourselves to others. We have to do more than just not be evil, we have to be saints (at least that's the ideal). Christ paid for original sin in all our names, not only through His Passion and Death, but also through His teachings. His teachings of giving more than what is expected, going that \"extra mile\", even unto sacrificing one's own life for others is what wipes the consequences of original sin from us. So, if we do this, those consequences will be taken back by God, and death nor evil will be no more.\n \n With respect to what trebor said. I don't know about other Christians, but in Catholicism sin and grace are certainly not mere \"states\". Sin is an action, an action that goes against the will of God. This action causes a \"stain\" in the soul (thereby putting us in a \"state of sin\"), which is not eliminated but through Penitence and Communion. Grace is, as I said before, much more than mere absence of sin, it is a state of communion with the will of God as expressed through Christ, in which the person gives himself to others and sacrifices for others. This is why generosity is the ultimate value of Christianity. Otherwise, it would be preached to merely stay away from sin and do nothing further.",

It is of course best if you believe in Christ, but then again, there are many in the world that, as you say, \"cannot embrace Christianity\", and it would be very unfair for them to be cast from salvation if they are incapable of knowing Christ and participating in His Church.\n \n The position of the Catholic Church is very much what I've just said. H.H. Pope John Paul II stated this clearly, saying that those who cannot know Christ, but nevertheless respect the nature of things and the dignity of the person, will be saved in the end by the infinite mercy of God. Dante Alighieri made a very beautiful allegory of this doctrine in his \"Divine Comedy\", where there is a scene in which Jesus Christ descends to limbo (the highest circle of hell) and brings with Him to heaven all those pagans that had been virtuous and pure before the coming of Christ to the world (and thus couldn't have known Him). In this way, in Dante's story, were saved great figures of Antiquity like Aristotle, Socrates, Pericles, etc.\n \n It is ridiculous that those who are pure of heart and of soul, and are selfless and virtuous, should be condemned because they were born outside of the influence of the Church, and never could have converted to the faith of Christ. Now, this only applies to those who cannot be Christians, but not to those who willingly abandon Christ. Those who have known Christ and, having seen Him and understood Him, turn away from Him and His Church, are more complicated, because they have knowingly turned away from God's faith. Nonetheless, I think that it is not completely wrong to believe that in the end, all those who were good will be saved through repentment and (especially) the infinite mercy of God.\n \n With respect to the bonus question, I am very aware of this, and this is exactly what Christians do. It is wrong to think that the good Christians do in the world is done only for the selfish desire of salvation. Of course, salvation is the \"prize\", but in truth, all the sense that any good deed has must be earthly, it must be centred on others, and not on one's self. This is true selflessness. It is somewhat hypocritical to do good only for your own sake, it the same thing as taking care of your rich aunt in her last years only so she puts you on her will. True Christian virtue is to do good for the sake of others, even unto your own death. And in that moment, God will bring you to His side as reward, but only because you understood the true statement of faith: look not to your own self, but only for the betterment of others and of the world.

I hasten to add that such view carries its own set of logical problems not the least of which is its exclusivist nature.\n\n \n I don't know where you are, but I'll assume you are either American or British. This is probably why you have always had this view of Christianity, living in a place in which the Catholic Church is not very present (despite it being a very commong topic of debate). The views you are expressing about Christianity are those of the majority of Protestant denominations, but do not reflect with total justice the views of the vast majority of Christians in the world (which are Catholics).\n \n The path to God is always Jesus Christ, this is common to all Christian churches, however, it is accepted by the Catholic Church that there are many who will never know Christ, and so it is not reasonable that they should be condemned to hel for this unfortunate turn of luck. By saying that many who did not believe in Christ can be saved, I am not saying that turning away from Christ is something that the Church justifies or accepts (obvoiusly), but I am saying that salvation can come to those who are faithful to the teachings of Christ even when they are away from Him or don't know Him.\n \n So, abandoning the Church and being good is not a \"path\" to salvation, but it is plausible to believe (so said John Paul II) that God will extend his infinite mercy to all of these people. People who performed the Word of Christ despite not knowing it or rejecting it formally. None the less, the rejection of Christ is a grave sin, in general terms.",

   "Was the sole reason though that these great figures predated a savior?\n\n \n No, the reason is that they were good people (virtuous), but they did not (and could not) know Christ. The fact that they lived before the coming of Christ is circumstantial, meaning that, if they had lived in modern times, but in some remote place completely away from the knowledge of Christ, they would have been saved too. The common denominator to this kind of salvation is the impossibility to know Christ.\n \n \nThis is a most interesting paragraph, going through treacherous religious territory at breakneck speeds, swerving into inpenetable barriers, only to emerge in the rarified air of knowing it's not who you believe in, it's what you believe in.\n\n \n Well, yes, to some extent. But the Catholic Church does not commend atheism or believing something that is not the true faith. What is commended is what you do in life, how you live it, and if you are capable of living virtuously even outside of the faith. Of course, the best and only way to be saved is through the Church, and so abandoning the Church of Christ is sinful and wicked, because it is like denying one's one chance to be saved, despising the sacrifice Christ made for everyone. This is all that the Church can say here on Earth. But it is plausible to believe that in the End, God will be merciful with those who lived a Christian life despite not being Christian, and that is someting that is outside of the knowledge of any man, including the Ministers of the Church.\n \n \nI hope in this new territory we're occupying right now that you're open to an honest discussion of what Jesus really did for our betterment.\n\n \n I agree, this is very interesting ground.",
