   "\n Buddhists want to return to their original nature which is the perfect nature yet they must forget the self to do that? Can you elaborate?\n\n First of all, when a buddhist refers to the self, he is referring to the ego. We feel it is the ego, the self-importance which causes suffering. Without an ego, people would not be hateful, they would not be greedy, they would not be spiteful etc. We believe that the ego is developed throughout life, but that originally, all beings are pure and perfect.\n \n\n Christians say one must deny \"one's self\" but I'm not sure how to forget my self.\n\n It is very difficult to forget your ego, your desires, your seemingly automatic responses- but sometimes it must be done. No one ever said these things were easy.\n \n \n \n \nWhat is Buddha nature?\n\n ok- it is very difficult to put into words, but I'm gonna try. A buddha is a fully enlightened being. We beleive that originally, all beings are perfect, but that from the first moment you enter the world, you begin to be tainted- so to speak- by the imperfections of the world. You learn how to be from your environment, from those around you, from the things you encounter throughout life. You begin to react in different ways, listening to your ego- acting out in anger, in frustration, in ignorance. We believe that with this, you are straying farther and farther from your original [perfect] nature.\n \n \nWhat is samsara world?\n samsara is a sanskrit word, that basically refers to the world all of us are experiencing. IN buddhsit terms, it is the world of suffering, of greed, hatred and ignorance, and of continuous rebirth. The alternative to this samsaric world is Nirvana- which is where all buddhists are trying to get to. \n \n \n \n\n Christians do try to perfect the self, in so far as we try to live like Christ. Ultimately, though, we are held back by sin. We call on God who gives us Grace.\n\n \n It seems to me, and I think I've said it before, that the biggest of the many differences between christianity (and other abrahamic religions) is that while christianity points to a divine power without- calling on God as you put it, buddhism points within- teaching that all power and wisdom is part of your original, or inherant nature, but you've forgotten it in this world of suffering.\n \n I hope these answers help out, but please realize that these are my own interpretations, and that I am still trying to grasp all of these concepts for myself. I tried to find a decent link that's not full of foreign sanskrit terminology, but have failed so far.",
