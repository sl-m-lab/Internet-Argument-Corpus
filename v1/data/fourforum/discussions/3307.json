I'll just touch on a few of your questions.\n \n Would science have happened. Yes, probably even sooner and with greater strength. People want answers. For generations people felt \"God did it\" was a sufficient answer. Without religion the quest for real answers would have started sooner.\n \n Would the Middle East be a problem? Yes. The reason that the Middle East has so much influence isn't Islam, it's oil. Whatever the culture of the people there, whatever their beliefs, the fact that they live on top of a giant oil reserve will give them an undue amount of influence.\n \n The Haulocaust? No, without Jews it obviously couldn't have happened as it did. However, Hitler was just looking for someone to use as a rallying point for the German people. Without a religious scapegoat he would have chosen some other group to persecute. He did go after gays and gypsys, he could easily have added more groups to that list. \n \n To answer your question in broader terms would require a novel. A novel which could very well make a good read, and which I assume someone must have written. Anyone have any suggestions?",

   "He did go after gays and gypsys, he could easily have added more groups to that list. \n\n Maybe, but also maybe people didn't like gays and gypsies because of religion in the first place. All the time i hear that in the bible it says Homosexuality is a sin. And about the gypsies, people hated them so much because they did many of the things that the bible forbid. Like witchcraft for example, i have read that witchcraft is a sin and should not be practiced. If there wasn't a religion then there wouldn't be a bible saying that Homosexuality and witchcraft is a sin.\n \n \nTo answer your question in broader terms would require a novel. A novel which could very well make a good read, and which I assume someone must have written. Anyone have any suggestions?\n\n Yea that goes to anyone that reads this, that you don't have to answer them all. You only have to write about the one(s) that interests you.\n :)",
