The states carrying out these votes are California, Colorado, South Dakota, and Michigan (stem cell-related). There hasn't really been much reporting about it since the presidential election has been dominating the news.\n \n These ballot initiative votes can be monitored at Local Ballot Measures - Election Center 2008 - Elections & Politics from CNN.com",

Technological edge isn't worth throwing ethics and standards out the window and using for experimental purposes what will become a person if left to grow and develop. We could get a \"medical and technological edge\" by taking people off the street and experimenting on them too, but that doesn't mean we should do it.",
