Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that the President's claim that Iraq tried to buy uranium from Africa was based on forged information\n \n Is Iraq a real terrorist threat, deserving immediate dismantlement and political reform?

   "Welcome to the forum. I'm Broker, I'll be attempting to dismantle all your arguments during your tenure. (;))\n \n Let's begin! This will be easy...\n \n 1. UN inspections were quite limited for a country the size of California. They didn't find any of the nuclear weapons materials either (plans, uranium reprocessing device in US hands). They found one illegal drone... the US Air Force has over 400 now under its control.\n \n We know that the Iraqis were possibly conducting smallpox research in 1997. UNSCOM inspectors actually found a bioreactor labeled smallpox... they tried to blow the facility up, but the French vetoed the proposal. Inspectors attempted to make the building unusable by blocking the ventilation system with concrete, but such biocontainment facilities are small and easy to setup and take apart. We also know that the Iraqis were practicing weaponizing their anthrax in 1997, working in a level three biocontainment facility using a harmless anthrax-related bacterium.\n \n An Iraqi officer in a recent interview said he had WMD delivered to him in the field. It was not used because most of the troops left their posts. He said that the weapons were capable of being deployed, guess when, within 45 minutes. He was the source of the British government's claim.\n \n \n 2. Saddam Hussein had extensive ties to terrorism. Not just al Qaeda, of course. But they're not the only people who want to see everyone of us dead.\n \n Most importantly of all, captured al Qaeda planner Abu Zubaydah incicates that people saying bin Laden and Hussein wouldn't work together on the grounds of the latter being a secular leader are wrong. According to him, bin Laden looked at Hussein as the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n \n Abdul Rahman Yasin was being harbored in Iraq. Yasin was a suspect in the 1993 WTC bombing. The Saddam regime provided him with monthly payments.\n \n One of the lead hijackers, Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi Intelligence official in Prague named Ahmed al-Ani. Although attempts to discredit this have been made, Czech officials at the cabinet level have not backed away from the claim. In recent days more evidence has surfaced on this, and now there is some indication that Atta also trained in Iraq.\n \n In October 2001, two Iraqi defectors said that a 707 fuselage was being used to train terrorists in hijacking techniques. The US military has recovered this and a terrorist training camp, along with two other camps outside of Baghdad.\n \n Iraqi Intelligence Chief Faruk Hijazi met with bin Laden associates on multiple occasions. Hijazi is in US custody, and confirms the meetings.\n \n An Iraqi Intelligence Memo was discovered in 1998 with bin Ladens name whited out. It described a meeting between an al Qaeda representatives and regime officials. Days afterward, al Qaeda issued an edict denouncing the US for crimes against Iraq. At about the same time, al Qaeda deputy Ayman Zawahiri was payed $300,000 by Iraq.\n \n 1,993 memos were found detailing the assistance Iraqi Intelligence gave to various terrorist groups.\n \n An Ansar al Islam base was bombed in the early days of the war. The US military estimates 500- 600 Islamic militants were killed.\n \n Iraqi intelligence met with al Qaeda officials in Afghanistan multiple times to help train al Qaeda militants with chemical agents.\n \n \n 3. North Korea is no threat. They have Patriot missiles stationed all around and 700,000 troops on their border. They want more money, and that's all they want. If we cut food and oil off they're starve and the nation stops. They depend on us to survive (ironically).\n \n \n 4. We all agree that part of the case was false. But the Brits based that claim on more than those forged documents. The Britons stand by it.",

This time, it was his second collection of short stories that did him in. The government had approved the book, but Ahmed sneaked into one of the stories a poorly veiled allegory criticizing Hussein. \n \n \"The Mukhabarat was not amused. Agents collected the entire 1,000-copy print run from the Mosul bazaar, piled the books on the ground and ordered Ahmed to torch them. After that, all he needed to do to make things right for the regime was to serve nine months of solitary confinement in a rat-infested cell.\" \n -- San Francisco Chronicle, April 2, 2003 \n \n ------\n \n \"Former Iraqi weightlifter Raed Ahmad, who defected to the U.S. during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, told the Daily News that athletes are routinely deprived of food and sleep, and the soles of their feet are caned. They are chained to walls for days, he said, and sometimes thrown into tanks filled with raw sewage.\" \n -- The Daily News (New York), April 2, 2003 \n \n Here is WMD info:\n Kuwait foils Iraqi-WMD smuggling attempt \n Report: Biological warheads, chemical arms en route to Europe snagged\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Posted: October 1, 2003\n 5:54 p.m. Eastern\n \n \n \n \u00a9 2003 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n Following months of frustrated searches by hundreds of U.S. and British investigators for Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, some have turned up in Kuwait, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Siyassah. \n \n The pro-government daily reports Kuwaiti security forces foiled an attempted smuggling of $60 million worth of chemical weapons and biological warheads from Iraq to an unnamed European country. \n \n And now Al Qaeda Link:\n \n 1) Official: Saddam Confidant Linked to Terror Group\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,101635,00.html\n \n 2)Weekly Standard: Intel Report Links Saddam, Usama\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,103176,00.html\n \n I can produce much more if needed. \n \n As to number 3 it is really quite obvious. The invasion of Iraq provides for a strategic US interest. There are a number of previously hostile countries which have now begun a heavy handed war on terrorism since the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Bush has forced Al Qaeda to operate on two fronts. We have the man power to handle that. They do not. Additionally we see greater cooperation from countries like Iran, and Saudi Arabia. \n \n I think it is easy enough to justify the war. I don't like my relatives being in harms way any more than the next person. Freedom is often envied and requires guarding. The Iraqi people will now get a taste of freedom. I also believe that as Sadam is interrogated we will find much more information.",

Does a strike on Iraq really fall under the vague umbrella of \"War on Terrorism\"?\n \n you decide...\n\n \n The reason why Bush took a detour from the real war on terror was because he wanted to please his corporate masters and his daddy.\n \n Of course, the apologists on here will say and do anything to cloud the issue.\n \n We never said that saddam wasn't a terrrable person and is guilty of much that he was accused of, but much of that was 12 years ago and from material supplied by the USA and done while an ally of the USA as well.

The current iraqi government has preserved memoranda and communiques from Saddam to known Al-Qaeda members. The documentation seized upon entry into Bagdhad was mountainous. Currently a link has been established that Muhammed Atta was trained at an Al-Qaeda facility in the heart of Bagdhad with Saddam's permission.\n \n As for WMD, Kuwait had intercepted $60million worth of chemical weapons that were attempted to be smuggled out of Iraq sometime in mid october of 2003. The evidence grows daily of the delivery of WMD's to Syria including satelite footage of a huge convoy of military vehicles approximately one month before the war. \n \n The news excerpts are stories that the Iraqi people reported to the mainstream media of Saddam's brutality.

Bush is not exactly their boy. The WMD story in kuwait was only picked up by the likes of Fox, and Drudge etc. The other media outlets did not even hit it or only barely. I think this points out their bias against bush. The info was picked up by other media outlets in the international community. I think the info is reliable.\n \n As for the kuwait story, those stories on that link are not necessarily related. However, I do note that the info was not confirmed by the un. It doesn't say that the UN has confirmed it to be untrue either.\n \n There is plenty of evidence in the media. Also, Undoubtedly there is evidence that none of us know of.

That isn't stealing an election... the electoral college was designed to make states and population important. Is Canada's system not fair because the Prime Minister appoints Senators for life? I wouldn't say so, it's your system.\n \n Oh, yes, the world loves Canada! Open your eyes. You've been protected because we're below you.

Smallpox would kill hundreds of millions of people if it was ever released. No one is immune to it anymore either.\n \n At first, yes. Arabs hate that we bombed Iraq and occupy. But in the long run, Iraq can become a great nation. Iraqis will eventually have much higher standards of living and enjoy a lot more wealth... people will see that and they will realize US action was good.\n \n bin Laden is about 50 times harder than Saddam. He's hiding in a cave somewhere with thousands of loyal and armed followers. He uses messengers to communicate and probably can't be seen by people who would tip us off.... And more evidence is surfacing that Iraq played a bigger role than we thought in 9/11. We know about the Czech meetings, but the British press is reporting that Atta was trained in Iraq.\n \n Of course Iraq wasn't the reason. We already have been to Afghanistan, then we moved to Iraq.\n \n Moving to your Bush claims of Iraq-al Qaeda links...

Bush sent troops into Iraq to specifically eliminate Saddam, even though the threat of chemical warfare was much greater in 1998. its obvious this strike is supposed to be in response to the 9-11 attacks. so how do you justify eliminating Saddam? it seems to me that Al-qaeda was fueling Saddam's tyrany, not the other way around. in other word, al-qaeda is the root problem. everyone knows this.

   "Thank you very much, epaphras. I should have done what you did days ago... I'm glad you did\n \n I read your link on the Al-qaeda article. I remember back in 1998 when the nerve gas threats were starting to rise. they even showed video clips of its effects on animals. those were very real threats. although at the time al-qaeda wasn't a household word like today, I dont doubt that that nerve-gas project was very closely linked to Al-qaeda, probably even initiated by them\n \n but is that what this war is about? Bush sent troops into Iraq to specifically eliminate Saddam, even though the threat of chemical warfare was much greater in 1998. its obvious this strike is supposed to be in response to the 9-11 attacks. so how do you justify eliminating Saddam? it seems to me that Al-qaeda was fueling Saddam's tyrany, not the other way around. in other word, al-qaeda is the root problem. everyone knows this. Saddam is simply an easy target, everyone knows this too.\n \n but why strike Saddam and leave the al-qaeda terrorist ring relatively intact?\n\n \n I have been away for the weekend but these other two fellows have responded well. You state the sending of troops to eliminate Saddam as a sole goal of the intervention. That minimizes the entire thing. Several Al-Qaeda training camps have been destroyed and valuable intelligence gained from them. \n \n Saddam supported Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda supported Saddam. Saddam was a tyrant and lethal to his own people. WMD have been discovered trying to be sold in Kuwait. We know he used them in the Iran Iraq war. We know the Iraqi's were meticulous records keepers. We know they destroyed many records. We know they moved a huge convoy into Syria before the war. We know that mass graves continue to be found.\n \n Al-Qaeda continues to exist, yes, but damaged, much money seized, and many top leaders dead or in custody. The Taliban is no longer in power and clean up operations continue in Afghanistan. Take a look on a map at the locales of Afghanistan and Iraq and look what is in between. That provides a nice general strategic view as well.\n \n I think the reasons for the war are clear to anyone willing to look at them. They are many. Both strategic and tactical. They are humanitarian and political. The idea that we are simply trying to get oil or it was some personal vendetta is simply not born out by the facts. \n \n People seem to think that a president can act without anyone else having a say. Like a king says go munch on the french and anyone that doesn't like it gets beheaded. Bush has the joint chiefs of staff, the pentagon, His own cabinet, congress etc. The majority of which he did not appoint and got to their positions by merit. Without their cooperation and advice there would have been no war. The same was true of Clinton. Ultimately he is responsible for the choices he has made but do not forget that he is advised by many. He is not a lone sovereign.",

What makes you think we aren't after him as we speak?\n \n So should we have agreed with the UN, in keeping Saddam in power and the Iraqi civilians in torture chambers?\n\n the WMD case for the war is still weak, and mostly seems to be a cover-up for Bush's real intentions. Remember, this war was supposedly sparked by the events of 9/11. the Iraqi torture chambers were operating long before then, and the government never seemed to be motivated to do something drastic about it. I see a definite shift in focus and target\n \n I saw this article in the Reuters website (Jan 1, 2004):\n \nBetween late January and May, the 123,000 war-weary U.S. troops currently in Iraq will be pulled out and replaced with about 110,000 fresh Army soldiers and Marines. In addition, the 11,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan will be brought home and replaced with about the same number. \n\n look at the numbers. there are over 10 times more troops in Iraq than in Afghanistan. where are we focusing? Are we really trying that hard to hunt down bin Laden?\n \n Also, the combat strikes in Afghanistan were from october 7 to 31, 2001 (24 days), whereas we were striking Bagdhad from March 19 to May 1, 2003 (43 days)\n \n I think its pretty clear who the real target is. so once again, why are we really after Saddam more than after bin Laden, when it was the attack from bin Laden that prompted this war in the first place?",
