Seriously I would be extremely upset too if someone dropped a house on my sister, killing her, then stealing her shoes. \n Come to think of it. I do have one villian , whom I can identify with, Magneto from X-men. He wants equality and justice for mutants in a world full of prejudice, fear, and hatred towards mutants.

If so I'd have to identify mostly with is a certain white mage from L. E. Modesitt, Jr.'s The Magic of Recluse. (Its a book!) He's evil in how he justifies everything he does for a greater good because his sect is now gone and at the same time gathers power around himself. Can't really remember his name...I think it was Antonidas or something. emoticon_confused Any how his ultimate goal is gaining as much knowledge through any means neccesary and brings truth to the quote, \"Knowledge is power\" However, his downfall also kinda says that too much knowledge gained at the cost of others can destroy you. Pick up the book its a pretty good read. :) \n \n All the other villains I like for other various reasons, I've never found the good guys that great in everything I've watched, read, or played.
