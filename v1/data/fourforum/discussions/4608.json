Therefore? \n \n \nZooarchaeologists seemingly rescued the early Israelites from obscurity. The apparent abstinence from pork in fulfillment of the biblical injunction (Lev 11:7-8; Deut 14:8) was embraced as the elusive marker of Israelite ethnicity.28 Brian Hesse and Paula Wapnish tabulated percentages of pig bones among faunal collections from Israel, Syria, Iraq, eastern Anatolia, and Egypt, spanning the ninth to the first millennium.29Relevant to this discussion are their findings from second- and first-millennium Cisjordan. Their efforts are hamstrung by the small number of faunal assemblages analyzed, samples of widely varying size (from 47 to 3,950 bones), and the variability of intrasite distribution depending on context. Isolating the results of southern Levantine sites, five Middle Bronze Age sites demonstrated \"intense exploitation\" of pig, from 8 to 34 percent of identified animal bones in domestic debris. Late Bronze Age sites yielded \"scant\" Late Bronze Age evidence, with the sole highland site of Shiloh yielding a mere 0.17 percent (one bone). Pig was rare but present in Iron I highland sites: 0.7 percent at Shiloh, one bone each at Ai and Khirbet Raddana, and \"some\" from the City of David (none from the Ophel). By contrast, the pig samples of 18 and 19 percent respectively from Iron I Tel Miqne and Ashkelon constitute incontrovertible evidence of Iron I Philistine pork consumption. At all Philistine sites analyzed, Ashkelon, Tel Miqne, and Tell Batash, pig exploitation decreased through the centuries, beginning in the eleventh century B.C.E. Overall, Hesse and Wapnish's results demonstrate reliance on pig in the Middle Bronze Age, with greatly diminished use from the Late Bronze Age through the Persian period except for Iron I Philistia, with a return to pork as a dietary mainstay in the Hellenistic and later periods.30Based on these findings, those who seek to identify Israelites on the basis of abstinence from pork are hampered by the single Late Bronze Age highland site with a \"trace\" of pig, which precludes distinguishing the Iron I highland \"Israelites\" from their predecessors. \n \n - see Journal of Biblical Literature: ISRAELITE ETHNICITY IN IRON I\nI found the following interesting Q&A between the DanDiego Jewish Journal and Dever ...\n \n \nIs there any evidence that these early Israelites followed a primitive form of kosher dietary laws?\n There is some. It's very striking that in the earliest settlements we have around 1200, there is statistically speaking no presence of pig bones. Almost zero percentage. Whereas in Canaanite or Philistine sites of the period, pork was widely consumed it seems. So the prohibition against pork seems to be a very early Israelite ethnic trait.... We don't understand the reason for it exactly... but it was probably a simple marker: the Canaanites do this, so we don't do it.\n \n -see [url=http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/cover_jan04.html]Where did we come from?\nSimilarly ...\n \n \nProfessor Dever finds the earliest convergence between the Old Testament and the archaeological record in the 13th century B.C. At about that time, the population of the central hill country west of the Jordan River and south of the Sea of Galilee began to expand rapidly, rising an estimated five-fold in the course of a century. The settlements that provide evidence of this \"population explosion\" differ markedly from nearby Canaanite centers, with distinctive house styles and new technologies, such as intensive terracing and stone-lined grain silos. The most startling difference, though, is that pig bones, common in other areas, are almost completely absent. There is no zoological reason why the settlers should not have kept swine, and Professor Dever takes this apparent aversion as a marker of a \"proto-Israelite\" ethnic group. He adduces other parallels, too, between this archaeological assemblage and the society depicted in Judges and Samuel, as well as a small bit of confirmatory data from a non-Biblical text: A famous stele erected by the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah in about 1210 B.C. describes a campaign against Canaan, mentioning a people called \"Israel\" among those defeated. The stele contains enough geographical information to make it likely that this \"Israel\" was located in the same area as the new hill country assemblage.\n - see  Stromata\nThat pig was widely consumed throughout the area argues against any economic/ecological unsustainability argument.\n \n \nAnd, though I don't pretend to any authority here, I doubt the pig taboo was restricted to 'nascent Israel', or that it appeared de novo in the post-pastoral era.\nThose are not the same: while few cultural markers appear entirely de novo, the archaeology suggests that the restriction was, in fact, diagnostic.\n \n If I had to hazard a guess (and that's all it would be), I would guess that the prohibition had far more to do with seeing the pig as a scavenger.",
