   "I agree, this should not be a civil rights issue. I think this should be a non-issue.\n \n I am going to post my views on this, then you religous types can pick me apart as a \"*** lover\" and the homosexuals can call me a \"homophobe\".\n \n First, I am going to start out with a little background. I recently found out that a guy who works for me, a guy who has been a close friend for 3 years now, a guy who I have spent untold hours with, gone out with on friday nights to the local bars with, is gay.\n \n We went out on Saturday to a local bar. It was me, him, and the guy he lives with who is apparently his boyfriend. We were in a college town, and there was a lebian couple (maybe bi, I don't really know) behaving inapropriatly in the next booth. They were making out and groping each other. I feel that is inapropriate behavior no matter what your sexual orientation. If you want to make out and grope, you should go home and do it, you should not do it in public. I do not make out with my wife and grope her in public.\n \n As anybody who has read some of my posts here can probably tell, I have a great deal of trouble not speaking my mind. I leaned across the booth, told them that I found their behavior inappropriate. I told them that civilized people do not act like sex crazed animals in public.\n \n They told me I was a homophobe, prejudiced against lesbians, and needed to learn to deal with people with \"alternative lifestyles\". This girl was up in my face screaming at me. My buddy Mark grabbed her, pulled her back, and said (pointing at his boyfriend) \"We are gay. He doesn't care. You are acting like XXXXXX.\"\n \n You could have knocked me over with a feather. I had no idea. So, of course, I told Mark that he was going to burn in hell, beat the hell out of him and his buddy, then immediatly went out to burn a cross in their yard.\n \n \n Kidding. I really couldn't care less. I was more than a little suprised, though. I guess, in retrospect, I could have maybe figured it out on my own. They live in a 2 bedroom house, and one bedroom is used as an office (I never really thought about where the other guy slept). I have never known either of them to date, and they do spend a lot of time together. Mark says my \"gaydar\" is defective. Apparently, there are some other gay guys that work for me. I had no idea. \n \n Now, I am going to say that I have a great deal of trouble understanding the gay viewpoint on some things. I know what turns me on, and it isn't a hairy a$$. Women are all soft, and pretty, and they smell good even when they sweat. Soft and pretty aren't words I would use to describe men, and I have yet to find one that smells good when they sweat. To me it is like setting a ming vase next to a plastic cup. I think that if I was a woman, I would most likely be a lesbian, because I would look at men and go \"yea....right\". I just can't understand why a man (or anybody for that matter) would look at a man and go \"ohlala\". I guess it is lucky for us men that they do, though.\n \n Besides that one philisophical difference, I really couldn't care less whether somebody is gay, lesbian, straight, whatever. I don't want to hear any sex stories, though. Not from the gay guys, not from the lesbians, not from the straight folks. If Mark ever starts a story with \"last night we were in bed and he did this thing\" that will be the end of the conversation. Same goes with my straight friends. Some things are not discussed. It is called \"decency\".\n \n Now, I have a few problems with the way that some gay people handle certain things. One of them is the whole \"coming out of the closet\" thing. I can understand wanting to tell your friends, family, whatever, that you are gay. I can see how that would be liberating. I once walked into a business meeting and honest to god a guy shook my hand and said \"hi, I'm joe schmoo. I'm gay\". Why, in the name f god, would you start a conversation like that? I don't run around going \"Hi, I'm mike smish, and I'm straight\". It was like being at an AA meeting. Is that a required part of coming out of the closet? I don't particularly care what his sexual orientation is, why would he feel compelled to share it with me immediatly on introduction? That seriously affected my buisness dealing with the guy. Not so much because I care that he is gay, but I think he is kind of a strange duck.\n \n The second thing I want to touch on is gay marriages. This has been a hot topic in the news lately. I want to go on record as saying that this is the stupidest, most un-American debate I have ever heard. Who cares if bill wants to marry ted? That is bills right. I think that, as Americans, we do not have the right to limit the personal freedoms of others unless it somehow would be detrimental to the public at large. If bill wants to marry ted, it is the duty of every American to facilitate that. If Bill wants to marry a milk cow, the judge should bop right on down there and perform the ceremony. If Bill wants to marry his 10 yr old daughter, Bill should be thrown in prison and subjected to some serious therapy.\n \n I think the issue of gay marriages is not one of morality, but one of freedom and that it is every Americans patriotic duty to ensure that gays are able to live as they wish, just like everybody else. It is easy to fight for the freedom of those who only wish to do the same things as you, it is much more difficult to fight for the freedom of those who wish to do things that you find offensive.\n \n I don't think that any church should be FORCED to marry gays, but churches tht are willing should be able to. Judges should be required to perform the ceremony just as they would for a straight couple.\n \n For you religous folks out there, you can console yourself by saying \"they are not really married in the eyes of god because my church didn't perform the ceremony, and my religon is right and they are going to burn in hell for all eternity\". That's fine, I don't think that even the gay folks will mind you thinking that.\n \n In fact, if you really think about it, if beig gay is a sin, and having sexual relationships with somebody you are not married to is a sin, and a marriage not performed in your particualr church/religon/whatever is not real in the eyes of god, by allowing these folks to be get married, it would encourage them to live in sin (since the marriage is not real in the eyes of god), therefore having frequent sexual relations with somebody to whom they are not married. Almost certainly a one way ticket to hell.\n \n It is your religous DUTY to ensure that gays have the right to marry. Not only will you be ensuring their freedom as Americans, you will also be certain they burn in hell.\n \n The gays are happy, you are happy, god is happy, everybody is happy. \n \n \n I'm with you on this one, treat. I think that a lot of these gay bashers have got to be some really bored, lonely, horny people to care THAT much about somebody elses sex life.\n \n \n Final note. I used the word \"gay\" a lot where I probably should have used \"homosexual\". This is becaue \"gay\" is a 3 letter word. \"homosexual\" has 10 letters. It is 5:30 in the morning and I am tired, and don't feel like typing a 10 letter word when a 3 letter word will suffice (and I have heard that just the word \"homo\" is offensive).",

   "I agree, this should not be a civil rights issue. I think this should be a non-issue.\n\n \n Your sense of humor was not lost on me, dae. You show yourself to be a reasonably open-minded person. \n \n I'm not gay by any strch of the imagination, but like all minorities that are persecuted, when that minority is not a hate group, I feel that they do deserve a clause in the Constitution for protection regardless of sexual preference, so they don't get jailed like those two guy sin Texas?? did when they were in a hotel room.\n \n I only responded to on post in this section that are of the common variety.\n The truth is that there are very many posts on this board I don't respond to because I intensly dislike stupidity. and would not be able to refrain from using curse words all over the place when I would post. Basically, I'd go nuts on them and my criticism would be so personal, sharp, and hateful that it wouldn't serve any purpose but to aggravate me and waste my time.\n \n You related some \"personal\" stuff, and I'll offer some thoughts on what I can recall.\n \n You mentioned trying to understand \"why the attraction to men\". I'm not gay, so I can't and wouldn't describe it, even if I could.\n \n Think of it like this. Some people dislike the taste of certain foods.\n You can describe a taste as bitter, and it carries some meaning, however, to your point of view, you sense to taste as tart, or perhas enjoy the bitter flavor. \n \n You can't possibly explain your feeling to make a rational for why you like a taste. All you can say is you like the taset and the othe person doesn't.\n \n My point is this.....\n \n Don't try to imagine yourself in bed with a man and try to figure out what would attract you to a hairy @sshole. It simply is not in your natue to find it attractive.\n \n What I'm trying to relate to you is that there is no possible way that you nor I can feel what that other person feels, nor would we want to. (Yet, we accept it as that person's feeling, without questioning if the feeling is sin or is not a sin (I'm an Atheist, so there is no such thing as a sin to me. My words would be: we accept it as that person's feeling, without question, and without passing judgement if the person sis a good or a bad person because of that feeling.))\n \n So, my advice is not to attempt the analysis you were trying. It just doesn't fit the situation. Use the: to each their own, even though I don't have a clue why you want your's approach.\n \n The guy in the office who said he is gay on introduction. I suspect that everyone in the office that you were in knows he's gay, and he doesn't that he is because he may talk on the phone with his boyfriend or whatever. \n Adn that what he had in mind was to see your jaw drop when he said something that is common knowledge to everyone else that was there.\n I'm sure you can picture his amusement and possibly other people to, depending upon your reaction. \n \n So, I REALLY don't think that was a case of a gay person needing to get out of the closet. I think it was a prank, but using actual facts, to watch your jaw drop, because of the place and time in which it happened.\n \n I'm reasonably sure that the guy just has an offbeat sense of humor, that you might not find funny or might not understand or both.\n \n The leaning over the counter incident was an invitation for a fight.\n Presumably they were college age or younger, and quite exhibisionistic.\n \n Instead of trying to instruct ppl on what you feel is bad behavior, the best thing is to ignore it, as they were not doing anything to harm you.\n \n So, I do understand why the girl(s) went ballistic.\n \n Frankly, I would have gone ballistic too, as I don't appreciate any person telling me how to behave if I am not hurting them and doing something very terrible. (I don't do stuff that would warrent such comments, but it's a control and morality, propriety, parental issue that is gonna push every button in the book and make someone go nuts on you.) \n \n Gay people as people are no less appropriate than us, so your friend will understand without your telling him what not to talk about. One thing to know\n about gasy is that they've spent a lot of their life covering up things and being careful and putting things into boxes. Gays won't go ballistic because of built up tension and just blurt out stuff to you. They are accutely aware of\n what other people think of them and how they behave, even when they behave in wierd off-beat ways. \n \n So, don't even concern yoursefl for one moment that your friend understands\n what you would find repulsive.\n \n The REALLY COOL THING is that this is a close friend or a friend that you handg out with all the time and even though he;s gay, he didn't do anything innappropriate towards you at all. So you can see first hand that there should be no reason to discriminate against these people OR to fear them as being bad parents, and people not to trust.\n \n THAT is very neat. Because I can see you are in almost all ways a very traditional conservative person in social situations, and it is exactly those types of people that are impossible nuts to crack. So that very good, and I;m \n glad to know that you are very liberal-minded on this issue and see things from a RATIONAL repspective, and not one of mistrust, and fear, and sin.\n \n I've had an uncle that's gay. He went on vacations with my family, and there were 2 times that due to the number of rooms available when on vaction that I as a teenager sleft in his room. Many years later he \"came out\", and to this day, my folks, have asked me a number of times if he EVER did anything to me! LOL!) I say \"never\", and then they forget it and ask again. Old predjudices die hard.\n \n I've been awake for over 50 hours so don't mind my spelling.\n \n Ohhh! I remembered something I wanted to tell you. My wife and I go to Provincetown, Mass., it's a known Gay Community. There is a HUGE gay culture there especially of younger college and post-college ages perhaps from 20 to 40 years old. Lesbians and Gays have made it into a REALLY wonderful place that my wife and I go back to when we can, and we spend lots of time in town. The people watching comes out night and once in a whiile a drag queen that is performing at some club comes stumbling out of his house with his \"girl\" friend, both hanging onto each other for dear life, because of the 6 inch stelleto high heel shoes that they repeatedly keep falling out of. There are gay clubs in town that offer gay comedians and there was a place that did a performance with imitations of famous women.\n The place has THE MOST EXCELLENT restaurants you will ever find, and a wide choice of them. During the day the town is a 1 block walking town with all kinds of arts stores. There is a large community of Artists there.\n The \"atmosphere\" the \"sense\" that you get from even just waiters and waitresses, and people in the town is a TOTALLY different experince than a \"normal\" town, and it is truely rejuvenating to be in that area.\n \n Anyway, I mention all of the above, only to say that I've met many gays\n there and had very breif off handed conversations. The town that they've created \"for themselves\" is better than any hetero town around, and it's not because ppl want to sell you stuff. Ppl simply are nice to each other there.\n And you will see ppl arm in arm, and sometimes kissing (which for men I will never get used to), ... but, it really doesn't bug me. It's all part of that place and accepting pppl for what they are. And that is really the underlying feeling\n you get there.\n \n Not surprisingly, families are only occasionally seen in the town at night, but are there in ddroves during the day.\n \n Anyway, here;s the story... don't worry about your friend doing/sauing anything that will nauseate you. It won't happen. Try to lighten up a bit, as some people are just exhibitionists, and they really are not hurting you. \n And the guy at work... consider that it was not a political or coming out move, it was a prank that you weren't in on that probably just popped into his head, and he may just be an impulisve type, with anoffbeat sense of humor that you might or might not \"get\".\n \n Last thought, you can be quite certain that your friend and his boyfriend had previously had a discussion about whether or not to tell you anything, and that the decsion was made perhaps daysm weeks or months ago, and this situation with the girls presented an ideal opportunity for them to say \"Hey!\n He's our friend and we stand up for him, as a good guy.\"\n \n (Neverthe less, I think you could consider lightening up a bit, and not let that stuff \"get\" to you.\n \n Anyway, your story was a very good read, and I'm glad that you posted it. \n I surpassed my expectations of anyone else being normal with respect to recognizing that gays are not sick sinners that are out to destroy \"the family\".\n \n So, thanks again.\n \n Depending upon your openess, you might want to share that story with some\n other people here in its own thread, to have a better chance of being seen.\n \n I just remembered... \"You asked why is it so important for gays to tell their family they are gay.\"\n \n My wife's brother is gay. Niether of his parents were ever told.\n \n It used to be a taboo subject. Thankfully, attitudes are changing.\n \n You only have to picture your self in the situation. You wont to bring your wife, but she's a he! And that won't do, unless you are both very carefull to hide your emotions, and touching each other.\n \n Most ppl find that kind of relationship with their immediate family very stressful. They would feel like they are always lying, and feel guilty about it, and extremely frustrated, as well. They would reason that men and women don't have to hide it, and these days, why should they, too.\n \n They know it will cause upset, but they believe that over time, their parents will accept it, and from what I've seen in documentaries about that subject (and I;'ve whatched a few), the parents do accept it over time, even though they do not understand it. And they become a family again without the concealment that was necessary.\n \n So, now you've had a chance to see why I was a Psych Major, with my interest in the behavior of people, their motivations, and thinking.\n \n Again, neat story thanks for sharing it with me!",

   "First off, don't worry about your typing/spelling. I usually type my forum replies with one hand while working on somthing else with the other, so mine are usually full of typos.\n \n I spoke w/ my wife today about mike being gay. She laughed at me, said I was the only person tht didn't know that and thet they (her and mike) had joked about it alot. Th signs were all there, I guess.\n \n I know I am kind of a stick in the mud when it comes to certain things like public display of affection. I was raised VERY conservative, and I think it sometimes takesa lifetime to break free of your upbringing. I do give it my best shot, though.\n \n It just never occurs to me to wonder about things like that (whether somebody is gay or not). I always kind of figured that it is not really any of my business, unless they feel I need to know for some reason. I didn't know there even was an issue of gay marriage until it started hitting the news more lately. I had always assumed that this is America, people are free to do what they want. When I saw the first news reeport about the whole insurance issue and all that, I called the guy who handles my companies insurance plan to make sure that we had provisions in there for gay couples. He said \"Yes, when we originally negotiated the policy your wife made certain that it was there\". She knew that Mike was gay, and would be working for me. I am glad that she was looking out for him, I never would have thought of it.\n \n I find some peoples views when iut comews to the whole gay rights issue a little odd. It seems like a lot of the folks who are anti-gay are a lot like me, conservative, stick in the mud white guys who would feel uncomfortable seeing an intimate public display of affection. Unlike me, who really doesn't care to hear about, or know about, somebody elses sex life, regardless of orientation, these folks seem to want to jump right into the middle of everybodies business.\n \n As far as the whole religous thing, I am a devout catholic. I was an altar boy growing up, I serve on my churches finance comitee, rarely miss a sunday at church. I don't see how people come to the conclusion that god hates gays. From a philisophical standpoint, god made all people, including the gay ones. Are they implying that god made a mistake? \n \n I might start a new thread and c&p my story into it. I think that the argument against homosexauls being teachers or parents is rediculous. I am a man, I do not molest little girls. I have a little girl, and she is the prettiest little girl in the whole world (of course) I have never had any trouble keeping my hands off of her. Mark is a man, is driven by the same instincts and sexual desires as me. If I have no desire to molest little girls, why would he have any desire to molest little boys? You said you were a psych major, maye you can shed some light on this for me.\n \n I had always assumed that, besides their orientation, homosexuals have a normal sex drive, just like anybody else. Is this incorrect? I tried researching it (just now) and putting \"homosexual sex drive\" into google certainly gets you some interesting results, but not much by way of expert opinion or scientific study that I saw at a glance.",

I'm sure there are some numbers on it, but I've no great interest in finding them. The question you ask is logically put and has the logical answer you expect. The whole molesting thing has to do with the molester getting off on having power over whom the molester is molesting, than a sexual orientation.\n \n I doubt anyone has ever attempted to compare the sex drive of gay people with straight people. I do know that the number of partners has been compared. In any case, I don't see why there would be any relationship between sex drive and homosexuality, any more than there would for a heterosexual.",
