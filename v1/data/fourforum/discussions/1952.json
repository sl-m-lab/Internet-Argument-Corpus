It seems to me that the law of natural selection would weed out any \"gay gene\" that existed; homosexuals aren't known for reproducing very well. The very fact of being homosexual would prevent one from passing on his/her genes.\n \n Am I missing something here? Has the existence of the \"gay gene\" been proven or disproven while I wasn't looking?\n \n Otherwise, could someone verify or disprove my stunning revelation please?",

I hold that society and our surroundings are responsible for orientation.\n\n \n I don't agree, although what you said is more realistic than saying it is a choice. The proper mental training thing depends on your definition of homosexuality. Some people define homosexuality as one who sleeps with others of the same gender, others define it as the desire to sleep with one of the same gender. No matter how much training you have, you cannot completely erase your desire to sleep with one of the same gender, however you can force yourself to sleep with the opposite sex. \n \n I do not think society and our surroundings are responsible for orientation because every society has homosexuals, and even animals who don't really have societies have homosexuals. Also there are very different environments that homosexuals grow up in, and they still turn out homosexual. For example, my parents are Roman Catholic, and they are conservative, anti drug, and strict. My girlfriend's parents are very liberal, and even know that she's gay and don't mind. They are also not very strict, they've even offered her weed before.",

Some traits are determined by genetics, while others are determined by environment. Drugs are addictive, so if you are offered them at an impressionable age, you may become addicted before you learn to really think for yourself instead of caring what others say. However, when people try to fit in they try to be heterosexual, and it gets to the point that the disgust they feel in this activity becomes to much and they stop doing it.",

However, when people try to fit in they try to be heterosexual, and it gets to the point that the disgust they feel in this activity becomes to much and they stop doing it.\n\n \n ok ok.. back up a few steps here. How do you know it has no effect on sexuality? the people I know who are homosexual were raised in a 'liberal home'. Their parents did not believe in homosexuality, but taught the children that things like that were accepted by society.... so.....take from that what you will. You don't have to be raised by homosexuals to be homosexual, but you have to be exposed to the 'correct' belief system. many homosexuals offer that belief system, which, I believe, is why it appears to remain 'in the family' or genetic. Now there are some that could be rasied by a stricter set of parents, but could be exposed to a different set of values either in the peer group, media, or some other source.\n \n Example: My sister and I are 2 years apart, and we had the same feelings towards homosexuality up until a year ago - we both thought it was simply not acceptable. At that time she fell into a different group of friends. Her beliefs changed completely. \n My point is, belief/value systems change depending on your surroundings. And since most behaviors (other than what we know as 'illnesses' - though I doubt many homosexuals would want to be classified there) are based on your belief systems.... I don't believe that there's a gene that determines whether you're homosexual or not.",
