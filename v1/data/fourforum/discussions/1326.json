   "Faith - Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence\n \n In a recent conversation I debate with someone I know I asked the following:\n Me: \"What \"God\" do you beleive in?\"\n Response: The God of Abraham, Moses, and Noah\n Me: How do you know that the bible is true?\n Response: I have faith.\n \n Its not an uncommon response I get in many theist vs. atheist debates. \"Faith\". What is it really?\n Faith considerd by many is one of the most powerful \"forces\" next to love. Constantly we hear the term \"faith\" being used as if its somehow logical and powerful.\n \n When the response is given \"I have faith\" there is no argument you can give to show how illogical or silly it is.\n Any reaction given such as anger, frustration, or not understanding is taken by those who have faith as a victory. \n \n In the debate I had with someone I know I expressed my frontation of lack of an answer to him.\n \n Me: \"Your willing to throw away any logical evidence and just go on the meaning of life by \"faith\"?\n Response: Yes\n \n Here I felt as if the someone loved to give that answer. Why is that?\n \n \n \n Anyways onto my debate question.\n \n Why do people need faith? In what instance will logic not suffice and in what instance is faith not silly?\n Why do people consider faith to be so \"powerful\" and a sufficent answer? Why does such an \"escape response\" leave the user satisfied?\n \n [ When I say logic it means the logical procedures to reach a conclusion. The procedures can include: past expereinces, science, etc... ]",

   " The same could be said about the Quran by Muslims, but thats not what I'm here to debate.\n\n \n Not really.

My point is the bible went through a lot of XXXX :-p\n \n \n You can't say everything because everything (such as the parting of the Red Sea) is not provable or atleast has not been proved.\n\n \n Actually even the parting of the Red Sea is very possible. Firstly, it wasn't the Red Sea, but the Reed Sea. The Red Sea was a mistranslation in Hebrew (or rather, it could be). If this is the case, then the Island of Thera's volcanic eruption caused an earthquake that sent a sort of tidal wave to Egypt (and Greece, Anatolia, Cyprus, et cetera). The water would go back, and dry land would appear. The Hebrews would gross this sea. And then in about an hour, the water would come back with a huge force. It's very logical. \n \n \n That most certainly does not account for the world flooding nor does it account for the \"ark\" or that Noah was somehow able to get 2 of every kind of mammal on it.\n\n \n There are many theories of what was meant by \"world\". God could have been speaking of the world Noah lived in, or the surround worlds. You must understand Old Hebrew is a very primitive language, and so the use of words were very easily misinterpreted. \n \n \n I'm not aware of any scientific proof that accounts for the varification of the angel of death sweeping down upon Egyptians homes and killing the first born son.\n Nor am I aware of evidence that the Nile was turned to blood as well as other \"plauges\" God put upon Egypt. \n\n \n Oh come on, you can think of dozens of things that were possible. Maybe a Hebrew killed them. Or more possibly, it was an angel. And yes, the water turned red from the Anthrax that the volcano erupted. \n \n \n The \"evidence\" that imense sound waves (which are probably not produced by trumpets) can break down brick walls does not prove that the Battle of Jericho actually occured.\n\n \n There was a study done (I saw this on Discovery channel), where and immense sound was made, and it was quite possible for a group of people to make this sound. Remember, it wasn't just two trumpets that did it, all of the Hebrews yelled as well. \n \n \n Such as?\n\n \n Oh Creation in six days (Old Hebrew, there is no word for \"Days\", and \"Days\" meant three things- a 24-hour period, a 12-hour period, or simply a period of time), Sodom and Gomorra (possible volcanic eruption, meteor, there are other theories), just to name a few.\n \n \n So the possibility of the Hebrews keeping an historical record that could have obviously been manipulated proves the existance of God?\n\n \n No, we've already come to the conclusion that God exists; the question is whether or not the bible is the word of God.\n \n \n Why would you put faith that the bible is the word of God? Either use logic to concur that the Hebrews would not lie about such a thing or just go ahead and guess whether or not its God's word.\n\n \n The fact that Moses wrote the first books of the Old Testament and was accurate means that he couldn't have lied. People couldn't have just assumed that Space was first created; or that animals were created before man; but lo and behold, 4000 years Later Darwin comes along and proves that humans evolved from animals. Moses couldn't have just arbitrarily lied that there was a flood; but lo and behold, in the 1970's discoveries were made in Turkey about a great flood. Obviously, this couldn't have just been a great big lie. \n \n \n I really don't mean to have a debate about the bible's reliability, I'm just speaking of faith in general, which as I see it, only comes in the \"blind-faith\" form.\n\n \n You've got to understand that there's a different between faith and blind faith. Blind Faith is just arbitrarily believing in something with no reason to. Faith is to believe something above reason. \n \n \n Q: How do you know Jesus even lived and died for your sins?\n \n\n \n Through Roman records, early historians, biblical records, early Christian records, et cetera. \n \n Q: How do you know God has a purpose for you\n\n \n Bible. \n \n \n Why do you continue to beleive in God despite the fact that you have offered no evidence for his existance.\n\n \n There is much evidence! Besides miracles that scientists are unable to explain, it is only logical that in our human universe some creator did exist. We've gone through this already:\n \n The Universe was Created \n \n A) Our universe has time.\n B) Time ALWAYS has a beginning and an end, by it's very definition (our universe simply could not have popped up out of nothingness) \n C) Our universe therefore had to be created. \n \n  The Creator of the Universe Still Exists\n A) The Creator is in a dimension without time\n B) Therefore, this time, the Creator has no beginning or end\n C) Therefore, the Creator is omnipresent.",

The Island of Thera erupted during the same time as Moses, and all the plagues of Egypt were signs of what would happen if Thera erupted. Even the flies, frogs, and locusts were signs of the volcanic eruption, with migration. All the things going on were normal for what was to happen in the eruption.\n \n \n So the flooding of one area proves the story of Noah?\n\n \n Yes, because Noah was from Anatolia, which is where this flood happened. Another theory is that there was a sort of massive \"El Nino\" back then, because so many cultures mentioned floods happening.\n \n \n Thera is an island of Greece and not anywhere close to Egypt.\n\n \n Yes, it is an Island in Greece, and yes it is relatively close to Egypt. However, that's irrelevant. There was an earth quake in a pacific ocean Island that sent a tidal wave to Alaska that killed hundreds. There was an earthquake in Chile that sent a tsunami to Hawaii. Things like this happen. It is VERY probable that the story was from a volcanic eruption in Greece. \n \n \n Once again you missed my point. I have said that perhaps it is possible that immense sound waves can break down brick walls. But the possibility does not mean it happened.\n\n \n Hence, you cannot automatically say the bible is lying because the events seemed so impossible. For the story of Jericho, during the time the Hebrews came, the walls were knocked down. Hmm... I wonder who did it? \n \n What's interesting is that we take many other writings as fact when there are only one or two pieces of writing. It's become a historical fact that Mohammad existed, even though there is little evidence of his existence. It has become historical fact that Attila the Hun and Pope Leo had a conversation, but it's taken as scientific fact. It's become fact that Phoenicians went around Africa, although the only evidence we have is from their own writings. Why is the bible, one of the oldest pieces of writing, suddenly incredible? \n \n \n I did not ask for an excuse pertaining to the possibility of the Bible's version of creation. I instead asked for evidence of \"other biblical historical mentions\".\n\n \n Sodom and Gomorrah Evidence\n \n Tower of Babel\n Moses Evidence\n \n Noah's Flood\n \n I could give you more if you can name some other biblical stories. \n \n \n Perhaps you have reached that conclusion.\n\n \n I am assuming your argument is 'If God exists, how do we know the bible is the word of God?'. If you're saying otherwise this debate can easily be shifted.\n \n \n Its very possible that the Bible is a somewhat accruate historical account, that has been changed and manipulated over time by various people.\n\n \n Probably not. After Moses, the bible was written in several different texts. The Peshitta bible, for instance, was copied before Assyrian Captivity. There were other bibles that were written from original manuscripts and stayed the same.\n \n \n I'm not speaking about your faith. I'm speaking about faith in general terms and religiously it usually comes in the blind form.\n\n \n Not with me. I don't see the need for blind faith. There's plenty of evidence that the bible is the word of God, let alone the existence of God. \n \n \n We disagree about this, but thats not what I'm here for. I am not here to debate the existance of God or the Bible's reliability.\n\n \n And you also said:\n \n \n In a recent conversation I debate with someone I know I asked the following:\n Me: \"What \"God\" do you beleive in?\"\n Response: The God of Abraham, Moses, and Noah\n Me: How do you know that the bible is true?\n Response: I have faith.\n\n \n But I said: \n \n No, we've already come to the conclusion that God exists; the question is whether or not the bible is the word of God.\n\n \n And you said:\n \n \n Perhaps you have reached that conclusion.\n\n \n What are you trying to debate?!

My position is the following: A) The bible's credibility is based on logical evidence, B) God's existence is based on logical evidence, and C) Even without logical evidence, it is not blind faith, but faith. Blind faith is faith without reason or logic, but faith is ABOVE reason or logic. \n \n \n What are you speaking of? The bible itself, or the books which the bible is based on? The bible itself is only 1600 to 1700 years old. There were many revisions to the bible as I had meantion elsewhere. Many different books have been added and removed over the early years of the bbile as well. If any of it is consistent it is only because it has been put together that way and anything which disagreed was removed. It was far easier to control content back then than it would be now since there were really very few actual books around as it was.\n\n \n The \"Torah\", I should say. There are many different kinds of Torahs. The Peshitta Torah, the Hebrew Torah, et cetera. \n \n \n Why do people need faith? In what instance will logic not suffice and in what instance is faith not silly?\n Why do people consider faith to be so \"powerful\" and a sufficent answer? Why does such an \"escape response\" leave the user satisfied?\n\n \n Faith is nessecary to believe in certain Christian beliefs, because there are simply man things that are beyond human thought. It must be understood that since God is in a different dimension, most of his dimension is unexplainable. Ergo, we rely on faith.

Is there logical evidence that a spiritual entity could possibly descend from the Heavens and take the lifes of every first born son with no resitance from any parents, no resistence from any of Pharoe's guards...\n\n \n I'm not arguing that God exists because of the bible. I'm saying the bible is truly the word of God because it is infallible. God's existence is a completely different argument, although I quickly mentioned some points during this debate. Once again, Old Hebrew is a very old and primitive language, so saying \"The water turned into blood\" could or could not have been literal. It could have meant \"The water turned into the color of blood\" or \"the water turned into what looked like blood\" or \"the water turned into what we thought was blood\", et cetera. Aramaic, which is the language of the Assyrians and closely related to Hebrew, is different. In Aramaic most of everything is clear and very literal. If I said \"The water is blood\", I meant that literally. If I said \"My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink\", I mean that literally. If I said \"Hail Mary, full of Grace\" I meant that literally. However, the bible was written in Old Hebrew, so the Aramaic doesn't help here. The mere fact that the Hebrews were such accurate historians is evidence enough that it is truly God's word. When Moses wrote the bible, the only other possibility is that he made up the stories of Noah's Ark and the tower of Babel out of his head. But he didn't. God inspired him to tell the stories as they were- and the stories ended up being very accurate. That is a miracle, not coincidence. \n \n \n Anyway, logic tells us that it is much more probable for the insecurity of human minds to need hope, need a god and that the power fiending corrupt leaders needed somebody to take advantage of than all these distant obscure connections that imply fantasitic coincedinces.\n\n \n Man naturally needs God because God made us that way; to always yearn to know him. \n \n \n Stop trying to look for logic in your God. If there was sufficient evidence, there would be no question and the world would bow down before him and worship him day and night. Again, faith, your religion relies upon faith which is why it cannot be proved wrong, too many Christians are close minded and would not accept the truth even if it were served to them on a golden platter. However, I try to be as open minded and logical as possible and I do not rely on blind anything.\n\n \n If there was sufficient evidence that he didn't exist, wouldn't we all be atheists? Obviously, that isn't so. Yes, there is very logical evidence that God exists. I admit that many Christians are closed minded, but many Atheists are as well. I have several atheist friends who simply don't want to listen to me when I mention Christianity. One time I asked this friend if he believed in God, and he said he had no reason to, and I told him there is reason, but before I could speak he said \"Christians don't know crap\" and walked away singing Blink 182's popular song at the time, What's My Age Again?. My friend also did this when I mentioned any other sort of political debate, such as abortion and homosexual rights. In my experience, atheists are much more closed minded than Christians within the city. The thing is that our universe is based on time; time's own definition means to have a beginning and an end. Our existence obviously couldn't have just sprouted up out of nothing. Ergo, we need some sort of creator that is OUT of time. Let's call this creator Shigure. Shigure is out of time; his dimension is completely different from our own, so different that it's beyond human capacity to imagine it. Shigure created this universe. Now, how do we know he still exists? Because he is out of time, he is omnipresent, which means, he has, is, and always will be existing. He doesn't have a beginning or an end; he doesn't need to exist. Ultimately, the only possibility is that God DOES exist. \n \n \n Your faith is blind. If it helps you lead a better life than go for it.\n\n \n Once again, you must understand the difference between blind faith and faith. Blind faith is believing in God without reason or logic.

   "I would like to second Robbie's endorsement of C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. It can be read in one day by most (Poet, I know you said you had a long list and little time) and it has two chapters on the subject of faith. It is easy to read yet profound in what it states.\n \n I would also like to add The Everlasting Man  by G.K. Chesterton to the recommendation. That is the book that C.S. Lewis read that propelled him out of agnosticism into Christianity. These two books can give curious agnostics a different view of Christianity.\n \n To elaborate on The Everlasting Man, it describes the uniqueness of Christianity. It is more difficult to read than Mere Christianity  but well worth it. I had to read some of it twice to get the full impact of what Chesterton was saying. He wrote it in 1925 so there are some contextual points that we cannot fully appreciate. Chesterton is one of the wittiest apologists of Christianity that ever lived. His intellect was immense and \"his prose is like poetry.\" He was also once an agnostic. All of these traits are appealing.\n \n In dealing with Christianity from an agnostic point of view there are several points that people find most perplexing. They don't know how the Christian can see the logic in some of these things. They don't see why Christians are willing to submit to faith. Chesterton provides an outline of the history of the world in Everlasting Man that answers a lot of those questions. He does the following:\n \n discusses primitive man, evolution, and the origin of religion\n \n distinguishes religion from mythology and philosophy\n \n discusses the importance of monotheism as opposed to polytheism/paganism\n \n specifically gives clues of why Old Testament events were violent by the will of God--(preserving monotheism amidst paganism)\n \n he proclaims the uniqueness of Christ--possibly the first man to claim to actually be God, not just to know God/the gods or speak for them--he destroys the idea that Christ was a megalomaniac but shows us that Christ acted in the most convincing way that he could have if he was being truthful (he discusses Buddhism, Confucianism, the great philosophers, Islam in relation to Christianity)\n \n he asserts that Christianity was the first union of philosophy and religion \n \n he discusses the uniqueness of the Catholic Church\n \n he proposes dogma as a necessity and gives the reasons why \n \n I cannot begin to describe these things with the same wit and insight that he does. The book gives a Christian point of view that does not rest solely on faith. I challenge all agnostics and atheists to read it and consider it. If you cannot get through the beginning then at least read the second section specifically on Christianity. Here are a few quotes from the book (that do not deal specifically with faith as Poet is talking about):\n \n \"In the land lit by that neighboring star, whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things, motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave like a race of demons...It is customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense   that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.\"\n \n \"The more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.\n \n The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of being a stranger here on the earth...He has much more of the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter...Alone among the animals he feels...the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular instinct called religion.\"\n \n \"Suppose that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it as a fearful wild-fowl indeed...That bird would tell the augurs, not of something that would happen, but of something that had happened. That something would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind could conceivable have foreseen it...There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"\n \n the book can be ordered from www.ignatius.com\n \n (Poet, I posted this here as I was not sure you received all 5 of the private messages that I sent--I only got 3 read receipts. Sorry I sent so many but the character limit would not allow me to send just one message.)",

Besides sensation the human mind has also notions, or anticipations (prol\u00e9pseis), as when, seeing an object at a distance, one wonders whether it is a man or a tree. These notions are the results left by previous sensations. The notion does not appear to differ from the internal sense of a brute, such as enables a dog, for example, to welcome strangers belonging to the profession of his master, and to bark furiously at a beggar that he has never seen before. The understanding, then, does not differ essentially from the internal senses.\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05500b.htm",

You believe in A, or that P, if and to the degree that you are ready to act with reliance upon A or as if P were the case. We always \"live up to\" (or \"down to\": really, right at) our beliefs.\n \n UNBELIEF in the context of the present discussion is not simply a lack of belief, in the sense that I now have no beliefs at all about most individual things that exist, for example. Rather \"unbelief\" here will refer to what is more properly called disbelief: a readiness to act as if certain things were not so. Thus unbelief is a species of belief involving negation.\n \n More precisely still, by unbelief in the present context we are referring to belief that a certain set of claims made by traditional Christianity--roughly, what C. S. Lewis referred to as \"Mere Christianity,\" are false. We are thinking of the person who is set to act as if they were false, and this personality set is what we mean here is speaking of the faith of unbelief.\n \n Please see the source below for a complete discussion of the topic.\n \n Source: http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=27\n \n On the following site, one can find an article entitled Jesus the Logician. It is fascinating.\n \n http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=39",

He simply states that because I believe and have faith in God that I will always lean toward blind faith. He uses this to impune any argument I make regardless of the subject. \n \n I, on another thread concerning the 2004 election posted dozens of news paper stories about Sadam's brutality to counter his point that we should not have gone to war with Iraq. He counter with something of the ilk, \"Oc course you would say that you have blind faith.\" He didn't address the postings except at first he said that they were from the bush admin and were biased and then when I pointed out they were from major media outlets then he stated that the media was biased about the war.\n \n This is my point.

   "this is a grey area, but i'd rather not base my beliefs on a 6000 year old father figure. i choose human knowledge, not human hoping. \n\n \n If you're suggesting that my beliefs are based on those formed a long time ago...\n I'll assume that you've not read any of my earlier posts on the Orthodox Church. I've posted on the subject of marriage for instance a list of Orthodox teachers that comes down to our present age. We are a living church. We didn't just stop teaching thousands of years ago.\n \n \nif a god exists, do you really and truly believe it would lie here on this planet? the books written by man and supposedly influenced by god. you know how many religions of the past and present claim this? \n\n \n So? \n \n What about the evidence of evolution? You can have the same piece of evidence and get 3 different conclusions over a period of time...\n Ammonites...\n 1870 Hyatt says that a group of ammonites went aegoceras (oldest)-Androgynoceras-Liparoceras (youngest) \n 1938 L F Spath said they went in the exact opposite way \n 1963 Blockely said that they were all part of the same species and the differences were because of sexual dimorphism.\n \n Do you know how many theories of the ascent of man I was taught when I did pre-history at university?\n Unilinear School \n Polyphyletic School, \n Preneanderthal School** \n Presapiens School*** \n Evidence does not point to a theory... except in the minds of theoreticians... as such it is but an artificial construct. \n *It says descent, Poirier, F E, \"In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\", p346ff \n **Preneanderthal Hypothesis: The theory, mainly applied to Europe, that proposes two separate lineages can be found in the Middle or Late Pleistocene. It posits that Neanderthals diverged from a line leading to modern Europeans just before they became specialized. \n http://www.modernhumanorigins.com/p.html \n ***Presapiens Hypothesis: The theory, mainly applied to Europe, that proposes two separate human lineages can be found in the Middle Pleistocene. One lineage (presapiens) evolved directly into modern H. sapiens populations and closely resembles these modern forms at an early date. The second lineage (preneanderthals) evolved into the European Neanderthal populations of the earlier Wurm glaciation and subsequently became extinct. \n (Ibid) \n \n All these theories are 'kosher' as far as evolutionary theory (when I was taught it) even though some are mutually exclusive - that is, if one works, then none of the others can be true. They are all based on the same evidence. They are co-existing theories.\n \n Your criticism of religion - because there are so many of them fails at this point unless you are willing to accept the same critique of evolutionary theory.\n \n \nwhat else can you do but take people's word? supposedly, you FEEL god's presence; i think it's a chemical imbalance or a blatant lie told by people on this thread to make themselves believe more. only you truly know, \"Christians.\" but you're right, faith is a NEEDED to believe that your religion is true. that your parents were right, that your friends are truthful, that the men that wrote this so long ago weren't full of XXXX, that there is an easy and obvious purpose of our life on earth. do you feel less alone now? good. \n\n \n Ah, the old chemical imbalance argument. Obviously if you don't believe in God - then that's what's driving you! If there's no outside super-natural influence then you are not a free agent. You're a product of society, or DNA astray, or magnetic forces.\n God gives us choice. He gives us Free Will. It is not an argument that I am but a by-product of blind evolution.\n \n Any belief you put forward must be a result of naturalistic causes outside your own capacities. You could argue that your love of your wife is just caused by evolutionary means to procreate. Or that your compulsion to eat a particular food is based on DNA or a predisposition. You've removed your own Free Will - your individuality. \n \n \nbecause of this, faith is good. faith is needed. it gives people hope and a reason to live. this \"presence of god\" also dissuades crime. people believe that there exists an eternal paradise reserved by those who do good, so they tend to try and do good, no matter what they want. \n\n \n This functionalist approach to religion is one I reject. God is real and not dependent upon your beliefs.\n \n \ni applaud you for this. good job! you found meaning in life. too bad you aren't for sure. oh, are you? either that's a lie or you are really confused.\n\n \n I am still searching for meaning.

Easily proven that it is a logical position. The issue of someone believing what I say to be true or not, about God that is, is a personal decision that I will not violate.\n\n \n I don't take dares, that is for children.\n \n Religious, or in your case blind faith is nothing more than tautologic, not true logic. Another name for it is the fallacy of circular reason or logic.\n \n Bill: \"God must exist.\" \n Jill: \"How do you know.\" \n Bill: \"Because the Bible says so.\" \n Jill: \"Why should I believe the Bible?\" \n Bill: \"Because the Bible was written by God.\"\n \n This is basically how you've replied to me on the topic of religious faith. You are still confusing it with normal faith. They aren't the same thing.\n \n \nMy contention is simply that it takes faith to not believe in God as much as it does to believe in God. Char cannot argue the point and instead attacks the person.\n\n \n Like you're doing now, and have from the start?\n \n \nAnd says \"blind faith\" repeatedly without ever arguing. He simply states that because I believe and have faith in God that I will always lean toward blind faith. He uses this to impune any argument I make regardless of the subject. \n\n \n That is all you have ever offered. Of course it \"impunes\" any arguement you make.\n \n \nI, on another thread concerning the 2004 election posted dozens of news paper stories about Sadam's brutality to counter his point that we should not have gone to war with Iraq.\n\n \n I never said that Saddam wasn't a terrible men, but much of what he is accused of occured while he was also a \"friend\" of the USA and used mostly WMD supplied to him by said government. To invade Iraq now is the height of hypocrisy. Saddam had nothing directly to do with 9/11. And you of course absolutely believe suspect information just because it agrees with what you want to believe. \n \n If you're not afraid of the truth as you claim than watch the docuementry \"Uncovered: The Real Reason Why Bush Attacked Iraq.\" I can even get the bit torrent link for you if you can find it.\n \n [Meaningless ranting deleted]",

I drink water... or maybe I'm not... does that make any sense?\n\n \n You know very well there is a difference between being open minded in your political and religious ideas vs. if you really have 10 fingers.\n \n As I have said. Those who are close minded are ignorant. You help nothing to be ignorant. If it is the truth that you want then you must stay open to possibilities.\n \n Maximus,\n \n \nOr it takes one from point A of logic to point B of logic, in which case it may be a necessity.\n\n \n If you want your beleif to be purely logical as conclusions should be if they are to be accurate than logic alone should be used. If you use faith to become opinionated in your ideals then you become ignorant.\n \n \nIs there ever a time in your life when you do not utilize logic, Poet? Have you ever been angry, in love, saddened by something that you should blow off without hesitation, trusted another by \"gut instinct,\" been consumed with laughter? Have you ever sacrificed for someone else out of pure compassion absent of the logic of what the cost/benefit is to you, the other, the world? Have you ever acted spontaneously? \n \n \n Yes of course I have done \"stupid\" things and thus not thought things through logically.\n \n \nLogic is one means (possibly not even an independent means). It is not the end.\n\n \n Logic is the only true means of reaching the truth. Without logic we would all be absent minded animals. How is logic not independent?

Are you sure you are open-minded? Would you, for instance, ever consider becoming a Christian?\n\n \n I find Christianity to be one of the stupidest religions that I'm aware of.

Because I am not using blind faith to presuade myself into absolute certainty, I continue to remain open to the possibilities of God's existance.\n \n \nBeing open minded is being willing to listen to another person and to understand them where they are in their thinking.
