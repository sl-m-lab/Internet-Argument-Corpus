   "http://www.raptureletters.com\n \n \"The rapture: When all the believers in Jesus Christ, who have been born again, are\n taken up to heaven.\n \n After the rapture, there will be a lot of speculation as to why millions of people have\n just disappeared. Unfortunately, after the rapture, only non believers will be left to come up with answers. You probably have family and friends that you have witnessed to and they just won't listen. After the rapture they probably will, but who will tell them?\n \n We have written a computer program to do just that. It will send an Electronic Message (e-mail) to whomever you want after the rapture has taken place, and you and I have been taken to heaven.\n \n How is this accomplished, you might ask. It's a dead man switch that will automatically send the emails when it is not reset.\n \n If you wish to do something now that will help your unbelieving friends and family after the rapture, you need to add those persons email address to our database. Their names will be stored indefinitely and a letter will be sent out to each of them on the first Friday after the rapture. Then they will receive another letter every friday after that.\n \n This rapture letter service is FREE and will hopefully gain the person you send it to an eternity in heaven.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n The letter will look like this:\n \n \"Dear Friend;\n \n This message has been sent to you by a friend or a relative who has recently\n disappeared along with millions and millions of people around the world.\n \n The reason they chose to send you this letter is because they cared about you\n and would like you to know the truth about where they went.\n \n This may come as a shock to you, but the one who sent you this has been taken\n up to heaven.\n \n If you read a Bible, you will see that after chapter three in the book of Revelation,\n the church is no longer mentioned as being on earth. (The church are the believers\n in Jesus Christ, not the buildings in which people meet.)\n \n In the Bible, 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4 verses 16 and 17 tell how Jesus came\n to take away His church. But, you have to believe the Bible is the Word of\n God in order to believe this.\n \n I am sure that there will be a lot of speculation as to what happened to all\n these people. The theories of some scientists and world leaders will have\n so much credibility that most of the world will believe them.\n \n It will sound like the truth!\n \n But, there is only one truth. And, that truth is that Jesus Christ, God in the flesh,\n came back to earth and took with Him to Heaven all who believed in Him\n and made Him their Lord.\n \n If you would like to give your life to Jesus Christ and be born again, it is\n not too late. First you must pray to God saying\"Father I admit I am a\n sinner, and I will turn from my sin and do good. I believe that Jesus was\n your son and that He came here to die for me so that my sins would be\n forgiven. I ask you to forgive me and I will repent of my sins. In Jesus\n name I pray.\"\n \n If you just prayed that prayer and meant it with all your heart, then God\n will know you as one of His own. You should now seek out others who have\n also given their lives to Christ, read a Bible daily, and do your best to\n bring others to Christ.\n \n God bless you.\"\n \n \n Do they really expect all Christians to just disappear from the face of the Earth? And they say scientists will make up a theory that will seem real? They don't just make up theories. This is kind of funny at first, but kind of scary that people actually believe this will happen.",

Religion has taken its toll on the Bible...I can see that.\n First of all Christ arose from the dead with a \"glorified body\" - that is not flesh. It had the appearance of flesh and was that to the touch, but flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 15:50)\n It cannot and will not.\n Therefore, our fleshly bodies will be changed to \"glorified bodies\"...those that are alive at that time. Being \"lifted into the clouds\" is what being \"taken to Him\" means. Show me where it says we will be raptured \"away to Heaven\".\n \nlets susbtitute the meanings you assigned here into the original scripture:\n \n In Heaven are many designated realms (please elaborate); if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place [in Heaven] for you? And when I Ascend and prepare a place for you, I will come again [my return] and you will be in my Kingdom [Heaven], that where I am you may be also [New Heaven and Earth].\" \n \n \n the above scripture, even after substitutions, clearly state that Jesus says he will come back to earth, and take his saints into heaven. (unless in this verse the word \"take\" means deceive as well...)\n\n Unkerpaulie, let's get something straight before we go any further. I did not pervert the Bible's meaning of the word \"take\" as to mean \"deceived\", and you know it. Stop that briar-patching, it's not your MO. What I meant was that those passages of scripture have been misunderstood.\n Now, back to the point.\n What is wrong with the above substitution? I read it and see just exactly what I posted before. Yes, Jesus has already prepared that place in Heaven for us. He will come here and take us to Him. I fail to see any mention of being raptured.\n \n In most cases this would be the time for those that believe in \"the rapture\" to step in and give it's meaning. Evidently we have none here that believe that way.\n \n BTW - Designated realms is that place in Heaven made just for you and I. What it looks like, how it's shaped, etc., is beyond my comprehension.\n \ni dont know about any \"last trump\", or any rapture that will take place before that. the conventional doctrine is that the \"trump\" and rapture event occurs at the same time. and basically its just one trumpet sound. its a single and instantaneous event, like i said before\n\n How do you say, \"Oui! The rapture thing again!\" without begging for its definition? I could go to Google and get plenty of definitions I suppose, but it wouldn't do a thing for this debate. We need someone that actually believes in it and can give us their version. It is my understanding that \"the rapture\" will occur before the trials and tribulations.\n 1 Corinthians 15:52 states, In a moment, in the twinkling of and eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\n Right now, as we speak, Heaven has not come down. It is still not on this earth and will remain there until Christ returns when Heaven comes with Him and, after the falling away, the trials and tribulations, will He establish His kingdom here.\n \n Again, there will be nowhere to be \"raptured\" to or towards or into. So, in other words, keep your powder dry.\n \nJesus said that he will take his saints up to heaven in a single and instantaneous rapture event, thesalonians confirms it. i see a lot of scriptural basis\n\n \"Into Heaven\", He will accept those true to Him, \"into Heaven\", \"unto Him\". To prevent this from being a circular argument instead of a useful debate: Do you not agree that New Heaven will come down to be established in the New Earth? If you agree, then you must agree that there will be nowhere to be raptured to.\n \n Of course if you equate rapture with change, then you misunderstand the \"rapture event\". One will happen, the other will not.\n \ni dont know about you, but the verse isnt confusing at all. 2 key points to note are 1)Jesus' return will be accompanied by angels in a spectacular display of glory, and 2) some christians will be alive to witness this event. \n\n We are in agreement here.\n \nhere is where you'll really have to do some work. you are telling me that by the word \"taken\" the author intended it to mean \"one will be deceived, the other left behind\" rather than \"taken\", as in removed or displaced? you're gonna have to do some word origin research on that one and get back to me, because i am certain (and can back up) that that wasnt what the author meant by \"taken\"\n\n Prove me wrong then. Prove to me that Jesus did not mean for us to keep to our work so that He would find us doing just that at His return - not run off to worship the anti-Christ. For instance, (after telling us that one will be deceived, but the other will remain and guard his house - verse 43); verse 46: Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he comes, shall find doing so.\n \nyou say that mainstream religion is wrong about their belief about the \"rapture\"\n\n Yep.\n \n(which you really havent defined yet),\n\n I don't need to define that in which I don't believe. It's a waste of time.\n Do you care to define it? No one can do so using scripture, but it had to originate from the Bible. How about giving your take on it.\n \nbecause mainstream religious preaches that in the rapture, the saints will be taken up WITH the lord on that day,\n\n I agree, but they're misunderstanding the timeline and using a word that misleads many.\n \nwhen you are arguing that they are going to be taken up to heaven TO the Lord\n\n Re-read any of my posts and show where I said \"taken up to Heaven\" other than meeting Heaven.\n \nanyway, what does the scripture say concerning the \"second coming\" (since \"rapture\" is the word you seem to have concerns against). strictly from what the bible says, lets answer these questions\n\n \n 1. will Jesus come to earth again? Yes\n 2. will his return be accompanied by trumpet sounds and angels? Yes\n 3. will it be a single and instantaneous event? Yes\n 4. will the dead in christ rise from the dead during that event? Yes\n 5. will the alive in christ also be removed from the earth during that event? They will be changed and meet the Lord in \"the clouds\" or in the spirit-world (Heaven) where that event will be as real as earthly matters, but have nothing comprehensible to earthly laws or scientific data. This will also be where those in #4 will be.\n 6. will all these christians be taken to heaven at that time (living and formerly dead)? No. Heaven will meet them.\n 7. will Jesus return to heaven during that event? He's already there. There is no mention of a re-return to Heaven for anyone.\n 8. will the sinners in the earth remain wherever they are during the event? Yes\n \n Again, \"the rapture\" only deals with a \"taking away\" before the \"great tribulation\" as I understand it, and the basis of this entire thread.",

   "Prove me wrong then. Prove to me that Jesus did not mean for us to keep to our work so that He would find us doing just that at His return - not run off to worship the anti-Christ. For instance, (after telling us that one will be deceived, but the other will remain and guard his house - verse 43); verse 46: Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he comes, shall find doing so.\n\n this one i'll have to look up. i'll get back to you about the specifics of this (greek word origins, etc)\n \n \nI don't need to define that in which I don't believe. It's a waste of time.\n Do you care to define it? No one can do so using scripture, but it had to originate from the Bible. How about giving your take on it.\n\n from here on i'll use the term \"second coming\" (which you apparently believe in) rather than \"rapture\". generally, both are names of the exact same event, but since for you \"rapture\" means something different (which you still refuse to define), i wont use the term\n \n \n1. will Jesus come to earth again? Yes\n 2. will his return be accompanied by trumpet sounds and angels? Yes\n 3. will it be a single and instantaneous event? Yes\n 4. will the dead in christ rise from the dead during that event? Yes\n 5. will the alive in christ also be removed from the earth during that event? They will be changed and meet the Lord in \"the clouds\" or in the spirit-world (Heaven) where that event will be as real as earthly matters, but have nothing comprehensible to earthly laws or scientific data. This will also be where those in #4 will be.\n 6. will all these christians be taken to heaven at that time (living and formerly dead)? No. Heaven will meet them.\n 7. will Jesus return to heaven during that event? He's already there. There is no mention of a re-return to Heaven for anyone.\n 8. will the sinners in the earth remain wherever they are during the event? Yes\n\n you answered yes to question 1 and no to question 7. if you agree that Jesus will return to earth, and not that he will go back to heaven on that same day, then you imply that Jesus will remain on earth after his second coming.\n \n in response to 5, you imply that \"the clouds\" mean the spirit realm, and not literally the clounds in the sky. i'll take note and be sure to look up the origin of that word as well, if you dont mind\n \n finally, you say that heaven will meet those that are alive, as well as the formerly dead, who believed in christ at the time. you also mentioned that at this point they shall be \"changed\". does this mean that all the christians in the world (present and past) will simply stay on earth, but be physically different (glorified bodies)? or is it a spiritual change?\n \n by the way you answered the qustions i have a much clearer picture of what \"second coming\" means to you.",

   "its funny that now that we know the earth is round, there really is no concept of up and down, except in the convention \"towards the center of earth\" and \"away from the center of earth\". in reality, down is only a single point, while up is literally anywhere in the expanse of space. of course, at the time the bible was written, the authors were probably not aware of this. to them, hell was downward, underground (where volcanic fire comes from) and up is where the majestic and awesome celestial bodies are found. is it any surprise that upward would be associated with God and downward with evil?\nDown is where you fall when you have nothing under you and nothing above you to hold on to. Gravity wins every time.",

   "ok, i checked out the strong's concordance to look up the greek origins of the words like i said\n \n clouds, in thesalonians, in greek the word is nephele, meaning an actual cloud in the sky, and it can also mean cloudiness/obscurity (like blurring or fog). i'd take it that Paul intended the idea to mean saints being levitated upwards during the second coming/rapture to the sky\n\n But there is no mention of \"outer space\". That is still here on earth - not out yonder somewhere. That is in this breathable air of earth.\n Also: It really depends on what the human mind can grasp. Remember, all that we can do is comprehend things \"from the cradle to the grave\" until we go further into a greater understanding to where we realize that there is everlasting life. It is then we see that this could mean \"apart from the natural\" and of the actual clouds. And what meaning would that give one way or the other? The clouds are really just above our reach unless we take an aircraft of some sort - then we're in the clouds, right? At first glance, yes, it would seem the word \"clouds\" would have some spiritual meaning, but when we take a closer look and see them for what they are: Part of this earth - not away from it, somewhere out there in space, a place we have to be \"raptured\" towards or to or into.\n Again, there is no scripture which says the righteous will leave Earth.\n \ntaken, in matthew, comes from the greek word paralambano, meaning to recieve to oneself, and also it can mean to assume a position or office (take office). this confirms the idea that the \"one will be taken, the other left\" means that people with be actually taken to Jesus in the second coming\n\n Who will inherit the earth if we all \"fly away\"?\n \n Let's see what Jesus has to say about one taken - one left:\n Matthew 24:38-40 \n For as in the days that were before the Flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, 39 and knew not until the Flood came, and took them (the unbelievers)all away; So Shall Also the Coming of the Son of Man Be. 40 Then shall two be in the Field; the one shall be taken (the unbelievers), and the other left (on earth). \n Taken by the powers of darkness, deceived into believing a lie.\n \ninterestingly, i also took a look at a bible commentary. in thesalonians, the term \"caught up\" is translated from the greek word \"harpazo\", which the word \"rapture\" is derived from. the word harpazo literally translates to \"seize\" or \"snatched\", coinciding with the idea of \"taken away\" or \"swept away\"\n\n Yes, 1Thes 4:17 \"Caught Up\" = Greek harpazo; Acts 8:39 \"Caught Away\" = Greek harpazo, but that has nothing to do with \"rapture\". It does, however, mean to \"take away\" or \"snatched\" as you posted, but to say that it means to \"fly away\" or \"be raptured\" (which means to blissfully whisk away from danger, trials, and tribulation) is not scriptural.\n Since we have not covered the scripture in Acts, I will post it:\n Acts 8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away (Harpazo) Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more... \n 40 But Philip was found at Azotus (on Earth): and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.\n He was not vacuumed up, raptured to some place in outer space.\n \n And what about the five virgins in Matthew 25? If you knew you were going to get \"raptured\" would you keep oil in your lamps? No, you wouldn't need it, right? So the other five that kept oil in their lamps made it to the wedding, not the foolish ones that believed they didn't need oil.\n \nso it seems as though the actual idea that the writers were trying to convey is that saints will be actually snatched out of the earth bodily, and jetisoned upwards to heaven\n\n No, it does not seem that way.\n \ni guess my next assignment is to show scriptural support that heaven is upwards and away from earth...\n \n Thanks, unkerpaulie, for your work. I am eager to see it.",
