   " Iran woman escapes stoning death for adultery\n But it is not clear whether they have lifted the death sentence against Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who has been in prison in Tabriz since 2006.\n The 43-year-old had already been punished with flogging for an \"illicit relationship\" outside marriage when another court tried her for adultery.\n There has been an international campaign to prevent her being stoned.\n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said stoning was a \"medieval punishment\" and that its continued use showed Iran's disregard for human rights.\n \"If the punishment is carried out, it will disgust and appal the watching world,\" he told a news conference in London on Thursday.\n Under Iran's strict interpretation of Islamic law, sex before marriage is punishable by 100 lashes, but married offenders are sentenced to death by stoning. The stones used must be large enough to cause the condemned pain, but not sufficient to kill immediately.\n Ms Ashtiani's lawyer and human rights activists had warned that her execution was imminent, after appeals for clemency were rejected.\n In May 2006, a criminal court in East Azerbaijan province found Ms Ashtiani guilty of having had an \"illicit relationship\" with two men following the death of her husband. She was given 99 lashes.\n But that September, during the trial of a man accused of murdering her husband, another court reopened an adultery case based on events that allegedly took place before her husband died.\n Despite retracting a confession the she said she had been forced to make under duress, Ms Ashtiani was found guilty.",

   "Hello there.\n \n I had never asked myself what was the punishment for adultery in the Bible before, but this topic made me google a minute. Forgive me if you find my sources are not good enough, I'm a total ignorant concerning holy scriptures. But here's what I've found:\n \n \n \nUnder the law of Moses the penalty was death by stoning. (Deuteronomy 22:21 ff, John 8:4,5). \n\n \n Source: Adultery and the Bible\n \n Another quote for the same law:\n \n \n22.22 &#8220;If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman and the woman; so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.\n\n \n Source: Old Testament Stoning to Death Punishments. Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Bible.\n \n The next link incidentally brought me back to the more general topic of death penalty:\n \n \nThe Bible prescribes the death penalty for the following activities, among others:\n \n * Murder\n * Adultery\n * Bestiality\n * Rape \n * Homosexual sex\n * A betrothed woman who does not cry out while being raped\n * A woman who is found not to have been a virgin on the night of her wedding\n * Worshiping other gods\n * Witchcraft \n * Taking God's name in vain or cursing God's name\n * Cursing a parent\n * Kidnapping\n \n\n \n Source: Crime and punishment in the Bible - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n That seems to be included in the old testament.\n \n And to my surprise i've also found this:\n \n \nLust\n \n 27 &#8220;You have heard that it was said, &#8216;You shall not commit adultery.&#8217; 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\n \n\n \n Source: Passage: Matthew 5:27-30 (ESV Bible Online)\n \n So I wondered what christians could think of this, if the word of Jesus should be literraly applied, in this particular case. Is the new testament and its various possible interpretations the only reference for believers or is the old one still taken into account? It seemed to me that we talk a lot about the sharia in muslim countries, so I wondered if muslims were more respectful of their traditions ( \"stoning as punishment for sexual sin is not prescribed in the Qur'an, but is prescribed in the hadith&#8212;oral traditions relating to the words and deeds of the Islamic prophet Muhammad\" - Adultery - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia), or if christians got soft. Again, if I looked into the wrong pages or if I misunderstood something, my apologies, this post was made after pure curiosity.",
