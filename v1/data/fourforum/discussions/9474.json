   "This thread is intended for use only by Marc9000 and Peeling to work out the details of their proposed debate on Evolution. All posts not authored by these two gentlemen will be deleted without comment.\n What needs to be resolved are:\n 1. Resolution's exact text. \n 2. Time limits / post\n 3. number of posts\n 4. Acceptable judges. PM any objections to me\n \n Good luck to both of you. Upon completing #1-3, I will send you names of perspective judges. We can handle task #4 via PM so that there isn't any ill will generated. \n \n Since this will be my first time as moderator in this forum, be kind. :)",

   "#1) I'm okay with the three words; \"Evolution is atheistic\". It's a broad, general resolution, and I believe I can show it in a general way. The \"general way\" is up to the judge, I would take no exception to his interpretation of it. \n \n #2) 72 Hours between posts (from previous post time stamp), with a stopped clock on the weekends, per peeling's request. It's up to him to set the Friday-stop time, and the Sunday or Monday-start time. I would prefer he use 6PM and/or 12AM clock times. The shorter the stoped time the better, but I'll agree to whatever he wants on that. \n \n #3) With me as the affirmative, same as the past - 5 for me, 4 for him. \n \n Thanks for moderating.",
