   "It's not the world's population per se that's the problem, it's how much of our resources each person uses that's going to become a problem in the relatively near future.\n Currently the US uses 26% of the world's energy with only 5% of the people. As developing countries begin to industrialise on a large scale, particlularly India and China with a third of the global population between them, their demand for energy will skyrocket. No matter how quickly we invest in new energy sources, demand will massively outstrip supply within our lifetimes, leading to global insecurity and increasing inequality, between and within nations.\n Not even taking global warming as a proven problem (which I do believe it is) the fact that the rest of the world wants to live like the rich West is going to cause us major problems. For example, although there are all sorts of theories about the total amount of fossil fuel left on the earth, most analyses agree that with current trends, demand will outstrip supply before the end of the decade, sending oil prices up (not even considering other reasons for this, such as potential increased instability in the middle east), with no chance of production being increased fast enough to bring the price back down.\n A lot of people in this thread seem to think that we could support far more people, but we simply cannot support more people who live like 'we' do in the rich nations. We would have to have a huge leap forward in clean energy production, and great economic sacrifices would have to be made before the benefits were seen. \n We could, for example, put vast amounts of money into r&d for cold fusion,and if it proves feasible, an even greater amount of money into building enough reactors to power the world, but this will take a long time, and living standards would drop in the West as a result of the financial drain.\n The only way we could realistically support more people than we have is if we abandon technology and live a communistic lifestyle while converting all the fertile land in the world into arable land.

   "The population of the world today is made possible only through the increased efficiency of production through the market specialisation of labor, ie capitalism. It makes harnessing resources economic which were yesterday uneconomic, and while the resources of the world are finite, the resources of the universe are virtually infinite.\n \n This is to talk theoretically of course, but practically, the same applies. In so far as free markets spread to the \"3rd\" world, its people can experience the same prosperity as those of the 1st, and the global economy can sustain an increasing population into the indefinite future. A world in which first world levels of capital investment are built up worldwide is a world which may sustain not merely 6 billion, but 50 or 100 billion, and ever increasing populations beyond that as global capital investment continues to rise.\n \n Of course, the likely alternative to such a population explosion in the advent of global freedom is simply rising standards of living, which may be even more desirable.\n \n To declare redistribution the order of the day, instead of increased production, is a case of killing the goose to get at its eggs, it may temporarily alleviate a problem only for it to rise again many times more difficult a short time later. When global production has been halved and the global population temporarily sustained through distributive measures, where then will you turn to sustain 5 billion lives? There will remain no more \"surplus\" to redistribute, only a surplus of population that was previously reliant on the stolen goods.",

   "I think through technology we will be able to sustain ourselves for an even higher population. We can grow food in places we couldn't before and we can get more out of crops than ever. Silver King corn is an example. It is similar to Silver Queen except for the fact that it grows in twos thus yielding more food for the same amount of land space. But I do think that some places are too overpopulated. And people need to show some responsibility. Many poorer people are having way to many kids. More than they can support. (Welfare policies aren't helping either) Let's take a small group of people that realize the importance of being responsible with their family size. Wealthy, black women. The statistic for wealthier (i.e. doctors and such), black women shows that their average number of children is close to two (I'm sorry I don't have a reference for this statistic because I read it in a book and have no clue where my book is). I'm sure that these ladies could support more children but they know they don't want to spoil their future with too many kids. Now, I am not saying don't have children. I love children. Just use Groucho Marx's logic when he was talking to a man with 15 kids. \"I like my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.\"",
