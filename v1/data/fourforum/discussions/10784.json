   "A conservative Christian pastor plans to launch a high-profile campaign Tuesday urging religious followers to load up on Microsoft Corp. stock, in an attempt to force the company to \"stop financing ungodly ventures.\"\n \n The Rev. Ken Hutcherson, who leads Antioch Bible Church in Microsoft's hometown of Redmond, says that he will create a global and powerful group to promote traditional family values, including marriage exclusively between a man and a woman.\n \n Hutcherson, joined by some of the country's most influential Christian leaders, has created a new organization, AGN Financial Network, to finance the effort. The worldwide venture asks people to buy three shares of company stock and donate one to AGN. Its Web site tells visitors, \"You have the power to change the world,\" and contains tips on how to open a brokerage account. Among the listed supporters are Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention and religious pundit Gary Bauer.\n \n \"We're not trying to hurt Microsoft or their shareholders, nor are we calling for a boycott of their products,\" volunteer spokesman Dennis Sullivan said. \"We are trying to get Christians to buy their shares.\"\n \n It's unclear what effect, if any, the initiative could have on the stock price. It would be difficult to influence company direction -- just to gain a 1 percent stake in Microsoft, about 31 million people would each have to spend $104 to buy three shares. Microsoft has about 9.36 billion outstanding shares, and its largest holder is Chairman Bill Gates, with 858 million shares, or 9 percent of the total. Capital Research and Management Co. follows with nearly 557 million shares, or 6 percent.\n \n At Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting in November, Hutcherson told the group that he was gathering evangelicals, Catholics, Jews and Muslims to challenge the company.\n \n He told company leaders, \"I could work with you, or I could be your worst nightmare, because I am a black man with a righteous cause, with a host of powerful white people behind me,\" according to an e-mail update to his supporters. \"I hope to hear from you and if not, you will hear from me.\"\n http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/346431_antiochmsft08.html \n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n People who employ divorcees? No campaigners.\n People who employ non-Christians? No campaigners.\n Employers who have employees work on Sunday? No campaigners.\n \n But for the gays? It's a \"righteous cause\"...",

Back in 2006 he wanted to buy up a bunch of stock and then dump it to drive down the price, in some sort of attempt to \"punish\" Microsoft. Now it seems he wants Christians to buy and keep the stock, so as to sway votes at shareholders meetings. Of course, either course of action is ludicrous. There's no way these people have the money to steer the course of a corprate giant like Microsoft.
