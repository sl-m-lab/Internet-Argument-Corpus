   "I posted this on anther webbord and was greatly attcked, and I may be here to test whether the thinking is more crtical in this board. \n Here is post I posted elswhere, What do you all see?\n \n Let me explain to you the thinking: \n \n First the states divide: Each states starts passing their own laws based on the extremeist christian values of that state. Those opposed move to a state that agrees with their life style. \n \n Second: As the people shuffle around the climate of those legislatures changes to either the far right or the far left. People continue to shuffle \n point of refernce: http://christianexodus.org/ \n \n As each state has people of differing views the tensions build. the US Congress gets less and less done due to the opposition. \n \n People continue to move...and shuffle state to state. \n \n It use to be people in other countries wanted to move here, now people here wnat to move to other countries. \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon04/11/110404ImigCan.htm \n \n We are no longer the united states, we are the divided states. Soon states want to separate from the Union. This is just what the terrorist want. \n \n I want nothing more than common ground between us all. I want to see this stopped. I want to see equal rights for all (yes, including gays) I want to see the Untied States as a United country against the terrorists, but we are not uniting we are growing apart and it is scary. If you don't see this, you are blind.",
