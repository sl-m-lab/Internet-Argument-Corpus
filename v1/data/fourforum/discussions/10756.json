Hitler kept immaculate records himself.\n \n And lets not pretend Eisenhower and Churchill were holocaust deniers:\n \n http://holocaust.hklaw.com/essays/2000/200020.htm\n \n On April 12,1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, commander in chief of the Allied military forces, visited the Ohrdruf concentration camp. After viewing the evidence of atrocities, he ensured that these unbelievable scenes would be witnessed and documented so that firsthand testimony of the crimes could be given. Eisenhower ordered members of the U.S. military forces to see what had been done and urged politicians, dignitaries, reporters, photographers, and filmmakers to inspect the camps and describe the atrocities they saw to their constituencies. Subsequently, explicit photographs appeared in Life Magazine, leading newspapers, tabloids, and exhibitions in the United States, Great Britain, and France. Eisenhower and his subordinates also ordered nearby German townspeople to come and witness the results of Nazi depravity and to help clean up the areas and to bury the dead. At burial services, Allied chaplains harshly reminded ordinary German citizens of their responsibility for the crimes (Moxon, 3).\n \n http://winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=605\n \n The systematic cruelties to which the Jewish people, men, women and children, have been exposed under the Nazi regime are among the most terrible events of history. Free men and women denounce these vile crimes and when this world struggle ends with the enthronement of human rights, racial persecution will be ended. ~ Winston Churchill\n \n \n3) What were an inmate infirmary, an inmate swimming pool, and a brothel doing in Auschwitz if in fact it was a \"death camp\"? \n\n \n Not saying I believe this, but not not every prisoner of war was a Jew.\n \n The final solution wasn't made up by the allies. Massive amounts of evidence used in the Nuremburg trials was German. There are films - not only those taken by US, Russian and Brittish military when the camps were liberated but also taken by the Nazis themselves. I grew up in one of the largest Jewish communities in the United States. I met holocaust survivors. \n \n You are an admitted white supremist and anti-semite. Attempts at debunking the holocaust are about as credible as trying to prove the earth is flat. Face it sunshine, you are allied with what most of the poeople in the wold consider the epitome of evil.",

What revisionists claim, in summary, is this:\n\n \n Since the Jewish prisoners were not allowed to keep personal diaries and record the atrocities they personally suffered, then the only evidence available are the photos and written records kept by the Germans themselves. And it is accepted by all parties that the Natzi's were excellent record keepers. So all of the evidence that proves the holocaust is absolutely true as recorded comes from the criminals themselves. \n \n It wasn't the jews who took those pictures of the piles of clothing, shoes, teeth with gold fillings and other possessions taken from the condemned prisoners, it was the Germans themselves who documented their own handiwork. So why do you deny that which your own heros supplied as evidence that you now deny and reject? \n \n \n) The Jewish Holocaust is but one of many \"Holocausts\" even in the twentieth century;\n\n \n TRUE, does that make it any less a holocaust, or any less atrocious?\n \n \n2) THE METHOD: There were no gas chambers and no attempt by the Germans to methodically exterminate Jewry, expulsion being very different from extermination;\n\n \n That is a lie and an outright denial of the Natzi's own records and statement of intent at the time that these atrocities took place.\n \n \n) THE NUMBERS: The common figure of six million is too large by 500% at least;\n\n \n Another revisionist lie that contradicts the Germans own records regarding the number of holocaust victims.\n \n \n) World War II was a slaughterhouse of unprecedented proportions for everyone involved -- not just Jews, who made up perhaps 2% of the total fatalities;\n\n \n No one denies that WW2 was a slaughterhouse of unprecedented proportions , but just because a hundred million died over all, that does nothing to lessen the cooking and gassing of around 6 million who never even had a chance to fight for their personal survival. With every statement and justification you make you confirm how twisted and corrupted your thinking is. \n \n \n5) THE PLAN: There was no Hitler order to exterminate Europe's Jews. There is no documented instance of any state-sponsored plans to exterminate the Jews.\n\n \n If you have a decent attention span you will see again how unreliable revisionist history is. Do you seek the truth at all, or is it only propaganda that you choose to believe?\n \n http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394981\n \n Here is just an excerpt: And again, it is the Natzi's own testimony that condemns them. \n In general, Eichmann's various accounts are more consistent than those of Hoss.14 Eichmann testified that Heydrich informed him late in the summer of 1941 that the Fuhrer had ordered the physical destruction of the Jews. He was then assigned to report on various preparations and killing- actions in the East. First, Heydrich sent him to the already informed Odilo Globocnik in Poland, who showed him the early construction of one camp designed to use exhaust gas from a captured Russian U-boat engine. Eichmann remembered the bright fall colors there. He was then sent by Heinrich Muller to Minsk to witness Einsatzgruppen activities. The weather had already turned cold, for he was wearing a long leather coat that got splashed with the brains of a baby held up to him by a desperate mother. Finally, Muller sent him to Chelmno in late December or early January to report on the gas van killings that had just begun there. Upon his return, he was chided by Muller for not having noted with precision the timing involved in the killing operation. The one event in the sequence that Eichmann did not relate with consistency was his first visit to Auschwitz. While in his court testimony he denied the Hoss account of a fall visit to Auschwitz, in earl ier.interrogat ions he admitted having been sent by Muller to Auschwitz \"at the beginning,\" where he discussed gassing methods with Hoss and was shown the small hut in which Cyclon B pellets had been tested on prisoners. The use of Cyclon B pellets, he noted, was the major difference between Auschwitz and the other camp he had seen. This discrepancy in Eichmann's account does not, however, alter the general thrust of his testimony: that he was informed in the late summer of 1941 of the Fuhrer's decision physically to exterminate the Jews and was sent by his superiors in the SS to report on the experiences gained from various killing operations in the East.15\n \n Does any documentary evidence survive to indicate that planning activities within the SS during the fall of 1941 focused on the difficulties of extermination, not merely on deportation? On August 28, 1941, Eichmann wrote the Foreign Office and added to the old formulation \"in view of the imminent final solution\" the ominous phrase \"now in preparation.16 Although this was not a document of decisive importance, the timing of the change in phraseology is important because it coincides with Eichmann's own account of learning about the extermination order in late summer.\n \n That the Nazis no longer considered mere deportation a satisfactory solution to the Jewish question is reflected in several memoranda of Undersecretary Martin Luther of the Foreign Office in mid- October 1941.17 A number of Spanish Jews had been arrested and interned in France, which led Spain to suggest the possibility of evacuating all Spanish Jews in France (some 2,000) to Spanish Morocco. On October 13, Luther urged negotiations in that direction-a position fully in line with the hitherto prevailing policy of achieving a judenrein Europe through the expulsion of the Jews. Four days later, however, Heydrich's Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) informed Luther by telephone of its opposition to the Spanish proposal, as the Spanish government had neither the will nor the experience to guard the Jews effectively in Morocco. \"In addition these Jews would also be all too much out of the direct reach of the measures for a basic solution to the Jewish question to be enacted after the war\" [italics added]. The rejection of deportation to Morocco combined with the mention of measures for a basic solution to be enacted after the war (which otherwise would have been avoided) indicates that a fundamental shift in Nazi Jewish policy had occurred and that the Nazis had more than a \"vague notion\" of what constituted this basic solution.\n \n Also in October 1941, Eichmann's associate, Friedrich Suhr, accompanied the Foreign Office Jewish expert, Franz Rademacher, to Belgrade to deal with the Jewish question in Serbia. After the fate of the adult male Jews was settled (they were shot by army firing squads in reprisal for casualties suffered from partisan attacks), Rademacher reported on the women, children, and elderly: \"Then as soon as the technical possibility exists within the framework of a total solution of the Jewish question, the Jews will be deported by waterway to the reception camp in the East.\"18 just after learning at a conference attended by one of Eichmann's men of plans for a reception camp in the East, Rademacher received a letter from Paul Wurm, foreign editor of Der Sturmer.",

These pictures Holocaust Pictures Exhibition are a record of the atrocities, and they were taken in every country where these crimes took place by many people who would never know each other. Yet they all document the same inhumane activities and crimes against humanity. Also, you say: Finally, one would be hard-pressed to explain why 6 million Jews killed by one group of socialists, are not only more important than 100+ million (assumed) Gentiles people killed by other socialists,\n \n Let me explain what defines a holocaust as compared to the victims of a war. In war people/civilians die through collateral damage. Their survival or demise is determined by fate since they may or may not be where battles take place or bombs drop at any particular time or place. Many of them are armed and capable of defending themselves if the battle comes to them. Then there are combatants who are trained and do battle with the enemy according to the rules of war. These two groups have the right, ability and opportunity to defend themselves rather than just be picked clean of all of their humanity and murdered en-masse with no hope of defending themselves at all.\n \n A holocaust is when certain people are targeted and collected, not because of any crime they have committed, but because of who they are. And then considered to be a problem just because they exist and live. Then when a FINAL SOLUTION results in their mass extermination in around 13 different unique locations, and 500 satellite camps: Concentration Camps \n \n \nBy 1944 there were 13 main concentration camps and over 500 satellite camps. In an attempt to increase war-production, inmates were used as cheap-labour. The Schutzstaffel (SS) charged industrial companies around 6 marks for each prisoner working a twelve-hour day.\n \n At the Wannsee Conference held in January 1942 it was decided to make the extermination of the Jews a systematically organized operation. After this date extermination camps were established in the east that had the capacity to kill large numbers including Belzec (15,000 a day), Sobibor (20,000), Treblinka (25,000) and Majdanek (25,000).\n \n It has been estimated that between 1933 and 1945 a total of 1,600,000 were sent to concentration work camps. Of these, over a million died of a variety of different causes. During this period around 18 million were sent to extermination camps. Of these, historians have estimated that between five and eleven million were killed.\n\n \n All with the same exact marching orders and mission statement which prevents these people from defending themselves in any way at all with either their will or a weapon, that is the definition of a holocaust joel.",

You are just building lie upon lie as you make stuff up regarding what I have said. Back it up liar, quote me making these statements.\n \n \nYou're right, what was I thinking? I don't see where I got the idea that singling out a group of people of a specific religion and violating their rights could lead to them being hated or feeling fear. Whatever was I thinking!\n\n \n Again tq, get a clue. People seeking permission to enter this country don't have any rights. They aren't even here yet so how can their rights be violated? And who in America can make them feel hated or feeling fear if their request for a visa is denied due to sketchy connections in their home countries?\n \n \nIs any other nationality on Earth detained and interrogated on entry into the USA? Of course not\n\n \n I wont call this a lie because it's just ignorance on your part. But every single person seeking a Visa is investigates before being allowed entry. Some more stringently than others, but nobody just flies in and enters without being looked at first. To make such a statement just confirms how ignorant you are.\n \n \nExample number...bah, I lost count- of Archie not actually thinking before he posts. By this example of Archie-logic\u0099 I, as a Canadian citizen, have absolutely no rights if I visit the US.\n\n \n Try going through the American border crossing and see if your not checked out by a National data search which is connected to your home countries criminal register. They will know if you are suspected of any un-american activities before allowing you entrance. And if they deny you entrance, they haven't infringed on one right which you formerly possessed, because until you enter the US, you have no rights at all. And if that's too tough to comprehend tq, you neither deserve them or need them until you are actually here. So how have non-existent right been denied you?\n \n \nNowhere at all. Where does it say \"treat people of this ethnicity and this religion as if they are homicidal religiously motivated terrorists\". Oh yeah, it doesn't.\n \n \n Investigating people prior to allowing them entry isn't treating them in any negative way at all. It's called enforcing National Security Laws which make such checks mandatory. And that statement is still the American mantra FOR EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO BE AN AMERICAN, BUT NOT FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO DESTROY IT.\n \n \nAs shown above, Archie will buy any lie if it agrees with his prejudices.\n\n Nothing I have said is prejudicial except in your small mind. And I showed above that everything my link said was accurate.\n \n \nAnd, Archie fails basic history (or is lying through his teeth again). You, just like the vast majority of the population of the US, are an immigrant. Your country, and mine, were founded, created, and grown by immigrants.\n\n And proudly so, and it's our immigrant blending which made us a great Nation. Only someone of your ilk would attempt to imply that anything I have said endorses denying Americans of their civil rights.\n \n \nAnd there's one final fabrication. Thanks for being true to form Archie.\n\n \n Hey liar, I said this: To suggest that I should promote a lax national security policy because I'm of arab descent is truly playing the race card, which doesn't surprise me since it's coming from you. How is that a fabrication?

Do you think every Christian supports the actions of George Bush? I've heard quite a lot of Muslims explain how the Jihad is misused by extremists to mean war against non-Muslims, when really the only Jihad that can refer to warfare is the lesser Jihad, and that is only defensive in nature. The greater Jihad is struggle within oneself. The vast majority of Muslims are ordinary, hard working people who happen to believe that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob sent a last prophet to Earth by the name of Mohammed, and dictated to him infallible scripture in the form of the Q'uran. I work with, and teach, Muslims a lot of the time and they're human beings the same as anyone else. I'm generally of the opinion that someone is against the slaughter of innocent people unless I have good reason to believe otherwise, and given that Islam specifically forbids the killing of innocent people it's pretty obvious where the majority of Muslims stand. Do you also include British and American Muslims serving in the armed forces in this accusation?",

But that really doesn't mean they are all radical or violent. What it means is that the 96% of non violent moslems fear the violent retribution of the 4% who are radical. And your moslem speaker in the posted video makes it very clear that the silence of the majority is the reason why this problem persists. And he is also evidence that not all moslems are radical.

You are implying that by me agreeing with a policy to INVESTIGATE ALL VISITING MOSLEMS IN ORDER TO WEED OUT TERRORISTS FROM NON VIOLENT PEOPLE IS DISCRIMINATORY, and is saying that all moslems are examples of *ahem* RADICAL ISLAM, as you put it? Like I said above, you're either too ignorant to tell the difference, or you just don't want to tell the difference in investigating people seeking to enter this Country, and actually abusing them.\n \n If I was truly against all moslems in a discriminatory way, I would have called for rejecting all of them across the board and not allowing any to enter this country in a time of war against radical islam. Have you no understanding about visa or immigration policy at all? I'm not even suggesting something that doesn't exist for ALL immigrants and visitors coming into this country whatever their nationality. This is SOP, yet you attempt to falsely demonize me for saying that this policy is necessary regarding the religious group which is at war with us in a debate about the holocaust which this group has promised to bring to us. \n \n So when you say that's your beef, it isn't with me. It's with America's policy as it exists today. What bothers you is that I absolutely agree that it's especially needed at this time if we hope to prevent radical moslems from getting in with regular folk as most assuredly happened with all of the 19 terrorists who successfully carried out the 9/11 attack in our Country. \n \n That isn't saying that ALL moslems are examples of radicalism, that's saying that all moslems must be cleared in order to prevent radicals from getting back in. For you to disagree with enforcing National Security Policies which we have in place just goes to show that you have neither a sense of history, nor the brains to protect us from another attack.\n \n BTW iangb, investigating non citizens prior to allowing them entrance into our Country isn't denying them of any American civil rights, since they don't have any American civil rights until they enter this country. This is a preventative measure, not a discriminatory measure. And did you notice the bolded in the quotes you posted? All for visiting and foreign moslems before allowing them entrance? Just because I didn't actually state that ALL foreigners are investigated in the same way, doesn't mean moslems are being discriminated against in any way, or that I endorse any discrimination against anyone. I endorse National Security policies which will prevent another attack here; sorry if that offends your liberal sensibilities.",

Here's my problem with you leftists. My response below to symbiote was way back at post #13, now look at the number we're at now. And most of those posts were me defending myself against TQ and you regarding this alleged discriminatory position of mine when my original response to symbiote couldn't have been more clear, and accurate according to US Visa and immigration policy. Do you even know why we must apply for visas to visit foreign countries? So they can check us out. Every Country does it, not just the USA. \n \n \nHolocaust revisionism does have some element of truth to it, for example it seems to me likely that internment camps started out largely as work camps and became increasingly harsh as time went on, particularly after it was clear Germany was losing.\n \n It's important to have the truth here, because we look at Japanese internment in WW2 and say \"oh that was fine, they weren't in death camps like the Nazis had\", but things may well have been different if the winners and losers were rearranged.\n \n I don't think attempts to claim the whole thing never happened are at all productive though, anyone calling it a myth best which parts in exactly they're objecting to the history of.\n\n \n \nI personally don't think that interning loyal japanese Americans was fine. I think it was racist and paranoid on the part of our Government. Just as Indian Reservations are Racist and slavery was racist based oppression. \n \n On the other hand I would support our Government today to investigate all visiting moslems and deport them back to their home Countries if they are found to be suspected of anti-american activities while in this Country or before coming here.\n\n \n I said visiting moslems right up front. And to only investigate them before allowing them entrance into our Country, not detain, interrogate or incarcerate them as tq inferred I said. I am constantly defending myself against misinterpretations solely because you haters want to think the very worst of me in all situations. \n \n If you worked as hard to find common ground as you do attempting to demonize me, we could make some progress here and maybe even agree on somethings without having to first cut through the slander and libelous tactics used to corrupt what I actually say, which you prefer to attribute to me. \n \n You two have derailed this thread from the holocaust to this fallacious accusation which you're still blaming me for not being clear enough about up front. But I was clear from the onset; it's you and tq who distorted what I said and continued to insist that I said something I never said at all.",
