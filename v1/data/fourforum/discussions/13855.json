   "It appears that the French don't have any problem bullying Muslim women.........well almost. ;)\n \n\n French Panel Recommends Limits on Face Veil \n Associated Press \n PARIS-A parliamentary panel that wants Muslim women to stop veiling their faces recommended Tuesday that France ban such garb in public facilities, including hospitals and mass transit, and a leading panel member said he foresees such an interdiction by the end of 2010.\n The nearly 200-page report contains a panoply of measures intended to dissuade women from wearing all-enveloping veils in France. It also recommends refusing residence cards and citizenship to anyone with visible signs of a \"radical religious practice.\"\n However, there is no call to outlaw such garments-worn by a tiny minority of Muslims-in private areas and in the street. A full ban was the major issue that divided the 32-member, multiparty panel which ultimately heeded warnings that a full ban risked being deemed unconstitutional and could even cause trouble in a country where Islam is the second-largest religion.French Panel Recommends Limits on Face Veil - WSJ.com\n \n",

   "I know this is an old thread, but I just want to say that I've reconsidered my stance on this issue. I think every country should ban the Burka to show the Arabs \"we're above your theocratic bulls***.\" The Burka is an oppressive garment meant specifically to humiliate and dehumanize women. When women are wearing Burkas, it's difficult to tell one woman from another, and the Arab males like it that way. They don't view their women as people, they view them as worthless sex objects.\n \n They accuse western men of \"hating women\" by taking them from their homes (i.e. giving them the option to have a job) and allowing them the same liberties of men. Yet the Arab males demonstrate their \"love\" for women by beating them, raping them, denying them the right to a job, most recreation, and medical attention. \n \n In Afghanistan, IIRC, it is illegal for women to sing, dance, play musical instruments, play sports, hold a job, go to school, or receive medical attention. And these people claim to love women?! The Arab view of women is not a perverted version of love; it is pure disgust and hatred, no love whatsoever involved.\n \n The full Burka is a Canvas prison. It weighs about 15 pounds (7kg), it puts pressure on the woman's head making walking more tiresome. It cripples the woman's vision, thus rendering her vision when walking so that she has to follow her husband and keep her eyes on him constantly. And most importantly, the woman has great difficulty running in the Burka; all the better to keep her enslaved.\n \n The Burka is a symbol of the Arab view of women as being subhuman. I think if they want women to wear Burkas in their country, their women should take off the Burkas whenever they come here. They should keep their misogyny in their country.",

   "Most of the European Muslim population IS moderate. What we have to avoid is fuelling radicalisation, and attacks on things particular to Muslims, even if other Muslims disagree with those practices, will lead to more people feeling that Islam itself is under attack. For many Muslims, just as for many Christians and Jews, attacks on members of their faith are attacks on their faith. If you want moderate Islam, give it space, don't put it under pressure. Pressure radicalises people. Look at where the Christian church is the most moderate - it's in the countries where there is an established church, England, Scotland, Sweden, Germany. Look at where it is the most extreme - where it is (or was) under pressure, Nigeria, Uganda, Poland, United States. Fundamentalism thrives on persecution, real or imagined. The less fuel for that fire, the better off we'll all be.\n \n The resistance to integration comes more from non-Muslim white families than it does from Muslim. I worked in Blackburn for a little while, and local primary schools faced a bizarre phenomenon. Most Asian families want their kids to grow up in an ethnically mixed school, so when a school had a fair chunk of Asian students, it tended to get a lot of parents keen to send their kids to this nice, diverse primary. Problem was, the white parents then had a tendency to send their kids elsewhere, because they thought there were too many Asians at the school, so it ends up 80-90% Asian and not very diverse at all. At secondary level, Asian parents sent their kids to the local schools, white parents bussed theirs to Clitheroe rather than have them go to schools with high proportions of Asian students. Yes, there is a lack of effort from some Asian families too, but it's far outstripped by racism from whites.",

In fact, if it were possible I'd have the fine levied on the woman's husband for making her wear the Burka.\n \n \nOf course not, the man forcing them to wear it will simply not let them out the house.\n\n \n Women have rights in France. A husband trying to suppress those rights has no right to do so. If he wants to be misogynistic, then he should go with his wife back to Afghanistan or wherever.\n \n\n In any given case, either it's forced and banning it will simply make life worse for the woman in question,\n\n \n Not without any laws being broken.\n \n \nor it's voluntary and you've violated her right to freedom of expression and freedom of religion for no good purpose.\n\n \n Right to freedom of religion isn't violated. Law requiring a woman to wear a twenty-pound canvas prison is cultural and political, not religious. The Muslim moderate women just wear the Hiyab, meaning that the Hiyab most likely conforms to Islamic religious law. In some of the less restrictive sects of Islam, women don't have to cover their heads. \n \n The Burka wasn't even created until the early twentieth century under the rule of Habibullah Khan, who introduced it not as prescribed by the Quaran, but to prevent men from looking at the facial beauty of the women of his Harem. The Burka is not prescribed by any actual Islamic law. It's only prescribed by Sharia politics.\n \n I don't see how you figure a twenty-pound canvas prison that completely conceals the identity of the wearer is \"freedom of expression.\"\n \n \nPretty much all styles of dress are promoted by a particular culture. Should we ban stiletos? After all they're very damaging to people's feet and are specifically designed to make women more appealing to men, by creating a posture that accentuates the legs, buttocks and breasts. A lot of women's \"fashion\" is precisely about turning women into sex objects, and pornography certainly is.\n\n \n That's different. Women who wears stilettos do so voluntarily, not because of any government law or because they're afraid their husbands will beat them if they don't. No culture or government is forcing women to wear stilettos, and stilettos aren't meant to humble women in any way. They aren't meant to restrict real freedom of expression, nor do they symbolize restriction of freedom.\n \n Also, if a Burka is meant to have any sort of sexual appeal, the guys who are enforcing it must have some very odd fetishes. emoticon_ic\n \n \nThe burkha is absurd and pointless, and in many cases is a result of sexist attitudes. BUT, it is far from the only form of dress for which that is the case; the focus on the burkha smacks of prejudice and xenophobia.\n\n \n No. Among all the Islamic woman head coverings, the Burka is by far the most oppressive. The Hiyab and Shayla are reasonable, as women can still retain some individuality in them, and they don't restrict the woman's movement or vision. The Burka is a canvas prison that is not prescribed by actual Islamic Law. It's only prescribed by a malevolent, misogynistic, extremist government and culture. And before you comment, no, I'm not referring to the Arab culture. I'm referring the extremist culture prescribed by the Taliban.\n \n I have one last thing to share with you in this post:\n \"He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.\"\n ~ Martin Luther King Jr.",

   ":)\nMost of the European Muslim population IS moderate. What we have to avoid is fuelling radicalisation, and attacks on things particular to Muslims, even if other Muslims disagree with those practices, will lead to more people feeling that Islam itself is under attack. For many Muslims, just as for many Christians and Jews, attacks on members of their faith are attacks on their faith. If you want moderate Islam, give it space, don't put it under pressure. Pressure radicalises people. Look at where the Christian church is the most moderate - it's in the countries where there is an established church, England, Scotland, Sweden, Germany. Look at where it is the most extreme - where it is (or was) under pressure, Nigeria, Uganda, Poland, United States. Fundamentalism thrives on persecution, real or imagined. The less fuel for that fire, the better off we'll all be.\n \n The resistance to integration comes more from non-Muslim white families than it does from Muslim. I worked in Blackburn for a little while, and local primary schools faced a bizarre phenomenon. Most Asian families want their kids to grow up in an ethnically mixed school, so when a school had a fair chunk of Asian students, it tended to get a lot of parents keen to send their kids to this nice, diverse primary. Problem was, the white parents then had a tendency to send their kids elsewhere, because they thought there were too many Asians at the school, so it ends up 80-90% Asian and not very diverse at all. At secondary level, Asian parents sent their kids to the local schools, white parents bussed theirs to Clitheroe rather than have them go to schools with high proportions of Asian students. Yes, there is a lack of effort from some Asian families too, but it's far outstripped by racism from whites.\n\n \n I n the world of Jo Bennett the nasty racist white parents didnt want to send their children to the same schools as the wonderful multi cultural embracing Asians.\n I dont know whether to laugh or cryemoticon_xdonno",
