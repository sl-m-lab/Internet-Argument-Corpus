   "Hate to break it to ya fellas, but whether or not you have your foreskin ain't all that shakin to the workings of the universe. :p \n\n It is to the boy/man who will never know in his life what sex is actually supposed to feel like. His poor hardened (keratinized) glans will never have the sensation that it would if he weren't circumcized. I've heard it being compared to the difference between seeing in color or in black and white. Certain nerve cells that were amputated normally perform certain sensory funtions also. These can never be recovered. \n \n Circumcision removes some, most, or sometimes all of the frenulum, which is (was) a very sensitive part, as well as the material that makes up \"the ridged band\" which is very important in normal ejaculatory response. \n \n Here is a nice site that explains things (Australian):\n http://www.circinfo.org/research.html\n \n \n\n Circumcision was a Victorian medical fad which should have gone out with neck-to-knee bathing costumes, blood-letting, frontal lobotomies, and the idea that children should be seen and not heard. The practice survived because it became deeply entrenched in the culture of English-speaking countries, and seen as normal, or at least acceptable: few people came to regard it with the same revulsion as they would look upon surgical alterations to the genitals of girls. As the original justifications for early circumcision were discredited, the fanatics kept coming up with new reasons for doing it: if it wasn't to stop masturbation, it was to provide immunity against syphilis; if it wasn't syphilis, it was cancer; if it wasn't cancer, it was UTIs ... And so on.\n .....\n The ridged band is a special zone of tissue on the underside of the foreskin, with probably the densest concentration of nerve endings in the human body. Until recently doctors did not even know it was there because they were too busy amputating foreskins before they had studied what they were tossing in the trash. In terms of its role in sexual responsiveness, it could be regarded as the male clitoris.\n .....\n Did you know that an early circumcision can prevent the development of neural pathways in the brain? And that circumcision often has harmful, and permanent, psychological effects?\n\n \n This is not a very well organized site, but it has A LOT of links: http://www.circumstitions.com/\n \n This is interesting to me:\n http://www.circumstitions.com/Nursing.html\n \n As well as this:\n http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP.html\n \nInformation for ordinary people\n The AAP's brochure for parents \"Circumcision: Information for Parents\" is woefully biased towards circumcision, not even admitting that the foreskin is part of the penis. Here is an analysis of its faults. That prompted an alternative brochure, treating intactness as normal, available both online with links and in document form suitable for printing out.\n \n Doctors' organisations\n The American Medical Association issued a policy statement on circumcision on July 6, 2000. It is weighed in the balance (and found wanting) here. It agrees with the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics of March 1, 1999.\n \n The AAP statement is also laid out paragraph for paragraph against its corresponding statement on Female Genital Mutilation, issued in July 1998. The contrast in both the tone and the content of the two statements is astonishing. You wouldn't think the two committees live on the same planet.\n\n \n And then they can always botch the procedure:\n http://www.circumstitions.com/Botched.html\n (links to pictures, so if you are squeamish, don't click here)\n \n \n \nFemale circumcision - now THAT is interesting.

Someone in Eastern Europe would think that ritual male gential mutilation as disturbing. They would cringe at the thought. \n \n Here, did you read these side by side?\n The opinion of the AAP:\n On male circumcision:\n \nETHICAL ISSUES\n \n The practice of medicine has long respected an adult's right to self-determination in health care decision-making. This principle has been operationalized through the doctrine of informed consent. The process of informed consent obligates the physician to explain any procedure or treatment and to enumerate the risks, benefits, and alternatives for the patient to make an informed choice. For infants and young children who lack the capacity to decide for themselves, a surrogate, generally a parent, must make such choices.118\n \n Parents and physicians each have an ethical duty to the child to attempt to secure the child's best interest and well-being.119 However, it is often uncertain as to what is in the best interest of any individual patient. In cases such as the decision to perform a circumcision in the neonatal period when there are potential benefits and risks and the procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being, it should be the parents who determine what is in the best interest of the child.\n \n In the pluralistic society of the United States in which parents are afforded wide authority for determining what constitutes appropriate child-rearing and child welfare, it is legitimate for the parents to take into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, in addition to medical factors, when making this choice.119\n \n Physicians counseling families concerning this decision should assist the parents by explaining the potential benefits and risks and by ensuring that they understand that circumcision is an elective procedure. Parents should not be coerced by medical professionals to make this choice.\n\n So basically infant genital mutilation is left up to the parents.\n \n On female circumcision:\n \nThe physical burdens and potential psychological harms associated with FGM violate the principle of nonmaleficence, a commitment to avoid doing harm, and disrupt the accepted norms inherent in the patient-physician relationship, such as trust and the promotion of good health. More recently, FGM has been characterized as a practice that violates the right of infants and children to good health and well-being, part of a universal standard of basic human rights.22\n \n Although pediatricians and pediatric surgical specialists may believe that refusal to perform FGM may represent ethnic and Eurocentric cultural imperialism, protection of the physical and mental health of girls should be the overriding concern of the health care community. Humanitarian organizations led by women from cultures in which FGM is practiced have adopted a strong position against the procedure because of its serious physical and psychological consequences.\n \n Some physicians, including pediatricians, who work closely with immigrant populations in which FGM is endemic (is MGM endemic here?), have voiced concern about the adverse effects of criminalization of the practice on educational efforts.24 These physicians emphasize the significance of a ceremonial ritual in the initiation of the girl or adolescent as a community member, and advocate a lesser procedure, such as pricking or incision of the clitoral skin, as often sufficient to satisfy cultural requirements. Pediatricians and pediatric surgical and urologic surgeons who are contemplating performing such a procedure should consider their role in perpetuating this social practice with its cultural implications for the status of women. It is also unclear whether performing such lesser procedures would be exempt from federal criminal laws.\n \n EDUCATION OF PATIENTS AND PARENTS\n \n An educational program about FGM requires, above all, sensitivity to the cultural background of the patient and her parents and an appreciation of the significance of this custom in their tradition.23 Objective information should include a detailed explanation of female genital anatomy and function, as well as a thorough review of the lifelong physical harms and psychological suffering associated with FGM. It should be emphasized that many countries in Africa have supported efforts to educate the public about the serious negative health effects of FGM, and that prominent physicians from Africa are advocates for the elimination of these practices because of their adverse consequences. Pediatricians and pediatric surgical specialists who care for patients from populations known to commonly practice FGM, such as Somalian, Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Sudanese communities, should be aware of local counseling centers. Successful educational programs typically require the active involvement and leadership of immigrant women, whose experience and knowledge can address the health, social status, and legal aspects of FGM.\n \n Efforts should be made to use all available educational and counseling resources to dissuade parents from seeking a ritual genital procedure for their daughter. In those circumstances in which an infant, child, or adolescent appears to be at risk of FGM, the AAP recommends that its members educate and counsel the family about the health effects of FGM. Parents should be reminded that performing FGM is illegal and constitutes child abuse in the United States.\n\n I can understand the difference between chopping off the entire outer part of the clitoris and male circumcision, but as stated in the report, this is not as common a practice as simple female circumcision. Really, what mostly happens is they circumcize the hood of the clitoris, or they remove most of the labia. This is pretty similar to male circumcision. Why isn't the AAP calling it MGM?\n \n So MGM is up to the parents and FGM is illegal.\n \n \n \nI am not a doctor , but I worked in a hospital for 12 years. The cases of elderly men they were being treated for infections due to unclean appendages were quite common . The elderly men with diminished capacity minds and untrimmed organs were just not maintaining cleaniness ... \n And on a more sensitive note, ask women that have relations with uncut men. You will find they are concerned with yeast infections ( is the male clean ??? ) and they complain about how uncut males have a hair trigger (no pun intended) and finish before they really get started. :)\n\n \n Well, then you are contradicting many sources that say that women acheive orgasm more often with uncut men because the way the penis behaves is different. The main sensations rely on mostly pressure and little friction, but when cut, friction is greatly increased, causing the need for artificial lubrication much more often. The penis is supposed to mostly slide in and out of the foreskin instead of mostly rubbing directly on the vaginal walls. (I wouldn't know the difference because I have never had a foreskin beyond infancy. And my girlfriend says she never has any problems or complaints, but we do use the lube sometimes!)\n \n Anyway, if an old man has some problem with his penis then he can get circumcized then (this is what happened to my grandfather). At least he's well old enough to make that decision on his own. A week old infant has no choice in the matter.",

   "I mutilated my dog as well. He looks much better.\n \n here you go:\n http://www.propenis.com/foreskin.htm\n \n additionally:\n \n Reversal of circumcision \n \n Q. I was circumcised as a baby but now I want to re-grow my foreskin. Is this possible? \n \n A. You are not alone in wanting the circumcision reversed. Requests for foreskin reconstruction, as it is called, is not at all uncommon, especially in America where very many more babies are circumcised than in the UK. There are two main reasons for men to request foreskin reconstruction, one physical the other psychological. On the physical side, following circumcision the glans of the penis may become less sensitive and a man may want foreskin reconstruction to reverse this. Although increased sensitivity of the glans has been reported following foreskin reconstruction, I am not at all sure whether this occurs in all men who have this procedure. On the psychological front, some men who were circumcised when infants feel hey were mutilated without their consent and develop a feelings of resentment and frustration. They feel their body is incomplete and that their penis may not be so attractive to a partner. They may become fixated on such feelings, which become intrusive on their daily life.\n \n Foreskin reconstruction is possible. It is accomplished either by skin grafting undertaken by a plastic surgeon or by a process known as tissue expansion in which the skin covering the shaft of the penis is progressively stretched over the glans. Tissue expansion is a slow process, involving hanging small weights on the skin and takes between 2 and 4 years to accomplish. \n \n The first step would be to discuss the problem with your doctor who may refer you, in the first instance, to a psychiatrist with a special interest in body image problems or to a urologist.",

He looks much better.\n \n here you go:\n http://www.propenis.com/foreskin.htm\n \n additionally:\n \n Reversal of circumcision \n\n Yes, I've seen many methods of foreskin \"restoration.\" They either include more cutting or streching of the existing shaft skin over the head of the penis. Neither are the same as being left intact. There are certain types of nerve cells and mucosal cells that can never be regrown or grafted back onto the penis.\n \n \n \n \n \nQ. I was circumcised as a baby but now I want to re-grow my foreskin. Is this possible? \n \n A. You are not alone in wanting the circumcision reversed. Requests for foreskin reconstruction, as it is called, is not at all uncommon, especially in America where very many more babies are circumcised than in the UK. There are two main reasons for men to request foreskin reconstruction, one physical the other psychological. On the physical side, following circumcision the glans of the penis may become less sensitive and a man may want foreskin reconstruction to reverse this. Although increased sensitivity of the glans has been reported following foreskin reconstruction, I am not at all sure whether this occurs in all men who have this procedure. On the psychological front, some men who were circumcised when infants feel hey were mutilated without their consent and develop a feelings of resentment and frustration. They feel their body is incomplete and that their penis may not be so attractive to a partner. They may become fixated on such feelings, which become intrusive on their daily life.\n\n I don't feel like I've been humiliated nor do I feel like my penis won't be attractive. It's the part about not having a body part that I should and having no say in the matter.\n \n \n \nForeskin reconstruction is possible. It is accomplished either by skin grafting undertaken by a plastic surgeon or by a process known as tissue expansion in which the skin covering the shaft of the penis is progressively stretched over the glans. Tissue expansion is a slow process, involving hanging small weights on the skin and takes between 2 and 4 years to accomplish. \n \n The first step would be to discuss the problem with your doctor who may refer you, in the first instance, to a psychiatrist with a special interest in body image problems or to a urologist.\n\n I shouldn't have to hang weights from my penis for 2 years or have more penis slicing to attempt to regain a foreskin. It wouldn't be a real foreskin anyway. There are special nerve and skin cells that are in a foreskin that are not in the shaft skin. All foreskin \"restoration\" does is put non-foreskin skin over the glans. This would lead to increased sensitivity in the glans, but that's not really the point. There are entire sensations that are not possible in a circumcized (even a restored one) penis.",

   "Sorry for providing too much info about my hygiene habits, but that's the nature of this thread, I guess...\n \n Yes, this is pure grist, literally.\n \n I would sit here and debunk their debunking point by point but let me just attack the weakest points.\n \n \nAllegation 8: Male circumcision is basically the same as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).\n \n Male circumcision and female genital mutilation (sometimes also incorrectly called \"female circumcision\") are two completely different procedures. Circumcision of males, except if done for religious reasons, is considered by most people as a prophylactic (health) procedure. FGM - by its nature - usually results in the mutilation of the female sexual organ, which makes it very hard for the person involved to experience any sexual pleasure [7]. The equivalent of FGM in males would amount to the complete amputation of the penis. \n\n First they just say that removal of penis parts is a different procedure from removal of vagina parts. Well, DERp! Then they say the reason it's different is because people's perceptions of the two are different. I'll agree with that. That's about the only difference. Then they say that FGM shouldn't be called circumcision because that's the word used for MGM. I agree that the more extreme forms of FGM mutilates the vagina to the point that sexual pleasure is almost non-existent. How would the girl know if it happened when she was an infant? What if she has 1/3 of the feeling like a circumcized male. They also try to make you believe that all FGM practiced in the world is the most extreme form, which is not the case. Most of it is comparable to common male circumcision.\n \n \n\n Allegation 3: Circumcision is a traumatic and painful experience for the newborn infant.\n \n The issue of how much pain infants experience during circumcision is a very controversial and hotly debated subject [1], [2]. Even though it is nowadays generally agreed that newborns experience pain more intensely than was previously thought, there are still those who regard the potentials dangers involved in administering anesthesia to newborns to outweigh the benefits [3].\n \n In the most recent report of the Task Force on Circumcision of the AAP, issued in March 1999, three forms of pain relief was reviewed. The methods deemed most effective was the use of either a local anesthetic cream (applied about an hour before the procedure), or a subcutaneous ring block [18]. Alternative forms of analgesia like sugar coated pacifiers [4] or even a drop of alcohol (like wine, which is often used at Jewish circumcisions) have also been advocated for use in conjunction with the anesthetics named above.\n \n Regardless of what kind of pain relief is used, parents can ensure that the circumcision of their newborn is made as comfortable as possible by on the one hand being there to comfort him, and also by choosing a qualified operator to do the operation, which will minimize the time needed to do the operation.\n \n Circumcisions performed on newborns normally only take between 5 to 10 minutes. With the use of anesthesia and/or analgesia, the discomfort and pain to the infant can be almost totally eliminated. Under these conditions, the claim that circumcision is a \"traumatic\" experience is clearly false and misleading.\n \n Parents should also bear in mind that studies have shown that the crying observed in babies during circumcision is often not pain-related (if some kind of pain relief is used), but instead might be caused by the discomfort of being strapped into a circumstraint (the apparatus that is used to restrain the baby during circumcision). However, these days more gentler ways of constraining the baby during the operation are often used instead. \n\n Here is the AAP report (again, with highlights):\n http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/\n \n WARNING: Actual video of a child being circumcized without anesthesia.\n http://www.measurection.com/user-submittals/videos/babycirc.wmv\n (~37MB, with sound) \n I don't know if this is too much for this board, but here it is.\n I never watched it actually, I minimized it and listened to the audio.\n The screams of the baby made me not want to watch it at all.\n \n\n Allegation 2: Circumcision amounts to the \"amputation\" of a normal, functional body part.\n \n Calling circumcision an \"amputation\" is a deliberate exaggeration that is used to to frighten prospective parents or instill a feeling of dissatisfaction and loss in those who had been circumcised as infants (see also the discussion below). Circumcision amounts to the removal of between 20% - 50% of the foreskin depending on the method used. It can therefore in no way be described as an \"amputation\".\n \n The claim is sometimes made that a baby is born with a perfect body, and that the foreskin must therefore serve a purpose like protecting the glans of the penis. That might have been the case if humans were still walking around naked. The question why human males are still born with a foreskin can of course be asked. It should, however, be born in mind that human beings have only been wearing clothing of any sort for the last 10-20 thousand years. On the evolutionary time-scale this constitutes a very brief period - certainly too short to have given nature time enough to do away with the foreskin!\n \n Another significant - and interesting - fact is that the only human cultures to routinely wear no clothing are all uncircumcised: in many of these cultures, a male with an exposed glans is considered \"naked\", i.e. the foreskin acts as a kind of natural covering. Circumcision is therefore exclusively associated with clothed man.\n\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=amputation\n To cut off (a projecting body part), especially by surgery.\n \n The dung about clothed and unclothed man made me laugh.\n \n \n Allegation 7: Circumcision is to blame for many social and psychological problems in adult males.\n \n During the past 20 years or so various \"support\" groups for of men who were circumcised as infants have been formed. These groups claim that they believe that have been harmed by circumcision, that they feel psychologically damaged and mutilated by it and that their sex lives had been ruined by the lack of a foreskin.\n \n As discussed in a separate Section , it has been the aim of the anti-circumcision lobby to make - and support - these claims in order to further their cause of stopping circumcision. It is, after all, hard to get people to change their views about a subject if they are happy about it.\n \n The easiest - and most susceptible - targets for this propaganda are those men who - for whatever reason - are unhappy with their lives and/or with their bodies, and as a result suffer from low self-esteem. To these people, circumcision becomes an easy target - and a convenient scape goat - for all their problems [25] .\n\n This isn't debunking anything, but they don't have any scientific evidence that it doesn't affect the brain. I would think that we would need to know one way or another before chopping off foreskins for no good reason.\n \n I can't speak for everyone but even before I became anti-circumcision I had thought that uncircumcized penises felt something that I didn't feel and that perhaps there was something \"emotional\" tied to it as well. Not just the foreskin, I mean the feelings that you would have if you had a foreskin. \n \n I have nothing to back this up, it's just a hunch. \n It was a hunch, along with other things, led me to be anti-circumcision.\n \n\n Allegation 9: An uncircumcised penis can be kept sufficiently clean by proper washing.\n \n As \"cleanliness\" is very often mentioned in conjunction with circumcision, this subject has been a favorite target of the opponents of circumcision, who proclaim that the implication that men cannot be entrusted with maintaining their own penile hygiene is an insult to them.\n \n If humans only needed to use the bathroom once a day, there might at least be some truth in the statement that proper cleaning of the genital area once a day with soap and water is enough. However, since this is not the case, and most men moreover either don't have the opportunity, inclination or time to clean themselves every time after urinating - as is needed to ensure proper penile hygiene - the statement is clearly false.\n \n Most parents know how difficult it is to get their children to take a bath or shower every day. Even if they do get them to bathe regularly, parents often fail to instruct their children about proper personal hygiene or see to it that it is also carried out in practice. In uncircumcised boys the foreskin usually cannot be retracted until the age of around six. Cleaning the penis in this instance not only requires extra attention and effort, but becomes absolutely necessary since the non-retractable foreskin can very easily trap dirt, bacteria and germs which can lead to a variety of infections, which in infants and young boys can have serious consequences [22], [26].\n \n From the facts outlined above it is clear that personal hygiene in uncircumcised boys often leaves a lot to be desired. What is more, this situation does not improve in adolescent boys: a recent study of boys in Germany [8] has shown that penile hygiene actually worsens as boys grow older. The reason for this might lie in cultural attitudes towards personal hygiene: in many European societies bathing on a daily basis is not the norm. A recent article in Time Magazine [9] for example mentioned that only 47% of all French men and women bathe on a daily basis. Taking into account the fact that most males in Europe are uncircumcised, the scenario discussed above paints a pretty dire picture of (especially) male personal hygiene in those societies. Most people will probably agree that this is hardly an ideal to strive for. Most heterosexual women also have a preference for circumcised sexual partners (see discussion below).\n \n This is saying \"Uncircumcized penises can be kept clean by proper washing\" is a myth because people don't wash properly. What is it then? Does wahing keep the penis clean or doesn't it? Should we lob off fingers because the fingernails get dirty? If you keep your penis clean, what's the problem? Let's let American men decide what's best for their own penises and let's not mutilate it for them before they realize what's going on because French people don't bathe everyday.\n \n \n Allegation 10: The foreskin plays an integral part in facilitating intercourse and in experiencing sexual pleasure.\n \n The experience of pleasure during sexual intercourse by circumcised and uncircumcised men is totally different, and therefore not directly comparable. After circumcision the glans develops a thin but tough protective layer of skin cells. This so-called keratinization process results in a layer only 10 or so cells think - about as thick as Saran Wrap. This is not enough to to significantly alter sexual intercourse, but instead creates a barrier against viruses and pathogenic bacteria.\n \n Opponents of circumcision allege that this protective layer of skin on the glans makes it less sensitive. There is no proof of this statement - many men circumcised as adults claim that once the glans becomes moist (e.g. during sexual intercourse), it has nearly identical sensitivity with that of the uncircumcised penis [10].\n \n Many men have also reported that the foreskin, instead of \"facilitating\" sexual intercourse, actually hinders it [10] because the glans is covered for a lot of the time, thereby reducing the sensitivity experienced by both partners. Even though the exposed glans is less sensitive than in the uncircumcised case, the former regains a lot of its sensitivity when the glans becomes moist (due to the use of lubricants or naturally during intercourse). Also, contrary to the claim often repeated by the anti-circumcision lobby, the foreskin is not the only erogenous part of the penis! Another advantage of circumcision is that the glans becomes enlarged (since it is no longer restricted by the foreskin), which many women find sexually very stimulating. Taking into account the factors mentioned here, as well as the much improved hygienic state of the circumcised penis, it should come as no surprise that a survey of women demonstrated female sexual preference for circumcised men [11].\n \n A recent study by researchers from the University of Chicago, based on a survey of 1400 men, moreover indicated that circumcised men have more varied sex lives [12]. This finding should not be surprising: oral sex, for example, is more likely to be a cleaner and more enjoyable experience for women if their partner is circumcised. The facts mentioned here hardly support the premis that circumcised men suffer from reduced sexual pleasure.\n \n So much misinformation.\n They do admit that the foreskin is ERROGENOUS.\n Not for me!\n The bold part about the foreskin covering the glans contradicts another \n \"myth debunking\" that this page even links to.\n http://www.circinfo.com/myths/myths_and_lies1.html\n \nThe foreskin contains specialized nerve endings.\n All nerves are specialized. There is nothing more or less special about those in the foreskin compared with those elsewhere in the body. The glans also contains nerves which don't usually get fully stimulated when sex is experienced through the foreskin.\n\n The glans never gets fully stimulated through the keratinized layer either, and you can't pull that back.\n \n And I've never heard of the glans getting bigger just because the foreskin is gone. I have heard of the glans being pulled into weird positions because of the tighter skin around the penis after circumcision.\n \n \n Allegation 12: Circumcision amounts to the \"mutilation\" of a sexual organ.\n \n A well-known researcher has made the comment that \"comparing circumcision to amputation is akin to comparing a nose-job to decapitation merely because both events occur above the neck!\". It should also be clear from the previous discussions that this statement is utter nonsence. \n\n A nose job is elective. For a newborn, a circumcision is not elective.\n Also, the nose is not amputated in a nose job.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=mutilation\n 1. To deprive of a limb or an essential part; cripple.\n 2. To disfigure by damaging irreparably: mutilate a statue. See Synonyms at batter1.\n 3. To make imperfect by excising or altering parts.\n \n I'd say #3 is the tamest form so maybe that definition would be more palatable to this site.\n \n\n Allegation 13: Infant circumcision violates the (human) rights of the the child since it is done without his consent.\n \n From the day that a child is born until it is old enough to make its own decisions, it is the responsibility of the parents to look after the welfare of their child. This means making decisions that they believe will be in their child's best interest. If parents are convinced that circumcision will benefit their child, they have the legal and moral right to make this decision for him. This is, after all, what parenthood is all about [13]. In the light of this, some of the comments made by those opposed to the procedure (e.g. that infant circumcision \"is an atrocity and a fraud; that it's brutal, perverse, outrageous violation ...\") can only be described as being bizarre on the one hand and totally misguided on the other. Some even equate circumcision with child abuse. Comments like these are irresponsible, not only because they are totally false, but also because they trivialize real suffering and abuse. \n\n This is the biggest fallacy.\n I love their double standard with regard to FGM.\n If the parents are convinced that removing the labia or the clitoral hood were in the best interest of the child shouldn't they have every right to do it?\n \n Here is a list of some ways people trivialize FGM the way we trivialize MGM here:\n http://www.noharmm.org/trivial.htm\n \n \n\n Allegation 15: If my child is circumcised he will be teased by his peers.\n \n Since the circumcision rate in the US at present is conservatively estimated to be at least 60% (see below) just the opposite will be the case. It is a well-documented fact [10] that young uncircumcised boys get teased quite a lot when they are amongst their peers, most of whom are circumcised.\n \n Although the fear of being teased or made fun of should not be an overriding reason for parents to circumcise their newborn, they should certainly keep this fact in mind since it can cause psychological problems for their son when he grows up. There has even been a reported case where a boy circumcised himself (and had to be rushed to hospital) because he could no longer stand the ribbing and teasing inflicted on him by his peers [6].\n \n Parents should also take note of a recent internet survey of teenage boys which showed that uncircumcised boys are far less satisfied with their status than their circumcised peers [14]. \n\n In one breath they say \"Don't get your kid circumcized just to fit in.\"\n And in the rest they say how uncircumcized boys don't fit in, and that you should get your kid cricumcized so he will be more satisfied with his status. Basically they are saying, circumcize your kids because you want them to fit in (figuratively).\n \n Here's something else to put in the mill:\n http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/",

At 52 now, my foreskin is getting longer than my dangler, so now I am getting salty shoe tops before I realize the sun aint fully out :(",
