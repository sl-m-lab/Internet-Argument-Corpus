I used to come home from school, grab my gun and walk to the swamp to hunt ducks.

   "Hi, daewoo. \n In my state, I think 18 is the age to OWN a gun.[ 21 for a pistol - and you need the course & a permit] But to learn to shoot? If the parent is a hunter, most of the families I know take the kids out at 12-14. I know a kid cannot own a gun until later, but they can go out on a hunt with a licensed hunter. One friend took his son down south for some kind of deer we don't have here. Another went to Alaska for bear. Another is teaching his 12 year old how to handle a gun properly for whitetail, come next season. My husband taught the kids when in late teens, basically for the safety aspect - didn't want any accidents around here!",
