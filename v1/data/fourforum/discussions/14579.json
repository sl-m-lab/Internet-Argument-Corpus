   "More than 3,000 Mexican federal police fired, commissioner says - CNN.com\n \n \nMexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- About 3,200 Mexican federal police have been fired since May for failing to do their work or being linked to corruption, Federal Police Commissioner Facundo Rosas said Monday.\n \n Of those, 465 have been charged with crimes.\n \n In addition, Rosas said at a news conference, another 1,020 officers face disciplinary proceedings for failing confidence exams.\n \n The probe started in mid-May, said Marco Tulio Lopez of the federal police internal affairs department.\n \n \"Investigations of our department began many months ago and this is the result,\" federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas told CNN.\n \n Among the officers who were fired, Rosas said, were officials in Ciudad Juarez who were publicly accused by fellow officers of corruption several weeks ago. In that incident, two groups of officers shoved and fought each other outside police headquarters.\n \n The fired officers account for about 9 percent of the federal police force, which has about 34,500 officials.\n \n None of the dismissed officers will be allowed to be rehired on police forces at the local, state or federal levels, Rosas said.\n\n \n So what was that, about how America needs to change its gun laws to better reflect those in Mexico? Try telling the people that when there are stories such as this. Stories about corruption of the police force in Mexico, stories about the cops being paid off by the drug cartels and the like.",
