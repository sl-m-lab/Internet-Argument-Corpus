Most private schools in the USA are religious. These vouchers are not actually money so the government isn't really giving people money to help pay for going to these schools. It is a promise of money to which the school has to redeem them directly back to the government in order to get the actual payment.",

They have their own agendas and don't have to follow any set standards. Funding religion by the State violates the 1st amendment. There is a very good reason why public education was started in the first place. It was to ensure that all children get a balanced education. The reich-wing has always been against public education because they know that knowledge is power and it is more difficult to control a population which knows how to think for itself.",

My family wasn't. \n Now if vouchers paid for all classes but religion classes, that may straighten a few things out, and that may be a better option. Private schools usually have better teachers.
