   "First, we need to separate the issues here. Permissibility of late term abortion is not the same as permissibility of specific methods by which these are done.\n \n So, please leave the question of \"viable fetus\" and so on out of this question - it's a separate issue, possibly well worth debating, but the issues there cloud our minds on the issue at hand. \n \n Once we get past that point, we get to see the method itself. So, without considering the reasons for why the abortion is done, why is this method used? There are others, after all.\n \n The later in term an abortion is made, the larger the foetus, and the more complicated things become. The most troublesome part is the foetus' head. The technique is to minimize the stress to the mother's body by:\n -dilating and birthing as much of the foetus as possible normally\n -then, removing the brain from the foetus's head so that the head collapses and the foetus can be removed more easily.\n \n Compared to the other methods I've seen on the wiki, it's the method that is the least likely to harm the mother, that's why it's preferable to other methods. It doesn't even require hospitalization, especially as opposed to abdominal surgery.\n \n \n \n OK, now that we know what it is, I'd also add the following:\n -the vast majority of abortions are made much much earlier (see wiki page for statistics. This method is used in about 0.17% of cases - one in a thousand). \n -by the time this method is considered, a host of other, less dangerous and less painful methods could have been tried. As a result, this procedure is rarely used without serious medical indications. Mostly, the foetus is not expected to be viable.\n -the method is used in cases that are not actually abortions. For example, a dead foetus must be removed in some way, and this is a relatively harmless way of doing that compared to the alternatives.\n \n \n End comment:\n When a pregnancy goes wrong, everything about it goes gruesome. \"Partial birth\" is so singled out, but compare it to other methods, and you'll see they are just as gruesome. It's a gruesome method for doing something that has to be done gruesomely.",

One may argue for or against which procedure we should use or when in the pregnancy, if ever, they should be performed, but those are different and independent arguments. \n \n I agree, abortion is the killing and destruction of a fetus. It can get pretty icky, like many a surgical procedure. I personally don't see what difference it makes on which side of the birth canal you do it.\n \n I do see a difference about what period of pregnancy you do it. (But we shouldn't confuse this with the procedure we choose.) As the fetus becomes more likely to be viable, it is my opinion that we should apply more and more discretion. There may be legitimate indication for abortion when the fetus is potentially viable, for the sake of the mother's life, or horrendous and fatal birth defects like anencephaly, for examples. It all gets very tricky and should be decided on a case by case basis by mom and doc. One may rightfully disagree with this of course, including how much intervention of the state should be allowed. \n \n Perhaps I am hearing something that no one has really implied, but it seems like some folks are suggesting that abortion takes place on a perfectly healthy baby at term.

A mother decides she doesn't want to be a mother but she has waited past the first semester, she gets a partial abortion. I did my reading and I have found this to be the case. And there is no excuse for this behavior. Pro-choice people cannot reason that the baby didn't have a brain, and thus never really existed, because if that was the case, they would not have to suck out the brain so that the skull can cave in, so that they can pull the baby out of the mother.

   " A more barbaric way of killing a child is impossible to imagine\n\n \n I can think of one more way that even more barbaric - don't perform the abortion.\n \n You obviously have no clue as to what kind of fetuses receive these types of abortions. In reality, the fetus involved is often already brain-dead or otherwise hopelessly flawed, and the procedure protects the woman's health, including her ability to have children in the future. The procedure may also be used to remove a fetus that is already deceased, but they don't tell you that part in the anti-choice brochures. You should also know that the procedure is very, very rarely used. In-fact it's way less than 1%... not even 1/4th of 1%... even less than 1/8th of 1%, around only 0.14% - but they make it sound like it's a common proceedure. There are also some very good legitimate reasons for this form of abortion, one is called Hydrocephalus, but the anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about it either emoticon_rolleyes Hydrocephalus is when a fetus has abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain. The fetuses head may expand to a abnormally large radius of up to 250% of a normal skull at birth, making it impossible for it to pass through the cervix. Eventually the pregnant woman would die without this procedure. Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications. The anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about any of those facts either. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor (a non-physiological state) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when this procedure is used, it is NOT used on a normal fetus. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead. That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad emoticon_rolleyes",

   "First, we need to separate the issues here. Permissibility of late term abortion is not the same as permissibility of specific methods by which these are done.\n \n So, please leave the question of \"viable fetus\" and so on out of this question - it's a separate issue, possibly well worth debating, but the issues there cloud our minds on the issue at hand. \n \n Once we get past that point, we get to see the method itself. So, without considering the reasons for why the abortion is done, why is this method used? There are others, after all.\n \n The later in term an abortion is made, the larger the foetus, and the more complicated things become. The most troublesome part is the foetus' head. The technique is to minimize the stress to the mother's body by:\n -dilating and birthing as much of the foetus as possible normally\n -then, removing the brain from the foetus's head so that the head collapses and the foetus can be removed more easily.\n \n Compared to the other methods I've seen on the wiki, it's the method that is the least likely to harm the mother, that's why it's preferable to other methods. It doesn't even require hospitalization, especially as opposed to abdominal surgery.\n \n \n \n OK, now that we know what it is, I'd also add the following:\n -the vast majority of abortions are made much much earlier (see wiki page for statistics. This method is used in about 0.17% of cases - one in a thousand). \n -by the time this method is considered, a host of other, less dangerous and less painful methods could have been tried. As a result, this procedure is rarely used without serious medical indications. Mostly, the foetus is not expected to be viable.\n -the method is used in cases that are not actually abortions. For example, a dead foetus must be removed in some way, and this is a relatively harmless way of doing that compared to the alternatives.\n \n \n End comment:\n When a pregnancy goes wrong, everything about it goes gruesome. \"Partial birth\" is so singled out, but compare it to other methods, and you'll see they are just as gruesome. It's a gruesome method for doing something that has to be done gruesomely.\n\n \n Oh please, they collapse the head as to not harm the mother! Give me a break, the mother needs to feel the pain just as here child did. It is sick and wrong to abort a BABY at this stage. I myself see it wrong to abort a baby at any stage. What we have here, besides medical reasons is a selfish person that can not live up to her responsibilitys!",

I will not attempt to interfere with a woman's decision precisely because I DO believe that I don't know any woman's given situation. \n \n Christina, for some women, yes, it IS that difficult to wear condoms or take birth control. I know that a number of people are unable to take birth control because they have severe reactions and have the same problem with condoms. I also know that not all parents teach their children responsibility and that comprehensive and complete sex education would work wonders for everyone. If you aren't taught responsibility how can you claim it, after all? I also know that there are people who were conceived when their parents wore condoms, IUDs AND took birth control. So sometimes contraceptives fail.\n \n I also believe that taking away one of the most important rights (at the very least) a person has (i.e. in this case, bodily integrity) will affect all other rights, as well. I am saying that, in effect, the other rights would become hollow, especially in a woman's case, since bodily integrity plays an important part in the creation of women's rights and is the right upon which others certainly seem to hinge themselves.",

I dont think I could never have an abortion, at the same time i have only been pregnant once, in a happy relationship my son was very much wanted so abortion would never have crossed my mind.\n \n I think it is a very complex issue. To me , killing an unborn child because a woman ' isnt ready', is terrible. Everyone knows that all forms of contraception can fail , but me personally from when i first had sex, although i wasd young and would not liked to have fell pregnant and i was on the pill and used condoms, i knew there was still a chance of becoming pregnant and i was aware of that and therefore would have faced the consequences of my actions. \n \n I am at the beggining of midwife training so i therefore want to keep an open mind as i would never want to hate a woman for aborting a child as my opinions are my opinions nobody can say if they are right or wrong, and i would never know how hat women was feeling. I do however find it very hard to have an open mind on late abortions. I know of a baby who was born at 25 weeks and is now a lively, happy 2 year old. The idea of doctors working to save tthe life of a prem baby at 25 weeks in one room , whilst others are ending the life of a baby at the same gestation. I have also just read partial birth (?) and from what i have read ( i admit i do not know everything about this) i find it barbaric. \n \n Women are blessed with bodies that are able to create and nurture life - i dont see how they could throw that gift away. I know of girls who have had a few abortions, because they werent ready - i think it is terrible, but then again if they were banned altogether back street abortions would be on the up , which wwould no doubt end with women being seriously hurt. I also cannot agree when people say the baby/foetus isnt a life, would anyone dare say that to a woman who miscarried at the same gestation?\n \n I do however think abortions should be considered for rape victims, it would be nice if women decided o give up there babies for adoption rather than abort yea, but when a woman has been raped, fell pregnant through no fault of their own it is unfair to force her to carry and give birth to a child, adding to her trauma. I also think if a problem arises within pregnancy meaning the baby would have no quality of life, abortion may be the kindest option.\n \n I am 22, you may think too young to really know, maybee my opinions will change but i dont think it will ever be a straighht abortion is right or abortion is wrong, but everyone has their views and are entitled to them.\n \n x",

   "Well I am not a woman, and this is my first time to this particular debate, but here is my take on abortion. If having the baby could cost the mother her life, and if this information was made known early in the pregnancy, then I might support the abortion, but that is the only support I would give on abortion. But dont wait 7 months into the pregnancy to make the decision to abort the baby, if you wait that long you need to trust God with both your life and the life of the baby. Now for all you ladies who use the excuse that its your body and your right, if you dont want to get pregnant, dont have sex, or if you do, use protection. There is absolutely no justifiable excuse to murder a baby just because you arent ready to be a parent, and if you do, you are a murderer, plain and simple. Same goes for women who abort a baby just because it is not the gender you want, oh its not going to be a girl so I will kill it and try again later, and if that one turns out not to be a girl I will kill it to. Unborn babies are not a piece of trash to be discarded, period! That baby has the same right to life as you do, and weather you want to believe this or not, you will face God with the murder of that child, God says that if anyone should harm a child they would be better of to tie a millstone around their neck and jump in the deepest part of the ocean than face me on the day of judgement. If you choose not to believe anything about God, it still will not change the fact you will stand before him eventually. Taking precautions so you dont get pregnant is not hard, so 99% of women who choose to have an abortion are murderers. When I shoot my guns, I take precautions so nothing bad happens, but if I should choose to forgo those safety precautions, and someone gets killed, even though I did not intentually mean to kill that person, I have commited a murder because I could have prevented it from happening and didnt.",

Same goes for women who abort a baby just because it is not the gender you want, oh its not going to be a girl so I will kill it and try again later, and if that one turns out not to be a girl I will kill it to.\n\n \n The embryo is not a human being if it has no mental existence or self awareness, and therefore it is not murder. The embryo or fetus is just an empty body at this point in development.\n \n \n \nUnborn babies are not a piece of trash to be discarded, period! That baby has the same right to life as you do, and weather you want to believe this or not, you will face God with the murder of that child, God says that if anyone should harm a child they would be better of to tie a millstone around their neck and jump in the deepest part of the ocean than face me on the day of judgement.\n\n \n Um, actually no. The bible clearly condones the murder of babies, born and unborn. It also doesn't consider a fetus a \"person\".\n \n BTW \"unborn baby\" is an oxymoron.\n \n \n \nIf you choose not to believe anything about God, it still will not change the fact you will stand before him eventually. Taking precautions so you dont get pregnant is not hard, so 99% of women who choose to have an abortion are murderers.\n\n \n The christian God must exist for this to happen. I know you are so sure about his existence, however I am just as sure he does not, Muslims are just as sure that Allah exists, and Hindus are just as sure that Vishnu exists, and there is not one shred of evidence to support that one is better than the other. You can believe what you believe, however it is idiotic to force that view on someone else. Blind faith is stupidity, in my opinion.",

   "You are right I dont know her situation, and neither do you at the same time. A lot of these women have multiple abortions, and some clinics provide free abortions, is it really so hard to get up every morning and take a pill or use a condem? I do feel for those who are having an abortion for a medical reason, I am sure the pain they feel emotionally is very real for them, but at the same time everyone is always so worried about womens rights, and I agree a women should have te right to vote, own land and speak thier minds. I do not think we should be below the man, but I do however think that we should be accountable for our responsibilitys and pregnancy is one of those responsibilities. What if it were only legal for a women to have an abortion in certain cases such as rape or medicall reasons the nomber of abortions would drop dramatically and it may also incourage women to be a little more careful with thier bodies. Pregnancy is not the only consequence of having unsafe sex, we really need to educate our children and teens on all consequences of having sex. I prefer my children are abstinet untill marriage, and I try everyday to install those values into them. If my daughter should make a mistake and become pregnant she will take the responsibility of either raising it with my and my husbands help or adopting her child out to a good family, but under no circumstances will she beable to abort her child and go on with her marry life hanging with her friends and acting as if every thing is ok. Yes I may sound strict and cruel to some of you but my children take responsibilty for thier actions. More parents should be this way and thier would be a lot less irresponsible people in the world.emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Where are all your women who \"have multiple abortions\"?\n \n Why do they choose to have these \"multiple abortions\"?\n \n Give me some solid facts, more info on what you claim.",

   "hey shooter, I am not trying to force anything on anyone, I am just voicing my opinion and belief. Weather or not you choose to believe in God or not is your choice, but choosing to deny God does not change the fact that we will all stand before him eventually. I do not believe in the God muslims believe in because muslims believe if they murder innocent people there will be 72 virgins waiting in heaven for them, thus making the muslim god a hatefull, murderous, prejudice god. As far as a fetus not being a baby, just a shell as you put it, form the moment of conception the fetus has a soul given to it by God, and to kill it is murder. Let me ask any of you who dont believe in God a question. Why do we have laws in America that say murder is wrong, that theft is wrong, that we can have only one spouse, and we cant wed our own family members. Why is it morally wrong to lie, or to cheat on ones spouse, why do we feel guilty when we know we have done something wrong. Where did these laws come from, did someone just all the sudden stert telling everyone that this is how it is, that we must obey these laws and feel this way because I say so. No, these laws were enacted by God at the begining of mankind and have been with us all along, and we feel guilt over wrongs we do because God put a sence of right and wrong in all of us.",

   "hey shooter, I am not trying to force anything on anyone, I am just voicing my opinion and belief.\n\n \n So you are pro-choice?\n \n \nWeather or not you choose to believe in God or not is your choice, but choosing to deny God does not change the fact that we will all stand before him eventually.\n\n \n God must exist for this to happen. You may believe whatever you want, but that won't make it right. I could say \"Whether or not you choose to believe in the tooth fairy does not change the fact that she will give you money for lost teeth\". You are assuming that he exists, which there is no evidence to support. You must first at least offer a shred of proof before you start making assumptions like that.\n \n \n \nI do not believe in the God muslims believe in because muslims believe if they murder innocent people there will be 72 virgins waiting in heaven for them, thus making the muslim god a hatefull, murderous, prejudice god.\n\n \n And how is your god not just as evil? Your God will torture people for eternities for merely having a personal opinion. Both Gods are evil.\n \n \n \nAs far as a fetus not being a baby, just a shell as you put it, form the moment of conception the fetus has a soul given to it by God, and to kill it is murder.\n\n \n Your personal opinion. Science proves that the fetus does not have a mental existence, and all you can offer is your personal belief. Using the \"soul\" argument is as irrelevant as if I said \"Well, my God judahujadawa says that weeding your garden is murder, because weeds have souls\". You must first provide proof to make an argument even worth considering or debating.\n \n \nLet me ask any of you who dont believe in God a question. Why do we have laws in America that say murder is wrong, that theft is wrong, that we can have only one spouse, and we cant wed our own family members.\n\n \n Because no one wants to be murdered, no one wants stuff stolen, no one wants their husbands having two spouses, and wedding your own family members causes defects. This should've been taught in first grade.\n \n \n \nWhy is it morally wrong to lie, or to cheat on ones spouse, why do we feel guilty when we know we have done something wrong.\n\n \n It is morally wrong to lie because no one wants to be lied to. Same with cheating on one's spouse. We feel guilty because of our conscience. Its basic evolutionary survival. We were given a conscience in order to prevent us from doing bad things to other members of our species.\n \n \n \nWhere did these laws come from, did someone just all the sudden stert telling everyone that this is how it is, that we must obey these laws and feel this way because I say so. No, these laws were enacted by God at the begining of mankind and have been with us all along, and we feel guilt over wrongs we do because God put a sence of right and wrong in all of us.\n\n \n Actually they were enacted by the tooth fairy.",

   "Well shooter, it must be sad being you, believing in absolutely nothing, looking forward to nothing when you die. As far as you being an atheist, you better hope you are right because you cant escape death no matter what you do, but I tell you what I will do, if you can prove to me with all your science that God aint real, I will take your opinion. What is science exhactly, a man made educated assumption. I guess since you dont acknowledge the existence of God, you also dont believe you have a soul, I mean after all proving one has a soul cannot be done. If I was in your shoes I would think long and hard about my belief system, because you never know when death will call you, could be 90 years from now, could be 30 seconds after you read this. Are you willing to risk eternity on just your opinion, when the possibility exist that God is real, which also means that heaven and hell are possibilities. Let me ask you this, nobody can prove that if you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger that you are going to die, it cant be proven until you do actually do it, but yet you still believe if you do it you will die, it could go either way. Why, if you did die right now, would God punish you because of your opinion, because God sends people like me to get you to accept a free pass into heaven by just giving your heart to Jesus, and if you refuse Jesus you then have nobody to blame but yourself, you had your chances. To not accept Jesus is certain eternal death. Get back to me when you can prove God doesnt exist.",

Especially since this \"God\" has provided mountains of evidence to suggest that many of his ideas are false. Right. Why didn't I think of that?\n \n \n \nLet me ask you this, nobody can prove that if you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger that you are going to die, it cant be proven until you do actually do it, but yet you still believe if you do it you will die, it could go either way.\n\n \n Yea, this makes tons of sense too. Are you feeling OK?\n \n \n \nWhy, if you did die right now, would God punish you because of your opinion, because God sends people like me to get you to accept a free pass into heaven by just giving your heart to Jesus, and if you refuse Jesus you then have nobody to blame but yourself, you had your chances. To not accept Jesus is certain eternal death. Get back to me when you can prove God doesnt exist.\n\n \n Actually, I have someone else to blame: God. He provided no evidence of himself, and would have us rely on blind faith and stupidity in order to spend an eternity in paradise.\n \n Do you think the God who created heaven and Earth cares about what kind of electrical impulses run through our tiny brains? When one opens his mind, he will see how ridiculous the idea of the judging and punishing God is, especially since judgment, reward, and punishment are all human emotions and characteristics. Why would an omnipotent God posses human characteristics? I would think that an all powerful God would possess a set of characteristics radically different than anything on earth.\n \n Furthermore, there are tons of religions, with not one shred of evidence to support one over the other. How can God expect you to find the right one? Eeny meeny miny mo? But remember, if you chose wrong its the fire pit for you.\n \n \"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use\" \n -Galileo",

   "Shooter, you make a lot of asumptions about God, and they are just that. Have you ever even done one shred of research on the bible, not any bible, just the King James version. I watched a show the other day on the history channel, and they were comparing different faiths of the world, as well as the KJV Bible, Koran, and others. They researched what the writings in each of these books predicted and how many of the predictions actually came to pass. Of all the books, the KJV bible was the only one that was documented by historians as being accurate. A lot of what the KJV bible predicts has not happened, but that is only because they are future predictions. It says in the bible that one day some people will take a mark in their hands or forehead, the bible calls this the mark of the beast.
