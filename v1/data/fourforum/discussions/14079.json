   "Anti-choicers don't give two whits about life, or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus. This story is a good example of that. I bet a lot of so-called \"pro-lifers\" would support this court's decision, even though the mother posed no real threat, and she could have miscarried the fetus:\n \n \n\n Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman\n By GENE JOHNSON&#8232;ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER\n \n SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.\n \n Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.\n \n Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.\n \n The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.\n \n Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.\n \n But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.\n The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: \"It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.\"\n \n They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in \"touch\" mode rather than \"dart\" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.\n \n The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.\n \"Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,\" Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.\"\n \n The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it \"off the wall.\"\n \n \"I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense,\" she wrote.\n \n She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.\n \n Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.\n \n Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.\n \n Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.\n \n \"This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,\" he said.\n\n \n For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)\n \n This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.\n \n Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. \n \n They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.",

In fact, she wouldn't even go to the gun range for fear of the affect the sound of gunfire would have on the developing fetus. So I agree that it is inhumane for an innocent child to be subjected to the electric shock of a taser.\n \n I believe that the mother should be charged with an addition crime of child endangerment for being so irresponsible and inconsiderate of her unborn child to challenge the authority of 3 police officers while in that condition. It is the epitome of irresponsibility.

And to say because I am pro-life I would be ok with what happened is insane.\n \n However that bieng said I am currently 7 months pregnant and if in that situation would act as calmly as I could to not escilate a situation because it is My job to protect My baby not the cops or anyone else's. \n \n IMO is more of a pro-choice thing to me.

   " \n This woman is a jerk and feels so entitled because she's black,\n\n \n \nThis is a racist statement. Also unsurprising from the anti-choice/anti-life crowd. And their constellation of views.\n\n \n There is nothing racist about the truth. Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out. That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black. It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law, then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do. Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone, then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat. She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me, she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police. I'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it. This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her.\n \n \nIt's not about how she treated cops. It's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights. \n\n \n An American citizen with rights AND RESPONSIBILITIES!!! There is no right in the constitution that allows her to be a jerk who breaks the law with impunity and then refuses to cooperate with the cops who are responsible for public safety.\n \n \nAnd how would you know this Archie? Have you been stopped for speeding and asked to sign one?\n \n How fast were you going?\n \n Bet it was more than 35 mph!\n\n \n Actually, YES I HAVE! Not recently, but every time a cop has ever told me to sign a ticket he has made it clear that signing it isn't an admission of guilt, just an acknowledgment of receiving it. It is SOP for cops to say this with every ticket which requires a signature. And these cops said it to her also. She's either stupid or was looking for any lousy excuse to refuse to cooperate, and then justify her refusal to cooperate with them which is why the Court rejected her argument and threw out her case ala they upheld her conviction and nullified her attempt to unlawfully enrich herself over an issue which she caused herself. Only a knee jerk and emotionally bent liberal like you would defend a scavenger like her who will create any bogus issue possible to make an illegal buck from a fallacious claim.",

Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F.

Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.\"\n \n \nLOL.

   "Marie,\n \n This article has absolutely nothing to do with abortion. However, I believe the point you were trying to make was that the pro-lifers would agree with the courts decision because they want to control women. Your claim was completely unwarranted. They responded stating that though they agreed with the courts ruling their reasons were far different than the ones you claimed. Instead of defending your position you called them hypocritical racist cowards. Additionally you ignored the fact that Archie mentioned that he was Arab. Post-911 America has become increasingly anti-Arab. He may or may not have become a victim of this. But instead of empathizing you insult. This is completely childish and I urge you to present a legitimate response.\n \n As for my position on this I feel the officers were in the wrong. As presented in the article refusing to sign a ticket as not an arrestable offense and it is not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest thus the tasing was unwarranted. Pregnant or otherwise.\n \n The judge who was in favor of the police officers actions argued that that police officer's response was appropriate as the woman in her agitated state could have picked up her keys and driven erratically thus endangering herself and others. This is a fallicious position as there is no way to be certain that erratic behavior would be a result of the woman's agitation. Additionally, Driving While Agitated is not a criminal offense. If that were the case I'm sure we'd all be locked up.\n \n Whereas personal responsibility is concerned I agree that we as Americans have to take responsibilty in ensuring that we follow the laws of our land, both Federal and State. However, the woman's position was that she was not the one speeding and thus refused to sign the ticket as she feared it would be an admission of guilt. Even if, the ticket indicated that her signature was not an admission of guilt I could only assume that by her rejection she did not take the time to read it. Her ignorance of her rights as an individual are not a valid excuse for the police to respond with force. Quite the opposite, in fact it is a police officers duty to ensure that those suspected of a crime are aware of their rights. And even if the police officer explained that her signature was just a notification of her receipt of the ticket I can further assume that she was turning a deaf ear to the officer's pleads. Her behavior, however inappropriate, did not warrant a tasing. The woman is responsible for her actions and did nothing to help the situation but the police officer's response was excessive and inappropriate.\n \n There is nothing in the article to support that the police officer's response was fueled by racism. Is it possible that a white woman in the same situation would be treated differently? Yes. However, the existence of a corrupt and racist system does not prove that it was applied here.

   "I bet the anti-choicers would have no problem, either, with what the soldiers in this article did to pregnant women. I'll concede that there's some question as to who was involved, but notice that the general consensus is the responsibility of the soldiers involved, and, for the sake of argument, assuming as much, the two pregnant women in question:\n \n \nKABUL, Afghanistan - After initially denying involvement or any cover-up in the deaths of three Afghan women during a badly bungled American Special Operations assault in February, the American-led military command in Kabul admitted late on Sunday that its forces had, in fact, killed the women during the nighttime raid.\n \n The admission immediately raised questions about what really happened during the Feb. 12 operation - and what falsehoods followed - including a new report that Special Operations forces dug bullets out of the bodies of the women to hide the true nature of their deaths.\n \n A NATO official also said Sunday in an interview that an Afghan-led team of investigators had found signs of evidence tampering at the scene, including the removal of bullets from walls near where the women were killed.\n \n The disclosure could not come at a worse moment for the American military: NATO officials are struggling to contain fallout from a series of tirades against the foreign military presence by the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who has also railed against the killing of civilians by Western forces.\n \n Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, has tried hard, and with some success, to reduce civilian casualties through new rules that include restricting night raids and also bringing Special Operations forces under tighter control. But botched Special Operations attacks - which are blamed for a large proportion of the civilian deaths caused by NATO forces - continue to infuriate Afghans and create support for the Taliban.\n \n NATO military officials had already admitted killing two innocent civilians - a district prosecutor and local police chief - during the raid, on a home near Gardez in southeastern Afghanistan. The two men were shot to death when they came out of their home, armed with Kalashnikov rifles, to investigate.\n \n Three women also died that night at the same home: One was a pregnant mother of 10 and another was a pregnant mother of six. NATO military officials had suggested that the women were actually stabbed to death - or had died by some other means - hours before the raid, an explanation that implied that family members or others at the home might have killed them.\n \n Survivors of the raid called that explanation a cover-up and insisted that American forces killed the women. Relatives and family friends said the bloody raid followed a party in honor of the birth of a grandson of the owner of the house.\n \n On Sunday night the American-led military command in Kabul issued a statement admitting that \"international forces\" were responsible for the deaths of the women. Officials have previously stated that American Special Operations forces and Afghan forces conducted the operation.\n \n The statement said that \"investigators could not conclusively determine how or when the women died, due to lack of forensic evidence\" but that they had nonetheless \"concluded that the women were accidentally killed as a result of the joint force firing at the men.\"\n \n \"We deeply regret the outcome of this operation, accept responsibility for our actions that night, and know that this loss will be felt forever by the families,\" said Brig. Gen. Eric Tremblay, a spokesman for the NATO command in Kabul.\n \n The admission was an abrupt about-face. In a statement soon after the raid, NATO had claimed that its raiding party had stumbled upon the \"bodies of three women who had been tied up, gagged and killed\" and hidden in a room in the house. Military officials had also said later that the bodies showed signs of puncture and slashing wounds from a knife, and that the women appeared to have been killed several hours before the raid.\n \n And in what would be a scandalous turn to the investigation, The Times of London reported Sunday night that Afghan investigators also determined that American forces not only killed the women but had also \"dug bullets out of their victims' bodies in the bloody aftermath\" and then \"washed the wounds with alcohol before lying to their superiors about what happened.\"\n \n A spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, Zemary Bashary, said that he did not have any information about the Afghan investigation, which he said remained unfinished.\n \n In an interview, a NATO official said the Afghan-led investigation team alerted American and NATO commanders that the inquiry had found signs of evidence tampering. A briefing was given by investigators to General McChrystal and other military officials in late March.\n \n \"There was evidence of tampering at the scene, walls being washed, bullets dug out of holes in the wall,\" the NATO official said, adding that investigators \"couldn't find bullets from the wounds in the body.\"\n \n The investigators, the official said, \"alluded to the fact that bullets were missing but did not discuss anything specific to that. Nothing pointed conclusively to the fact that our guys were the ones who tampered with the scene.\"\n \n However, given that Special Operations forces killed the women, it was not clear why anyone else would have a motivation to remove bullets from bodies or tamper with evidence at the scene. NATO officials have also rejected allegations that the killings were covered up. But it was not immediately clear on Sunday night how troops who shot the women and later examined their bodies would not have recognized that it was their bullets that killed them.\n \n Abdul Waheed Wafa contributed reporting.\n \n U.S. Admits Role in February Killing of Afghan Women - NYTimes.com\n \n\n \n Like the death penalty, assaulting 7 month old unborn children, not caring about the children after they're born, the so-called right-to-life movement, for the most part, again and again, shows that the fetus or the principle of life, is not at all what their prime motivations are based upon.",

   "Your claim was completely unwarranted. They responded stating that though they agreed with the courts ruling their reasons were far different than the ones you claimed.\n\n \n Just because people claim otherwise is not evidence that they are motivated otherwise.\n \n \nAdditionally you ignored the fact that Archie mentioned that he was Arab. \n\n \n I did no such thing; I addressed his \"mentioning\" head on. If he is Arab, as he claims, he is a racist Arab. Being non-white, as I stated, does not mean one is not racist.\n \n And, indeed, there is plenty of discussion today about racism within the Arab community. Take, for example, the case of the Arab newscaster who went on with a \"black-face\" and commentary on President Obama.\n \n \nPost-911 America has become increasingly anti-Arab. He may or may not have become a victim of this. But instead of empathizing you insult. This is completely childish and I urge you to present a legitimate response.\n\n \n I agree that Arabs are a victim of discrimination in post-911 America. But I don't think that has anything to do with the poster you are referencing. If anything, his views contribute to post-911 discrimination against Arabs in the U.S.\n \n Also, i don't accept at face value that he is even Arab. This is the internet.\n \n \nAs for my position on this I feel the officers were in the wrong. As presented in the article refusing to sign a ticket as not an arrestable offense and it is not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest thus the tasing was unwarranted. Pregnant or otherwise.\n \n The judge who was in favor of the police officers actions argued that that police officer's response was appropriate as the woman in her agitated state could have picked up her keys and driven erratically thus endangering herself and others. This is a fallicious position as there is no way to be certain that erratic behavior would be a result of the woman's agitation. Additionally, Driving While Agitated is not a criminal offense. If that were the case I'm sure we'd all be locked up.\n\n \n Good argument, IMO.\n \n \nWhereas personal responsibility is concerned I agree that we as Americans have to take responsibilty in ensuring that we follow the laws of our land, both Federal and State. However, the woman's position was that she was not the one speeding and thus refused to sign the ticket as she feared it would be an admission of guilt. Even if, the ticket indicated that her signature was not an admission of guilt I could only assume that by her rejection she did not take the time to read it. Her ignorance of her rights as an individual are not a valid excuse for the police to respond with force. Quite the opposite, in fact it is a police officers duty to ensure that those suspected of a crime are aware of their rights. And even if the police officer explained that her signature was just a notification of her receipt of the ticket I can further assume that she was turning a deaf ear to the officer's pleads. Her behavior, however inappropriate, did not warrant a tasing. The woman is responsible for her actions and did nothing to help the situation but the police officer's response was excessive and inappropriate.\n\n \n Again, good arguments, IMO, although I do not agree that her behavior necessarily did nothing to help the situation. She simply refused to sign the ticket. She exercised her rights as an American citizen, which includes the right to be foolhardy, whether she was being foolhardy or not. Which I can't say. I can say, that I don't appreciate having to sign all kinds of things either, and under coercion. It's my signature and I take it seriously. It means something when I put my signature down. \n \n Also, we cannot accept that the ticket states what Archie says, even though he's been repeatedly stopped for speeding at 85 mph on the freeways --- and I would bet he was going even faster -- because (1) he's a known liar, and (2) even if he was telling the truth, there may differences depending on what state or area you're in.\n \n Also, I would imagine it's quite normal to feel agitated if a police officer stops you. Even moreso, if the police officer is as agitated as this dude must have been, if he actually tasered a 7 month pregnant woman, with her little boy in the car no less, who was allegedly driving 35 mph in a school zone -- which is rather common at many schools -- which is not to excuse it -- but just to put the offense in perspective.\n \n I mean, if anyone was being an a-hole, it wasn't this woman. It was the police officer.\n \n \nThere is nothing in the article to support that the police officer's response was fueled by racism. Is it possible that a white woman in the same situation would be treated differently? Yes. However, the existence of a corrupt and racist system does not prove that it was applied here. I agree that the system described should not exist. But we cannot scream racism everytime a person of color is suspected in a criminal action.\n\n \n Rubbish. This is not \"screaming racism every time a person of color is suspected of a criminal action.\" More like denying racism even when it blaring full volume in the faces of those who observe.\n \n Indeed, if you look at my posts, I took the side of the police officer in the famous incident involving Henry Gates, who I am a fan of, nevertheless.\n \n The right, on the other hand, on this board, blindly takes one side only, every time.\n \n All of you remind me of the famous story of the people who closed their blinds in N.Y.C. when a woman was being raped outside, in plain view on the sidewalk, and screaming for help.\n \n If she were in her third trimester of pregnancy (with the foetus experiencing pain), and black, and being raped by a police officer, all the more reason for you to do so.\n \n I don't believe that one of you, with the exception of perhaps Winston (if his memories of the revolution weren't too traumatic), would stand up for what's right.\n \n Deal with it.",

   "Just because people claim otherwise is not evidence that they are motivated otherwise.\n\n \n True. But it is you who are accusing them. If they deny the accusation and you dismiss their denial you must provide them a means to prove otherwise. Right now you have your ideas about them. If there is no way for them to disuade you from your position and you give them no way to defend themselves. Your argument becomes moot as an undebateanle statemnt cannot be argued.\n \n \n \n \nI did no such thing; I addressed his \"mentioning\" head on. If he is Arab, as he claims, he is a racist Arab.

I was merely asking that when you respond make sure you discuss the merits of their argument as opposed to your assumptions about them.\n \n Additionally, I am aware that anyone can be racist not just whites.\n \n \nAgain, good arguments, IMO, although I do not agree that her behavior necessarily did nothing to help the situation.\n\n \n Non-compliance with law enforcement will never help the situation. With that said Idont believe that you should always do what your told. I'm simply illustrating the fact that resisting will always escalate the situatation. The end result of which, although unwarranted, was a result of her resistance. If she hadn't resisted I don't believe she would have been tazed. Again, I will reiterate that she had the right the way she did. But her actions didn't mitigate the situation. \n \n \nAlso, we cannot accept that the ticket states what Archie says, even though he's been repeatedly stopped for speeding at 85 mph on the freeways --- and I would bet he was going even faster -- because (1) he's a known liar, and (2) even if he was telling the truth, there may differences depending on what state or area you're in.\n\n \n I don't know much about Archie as I am new to this forum.

This is not \"screaming racism every time a person of color is suspected of a criminal action.\" More like denying racism even when it blaring full volume in the faces of those who observe.\n\n \n I just do not see the racism you claim we deny. Yes, the woman was black. Yes, the cop was white. But there is nothing in the article that suggests his actions were motivated by race. It easily could be that he is just an a-hole as you so eloquently phrased \n \n \nAll of you remind me of the famous story of the people who closed their blinds in N.Y.C. when a woman was being raped outside, in plain view on the sidewalk, and screaming for help.\n \n I don't believe that one of you, with the exception of perhaps Winston (if his memories of the revolution weren't too traumatic), would stand up for what's right.\n\n \n I really hope you are not including me in this group. You don't know me well enough to accuse me of such things. If witnessed this I would be calling the police explaining how I bludgeoned a guy to death with a bat. I grew up with a single mother and I honor and respect the strength of women. As a human and a man I feel that it is my duty to protect and serve. \n \n \nIf she were in her third trimester of pregnancy (with the foetus experiencing pain), and black, and being raped by a police officer, all the more reason for you to do so.\n\n \n Here you are generalizing and you do not support your accusation.",

   "This article has absolutely nothing to do with abortion. However, I believe the point you were trying to make was that the pro-lifers would agree with the courts decision because they want to control women. Your claim was completely unwarranted. They responded stating that though they agreed with the courts ruling their reasons were far different than the ones you claimed. Instead of defending your position you called them hypocritical racist cowards. Additionally you ignored the fact that Archie mentioned that he was Arab. Post-911 America has become increasingly anti-Arab. He may or may not have become a victim of this. But instead of empathizing you insult. This is completely childish and I urge you to present a legitimate response.\n \n As for my position on this I feel the officers were in the wrong. As presented in the article refusing to sign a ticket as not an arrestable offense and it is not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest thus the tasing was unwarranted. Pregnant or otherwise.\n \n The judge who was in favor of the police officers actions argued that that police officer's response was appropriate as the woman in her agitated state could have picked up her keys and driven erratically thus endangering herself and others. This is a fallicious position as there is no way to be certain that erratic behavior would be a result of the woman's agitation. Additionally, Driving While Agitated is not a criminal offense. If that were the case I'm sure we'd all be locked up.\n \n Whereas personal responsibility is concerned I agree that we as Americans have to take responsibilty in ensuring that we follow the laws of our land, both Federal and State. However, the woman's position was that she was not the one speeding and thus refused to sign the ticket as she feared it would be an admission of guilt. Even if, the ticket indicated that her signature was not an admission of guilt I could only assume that by her rejection she did not take the time to read it. Her ignorance of her rights as an individual are not a valid excuse for the police to respond with force. Quite the opposite, in fact it is a police officers duty to ensure that those suspected of a crime are aware of their rights. And even if the police officer explained that her signature was just a notification of her receipt of the ticket I can further assume that she was turning a deaf ear to the officer's pleads. Her behavior, however inappropriate, did not warrant a tasing. The woman is responsible for her actions and did nothing to help the situation but the police officer's response was excessive and inappropriate.\n \n There is nothing in the article to support that the police officer's response was fueled by racism. Is it possible that a white woman in the same situation would be treated differently? Yes. However, the existence of a corrupt and racist system does not prove that it was applied here. I agree that the system described should not exist. But we cannot scream racism everytime a person of color is suspected in a criminal action.",

   "Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman\n By GENE JOHNSON&#8232;ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER\n \n SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.\n \n Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.\n \n Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.\n \n The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.\n \n Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.\n \n But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.\n The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: \"It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.\"\n \n They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in \"touch\" mode rather than \"dart\" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.\n \n The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.\n \"Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,\" Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.\"\n \n The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it \"off the wall.\"\n \n \"I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense,\" she wrote.\n \n She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.\n \n Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.\n \n Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.\n \n Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.\n \n \"This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,\" he said. \n\n \n One wonders if there wasn't an element of racism involved.",

The smart way would be to comply with the police and then fight the procedural mistakes rather than physically resisting.\n Oh, and I really fail to see how Vietnam hasn't won the war... you couldn't even make a case that the victory was pyrrhic...\n\n \n Are you sure you read the entire article that was posted? \n \n The woman was pulled over for speeding. She didn't want to sign the ticket. That's not a crime. They were trying to arrest her. She refused and informed them she was pregnant. Resisting an illegal arrest is not a crime. \n \n There were 3 officers. They each tasered her. You mean to tell me 3 male officers can't easily subdue a pregnant woman and cuff her without using a taser? The taser was completely unnecessary. Their actions were completely unnecessary. \n \n Now I don't know all the details of the story, all I know is what was presented before me. And based off that alone, the only crime committed was speeding... not an arrestable offense.",
