OK Picks for 11/06/05\n \n Buffalo has a much needed bye this week. Hopefully they'll surge the way they did last year and finally make the post season.",

Did anyone see THE HIT Mike Brown laid on Detroit's Garcia last sunday??? Sweet Jesus!!! Was that OT interception a result of a lingering concussion???\n \n My prediction:\n \n BEARS 28 Saints 0 (maybe 3 pts. for the hurricane victims)",
