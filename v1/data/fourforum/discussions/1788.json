   "This issue has been flying around for quite some time, and has become quite controversial. I shifted the talk of evidence into this thread since, quite obviously, it was wading off topic of the previous thread. I shall make a few points, and provide questions. \n \n Dubiety has arisen from the meaning of the word \"evidence\". More specifically, between myself, Hank and Plotter. So really, this topic is mainly for them two. I will write out several points, constructing my side, and I would like to know where people disagree with me. \n \n (i) Words have meaning. Had they not had a meaning, they would not be used. This is common to all words of all dialects, even apparent nonsense words have some meaning. Some words (a small minority) are hard to affix a definition to. However, the vast majority of words have definitions. Agreed?\n (ii) If there is a debate between two persons, it is important that both parties have an adequate understanding of the words being used. Otherwise, they are meaningless. Agreed?\n (iii) The definitions and meanings of commonly used words are stored in a Dictionary. The meaning of a word is stored in a dictionary. Instead of creating a dictionary in every post, we are agreed on the words that we are using, since they are common and are stored in a dictionary. Agreed?\n (iv) Dictionary.com provides this definition for \"evidence\":\n \n ev\u0095i\u0095dence P Pronunciation Key ( v -d ns)\n n. \n A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=evidence\n \n This definition, I would say, is succinct and quite clear. There is little room for different interpretations. Someone adhering to the fundamental definition without interjecting their own subjective interpretation cannot be accused of \"interpreting it\" in their own way.\n \n (v) If I am to use this exact definition of the word, it should not be argued that the meaning of the word is \"being twisted\". \n (vi) It is really not for anyone here to changing the meaning of a word in the dictionary. \n (vii) If one does want to rather use another definition of a word, they shouldn't conclude that one other (who uses the dictionary as a source) is twisting the definition. \n (viii) Evidence is not the same as proof. \n (ix) There is a clear difference between poor and strong evidence. Poor evidence is not worth mentioning most of the time. However, strong evidence is. \"The Bible is right because it says it is\" is an example of a poor evidence. \"My name is Francis because that is what is said on my birth certificate\" is an example of strong evidence.\n \n Different societies might have lead persons to understand the meaning of a word differently, but the objective definition is stored in a dictionary. \n (x) If one is to use a different definition of a word in the dictionary they should either:\n (a) Make sure that there is common ground with their interlocutor on the meaning of a word. Provide their own definition for it. Or...\n (b) Cease using the word. \n \n Agreed?\n \n I would greatly appreciate if those, who wish to argue otherwise, answer each one of my points, with an appropriate argument backing up what they think. A plain statement, x, will not suffice. But rather, a statement, x because of y, is far better. Thank you.\n \n \n So what you are really saying is, if you can find anyone who used something to form a conclusion then it is evidence. So if it is helpful in one person forming some conclusion, then it must be evidence because of the way you interpret the definition.\n\n Yes, that is precisely correct. And, that is the definition of the word \"evidence\". \n \n In a debate forum like this, evidence is used to prove a point.\n\n That seems quite right. I would only alter it to:\n \n In a debate forum like this, evidence is used to [try] prove a point.\n \n Therefore it is assumed by most that you are using the concept of evidence as is used in a court, as something that is actually helpful to any reasonable person in forming a conclusion, not just something that ONE person says is helpful in forming their conclusion.\n\n If something is helpful to one person in forming a conclusion, then it is helpful in forming a conclusion, regardless of whether the rest of the world accepts it. Saying that someone is wrong because the majority or everyone else says otherwise is a logical fallacy; Argumentum ad numerum\n \n If you are going to say that the color blue is evidence for blue fairies because you can find one person that believes that, then the word has no meaning in the context of a debate.\n\n I'm sorry that you are finding it hard to accept, but that is the meaning of the word. The evidence of course, is incredibly poor, and no-one would change their mind. Such evidence is not worth stating and doesn't logically follow either, so it doesn't matter much.",
