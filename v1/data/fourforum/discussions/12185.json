   "-\n \n Notion of fast U.S. recovery falls flat at parley\n At annual meeting, economists see little chance recession will end in `09\n \n \n \nThe idea that the U.S. economy is going to recover in the next six months is given little credence at a gathering of top academic economists here over the weekend.\n \n A pickup sometime after June is still the Federal Reserve's quasi-official forecast. And leading institutional forecasters surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators are optimistic. \n \n But that forecast seemed woefully out of touch to many experts who spoke at the annual meeting of the American Economics Association. \n \n [SNIP]\n \n Despite all these efforts, the U.S. economy, hit by an oil shock, a credit crunch and the global downturn, seems to be on a steep slide. \n \n Some argue that the recession has just begun, despite the formal ruling by the business-cycle-dating committee that it began in December 2007. \n \n Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the recession began only in mid-September when Lehman Brothers collapsed. \n \n \"We are in a horrible mess. I believe it is very young and it is going to be long and deep,\" he said. \n Even in the first quarter of 2010, the economy will likely be weak enough to need macro stimulus, he said.\n \n Martin Feldstein, the prominent Harvard University economist, said there was no longer any basis for believing the recovery could start in the third quarter. \n \n \"I think we'll be lucky if by this time next year we see the economy hit the bottom and start turning up,\" Feldstein said. \n \n \"In terms of the level of activity, the end of 2009 is going to look lower than it is today,\" he said.\n \n \n -",

We are already seeing this mess feeding on itself and we are stuck in a self perpetuating downward spiral. What is going to stop it?? \n \n Every recession we have ever had basically boiled down to an inventory adjustment event. The current situation had nothing to do with an inventory adjustment, it is a debt re-assessment. We have only ever had one of those. We called it the great depression.\n \n I can not recall any time in the history of the planet earth that a credit bubble burst and a depression did not follow, and this dwarfs any other credit bubble in history.",

I'd say it is clear that government intervention helped prolong it. Some people say the government didn't do enough but this is just a false positive (basically). For example if go out and spend $800 billion twice a year for the next 5 years and after 5 years the economy gets better you will no doubt here that 8 trillion dollars is what it took to get the economy moving again and if we had only spent that money in the first place wouldn't suffer for 5 years. This is, of course, crazy because it assumes the money helped in the first place. No causation was actually found. \n \n Look for this to happen here in the US with the phrase \"well we can't do nothing!\" or \"we can't afford not to!\" as a justification.

Account seizures, paycheck garnishments, it is all on the table then.\n\n \n If Congress starts making policies that says they are going to adjust loans so people can pay them than you'd have to be an ##### not to foreclose. A simple example explains this...\n \n Say you have a townhouse complex consisting of 10 townhomes all of which are about the same and costing $250,000. At this point they are all worth the same. Now, say congress says \"hey, if you can't afford your loan we will adjust the mortgage down so you can pay it\". Two people in townhouse complex can't afford the payments and thus adjust the mortgage down to where they can pay it. Chances are good that you'd have to cut the thing probably by $50,000..at best. So now homes are only worth $200,000 for the entire complex since that is what the loan amount is for. If neighbor A is only paying $200,000 than neighbor B should do the same thing to get that deal. Now if Neighbor A just foreclosed instead, the price might very well go down to $200,000 when sold but neighbor B would not benefit from doing the same and thus worth the homes will generally fall inbetween 250 and 200. \n \n Chester thinks the mortgage adjustments are the best way to go...I find this to be a disaster policy.\n \n On the other hand you could do a mortgage adjustment that is so unappealing that only foreclosure people would do it just to have a roof. Basically with this you could force any gain to go to the bank when sold or have the ability to adjust up if the salary increases. Basically enslave the person to the home for years. All this accomplishes is making the neighbors mad for lower property values and the homeowner mad because he/she is stuck in a home. It could also have other bad side effects that I won't get into.\n \n In short, let people foreclose naturally.",

Too many banks are trying to sit on them because they know they wont get squat for them, but they are maintaining or securing them so they quickly degrade. IMO if a bank has not found a new occupant for a foreclosed home within 6 months the city or county that home is in should be required to sell it at a no-reserve sheriffs sale with the proceeds to go to the lender. \n \n That will drive prices down (which in all reality is just a matter of hastening the correction) and I think that counties and cities would use the law semi sparingly since they do not gain much by it, but it would also keep these foreclosed properties from becoming a blight on the neighborhood.",

It is not fair, but we cant have homeless families setting up shanty towns, either.\nI doubt this would work because bank is already bankrupt and now they got a loss on the property plus paying for 3-4 months of rent. This bill would end up back with the taxpayers. \n \n You'd be better off just not seizing anymore wages from the person going bankrupt and have them foreclose, have no home, and rent somewhere based on the salary they have. If they are unemployed and have no income than $2000 isn't going to change whether or not they can pay rent.\n \n \nI also think we need to do a MAJOR revamping of laws regarding what happens to these properties AFTER foreclosure. Too many banks are trying to sit on them because they know they wont get squat for them, but they are maintaining or securing them so they quickly degrade. IMO if a bank has not found a new occupant for a foreclosed home within 6 months the city or county that home is in should be required to sell it at a no-reserve sheriffs sale with the proceeds to go to the lender. \nThis might not work either because banks would just create a subsidiary that they would \"sell\" the house to that would treat them as investment properties much like you see with some people on a small scale now (buying up homes and fixing them up and selling them later). So nothing gets accomplished other than a circumvent of the law. The banks end up paying for sitting on them in the long run thanks to property taxes. \n \n I'd be ok with making a law that had property taxes double or triple on companies or persons that own 3 or more vacant homes...or something like that. This would accomplish the same thing you are trying to accomplish.\n \n \nThat will drive prices down (which in all reality is just a matter of hastening the correction) and I think that counties and cities would use the law semi sparingly since they do not gain much by it, but it would also keep these foreclosed properties from becoming a blight on the neighborhood.\nI like the property tax idea :) If you are paying $2,000 on taxes for a home and all of a sudden you owe another $4,000 a year than sitting on it is really killing you.",

   "What I would truly like to know is are there actual cases of \" a mexican day laborer who makes $7 an hour when he can get it should not be buying a $340,000 house.\"\n \n Did such a thing really occur?\n\n \n YES. It absolutely DID. It was not even that uncommon (though most of the houses were more in the 250-275K range). \n \n The loans that were being made were absolutely ludicrous. If you look at some of the \"sob stories\" the media has been putting up about people losing their homes it takes about 30 seconds to realize that those people never should habe HAD those loans. There was one on MSNBC the other day about a woman in California...a nurse...who had purchased 6 homes in the last 5 years with a total value of $1.47 million dollars...on a salary of $69,000 per year. She lived in one and rented all the rest with no positive cash flow. The problem came when home values started falling and rents started falling and she lost her tenants in one of the units. She had no cash reserves AT ALL so a single month with no rent payment put her out of the game for that location...then she started trying to shuffle money around and cover the shortage and put all the rest in arrears.\n \n A lot of those problems were, quite frankly, caused by the \"get rich with real estate\" charlatans you see on TV that advise people to buy homes, rent them for a marginal cash flow, and then refinance them every 4 years when the value increases. They actually call it \"harvesting equity\" and compare it to harvesting a crop. It works relatively well as long as property values are increasing and interest rates remain low. As soon as property values start decreasing or interest rates increase, which increases your debt service costs, or you hit an economic slowdown and you have to increase rents, you have a BIG PROBLEM.\n \n Overall the real problem in the housing market, what allowed the bubble to get so big, was that everybody became a mini real estate speculator. I have talked to DOZENS of real estate agents and not a single one of htem can recall making even one sale in the run up to the bubble bursting that was not at least partially speculative in nature. Even people who planned to live in the house were trying to get the biggest house they possibly could, even if it was more than they could actually afford, on the logic that the value WOULD increase and it would all be OK in the long run. \n \n That is INSANE. The strategy the nurse I cited above is not necessarily a bad one, but it is an EXTREMELY risky one. I very literally used it myself in the run up. I bought 23 houses in 2 different college towns and a \"corporate\" neighborhood (right next to the sprint campus in Kansas City) I rented them at zero cash flow for 3-5 years (depending on the purchase date) and then when we got to the point that cracks were beginnign to appear in the markets I dumped them all. Most of them had increased in value by 40-60%. I did not finance them with a mortgage, I took a cash loan and used a bunch of junk MBS paper that I was holding as cash collateral. The bonds paid 8.45%, but the loan only cost me 4.2% (because I posted a cash equivalent collateral). So, I still made money on the bonds (4.25%).\n \n The difference is that I made that investment because I understood how the market works and knew what to watch for. The nurse made it because she ordered a \"how to get rich in RE\" program from an infomercial for $39 that explained how to buy and get it financed, but did not mention that it was an incredibly risky strategy and you had to know when to get the hell out. \n \n Chester would argue that the nurse above somehow got screwed and the lender should not have made the loan or should not have been ABLE to make the loan. Frankly, I think he is DEAD wrong. I have not seen a SINGLE case where the people who took a mortgage did not understand the consequences of taking it. People who took the exploding arms KNEW that their rate would shoot through the roof along with their payments, they just thought they would either be able to refinance first or that they would be able to sell the house off and make a bunch of money.\n \n Where people got into trouble is that they did not understand how to asses the risk they were taking or did not bother at all because they were optimistic that everything would be OK. It is the bankers job to asses overall risk. IT is the borrowers job to asses personal risk. What happens if you cant refi? What happens if you dotn get that promotion you were counting on? What happens if you lose your job? Those are the kind of thing the BORROWER has to consider, not the lender. The lender pretty much has to take the borrowers word for it. \n \n I will be the first to agree that WAY too many americans were taking out risky loans, but that is THEIR fault, not their lenders. Risk is part of business. I have literally had an accountant that I knew for years look me in the eye and ask me if I had a drug problem because he realized that I had leveraged and awful lot of money at 700:1 to make a combination currency/junk bond trade that in his estimation was so incredibly risky that I would have to have been high to do it. IT paid off nicely in the end.\n \n Risk is part of business. Most americans are just too stupid to understand what is a good risk and what is not. It is not that they dont understand the consequences of their mortgage, it is that they were too dumb to properly accounr for the risk.\n \n What those people who are calmoring to keep these people in these homes are missing is that in reality that is the worst possible thing for them. Tying somebody to a house they cannot afford and should not be in does not help them, it turns them into virtual slaves. The FAR better option would be to let the foreclosures go through, or force mortgage companies accept a deed in liu of foreclosure (which streamlines the process) get those properties sold, which will depress prices significantly. 3-4 years after a foreclosure you qualify for an FHA loan, so those people can rent for 3-4 years, do some credit repair, and then go back and buy the same house for half the price. Over the life of the loan that will save them literally HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars. Let the lenders eat the loss as opposed to forcing the homeowners into indentured servitude over it.",

The problem is that we have programs in place to help pay rents for those who need it, but often people are unable to participate because they cannot afford the move in cost (security deposit, etc...). \n \n I would support something like that for the same reason I am a strong supporter of the food stamps problem. It is cheaper to feed people than to fight them. You put enough families out on the street and eventually they react. \n \n\n This might not work either because banks would just create a subsidiary that they would \"sell\" the house to that would treat them as investment properties much like you see with some people on a small scale now (buying up homes and fixing them up and selling them later). So nothing gets accomplished other than a circumvent of the law.

Up until the 1920's you could literally move into an abandoned house and as soon as you could show residency, you could file a claim for a deed and it became yours. That is a DRASTIC departure from todays understanding of property rights, but it is actually a more efficient method of making land and property productive than the market is. Our liberal views on land rights is one of the things that allowed America to grow as quickly as it did in the early years....you either used it or somebody who WOULD use it did. The saying \"possession is 9/10ths of the law\" is a saying that goes back to land rights in the 19th century in America. If the other guy had a deed, but you had a crop in, it was yours and screw his deed. That allowed us to get HUGE amounts of land into production very quickly. \n \n Letting houses rot and land sit idle because banks are not really equipped to get them on the market is an ENORMOUS waste of wealth. We are not just talking MONEY here. Destroying money is no big deal. We are talking the actual destruction of WEALTH, which is an unforgivable sin.",

Frankly I have been posting here long enough that people usually dont bother. I am not generally known for making statements that I cannot back up. Is simone requests it, I will take the time. \n \n You, on the other hand, are a different story. You constantly spew idiocy that you cannot back up. You have been asked several times to show us all this deceptive lending that has been going on and have yet to even give us an anecdotal example. Even in the big \"countrywide\" deceptive lending case nobody ever actually accused coutnrywide of any charges that could be considered deceptive lending by even the biggest stretch of the imagination...countrywide was essentially accused of giving \"unaffordable\" loans. People requested, applied for, and many cases committed fraud to get, loans they could not possibly afford based on the idea that the value of the home would increase. \n \n the turth of the matter is that NOBODY has managed to show that deceptive or predatory lending has been a problem. They can certainly show that FRAUD on the part of the BORROWER has been a problem, but not on the part of the lenders.\n \n I am interested to know what a chester approved world would look like. My brother in law recently went out and bought a new high def flat screen AND a new sound system to go with it. He spent about $1600. Then the blower in his furnace went out...a $600 repair that he does not have the money for because he has #### poor money management skills and that $1600 wiped out their savings and all their credit cards are maxed (I would guess they actually only had about $1000 in savings and the rest he put on plastic).\n \n It seems like in Chesters world he should have been counseled by the store to not buy the television and now the sales person who sold it to him should be doing time because he could not actually afford it.\n \n That is not the way the real world works. YOU are responsible for budgeting your OWN money. Your mother is not going to follow you around and tell you what is a good idea and what is not. Your mortgage lender is not going to tell you what is a good idea and what is not because frankly they DO NOT KNOW. What is a GREAT deal for one person can be a TERRIBLE deal for another, and only the person in question can make that determination. Interest only mortgages are GREAT wealth management tools for some people, and a guaranteed ticket to foreclosure for others. There is no way for you mortgage broker to know which it is for you because it depends on your wider cash flow strategy, which the mortgage company is not going to know. \n \n You are essentially arguing that the mortgage lender should be held responsible for things that they have no control over and cannot possibly be responsible for. \n \n Frankly your argument is childish.",
