   "The latest UN Report on Global warming now says that they are 90% sure that global warming is man-made. While I remain unconvinced, I am convinced that our government's energy policy is screwed up. Here's a good example of just how bad it is.\n \n \n\n Rules could end four dams, help salmon runs\n Utility will have to install fish ladders or remove Klamath River damsBy Jeff Barnard \n AP Environmental Writer \n Updated: 8:54 a.m. PT Jan 31, 2007 \n GRANTS PASS, Ore. - PacifiCorp must build new fish ladders and make other modifications so salmon can swim freely past four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River if it wants a new license to produce electricity, federal fisheries agencies said Tuesday.\n The ladders, turbine screens and fish bypasses are estimated to cost about $300 million and will be requirements of any new operating license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, boosting pressure on the utility to remove the dams as a cheaper alternative.\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16903934/\n \n\n \n In its infinite wisdom, the FERC would rather shut down 4 clean sources of electricity than risk a few salmon not being able to breed. Unf@#$ing believable!",

It was a huge mistake to stop the building of nuclear power stations for power production.\n\n \n I absolutely agree. Nuclear power is the cleanest source of energy able to be exploited to a great degree. Wind, solar, hydroelectric, etc., all all niche energy sources that can't handle all of the country's needs.
