Many Christian Republicans don't like that and are fighting to overturn that ruling. Recently one Supreme Court justice resigned and one more is expected to resign soon. \n \n The way we appoint people to the Supreme Court is that the president appoints the justice and Congress has to affirm the nomination. The current president along with other Republicans want abortion to be illegal all the time unless the mother's life is in danger while the Democrats want it just the way it is. The question here is about whether people would support having a Supreme court justice appointed that was personally against abortion but wasn't sure how they would rule legally.\n \n if you need more clarification I would be happy to answer any questions.",
