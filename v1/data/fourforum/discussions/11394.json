   "Just returned from seeing Mamma Mia! I laughed and cried for nearly 2 hours. The audience responded well to the high-energy ABBA songs. As I exited the theater, some girls were in a circle singing Dancing Queen. I may go to a karaoke bar tonight and sing it myself. Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan were great. I understand now why Streep is called a great actress. She has told Benny and Bjorn that she wants a part in Kristina if and when it becomes a movie.",

   "Very fun movie. The end credits alone were worth the price of admission. \n \n Meryl is always an awesome actress - but if you really want to see it watch Sophie's Choice (she actuallu learned Polish for the role). Pierce Brosnan was painfully bad - can't sing, can't act and had ZERO chemistry with Meryl. I can think of several appropriate age actors who can actually sing (Adrian Zmed, John Travolta, John C Reilly, Brent Spiner, Jeff Conaway, John Bon Jovi, Paul Gross, Rick Springfield.....)\n \n The ladies were all awesome however - - especially Christine Baranski. I thought she stole the show.",
