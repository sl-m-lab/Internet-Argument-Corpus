   "I have gone to both public and private schools. The private school was religious, but so what. Anyway, I found that there are perks to both systems:\n Private Schools:\n Teacher can spend more time with each individual student.\n The class tends to move faster because it can only go as fast as the bottom 25% (there are less of those in smaller classes)\n Closer relationships with peers.\n Discipline is fairly high, shaping kids into model students.\n Higher test scores because of education.\n There are probably some others that I'm missing, but those are the ones right off the top of my head.\n \n Public Schools:\n Exposure to a greater range of views from classmates.\n More subjects are generally taught, along with some more advanced ones.\n Low discipline means that each person must regulate themselves.\n You tend to get noticed more by colleges.\n \n There are some bad things about each system too, but I'll leave that up to someone else unless you really need a lot of help on the issue.",

The students were more interesting to be around becaues they were continually being taught to think for themselves, the teachers were more friendly with the students (yes, even if you WEREN'T in sports), and it offered more challenging courses.\n \n Public seemed to drive the love to learn out of me. I didn't think ANYTHING was capable of that. I was wrong.\n \n On the whole, I think private schools are better, simply because you're taught to think critically, rather than memorizing what the teacher tells you, then believeing it.

The outer kids would tease him, and the teacher would do nothing but join in.\n \n At Christmas break we pulled out older son out of school and home schooled him for a semester. Now we pay a lot on money for both of the kids to go to school where they care about the kids. They are reasonable about the work. When he finishes, he can get up and get a book off the rack in the room and read at hi desk. If kids tease him the school try's to correct them, and they all are taught to treat outers, as they want to be treated.\n \n Hands down privet is better!!!!!\n \n I will end here, but if you want my views on special Ed, just let me know, and clear some time to read and I will tell you what it did to me.\n \n Ps I know that the witch I dealt with is the exception, but it was MY kid she was messing with.",

I have a chemistry teacher that curses all the time. He's funny and down too earth. Also ive been to a public school before and i have had the \"real life\" experiance. But i chose a private school not because i want to get away from all of that. I just wanted a smaller school. Thats all, because if i stayed in a public school then i would be no one. our public school had around 1,712 kids in the 11th grade. they had to separate the school to two complete diffrent buildings. all together there are around 5,230 kids. wow...somtimes I have consentration problems(and no, not the ADD or ADHD type), so i somtimes need to be engaged for me to consentrate.

(man i feel sorry for the kids that wear them because they are Really ugly) my school doesn't. My school actually thinks that having unforms is violating a person's right to expression. (to some extent at least) Also all the kids in my school think that real life only existed in books or movies. They are well aware of whats going on in the real world.\n \nbut i'm observing and interacting with kids of all ethnic backrounds, with all different sorts of intelligence levels, religions, monetary situations, etc.\n\n We have all diffrent types of kids going to our school. We have muslims, jews, christains, athiests, etc. And we have a wide diversity of teachers too. My history teacher was a navy seal and then was promoted to be one of the secondary commander of a aircraft carrier. And he really makes us learn about the \"real world\" we probably learned more about religion, economics, politics, and history than what any public school can offer. And yes we have kids who are in a lower and upper class in finance than me. The school has a scholarship program that can make it so the people who have bad \"monetary situations\" can go to a private school. And there are many who take the school up on that offer. We have kids coming from the worst places from chicago to the richest people in the suburbs. Also we have diffrent ethnic groups. From caucasian kids, to black kids, to asian kids, to hispanic kids. You cannot say that we do not have diversity in private schools without actually experiencing it for yourself.\n \n Will a private school student be comfortable with a drug dealer or a mentally retarded person?\n\n Yes, because it happens in private schools too. We are faced with drugs and alcohal everyday. Grweat example...(these people are complete XXXXXX) It was homcoming and my sophmore class decided to have a party (I didn't go because I was visiting my sister in College). Well Candice (a teengae girl who used to go to my school) decided to break into her old house and throw a party. (the new owners were going to move in in a couple of weeks) So some hours went by and everyone was horribly drinking. Well three kids (one including my best friend's sister) passed out from alcohal poisoning and drug abuse and one of them had a heart attack. His heart just stopped. So the ambulance came and the Emergency Medical Personel had to shock him (I forogot what thats called) to get his heart moving again. So now all three of them are being threatened for expultion. And this is just one example. People get caught with drugs. People steal. They cheat, they write hate letters. Someone went into a teachers purse and just took $200.\n \nMaybe-- but i wouldnt be if i had spent my years with people just like me...\n\n Now because of the things I just said, maybe, just maybe, that quote may not all be true.\n \nHowever, if a gifted child will not push themselves or be self-motivated to learn on their own, or parents do not want to or have to time to help, i suppose a private school would be the better situation.\n\n Do you really think (and im not saying i am the same) that some kid that does not like school would spend their money on eduational books and spend time on the internet looking up interesting facts online? and I dont think that a parent would waste their money on sending a child somwhere in which they do not care about. Like i said some kids go to private school to have a smaller enviroment. Some for other reasons...but that does not make up the fact that private schools are not as diverse or not as good as a public school. Because it isn't.\n \nI will note though, that my peers frustrate me exceedingly, and i spend a great deal of time online with teenagers more like me in intelligence and interests *shrug*\n\n You or I or most, maybe all who discuss (or even read) the discussions and debates here might.

   "I haven't read all the posts yet but I will. I would like to respond to the original question before I get into the debate about it.\n \n I went to a private school (not religious, Montessori) preschool through 8th grade. It cost about $8,000 per year in tuition. I am currently in 10th grade, my second year in public schools.\n \n Since it was a Montessori school the way it worked was that we all worked independantly on stuff we had previously been taught in \"lessons\" taught by the one teacher for all subjects in groups of 3 or 4 students. Through grade 6, we had no grades and no tests. So without the fear that we would actually have to pass a test with the subject on it we actually had a love of learning. We didn't learn because we were forced to, we learned because it was fun to explore the topic. We would meet every 2 weeks with our teacher to establish a list of things to do independantly and look at how we did with last 2 weeks' goals.\n \n In 7th-8th grade it was closer to the trational public school but with many key changes. First of all there were only 25 people in 7th-8th grade. We would have blocks where the 7th graders would do one subject and the 8th grade the other, and then switch. The only tests we had were final exams at the end of the year, and we only had science, math, english, and history. We had a seperate French class taught by a teacher who only came to our school for our class and then left. We had a few tests and this was more traditional although there were only 5 people in the whole class. We sat around a table and the teacher taught and we had homework, tests, etc. But we were still encouraged to explore the topics because there were relatively few tests and the teachers had much more freedom in the curriculum because instead of having to teach to the tests, they could make the tests test what we learned. And we NEVER asked if anything would be on a test. That was considered a bad question because it's basically asking \"Do I actually have to know this?\" and of course we were encouraged to explore and learn as much as we could. The teachers were also very flexible because we had only 2 teachers (1 for science and math, 1 for english and history).\n \n \n Public schools\n They were much different than the private school. Instead of actually trying to make it interesting everyone only wanted to know:\n \n 1. If they actually had to know every single concept\n 2. when the test would be\n 3. what the test would be on\n \n It wasn't learning, it was studying and memorizing everything the night before, taking the test, and then forgetting it. People didn't learn here, they acheived, hence the Maryland public schools slogan \"acheivment matters most\". Of course this is total BS in my opinion. Schools should be focused on learning, not acheivment. All the teachers usually can't answer all people's questions related to the topic for fear of getting behind. Each teacher has about 200 kids all day and really doesn't know (on a personal level, of course they know our names) the kids. Public schools don't acheive the purpose of school, to get children to learn and enjoy learning.\n \n So in my opinion private school (at least mine) was WAY better than public school. I'll read the rest of the posts and comment as need may be.",

   "Where I live, I think the public schools are better. In public schools you can be casual and relax, and there are a lot of different levels of how hard a class is. Say you're bad at math but great at art, you can take advanced placement art and level three math. Also, you can interact with a wide variety of people and you don't have to be a big sports fan. The teachers act like human beings, and students sometimes end up being friends with some of them. Most of them are also willing to work with you outside of class. The students are mostly open minded and accepting of different people.\n \n In private schools around here you have uniforms and the rules are so strict you can't even learn normal human interaction at them. You have less choices on what classes you can take, and you are expected to like sports. The teachers seem more like machines, simply teaching you in a very regulated style. The students have been known to attack the unpopular kids, and the teachers don't care enough to do anything about it. However, from reading this forum I'm beginning to think that this is a very unusual situation.\n\n \n Sorry I just had to answer this. Not all private schools are strict and can't interact with the teacher. In 7th-8th grade our teacher took us mountain biking once a week, we'd hike in the woods (on school grounds). You are definately not expected to like sports. That I think was one of the downsides, no intermural sports (of course I play baseball and all other middle schools had was softball anyway, so...). The teachers definately were not like machines, they were interested in what you had to say and would do research outside of class to answer questions you had. They were far from teaching in a regulated style. And since we had 25 people in our class, we were pretty much all friends and there weren't popular and unpopular kids. And I agree that is an unusual situation.",

Our school is the poorest school in the county. I'm in the math/science magnet and they put it here because there are a bunch of black/minority kids (not being racist, but you know the type) who don't care about their education, don't care about anything, get into fights a lot, etc. and they want to raise the \"acheivment level\" of the high school.

I am an exchange student at an Australian Public School for a year, but until last year I attended the oldest Public School in England (established in the 1300's by William of Wykham,) and I can asure you that my family is not wealthy. My father died when I was eight, and while he left my mother and me provided for, we are not exactly rolling in the stuff.\n \n I am a fee paying boarder, but my school in England traditionally has a minimum of seventy 'bursary boys', who are known as 'scholars' and get special treatment despite the fact their parents pay no fees. (I think this is great, and makes a change from rich people getting preferential treatment! :) ) My English school also traditionally has the highest academic record in Britain.\n So, yah! boo! sucks! to Eton, Harrow and Rugby! :p \n \n I have never been to a comprehensive, so I cannot make any real comparisons, but I am told that the facilities and individual attention are not as good as at a public School.\n \n Also, forget about elitism and so on at Public Schools.

I attended a nationally recognized public high school that had incredible resources an teachers and I learned and experienced a ton - my best friend attended a private Catholic school that was not nearly as good. It varies from state to state, town to town and school to school. It depends on having the right amount of resources for the size of the student body and how much the teachers, parents and students put into it. I suggest checking out all your options - don't assume one is better than the other. There are two public high schools in my neighborhood. One is one of the best high schools in the metro area and I will be thrilled if my son attends.

Money-throwing isn't necessarily the problem with schools, it's the way it's utilized. Many schools **** away money; for example, my highschool and an extremly high benefit from county taxation--yet the assmonkies spent most of it on increased teacher salaries, a football yard, a new auditorium and a gym. Um? Priorities people? Some of my gawdaym classes didn't even have books! \n \n The way to fix the system is through the teachers and closer government watch on how they spend their money, as well as tougher curriculae. Big government needs to hit the administrations and teachers unions over the head with big sticks.\n \n \n \n There are also bad private schools. They aren't all the same. According to many studies, the voucher system has not shown good results. Not everyone will be able to get to go to private institutions, and the people who end up going to them will not want to pay for the imporvement of public education, sothe people who have to go to PUb-ed will be at a disadvantage. Privies will lose incentive to interact with the Public system. \n \n What public education needs is:\n \n 1. Breaking some of the powers of the Teachers unions as to not make it nigh-impossible to fire incompetent teachers\n 2. Stop wasting tax-money\n 3. Get a new curriculum based on utilitarian subjects: Logic, Science, Math, English (non-literature) and a mandatory language useful for communication. This should be the standard curriculum untill they reach college, which is fine.\n 4. Get rid of worthless extra-curricular activities. Highschool is for learning, not playing checkers or cheerleading.\n \n All Religious vouchers going to schools where it is shown that religious curriculae are in place should be banned, even after public education is fixed.\n \n All private schools should conform to the new standard of maths, hard sciences, linguistics, and logic/rhetoric.\n \n \n \n 4. Many existing private schools are unlikely to accommodate significant numbers of additional students in a privatized system.\n \n Chester E. Finn, Jr., who heads the Fordham Foundation, notes that it is generally hard to find private school leaders \"who want their schools to grow, to open additional campuses, to recruit more clients.\" Finn also recently admitted that \"there aren't enough private schools to go around\" for would-be voucher students. Indeed, a massive number of schools would have to be built to replace all or most of the 92,000 public schools operating across America.\n\n \n \n 5. Vouchers can lead to hastily created 'fly-by-night' private schools unable to provide children with a quality education.\n \n Concerns about quality are magnified by the fact that private and religious schools are not held accountable in the same manner as public schools. In fact, the CATO Institute's David Salisbury recently argued that private schools' ability to disregard state standards is \"the very basis for school choice.\"\n\n \n [quote] \n A report by the People For the American Way Foundation\n Executive Summary\n \n Today, governmental responsibilities in education and the strong connection that Americans have with their public schools are being put to a serious test. A network of Religious Right groups, free-market economists, ultraconservative columnists and others are using vouchers as a vehicle to achieve their ultimate goal of privatizing education. Their embrace of vouchers reflects their view that to be successful, privatization must be achieved incrementally. The long-term goal is to make all schooling an activity supplied by private sources: for-profit management companies, religious organizations and home schools. The movement believes that targeted voucher plans, such as those in Florida, Milwaukee and Cleveland, give them a foot in the door en route to achieving this goal. While many of those who want to privatize education choose their words very carefully, others are more candid about their goals. The Heartland Institute's Joseph Bast has urged others who share his group's extreme agenda to be patient. \"The complete privatization of schooling might be desirable, but this objective is politically impossible for the time being. Vouchers are a type of reform that is possible now, and would put us on the path to further privatization.\"\n \n 1. Vouchers are part of a broader strategy by some to privatize public schools.\n \n Joel Belz, publisher of World-a Religious Right magazine-wrote a column several years ago sympathizing with those who oppose vouchers because they don't want government to play any role in education. He wrote: \"If [supporting vouchers] helps bring down the statist system, which it will, it will be worth the temporary compromise.\"(emphasis added) Supporting vouchers now, Belz argued, would help pro-privatization groups in the long run \"gain a larger strategic advantage.\"\n \n 2. Voucher supporters are pushing their agenda from the highest levels.\n \n Privatization advocates have made a serious effort to bring about change, no longer from outside the system but from within the corridors of power. U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., after his appointment to the House education committee said, \"I think it's a lot easier to kill the beast when you get in the cave.\" Recently, the Bush Administration appointed Nina Shokraii Rees, a staunch voucher advocate, to head DOE's Office of Innovation and Improvement.\n \n 3. Many pro-privatization groups offer two messages: one for committed followers and another for the broader public.\n \n For example, the Florida-based James Madison Institute has stated that it \"believes that parents should have the freedom to make decisions in the best interests of their children.\" Most Americans, including those who strongly support public education, would likely agree with this vague statement. These words, of course, leave unmentioned the fact that the James Madison Institute's education policy director has signed a proclamation that calls for scrapping the public education system.\n \n some more bad stuff:\n \n \n \n\n 4. Many existing private schools are unlikely to accommodate significant numbers of additional students in a privatized system.\n \n Chester E. Finn, Jr., who heads the Fordham Foundation, notes that it is generally hard to find private school leaders \"who want their schools to grow, to open additional campuses, to recruit more clients.\" Finn also recently admitted that \"there aren't enough private schools to go around\" for would-be voucher students. Indeed, a massive number of schools would have to be built to replace all or most of the 92,000 public schools operating across America.\n\n \n \n\n 5. Vouchers can lead to hastily created 'fly-by-night' private schools unable to provide children with a quality education.\n \n Concerns about quality are magnified by the fact that private and religious schools are not held accountable in the same manner as public schools. In fact, the CATO Institute's David Salisbury recently argued that private schools' ability to disregard state standards is \"the very basis for school choice.\" \n\n \n \n \n\n 7. A privatized system of education could leave too many children behind.\n \n It is likely that a privatized education system will cater to those students who are believed to be easier or less expensive to educate. The Heritage Foundation has expressed hope that \"vouchers could limit how much taxpayers must pay to educate the disabled and begin a movement toward cost containment.\" A survey by the U.S. Department of Education of private schools in large inner-cities found that between 70 and 85 percent of schools would \"definitely or probably\" not be willing to participate in a voucher program if they were required to accept \"students with special needs such as learning disabilities, limited English proficiency or low achievement.\" Among religious schools, 86 percent expressed this same unwillingness to participate.\n\n \n Many don't want to participate and they will try to educate the people who are the easiest and cheapest! Profit motive at it's best! Business \"market\" education libertarianism.\n \n \n The public supports public education.\n \n In a national poll this year, Americans chose \"reforming the existing public school system\" over \"finding an alternative\" to the current system by a 69-to-27 percent margin. In last year's annual Phi Delta Kappa-Gallup poll on education, 71 percent of public school parents gave a grade of A or B to the school attended by their oldest child.\n\n \n Many people don't want vouchers.\n \n \n Across the country, space in many private schools-particularly the elite academies-is highly limited.  For a variety of reasons, many existing private schools are unlikely to expand to accommodate significant numbers of additional students in a privatized system. Many of these schools would fear the changes that an influx of new students from public schools would bring to their educational environment. Others might choose to retain highly selective admission standards\n\n \n People will be left out in the cold and there isn't enough space to accomodate them all.\n \n \n While religious schools are generally considered more willing to accommodate students than non-sectarian private schools, the evidence suggests that they, too, would turn away many students who now attend public schools. Catholic schools already reject a majority of their applicants.  In 2002, a Catholic school official in Cleveland stated that the city's Catholic schools \"often investigate students' backgrounds\" and consider academic and behavioral issues in deciding which students are accepted. \n\n \n Hmm not very good and reliable, as are several libertarian ideals ( like relying on charity for social security and welfare!)\n \n \n opening new schools is a time-consuming and expensive task and it's safe to assume that a reasonable share of these newly formed private schools would fail. Consider, for example, that during the first five years of the Milwaukee voucher program, nearly one out of four voucher schools closed its doors. Three voucher schools actually ceased operations during the course of the school year, disrupting the education of their students and forcing parents to scramble to find new schools\n\n \n Those vouchers are awesome! Voucher programs pose many problems.\n \n \n Even though Florida's McKay voucher program was specifically created for students with disabilities, the law is structured in a way that penalizes middle- and low-income parents who cannot afford to pay tuition or fees that typically exceed the voucher's face value. Additionally, participating private schools are not required to offer special education services and even those that do offer these services are not required-unlike public schools-to monitor students' progress.147\n\n \n Crouching Libertarian, Hidden cost. Can't pay extra expenditures get's ya penalized! No special education requirements (they are't unders state or federal control!) No requirement to moniter student progress...that seems safe.",

   " For many people, this is seen as an advantage. This prevents everyone in the school from getting corrupted from some pimp-ghetto **** that someone brings in.\n\n \n It's hardly equitable or an advantage, since it creates social disparity and ecourages it. It also means you are at the mercy of whomever they select or want or their special interests. It's been documented as happening, and nothing can be done, since it's 'private.' \n \n \n Do you have any explanation?\n\n \n Of what? Why this would happen? Why it's bad? What we should do instead?\n \n \n That's illogical. Lower tax rates mean that the government is spending less money. When the tax rate is lower, the government is basically forced to spend less. Big government = bad; small government = good.\n \n\n \n Actually, it's not illogical. The government doesn't have to spend less to tax less. It's called defecit spending, and the US government does it regardless of taxes up or down. Taxes up, however, brings in more money than taxes down.\n \n Tell me what logical fallacy it is? We have lowed taxes, yet the government defecit spends like no tomorrow: War, Pork Barrel etc.\n \n If theory conformed to reality, t he government would spend less.\n \n Even if the government did spend less, many programs would lose funding anyway and that's not desirable from a normative perspective. You cannot rely on private venture and charitiy for critical things.\n \n Big government not = always bad and good government = always good. It's a generalization that doesn't hold. It's propaganda. It's a glittering generality fallacy.\n \n \n I wouldn't be surprised that much, but do you have any reliable statistics to back that? You won't need to truck your children around if you have the sense to find a decent school in the first place. Schools fail because they have poor standards and poor outcome, thus causing parents to pull their kids out of the school.\n\n \n I did above in several other passages. There are many more, however, and more instances of places A. Turning people away for no reason B. Failing economically, and B. Not being efficient. C. Not enough of them.\n \n What? Is the government going to subsidize all of the pepole who cannot afford private education? Do you know how expensive that is anyway?\n \n You are assuming people are smart in general. They are't. That's a big problem. People will gravitate to problems and when things can go wrong, they most likely will.\n \n There's also no standard for curriculm in a Private School, as I am aware. It could have changed, but last I checked, they can teach whatever they want from whatever slant they want. \n \n \n \n You're saying that modern education is better? Students graduating high school without being able to read properly? Students graduating without being able to do basic trigonometry? Have you considered how bad high school culture is? They are certainly not a place that is ideal for learning (public schools aren't safe places, you know). Ever notice that the US is placed as one of the \"dumbest\" nations for how rich our nation is? If we're supposedly such a wealthy education, I'd expect more than just a bunch of mediocre schools...\n \n\n \n Yes. It is better. In the 18th century the literacy rate was  far  lower than it is now. The number of people educated in the 18th century was also abysmally low compared to today (in many countries).\n \n 18th century education was largely a private endeavour, which meant tons of people got screwed and education was largely an oligarchic event, untill the age of Enlightenment passed. From that point on, it was still bad, but during the INdustrial Revolution and progressive era, much changed, and people's education  improved  becuase of public education, and more people were educated, and a standard developed instead of little pockets of whatever someone wanted to learn.\n \n Students not being able to graduate without basic trig. Yes, that's a problem, but it's not the problem of public school. Not at all. The problem are teacher's unions which didn't exist prior at such a stage, crappy teachers with \"tenure,\" and kids who don't want to learn anyway.\n \n It's not the fault of public school. Many schools have more than adequate funding. The problem isn't the school or the idea of public ed. It's modern elements put into it. The solution is to eliminate or ameliorate these problems, not chuck a good idea that's worked far better than the 18th century model.\n \n Yes, the United States is placed very low in science and math. however..do you notice that many other nations with  public education  that are not the US do not hav the same problem? They are much higher! Public Ed isn't the problem. Americans are the problem and the modern mind-set is the problem.\n \n Public schools do work in many countries. Do what they do. \n \n \n \n They reject a bunch to keep out the riff-raff. What federal standards don't they follow?\n\n \n Those who they privately decide are riff-raff. THey don't meet government regulations of who can and cannot be accepted. THey can deny anyone for any reason they choose. It's a private institution, and there have been many documented cases of families being turned away.\n \n This is the crux of the private education problem. They  will  turn many away. These people will be stuck in a public ed system which no one is funding--this means it will get worse, because no one will want to pay into a system they don't use if we largely switch over to private ed. The system will weaken for those who are denied or cannot gain access. \n \n Private institutions will also cater to special interest groups. There is no set rule or mandate. THey can do what they feel is appropriate. We already have some problems in public schools with that **** as it is. We don't need a harder to regulate system to take it over.\n \n As well, not everyone can fit into all the private ed schools, even if they allowed everyone to join--which they don't. They can set up any old test they want, and if you don't measure up--oops, guess you're screwed. That's not education--that's 18th century Libertarianism. It's not good to go back to that; it failed, that's why we have public education. The endeavour is superior.\n \n \n Those with mental problems shouldn't be in a public school either. They should be placed in a special needs school/program where they won't fail every class. Applicants not wanted at a school are most likely not wanted for a reason. Usually applications with a bad attitude or poor integrity aren't likely to be accepted to a private school. The students who are in shape don't have time for all the riff-raff potentially coming in.\n\n \n THis is another problem. Many people have a variety of disorders. We going to deny them all an education? How do we make sure their standards are objective? We can't. It's a private business.\n \n There are too many abuses to this system. They can derrive tests, rational, or standards for anything specific they do/don't like, and no one can say jack about it. That doesn't fly in government operated schools.\n \n They do have special Ed in public school. There are ample opportunities for help for them, which they won't and don't receive in many private institutions.\n \n \n Important:\n \n \n In Milwaukee, where the country's largest voucher program has been operating for more than 10 years, taxpayers have spent more than $140 million on private education. Meanwhile, voucher schools lack the most basic accountability measures, with no academic data collected for more than six years. As a result, no one knows how students in voucher schools are performing academically. The schools are not required to hire certified teachers, acquire certification, or disclose their attendance, suspension or dropout rates. They are not required to provide the same level of services for special education students or students who don't speak English. Free speech, due process, and state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, marital status or sexual orientation do not have to be followed at a private institution.\n\n \n \n First, private voucher-funded schools cherry-pick students to inflate their success rates. Like the health insurance plans that are dropping the gravely ill and asking the public to pay the tab for their healthcare, these private schools are leaving those with disabilities, behavioral problems and other issues that require more resources for the rest of us to pay with our tax dollars.\n\n \n They succeed prima facie, for a number of reasons: they are very selective with who can join. They pick and choose, thus making an artificial group. Anyone who doesn't fit their mold for any reason is booted or not accepted, thus skewing their results.\n \n They don't have to report anything at all! They have to follow zero rules. They don't have to spend the resources on anything they find not appropriate.\n \n \n One voucher school in Milwaukee does not teach science to elementary school children. Why? Perhaps because it requires supplies and equipment, and therefore is more expensive than other topics. Will the students graduating from this school be able to compete in the 21st-century job market with their peers if they have not taken any science classes? Probably not. But how can anyone complain, because, after all, this is a private institution, and state teaching regulations do not apply.\n\n \n Haha. They don't even teach classes for no reason. Lucky we found this one, cause someone managed to report it. Doesn't matter--government can't do squat about it anyway.\n \n People attack science anyway,and the majority of the American Population is Science Illiterate, so why would they care? 61% of Americans deny evolution and believe in literal creationism. Again, AMericans are stupid--and it's not public education's fault.\n \n These institutions won't fail either. Why? They hide stats, cherry pick applicants, and teach whatever they want and what makes them look good. THey also deal with little to no problematic/undesirable people. It's bs.\n \n \n Secondly, voucher money is being used to pay for Bibles and religious materials. The High Court walked lightly on this obvious funding of religion by saying that the money went to parents who gave the money to the school out of free will.\n\n \n More ********. Government vouchers going to pay for...Bibles? You gotta be fraking me. This is what they spend government voucher money on?? Yea..right. 18th century looking better and better!\n \n http://www.asianweek.com/2002_07_05/news_washj.html\n \n \n \n \n \n More Milwaukee Parents Choosing Private Schools\n By Cheryl Chumley\n CNS Staff Writer\n 31 May, 2000\n \n (CNSNews.com) - The expansion of Milwaukee's Parental Choice Program, to include 22 new private schools this fall is proof, one supporter and participant claimed, that the voucher system is a rising success.\n \n The city's voucher program allows parents and guardians who meet certain financial criteria to use taxpayer funds to send their children to the private school of their choice. The 22 new schools will add an estimated 2,000 more student participants - bringing the total to about 10,000 in the Parental Choice Program.\n \n The voucher program was enacted in Milwaukee in 1990, but did not gain in popularity until the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled eight years later that the admission of religious schools into the system would not violate separation of church and state outlined in the U.S. Constitution.\n \n About half the schools entering the voucher system this year are religious in nature, and include a range of sects from Muslim to Catholic, Brother Bob Smith, president of Milwaukee's Messmer High School and principal of Blessed Trinity Elementary School, said.\n \n \"This is the second year of religious schools being in the program,\" Smith said. \"Most people say it's had a resounding success.\"\n \n Rating those successes, however, is to date a nonscientific procedure, according to one education official opposed to the entire idea of a school voucher system. Smith admitted his view of the program's success was so far based largely on feedback received from teachers, parents and guardians rather than on documented evidence.\n\n \n Sooo little to no actual proof, no documentation..just...heresay. That's scientific and reliable. So, if your kids are learing whatever distorted ideolgoy and curriculm they are teaching at your chosen school...of course you're gonna be happy! You are getting your money's worth! God forbid the big bad gub'ment comes yonder and makes sure lar'nen  real  science and not dat creationist or pseudo-science stuv!\n \n Remember! WHen you low the standard of the curriculum and you cherry-pick applicants, success is guaranteed! As tony the Tiger would say: Private School methodologies are \"grreeeaaatt!\"\n \n \n Not only, he said, are private schools participating in the voucher program allowed to keep confidential their educational records - though much of their funding comes from taxes - but representatives of the program are not required to adhere to any state student testing regulations and standards.\n\n \n Again. They can do whatever they want...and parents remain completely oblivious to this nonsense---or....are they? Or do they know what's going on, but prefer not to say! Confidential records, selective picking, selective curriculae, no standards = formula for success.\n \n \n\n \"They don't want state oversight,\" Wollmer said, \"but they're more than willing to take state dollars.\"\n\n \n State money, but no state accountability...yea right.\n \n \n Private schools don't even have to hire certified/qualified teachers! Oh come on? That's a travesty.",

   "Yes. It is better. In the 18th century the literacy rate was  far  lower than it is now. The number of people educated in the 18th century was also abysmally low compared to today (in many countries).\n \n 18th century education was largely a private endeavour, which meant tons of people got screwed and education was largely an oligarchic event, untill the age of Enlightenment passed. From that point on, it was still bad, but during the INdustrial Revolution and progressive era, much changed, and people's education  improved  becuase of public education, and more people were educated, and a standard developed instead of little pockets of whatever someone wanted to learn.\n\n \n I used to think the same thing, but I did some research into this a few years ago, and when I saw the curriculum of some schools in the 19th century, I was shocked. It was as advanced, and in many cases more advanced, than what we have now in our public schools. \n \n I think the main differences are\n \n - education was much less centralized at that time--not much govt. regulation. One could argue the merits of this as either pro or con. In some cases govt. can be too much in the classroom, and in other cases not enough. This probably partly what you mean by \"private endeavor\" but I would argue that making schools govt-regulated doesn't always work and hasn't in many cases. There is certainly nothing you could cite or point to that would prove it has always been superior.\n \n - Technology and general understanding was not as far along, and so this was manifested in education at the time. But this is not a problem with the 19th century educational system, but rather that the country (and the world, for that matter) didn't know as much then about science and engineering.\n \n - The industrial revolution was barely getting started. One can't overestimate the effect of the industrial revolution on education. In essense, over time the direction and motivation of education shifted some from classical studies to more scientific endeavors. \n \n - Society placed less a value of education, especially in rural areas. But this does not indicate that the education that was in place was bad.\n \n I don't think it is a good way to look at it to say that 18th or 19th century education was inferior, but rather simply different. I think if you put a typcial public-schooled kid up against a schooled-kid from the 19th century and put them through latin test, the 19th century kid would have the best chance. The same goes for Mathmatics in some cases--they put a lot of emphasis on it. But if you did the same with science, the modern kid would have the best chance.\n \n Here is a site that gives some good info on 19th century education. As you will see, the curriculum really isn't that much different, except for a lot more foreign language.\n \n http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jessiem/resources/19camered/#subjects\n \n Also notable is this quote from the article:\n \n \"In many school districts, the apparent value placed on free, public education led to generous funding for schools. In Kansas, for instance, half of all taxes levied were for education. Most states had a state tax for education, and local taxes raised for education ranged from $3.90 to $35.00 per child. During the 1889-90 school year, the U.S. dollar equivalent of 28 million pounds was spent on public education in the US Most school districts also had a free textbook system so that students could borrow books for use during the current year.\n \n Despite the support for public education, 90% of the population did not attend school past primary school. 97% of the population attended primary school, which was for children ages six to nine. Approximately 2% of the population attended grammar or intermediate school for children ages ten to fourteen, but many had to leave school to work. Less than 1% of the population attended high school, which was for students ages fourteen to sixteen.\"",

   " \n I used to think the same thing, but I did some research into this a few years ago, and when I saw the curriculum of some schools in the 19th century, I was shocked. It was as advanced, and in many cases more advanced, than what we have now in our public schools.\n\n \n I didn't say 19th century. I said 18th century emoticon_xlove \n \n \n - education was much less centralized at that time--not much govt. regulation. One could argue the merits of this as either pro or con. In some cases govt. can be too much in the classroom, and in other cases not enough. This probably partly what you mean by \"private endeavor\" but I would argue that making schools govt-regulated doesn't always work and hasn't in many cases. There is certainly nothing you could cite or point to that would prove it has always been superior.\n\n \n I agree too. That's one of my problems with Private Education. It, so far, cannot be held accountable or to federal standards. They can do whatever they want and it's decentralized. I like someone watching over them to make sure they are doing their jobs.\n \n Not all Public are better than Private no. There are stats that show otherwise, but the stats are kinda deceiving due to various factors.\n \n \n - The industrial revolution was barely getting started. One can't overestimate the effect of the industrial revolution on education. In essense, over time the direction and motivation of education shifted some from classical studies to more scientific endeavors.\n\n \n I agree. The IR was a major spark for the public education inititive during the age of mass society. I think it was more the Second Industrial Rev, however.\n \n \n I don't think it is a good way to look at it to say that 18th or 19th century education was inferior, but rather simply different. I think if you put a typcial public-schooled kid up against a schooled-kid from the 19th century and put them through latin test, the 19th century kid would have the best chance. The same goes for Mathmatics in some cases--they put a lot of emphasis on it. But if you did the same with science, the modern kid would have the best chance.\n\n \n I agree, they had different curriculae. I am not saying that's what made the system bad. My problem is that so many people, since education had no Federal protection or supervision was arbitrary and selective. So many people weren't educated or couldn't afford it. The teachers aren't as well-trained (or tehy don't have to be at all). They tend to crystalize people into divisions.",

   "These posts sure are getting long.\n \n The main problem I've always seen with going over to a completely private school system is the fact that you treat the schools as businesses. This, in itself is not a problem, but the fact that the majority of new businesses fail is. If you have schools run like businesses, some will fail miserably, but they're product is the education of children.\n \n You can't just say that parents will move their children to a better school on the drop of a hat, transferring to a new school is a dramatic experience, often involving a completely new social group etc. and curriculum. It may take a year or two before parents decide to remove their children from a school. Perhaps the other option is even worse, where overly concerned parents move their children to another school at the slightest offence. Can't get on the cheerleading squad? We'll send you to a school where you can.\n \n This, of course, assumes that parents are overly concerned about their children's education. This is unfortunately not always true. A division of schools would quickly open up on the cheap for those parents who just want their children to not be arrested for truancy. I know people who's parents couldn't care less about how they are doing in school.\n \n Businesses are the perfect system to create widgets, but not human beings. Feel free to quote me on that.",
