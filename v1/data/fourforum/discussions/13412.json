The steam from the hissyfits generated amongst American racists is very close to blinding.\n\n \n I'll bet there are racists in this country who hate the fact that a black man is the commander and chief, but it has nothing to do with their black descendants helping to build the whitehouse at all. It has everything to do with his race, to them, and it doesn't even matter that he is doing a lousy job which is leading to our downfall as a world superpower. Even if he was doing a good job racists would still hate him. \n \n And that's because hatred and racism is ignorant and irrational and makes no common sense at all. But if Obama was doing a good job and not bankrupting america, the vast majority of us who didn't vote for him would be quietly standing by and applauding his success. I know I would be. I get absolutely no pleasure from his failure as he drives my country into the dirt.\n \n But here's the problem with Obama and his policies; they, as in socialist/collectivist/marxist policies have always failed where ever they have been tried and applied, in part, much less as a whole far reaching plan which he is attempting to impose against the will of the people he was elected to serve. So he has forfeited any trust even the majority of those who voted for him once had for him, and he has justified the mistrust we who didn't vote for him had for him from the beginning.\n \n I have said from the beginning, before he was elected that he is a dedicated socialist and wants to fundamentally change what this country has always stood for as a capitalist superpower. I said it right here on this forum, and all of the denials and lies you leftists could spew have now been proven to be just that, false denials and lies. Yet even now you attempt to twist reality and imply that our rejection of what your messiah represents is founded in racism rather than about what he represents. What is so pathetic is that you still are too ignorant to see that you have been had, played, conned to the max. That is what makes me pity you so much. Even now you either can't see it or are too proud to admit that you have trusted a liar and a con man.\n \n Remember simone, unless you're willing to admit finally that Acorn rigged the ballot boxes in a half a dozen key states which allowed the dems to steal this election, then you must admit that a majority of americans were actually stupid enough to vote for this criminal and his cronies. That may mean they are gullible and dumb which I readily admit, but it doesn't play into your claim that they are racist at all. As usual simone, you are spewing shallow and dishonest drivel. But hey, that's the simone we have always known and pitied around here. emoticon_rolleyes",
