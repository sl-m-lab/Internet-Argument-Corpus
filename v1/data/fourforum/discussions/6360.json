   "I'm surprised anti-Semitism isn't an Evangelical position. It's quite prevalent in the New Testament.\n\n \n I don't think so. \n \n First, \n \n The most sacred work of the Jewish community, the Torah, records Moses calling his people \"stiff-necked\" and \"rebellious.\"\n \n I count no less than eight historical allusions by Moses in Deuteronomy 1-4 of Israel's absolute defiance of their God. Moses concludes the Torah by stating that he knows that Israel will disobey the Holy One and break the covenant after he is gone. Moses is first in a succession of Jewish prophets who do this. Isaiah call the Jews \"Sodomites;\" Jeremiah likens them to \"a wild XXX in heat;\" Ezekiel and Hosea classify them as \"adultresses;\" and Amos likens them to a \"father and son who use the same girl.\" Passages in the Old Testament are replete with prophetic discourses objecting to Israel's profanation of her holy calling. And, yet, I am not aware that the Torah or Old Testament has ever been labeled \"anti Jewish.\"  Why? We recognize these struggles as an intra-Jewish religious tension in an attempt to aid Israel toward the goal of her high calling; not to proclaim Israel as the worst people on earth.\n \n So, is the Old Testament anti-semitic? \n \n Approaching the New Testament\n \n We must approach the New Testament in the same light. The Gospels were written within the context of Judaism. We must recognize this if we are to understand and appreciate them fully. The main subject, Yeshua, was a Jew. The disciples were Jews. His opponents were Jews. The main themes of divergence were Jewish. The sources are Jewish and the authors of the New Testament, with the possible exception of Luke, were Jews.\n \n All the earmarks of an intra-Jewish struggle are present. Yeshua is portrayed as a prophet in the succession of Jewish prophets of Israel. As the prophets were rebuffed in their attempts to call the Jewish nation back to their Creator, so Yeshua is met with the same resistance. Yeshua' identity as a Jew is affirmed and reaffirmed. Jesus' ministry was almost exclusively with his own. Yeshua said, \"I always taught in the synagogues or at the temple where all the Jews come together\" (John 18:20). Pilate, the Roman prelate who handed Yeshua over to be crucified, recognized the situation to be a Jewish matter. He said to Yeshua, \"It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me.\"\n \n http://www.chosen-people.com/docs/Curious/AboutUs2/Articles/NTAntiSem.html\n \n You might study up on the numerous illustrations that demonstrate that the term \"Jews\" must be taken in its overall context as each individual passage dictates. Just like in the Old Testament, there are \"good Jews\" and \"bad Jews\" alluded to in John and elsewhere. From listening to you, one would think that the New Testament paints all Jews in a bad light. That's hardly defendable. Conclusions from the link: \n \n Conclusions: \n \n 1. When \"Jews\" is used of the hostile aristocratic leadership, it is appropriate and truthful to ascribe the primary responsibility (see John 19:11 for the relative roles of Pilate and the High Priest - \"Jesus answered, \"You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\") for His execution to them. \n 2. When \"Jews\" is used of the general populace, it is used in a VERY POSITIVE sense (and in some passages, in a neutral sense), but is NEVER used in an 'anti-Semitic' slur. \n 3. THEREFORE--to assert that John (and the wider Christian community) attributed the death of Jesus to the GENERAL POPULACE known as \"Jews\" is FUNDAMENTALLY MISTAKEN; and that to accuse certain first-century Jews of being 'anti-Semitic' because of some general Roman cultural trend is entirely without foundation. \n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/ajews.html",

   "\n But we don't hold it against them today. We evangelicals support the Jews and the nation of Israel.\n\n \n I would venture to say Evangelicals suffer the Jews more than support them.

   "Is the Gospel of John Anti-Semitic?\n \n First, John was a Jew, as was Jesus, as were the disciples. To make your case that the Gospel of John is inherently anti-semitic you are thus accusing Jews of being bigoted against their own countrymen, which seems to me to be a major stretch.\n \n Second, you seldom hear mentioned from the Billsco's of this world the very positive things that are mentioned about Jews in the Gospel of John, such as:\n \n Jesus tells the Samaritan woman that \"salvation is of the Jews\" (4:22), \n \n The people who mourn Lazarus with Mary and Martha are said to be Jews, although they also are not hostile to Jesus. Moreover, throughout John's Gospel \"Israel\" and \"Israelite\" are used in a positive sense. Thus Nathanael can be called \"a TRUE Israelite in whom there is no guile\" (1:47) and Jesus is hailed as \"king of Israel\" (1:49), a title whose entirely positive connotations contrast with \"king of the Jews,\" which has a negative and sarcastic ring on the lips of Romans (e.g., 19:3). If John is truly anti-semitic why is he saying positive things about Jews???\n \n \"The Jews\" is, then, a term used of a group of (corrupt) Jewish leaders who exercise great authority among their compatriots and are especially hostile to Jesus and his disciples. A recent study of the gospels' use of Ioudaioi confirms the view that when it is used in a peculiarly Johannine sense, that is, not with reference to Judeans or to Jewish customs, feasts, and so forth, it refers to certain authorities rather than to the people as a whole.6 It is these authorities, not Jewish people generally, who are portrayed as hostile to Jesus throughout John  and make that gospel \"appear\" anti-Jewish.\n \n http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/sites/partners/cbaa_seminar/Smith.htm\n \n When \"Jews\" is used of the hostile aristocratic leadership, it is appropriate and truthful  to ascribe the primary responsibility (see John 19:11 for the relative roles of Pilate and the High Priest - \"Jesus answered, \"You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.

To make your case that the Gospel of John is inherently anti-semitic you are thus accusing Jews of being bigoted against their own countrymen, which seems to me to be a major stretch.\n\n \n Although we don't know who wrote the gospel of John, we can understand its purpose. It was attempting to recognize and define a new community of believers apart from Judaism. \n \n It did it in a strange way: by attacking and denigrating Jews. Not unlike many posts I read on these forums, instead of promoting and highlighting the positive aspects of one's own message, the attempt instead is to destroy another's by personal attack. It speaks often about the lack of quality of the message. \n \n \n \n \"The Jews\" is, then, a term used of a group of (corrupt) Jewish leaders who exercise great authority among their compatriots and are especially hostile to Jesus and his disciples. A recent study of the gospels' use of Ioudaioi confirms the view that when it is used in a peculiarly Johannine sense, that is, not with reference to Judeans or to Jewish customs, feasts, and so forth, it refers to certain authorities rather than to the people as a whole.6 It is these authorities, not Jewish people generally, who are portrayed as hostile to Jesus throughout John and make that gospel \"appear\" anti-Jewish.\n \n\n \n John 6:41 is only one of several verses that specifically refer to the general populace of Jews, the common man. I'm not surprised that Christian apologetics has attempted to deflect the obvious problem of anti-Semitism in the Johannine gospel, it is an embarrassment and shame of major proportions. \n \n (See also John 5:15-18, John 7:10-13, John 10:31, John 11:53-54, John 19:12, John 20:19.)\n \n \n The truth is, the more fundamentalist Christians become, the more anti-Semitic they become.\n\n \n \n\n That's horse manure.\n \n \n I think the link is very clear, and the thinking behind it is not at all hard to understand. \n \n \n\n But seeking converts is what Christians do to everyone. They prey on non-Christians and they prey on each other all the time. No matter how twisted they are in their thinking, they really think they are doing the rest of us a favor. But why is a religion based on claims of God's so-called \"love\" of humanity that further claims that same God sent His \"only begotten Son\" to die a horrible death on a cross for the sake people that so often disobey the very teachings of that Son? How can they justify violence when they fail to convince others to follow? \n \n Christianity claims that all people must know God as revealed only through Jesus Christ. That's the only way one can avoid damnation and obtain life in Heaven. After Christianity merged with the Roman Empire, Jesus took second place to the Church. The secular state became a new instrument of judgment (and punishment) outside God. They further argued that those who take away the possibility of eternal life should be prevented by all means including force and terror. This is especially true for heretics and apostates from the Christian faith or anyone else who drew converts away from the Church. This would be spiritual murder so they claimed a kind of \"right of self defence\" of the soul. All things take a back seat to self defence and anything is justified including killing. So murder that is so clearly prohibited with Jesus Himself and the Ten Commandments becomes not murder but self defence. \n\n http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/mine/antisemitism.htm\n http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/jew_haters.htm",

   "1st Century Jerusalem Burial Cave Reveals: Names, Testimonies of First Christians\n \n The first century catacomb, uncovered by archaeologist P. Bagatti on the Mount of Olives, contains inscriptions clearly indicating its use, \"by the very first Christians in Jerusalem.\"\n \n An inscription, found on a first century coffin bearing the sign of the cross, reads: \"Shimon Bar Yonah\" = \"Simon [Peter] son of Jonah\". \n \n The catacombs were found and excavated primarily by two well-known archaeologists, but their findings were later read and verified by other scholars such as Yigael Yadin, J. T. Milik and J. Finegan. Both archaeologists found evidence clearly dating the two catacombs to the first century AD, with the later finding coins minted by Governor Varius Gratus at the turn of the millenium (up to 15/16 AD). Evidence in both catacombs indicated their use for burial until the middle part of the first century AD, several years before the New Testament was written.  \n \n As Claremont-Ganneau further investigated the tomb, he found inscriptions, including the names of \"Eleazar\"(=\"Lazarus\"), \"Martha\" and \"Mary\" on three different coffins.  \n \n Bagatti also found evidence which clearly indicated that the tomb was in use in the early part of the first century AD. Inside, the sign of the cross was found on numerous first-century coffins.\n \n He found dozens of inscribed ossuaries, which included the names Jairus, Jonathan, Joseph, Judah, Matthias, Menahem, Salome, Simon, and Zechariah. In addition, he found one ossuary with crosses and the unusual name \"Shappira\" - which is a unique name not found in any other first-century writtings except for the Book of Acts (5:1). \n \n Photographs in the link below\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/theology/burialcave.html\n \n Now, a 2nd Article:\n \n Need something etched in stone confirming Jesus before 70 A.D.?  \n \n \"This catacomb on the Mount of Olives belonged apparently to one of the earliest families which joined the new religion of Christianity. In this group of sarcophagi, some of which have the Christian symbol and some have not, we are, so to speak, [witnessing the] actual unfolding of Christianity. Personally, I think that many of the Hebrew-speaking people whose remains are contained in these ossuaries were among the first followers of Christ.... The appearance of Christianity at the very gates of Jerusalem is, in my opinion, extraordinary and unprecedented. Somehow the new [Christian] doctrine must have made its way into the Jewish system.... The association of the sign of the cross with (the name of Jesus) written in Hebrew alone constitutes a valuable fact.\" \n \n \"What gives additional value to these short inscriptions is that they furnish a whole series of names found in the Gospels, in their popular and local Syro-Chaldaic forms. The presence of the names of Jesus and Martha, of which we only knew historically that it was the feminine form of the Aramaic, would alone be sufficient to make this collection important from an exegetic point of view. By a singular coincidence, which from the first struck me forcibly, these inscriptions, found close to the Bethany road, and very near the site of the village, contain nearly all the names of the personages in the Gospel scenes which belonged to the place: Eleazar (Lazarus), Simon, Martha ... a host of other coincidences occur at the sight of all these most evangelical names.\" \n \n Italian scholar P. Bagatti discovered another catacomb holding 100 ossuaries on the western side of the Mount of Olives. Coins that were minted by Governor Varius Gratus (A.D. 16) showed that these tombs were used for burial of Christians before A.D. 70. The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus. Many of the ossuaries included other names, such as Jarius, Jonathan, Joseph, Judah, Matthias, Menahem, Salome, Simon, and Zechariah. \n \n The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus.

I found no source that had over 22% as non-religious, much less over 50%.\n Presumably these 81% (78% or whatever) see religious benefit for themselves. \n\n again, totally baseless presumption. apparently you are of the opinion that if the majority of people in the world are in a particular state, that means that that is the more beneficial state. i have already demonstrated to you that your logic is flawed, but you still insist repeating the same flawed logic\n \n let me make myself clear again: the majority of people being in a particular state does not make that state more benficial. \n \n \nI didn't say that they are better off; I said presumably they believe they are better off. I still don't know whether they are \"better\" off or not. You have been unable to quantify \"betterness\", therefore I suspect your claim that we'd likely all be better off is vacuous.\n\n yes. you made a PRESUMPTION. and your presumption is baseless. you cannot presume that people believe anything and offer it as support for any type of argument. a presumption is imaginary, and not substantial as evidence. i am under no obligation to entertain your baseless presumptions\n \n \nIt was your position that we'd most likely all be \"better\" off. I have asked repeatedly for a quantification of \"betterness\", and you apparently have none. Your position seems vacuous. Your position might as well be we'd most likely all be \"worse\" off.\n\n i have provided the dictionary definition of betterness. furthermore, you have failed to provide any evidence showing that in a world without religion everyone would NOT be better off. if you cannot quantify betterness yourself, then you have no basis by which to challenge my statement\n \n \nThe ability to accept the game of day (either religion or atheism) is advantageous. One is more likely to mate if one can play along with whatever game is present. If one is predisposed toward any definitive belief, one is more liable to find himself dead or cast out. \n\n flawed logic. the ability to rise beyond mediocrity is advantageous as well. so is the ability to perform beyond average. by simply subscribing to whatever is the norm has absolutely no correlation to survivability. some cases it is advantageous to follow the crowd. in some cases it is detrimental. your generalization is fallacious and poorly thought out\n \n \nCommonality has absolutely nothing to do with advantageousness? Prove it.\n\n i would replace the phrase \"has absolutely nothing to do with\" with \"is not directly related to\". a partial withdrawal\n \n \nThere seems to be a great drive to conform. If conformance were not advantageous, why would the drive exist?\n \n Yes, poverty (the acceptance of poverty) does seem to have had the upper hand. Some people kill themselves rather than be poor, but most seem to accept poverty.\n Africans accepted slavery and were able to reproduce. \n\n utter garbage. first of all, the majority of africans were not slaves, so your analogy is flawed. second, africans never \"accepted\" slavery. there was no drive to become a slave where the africans were concerned. third, most slaves were not permitted to reproduce, or were under severe reproduction controls. it was only after the abolition of slavery that the black population outside of africa flourished. facts please. your presumptions are really annoying to deal with. with every post you make, your educational void is displayed even more\n \n \nI didn't say that anyone is born with an inclination towards religion. Your attempt to change my words is fallacious.\n Furthermore, what you think is thoughtless is of no account. You seem to be trying to poison my well. \n You already admitted:\nthere are millions of people that are immersed in the blissful ignorance that religion offers. \n\n That a great many people are religious is evidence that Darwin is allowing it. On the other hand, Darwin is not allowing many people to drink copious amounts of chlorine bleach.\n\n you said \n \nIf it were \"better\" to disbelieve religion, then presumably we would be born with an aversion to religion. Obviously that aversion is not present.\n\n where do you come up with these presumptions? being born without an aversion to religion implies nothing about whether accepting religion is \"better\" or not. obviously, an aversion to atheism is not present either, so your point is moot",
