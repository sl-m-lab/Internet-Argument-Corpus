   "there is the law of Conservation of Mass, which states that mass (or matter, in this case... atomic mass/matter) in a closed system, ie the universe in it's entirety, will remain constant. so the atoms that you are made up of are the same atoms that were around when the universe was formed. mind = blown, i know. this means that new atoms are never being formed, and new mass or matter is never being formed. right now, we cant tell the date of an atom, but if we could, we would have a definite idea of how old the universe is. there is science to back up 14 billion years, but that seems a bit short for me.\n \n so, as far as the origin of matter goes, all of it started with the origin of the universe, something like 14 billion years ago. the existence of matter? im not quite sure of that question, but i would be interested to discuss that.\n \n another thing to think about is time - the speculated age of the universe is counted earth time. time is directly relative to mass, so in areas where there is no mass, time could be standing absolutely still, and that section of space could theoretically have only existed for like a second, the split second when it was in proximity to something that contains mass. then again, time is a complete mystery; i dont believe in it myself. to think that because of my height, my head is very minutely in the past relative to my feet... it just doesnt make sense. and whenever you go on an airplane, you are slightly in the past compared to everyone else. astronauts are completely knackered - they must be very behind.",
