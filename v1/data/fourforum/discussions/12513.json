   "Three slain:\n \nDevotion to badge was slain officers' common thread\n Sunday, April 05, 2009\n By Jonathan D. Silver and Jon Schmitz, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n One was a 14-year veteran of the Pittsburgh police; the other two were relative newcomers, each with two years on the force.\n \n Two of them left behind wives and daughters; the other was engaged to be married.\n \n What the three officers who were slain yesterday in Stanton Heights shared, colleagues and friends said yesterday, was their devotion to police work.\n \n The fallen officers were identified yesterday as Eric Kelly, 41, a 14-year veteran; and Paul Sciullo III, 37, and Stephen J. Mayhle, 29, each with two years on the force.\n\n Devotion to badge was slain officers' common thread\n \n \nSuspect in officers' shooting was into conspiracy theories\n Sunday, April 05, 2009\n By Dennis B. Roddy, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n Richard Andrew Poplawski was a young man convinced the nation was secretly controlled by a cabal that would eradicate freedom of speech, take away his guns and use the military to enslave the citizenry.\n \n .... by January 2007, was posting photographs of his tattoos on white supremacist Web site Stormfront. Among his ambitions: \"to accumulate enough 'I punched that [expletive] so hard' stories to match my old man.\"\n \n .... \"He was really into politics and really into the First and Second amendment. One thing he feared was he feared the gun ban because he thought that was going to take away peoples' right to defend themselves. He never spoke of going out to murder or to kill,\" said Edward Perkovic, who described himself as Mr. Poplawski's lifelong best friend.\n\n Suspect in officers' shooting was into conspiracy theories\n \n Those worthless, scumbag, little worms Glenn Beck and Chuck Norris fed this madman's fears with their senseless rhetoric.",
