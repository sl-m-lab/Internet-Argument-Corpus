   "The February 20th issue of The New Yorker Magazine has an article entitled The Saintly Sinner - Mary Magdalene, by Joann Accocella which contains some rather interesting insights into early Christianity taken from both the NT as well as from the Nag Hammadi library of Gnostic writings discovered in 1945 in Egypt. These writings are believed to date from the 2nd to the 4th centuries CE. They portray Mary Magdalene in a light quite different from what the later church would propose. She is a central figure of the Gnostic gospels, Jesus' favourite disciple, and perhaps his lover. \n \n Evidence suggests that the early Church splintered into factions, each with its own view of what actually constituted (as yet) emerging Christian doctrine. Included among these factions was that of Peter/James of the Jerusalem group, Paul, and, notably, Mary M. Mary's faction eventually lost out, and the (now established) Church dismissed her as a prostitute and Jesus groupie. \n \n But the NT Gospel of John (which appears to have considerable Gnostic overtones) has something else to say. According to this Gospel, Mary Magdalene came, alone, to Jesus' tomb, before dawn on Sunday morning. No one accompanied her, not even Jesus' disciples or any of the other women. It was she who then ran to the disciples to inform them that Jesus' body was missing. And, according to John's Gospel, it was to Mary Magdalene that the risen Jesus first appeared. \n \n Consider, then, what Paul has to say as to the testimony of women...\n \n 1co 14:34-35 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.\n \n 1ti 2:11-12 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.",

Sure, there were struggles early on between orthodox Christianity and heresies. That's well known--nothing new there.\n\n \n Yes, the winners get to label the losers as heretics. And, sometimes, the question as to who wins and who loses is more a matter of politics than logic or reason. In re: Nicea, Arius appears to have had scripture on his side, as well as a considerable number of bishops. Nevertheless, he eventually lost to (what I believe to be) the politics and institutionalism of his day. Likewise, there must have been a reason why the Nag Hammadi texts were placed in a jar and buried within a cave. \n \n \nIt's not like the fact of these historical events refutes anything.\n\n \n I never said or implied such.

Such considerations lie outside my (or anyone's) expertise and really don't interest me. That said, I hasten to add that the evidence suggests that Christianity and Christian doctrine evolved over time, and that such evolution was often, umm..., bumpy. Indeed, today's Christianity is about as diverse and fractured as it was at the time of Arius or Luther, and continues to evolve. But I think that, in order to truely understand Christianity (or, for that matter, any other religion), one must trace its origin and gradual evolution. One cannot simply dismiss the Gnostics or Arians based upon political or institutional outcomes without knowing what it was that they had to say. And what they had to say was part of the mosaic of early Christianity. Judgements as to whether they were right or wrong, or to what extent they were 'heretics', is baseless and, IMO, without substance.",
