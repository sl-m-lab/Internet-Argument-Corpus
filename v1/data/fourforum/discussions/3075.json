If one believes in any sort of spiritual after life , then I could not in all honesty, say that person is a non - believer. I think you may be taking my Ford analogy a bit to serious though, it was just my overly simplistic analogy of how children can grow up and be influenced in their choice of religion , or not, by their parents . There are always holes in the fabrics of interpretations, whenever people debate , mine included. :) \n \n As to your reference to other sources of intolerance , such as people not being cultural diverse, people with tunnel vision and close mindness, those are good points indeed. I believe all of those can promote religous intolerance in our society. But one would have to look at how the person as a individual, got to be intolerant of religion , from hearing their personal experiences I believe. There are way too many variables that happen in peoples lives , that make them intolerable to religion, for one to make a generalization about it .

I have not said that silence equals support - however that is an inference many have made in the past - if you don't speak out against abuse, you are in effect condoning it.\n Anyway, none have replied to me on this thread except you, and JoeBrummer.\n JoeBrummer tried to redefine one of these intolerable groups by suggesting it wasn't a religion at all, but a cult.\n And you enter this debate because some how you think I've made a personal attack on you. You instead mask this in terms of me being on 'the attack' when you lack the insight to see the attacks you yourself have made, in broad terms, and personal ones - lest you feel only you have the right to do this (see the way you've questioned whether I as an Australian have a right to enter a debate on Civil Rights).\n Further, you tried to point score on the 'metric system', and on the 'god, country, apple-pie' phrasing of another poster. Even here you don't deal with the issues, but are determined to personalise this - I must do so in response.\n \nWhy do you persist in harassing posters in this manor? \n\n Do you feel 'harassed? Have I directed these post about 'the family' at you specifically? Looking back over the posts, I've replied directly to LadyWolf and JoeBrummer, now you. How is it that you feel harassed?\n If you feel that I've posted these questions directly to you (and I don't see that I have) - then why do you persist in not actually answering the questions I put? If you feel that these questions weren't put to you, then how is it that you feel harassed? Maybe you're tele-empathic? :)\n Perhaps because if some of the 'free-thinkers' admit that in fact they don't tolerate all beliefs that the whole reason for this thread will collapse... which was in fact an exercise to draw out Christians who actually ARE committed to principles beyond the parameters their own feelings of what is right or wrong.\n \nAnd what exactly was that crack at her spelling?\n\n I don't follow this, lest you refer to a poster writing Judiasm. It's to determine if in fact this poster is referring to Judaism, or something else entire. It did sound funny though.... Judiasm. You don't see it as funny. Big deal.\n \nMaybe someone needs a time-out.\n\n You're free to leave. Or, you might return, and actually answer some of the questions put to others. You might just resort to generalised and sweeping-statements, as you've done so in the past. I think you're very angry about a lot of things, especially about some upstart Australian who argues with facts and shows you up on issues about America. And you live there! :)\n \n If you want, here's the question for you... do you support the practices of the Hindus in Suttee, or of animists in female genital mutilation, or the 'free love' practices of \"the Family\"? Your lack of response won't surprise me, however, I will not draw an inference that your silence equals support.",
