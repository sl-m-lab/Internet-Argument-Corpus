   "Why did dubya get a majority of the vote in the last election compared to clinton who never won a majority of the voters?\n\n \n Perot. Daewoo has explained this. Let me quote him.\n \n \nBush I was defeated by Ross Perot. Perot came in and slit the republican vote and handed the presidency to Bill Clinton. \n \n Going into the election, Bush was seen as unbeatable. The economy had certainly taken a beating, but there was some hope on the horizon, and more importantly, he had brought us through a war victoriously (gulf I). A popular war, no less.\n \n Clionton got a run at the presidency as a sacrificial lamb. The democrats didn't think they could possibly beat bush, so they ran the governer of Arkansas, a guy with kind of a shady background and some pretty serious credibility issues, knowign that he would be beat. Nobody who really felt they had a chance at the oval office wanted to go up against bush Sr.\n \n Perot came in, and despite the fact he was a lunatic, split enough republicans off to cost Bush the election.\n\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=105961&highlight=perot#post105961\n \n hence, Perot caused a three way vote, where in this election, there was a two way vote. Think about it this way, 100/3 or 100/2.1?",
