   "Evolutionists' Biological Fairytale\n \n \n This time last year I was lost. \n \n I'm not generally the type of individual who blames my own personal issues on other people, but the fact is I was mislead and lied to by science and by the media. \n \n The fact is, I would still be lost if I had not taken a hard look at the evidence that God gave me. Thus, in a way, I do believe my faith is evidence-based. I believe God gave us evidence in the form of His word - The Bible - and I believe He gave us evidence of His eternal greatness through his miraculous Creation. It's all here for everyone to see. There are no excuses.\n \n But I submit that the Liberals in this country have one supreme goal -- trashing this evidence - on both fronts. The first thing they've done is trashed the Bible. They've taken it out of our schools, out of the public arena, off the airwaves, out of courthouses, out of the military, and generally out of sight anywhere besides inside churches and homes. Instead of reading/analyzing the Bible and celebrating life, liberals would just assume everyone analyze porn and worship death.\n \n Next they've trashed God's creation by diverting everyone's attention. It's a subtle move that not many people have noticed. But I've noticed. What they've done is a clever sleight-of-hand move. Science no longer looks at animals. They no longer study how organisms interact within their environments. Instead they've turned everyone's attention to genes, bacteria and viruses....and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things....Thus, they assume (correctly, unfortunately) that most people will just take their word for it.\n \n Buy they're not fooling me. Evolutionists tell us that they have to look at our genes to tell us who we are. They tell us that instead of looking at the whole organism, we have to look at individual sub-units or parts. But that's a bunch of liberal nonsense. God gave me enough common sense not to listen to those who trash Him and His Creation.\n \n \"It is not the genes that elicit nascent form, but the nascent form that selects the genes and recruits them for its program\" Sermonti\n \n Yes, thanks to today's science, the study of individual, whole organisms has been replaced by the study of genes. Instead of real-life representing bilogical reality, they've created their own fairytale of biolgical reality.\n \n The fact is, genes make sense only in the context of the organism - and the organism only makes sense only within the context of the environment they live in. Animals, in fact, seemed to have completely disappeared from the realm of evolutionary biology. Nobody talks about animals anymore...and they certainly don't talk about how they interact with their environment.\n \n But I don't believe you can separate the two. And not only do I believe that the organism can effect the environment, but the environment can also effect the organism. It's another two-way street that evolutionists have chosen to completely abandon because of their head-in-the-sand version of science which validates their atheist agenda. \n \n But see I have a theory as to why science must do this: It's because science has come to realization that all animals have brains and consciousness in varying forms. These, of course, are the anti-science because science cannot explain such a phenomenon. But the fact is each animal has it's own brain - and each brain comes pre-programmed with its own abilities according to how God designed it. Each animal has a different function and different abilities. God knew beforehand that environmental circumstances would be changing, thus he gave each organism the ability to change with it. This is simple common sense.\n \n Therefore, I believe that God designed Finch brains to be able to subconsciously decipher when the environment changes and when a modified beak is needed. Likewise I believe God made it so peppered moths are able to modify their wing-patterns based on environment or background colors. This is no more unbelievable than the fact that a fish can change colors or that a snail can grow a bigger shell in the presence of predators. It all comes from the same creative Designer.\n \n And what's funny is evolutionists - in one breath - will tell you how they do not deny plasticity....yet in the next breath will tell you that's not how finches and moths changed! If these people were intellectually honest, they wouldn't talk out of both side of their mouths like that...they would admit the truth. But I no longer expect the truth out of atheists.\n \n And if you think about it, there is no way that plasticity - adaptivity - could have \"evolved\" like evolutionists say because common sense says that this feature is automatically hard-wired into the brain. To believe otherwise would be to believe that millions-year-old moths didn't have the same physical/mental capabilities as a present-day moths - even though they both have brains. I believe in order for an animal to not be adaptive it would have to be born without a brain.\n \n The brain is the fundamental unit of life - yet evolutionists attempt to explain life by completely ignoring it. \n \n I don't buy it....and you evolutionists are all outmatched by common sense.",

   "What the hell, I've got some time. Where to begin.....let's go down you're arguements.\n \n \nEvolutionists' Biological Fairytale\n \n \n This time last year I was lost. \n \n I'm not generally the type of individual who blames my own personal issues on other people, but the fact is I was mislead and lied to by science and by the media.\n\n How? What exactly did they say, that God didn't invent every living thing individually? I'm interested to learn what information you specifically feel was a fabrication.\n \n \nThe fact is, I would still be lost if I had not taken a hard look at the evidence that God gave me. Thus, in a way, I do believe my faith is evidence-based. I believe God gave us evidence in the form of His word - The Bible - and I believe He gave us evidence of His eternal greatness through his miraculous Creation. It's all here for everyone to see. There are no excuses.\n \n But I submit that the Liberals in this country have one supreme goal -- trashing this evidence - on both fronts. The first thing they've done is trashed the Bible. They've taken it out of our schools, out of the public arena, off the airwaves, out of courthouses, out of the military, and generally out of sight anywhere besides inside churches and homes. Instead of reading/analyzing the Bible and celebrating life, liberals would just assume everyone analyze porn and worship death.\n\n As to your first point, as far as I can tell, you looked at the world and said, \"Naw, there's no way this happened without God.\" And not just any God, but Trinity father son holy spirit God. The miraculous creation of our existance does not point to Christianity at all. However, you didn't just look at the 'miraculous creation,' no you had a study guide. Allow me to mention something right here, and point out I'm a Methodist....ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue, but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it. Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God. The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance, it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions.\n \n As to your second point, argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you haven't really put much thought into this contention. You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school. There is a good reason for this. I can't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said:\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" \n \n This means government isn't suppose to support religious groups. What would you define mandatory school prayer as? Anyone who has ever argued that a seperation between church and state isn't a good thing has obviously never been the religious minority. I lived in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and I can tell you state supported religion is not good.\n \n \nNext they've trashed God's creation by diverting everyone's attention. It's a subtle move that not many people have noticed. But I've noticed. What they've done is a clever sleight-of-hand move. Science no longer looks at animals. They no longer study how organisms interact within their environments. Instead they've turned everyone's attention to genes, bacteria and viruses....and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things....Thus, they assume (correctly, unfortunately) that most people will just take their word for it.\n\n The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.\n \n \nBuy they're not fooling me. Evolutionists tell us that they have to look at our genes to tell us who we are. They tell us that instead of looking at the whole organism, we have to look at individual sub-units or parts. But that's a bunch of liberal nonsense. God gave me enough common sense not to listen to those who trash Him and His Creation.\n Well I can't really refute that, now can I? Congrats for your one paragraph and your God given common sense debunking the last 50 years of molecular biology. Please refer to any highschool biology text to confirm the study that has been proven time and again that DNA allows for the creation of protiens that make up our body. It is the kind and number of these protiens and enzymes that determine what we look like, what instincts we have, etc.\n \n \n\"It is not the genes that elicit nascent form, but the nascent form that selects the genes and recruits them for its program\" Sermonti\n I admit I didn't know who Sermonti was at first. A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco, one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante. a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980. He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose' to be part of science, giving such examples as: \"In the presence of the inducer (lactose) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4).\" In case you never took biochemistry, this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals.\n \n \nYes, thanks to today's science, the study of individual, whole organisms has been replaced by the study of genes. Instead of real-life representing bilogical reality, they've created their own fairytale of biolgical reality.\n \n The fact is, genes make sense only in the context of the organism - and the organism only makes sense only within the context of the environment they live in. Animals, in fact, seemed to have completely disappeared from the realm of evolutionary biology. Nobody talks about animals anymore...and they certainly don't talk about how they interact with their environment.\n \n Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment. It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature. This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another. Given a complete understanding of molecular biology, we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch.\n \nBut I don't believe you can separate the two. And not only do I believe that the organism can effect the environment, but the environment can also effect the organism. It's another two-way street that evolutionists have chosen to completely abandon because of their head-in-the-sand version of science which validates their atheist agenda. \n \n But see I have a theory as to why science must do this: It's because science has come to realization that all animals have brains and consciousness in varying forms. These, of course, are the anti-science because science cannot explain such a phenomenon. But the fact is each animal has it's own brain - and each brain comes pre-programmed with its own abilities according to how God designed it. Each animal has a different function and different abilities. God knew beforehand that environmental circumstances would be changing, thus he gave each organism the ability to change with it. This is simple common sense.\n I'm not going to even mention how perilous common sense is. I'm confused by your statements about all animals having brains and consiousness. Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms, like sponges and jellyfish, do not require a centralized nervous system. Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma. You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some, making your assertion meaningless. Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche, and this would be caused by slow natural selection, not by holy edict. By the way, most pastors I'm familiar with would tell you animals don't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought. As to you stating God gave animals the ability to change to their environment, do you have evidence of massive bodily changes? Tell your assertion to the millions upon millions of species that have gone extint in Earth's history because of changing enviroments or more powerful competition.\n \n \nTherefore, I believe that God designed Finch brains to be able to subconsciously decipher when the environment changes and when a modified beak is needed. Likewise I believe God made it so peppered moths are able to modify their wing-patterns based on environment or background colors. This is no more unbelievable than the fact that a fish can change colors or that a snail can grow a bigger shell in the presence of predators. It all comes from the same creative Designer.\n \n And what's funny is evolutionists - in one breath - will tell you how they do not deny plasticity....yet in the next breath will tell you that's not how finches and moths changed! If these people were intellectually honest, they wouldn't talk out of both side of their mouths like that...they would admit the truth. But I no longer expect the truth out of atheists.\n To be honest I'm still not sure what your plasticity arguement is about. You seem to argue that animals can change shape and design like pokemon when the need arises. Now, my body, in the precence of foreign organisms, will create brand new protiens designed to kill the invaders, but this is a simple genetic process well understood by biologists. I still ask you to show me some study where an animal has been placed in an altered environment and makes a larger beak, grows extra limbs, etc. The problem with your fish and moth examples are growing larger shells or changing colors are abilities, not permanent changes, that are shared by the organism's offspring. If a snail grew a large shell when there were many predators around, its offspring would not have the same large shells unless a similar predator threat existed. You're arguements about plasticity essentially claim the story of how the elephant got its trunk is a valid evolutionary theory.\n \n \nAnd if you think about it, there is no way that plasticity - adaptivity - could have \"evolved\" like evolutionists say because common sense says that this feature is automatically hard-wired into the brain. To believe otherwise would be to believe that millions-year-old moths didn't have the same physical/mental capabilities as a present-day moths - even though they both have brains. I believe in order for an animal to not be adaptive it would have to be born without a brain.\n\n Million year old moths didn't have the same capabilities as a present day moths. Million year old moths had capabilities that suited it to the million year old environment. Changes to moths have been subtle because it is a successful group of organisms, but changes do exist. Also, you keep harking on brains making creatures adaptive. An ant has a brain, yet an ant follows a very predictable program that can be quite easily simulated by computers. Of course there is always a randomizaion factor, but you mustn't confuse random action with adaptation.\n \n \nThe brain is the fundamental unit of life - yet evolutionists attempt to explain life by completely ignoring it. \n \n I don't buy it....and you evolutionists are all outmatched by common sense.\n\n Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex. \n \n Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: \"Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded.\"",
