   "I came across this story of James Browns widow being locked out of her house because they weren't married.\n http://www.republicoft.com/2006/12/28/james-brown-where-theres-a-will-and-a-wife/#more-598\n \n Sounds all too familiar for gay couples.\n \n \nWhen I heard this story, I couldn't help thinking of how many times I'd heard it before, when I worked at a gay organization and later at an AIDS organization. I remember opening the door one morning to find a man in tears on the other side. I let him in and sat him down. He calmed down enough to tell me that his partner had just died. They'd been together for years, and he'd cared for his partner through his illness, during which the family remained estranged, having never accepted their son's \"lifestyle\" or relationship. But when the end drew near the partner's family swooped in, and began trying to take control of things.\n \n When his partner died, they unceremoniously tossed him out of the house, because it wasn't in his name and therefore he had no legal right to live there. He, like Tomi Rae Hynie, wasn't so much a spouse as a house guest; years of care and sharing a life together notwithstanding.\n\n \n This is why gay people need marriage. How would it make you anti gay marriage people feel if you were in this situation?",
