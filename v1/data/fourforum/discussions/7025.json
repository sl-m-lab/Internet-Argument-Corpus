   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/opinion/09gumucio.html\n \n December 9, 2005\n Op-Ed Contributor\n Se\u00f1ora Presidente? \n By RAFAEL GUMUCIO\n Santiago, Chile\n CHILE is one of the more conservative countries on a continent that is not especially renowned as tolerant, forward thinking or democratically minded. Divorce was legalized here just last year, and abortion continues to be a taboo subject even for the most progressive of politicians. Our social codes and racial prejudices are deeply engrained. We are an overwhelmingly Catholic country with a history that has been marked - and continues to be marked - by the power of its military.\n \n Given this context, it is nothing short of extraordinary - even revolutionary - that the clear front-runner in the presidential vote being held on Sunday is Michelle Bachelet, a divorced mother of three who is an atheist and a member of the Socialist Party. \n \n Polls show Ms. Bachelet, a former defense minister, far ahead of her rivals, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, one of Chile's wealthiest businessmen; Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn, the ultraconservative former mayor of Santiago; and Tom\u00e1s Hirsch of the Communist Party. Although a runoff is likely, the prevailing opinion here is that Ms. Bachelet will be the ultimate winner. \n \n If she is, she will be the first woman in the Americas to be elected president not because she was a wife of a famous politician, but because of her own record. That this is a probability is even more astonishing when one considers that nothing like it has occurred in countries like the United States or France, where the democratic tradition is far more stable and feminism's impact presumably far greater. Curiously, American television is now running a series that revolves around the \"novel\" idea of a female president. What is fiction in the United States may well become reality in Chile. \n \n The twist is that the Chilean candidate is a far more interesting character than the female president portrayed on American TV: as defense minister, Ms. Bachelet oversaw the successors and subordinates of the men who killed her father and tortured her and her mother during the darkest moments of the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. \n \n How has this happened? Chile, more than ever, is proving itself to be the polar opposite of Lampedusa's Sicily: in order for things to change, they have to stay the same - or rather, they have to look as if they are staying the same. \n \n That is the best way I can describe the spirit with which the country seems to be anticipating the elections: people are aware that no matter what the outcome an unprecedented cultural, political and social revolution is taking place. And at the same time, they seem surprisingly unfazed by it all, observing these sweeping changes with ease, aplomb, even delight.\n \n Perhaps this is because Chileans have by now grown accustomed to wild fluctuations in the country's political fortunes. This past year, the Chilean people saw rightist leaders - until recently General Pinochet's staunchest allies - renouncing all ties to him. General Pinochet is now under house arrest, held not only on human rights charges but also for his alleged role in a financial scandal involving millions of stolen dollars.\n \n In countless other ways, the Pandora's box of Chilean politics has been flung wide open: nowadays it isn't at all strange to see an ultraconservative Catholic candidate signing his name on a transvestite's legs as a publicity stunt, nor is it odd to hear Ms. Bachelet talk about how hard it is to find Mr. Right.\n \n For decades, even centuries, Chilean politics have largely been of the old-boy's-network variety, in which an all-male group of power brokers have run things on their own terms, within a select inner circle, forging alliances with one another and making deals with the press behind closed doors, far removed from the citizenry they represent. \n \n Change in Chile has come at a breakneck pace in recent years, as justice is finally being delivered to dozens of dictatorship-era cronies, and the pillars of the church and the political elite have been shaken to their foundations by a wave of pedophilia scandals involving both.\n \n The changes are abrupt and the contradictions are evident. Thanks to the country's growing economy, Chileans have access to more creature comforts than ever before, and yet prosperity somehow hasn't dulled their sensibilities: the populace that benefits from free-market economics also turned out in droves to pay tribute to Gladys Mar\u00edn, the president of the Communist Party, when her coffin was carried through the streets of Santiago in March. People may be gulping down Starbucks and coveting iPods, but they are also devouring highly irreverent political magazines like The Clinic (for which I write) and flocking to politically oriented movies like \"Machuca,\" which is about the 1973 coup led by General Pinochet. \n \n Some analysts think that the free-market economy is responsible for this unprecedented change in Chile's political and social landscape. But other countries that follow that economic model (Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States), seem to be slouching in the opposite direction toward a retrograde, hard-line conservatism. Economics, then, clearly do not tell the entire story.\n \n Other analysts attribute the change to the current president, Ricardo Lagos, who has concentrated on reconciling Chile with its tortured past. Even so the general consensus is that nobody - not Mr. Lagos, not the Chilean intelligentsia, and certainly not the power elite - was prepared for the seismic social and political shift represented by Ms. Bachelet's thriving candidacy. I don't think anyone would have predicted 10 years ago that we would ever arrive at this moment, but it seems that Chile is eager to usher it in. For us, political and economic stability - despite being so recent and so precious - is not enough.\n \n Just as in 1970, when they went to the polls and elected a Socialist president, and again in 1988, when they rejected their dictator, Chileans have proved themselves to be far more daring with their vote than their lifestyles.\n \n Perhaps this is because when they vote - in secret, where nobody can judge or criticize them - they reveal their truest colors, their passion for change, for improvisation and for leadership in a world that seems hell-bent on moving in the opposite direction. \n \n Rafael Gumucio is a columnist for El Diario in New York and for newspapers in Chile. This article was translated by Kristina Cordero from the Spanish.",

I have no special claim to power, and thus there is no reason for a person to read my recommendations particularly. For that I thank you.\n \n However, I have to say that your description of Chesterton is far off of the truth. He doesn't hide behind vagueness at all, but illustrates his thoughts to the best of his ability (which, if understood, are quite brilliant). Vagueness is one of the attributes which he rightly ascribes to many of the philosophers of his age (and other ages). I have my doubts as to how carefully you engaged yourself in the reading if you believe he \"hides\" behind anything. The work really needs to be read and engaged in slowly and thoughtfully to be properly understood and appreciated. I have to recommend getting through the first four or five chapters, slowly - but again, your efforts are more than most, if not all, on this forum.",

   "Anthony Flew now admits that he was misled about the origin of life, by Gerald Shroeder, who isn't even a biologist. \n \n Flew himself is largely to blame for being misled because he uncritically listened to only one side of the story, accepting it at face value.\n \n Further, Flew's conception of 'God' would not be that of Christianity, Islam, or any such religion, but rather the God of the deists. \n \n \nUpdate (December 2004)\n \n Flew has now given me permission to quote him directly. I asked him point blank what he would mean if he ever asserted that \"probably God exists,\" to which he responded (in a letter in his own hand, dated 19 October 2004):\n \n ******************************\n Flew: I do not think I will ever make that assertion, precisely because any assertion which I am prepared to make about God would not be about a God in that sense ... I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of Aristotle or Spinoza and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations.\n ******************************\n \n Rather, he would only have in mind \"the non-interfering God of the people called Deists--such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.\" Indeed, he remains adamant that \"theological propositions can neither be verified nor falsified by experience,\" exactly as he argued in \"Theology and Falsification.\" Regarding J. P. Moreland using Flew in support of Moreland's own belief in the supernatural, Flew says \"my God is not his. His is Swinburne's. Mine is emphatically not good (or evil) or interested in human conduct\" and does not perform miracles of any kind. Furthermore, Flew took great care to emphasize repeatedly to me that:\n \n ******************************\n Flew: My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species ... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.\n ******************************\n \n He cites, in fact, the improbability arguments of Schroeder, which I have refuted online, and the entire argument to the impossibility of natural biogenesis I have refuted in Biology & Philosophy.\n \n So what of the claim that Flew was persuaded by the Kalam Cosmological Argument? Flew \"cannot recall\" writing any letter to Geivett claiming \"the kalam cosmological argument is a sound argument\" for God but he confesses his memory fails him often now so he can't be sure. Nevertheless, I specifically asked what Antony thought of the Kalam, to which he answered:\n \n ******************************\n Flew: If and insofar as it is supposed to prove the existence of a First Cause of the Big Bang, I have no objection, but this is not at all the same as a proof of the existence of a spirit and all the rest of Richard Swinburne's definition of 'God' which is presently accepted as standard throughout the English speaking and philosophical world.\n ******************************\n \n Also, regarding another rumor that Flew has been attending Quaker meetings, Antony says \"I have, I think, attended Quaker meetings on at least 3 or 4 occasions, and one was at the wedding of a cousin,\" and thus hardly a religious statement on his part but a family affair. Nevertheless, for him and his family generally, he says \"I think the main attraction\" of Quakerism has been \"the lack of doctrines.\" On the whole God thing, though, Flew is still examining the articles I sent him, so he may have more to say in the future.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Update (January 2005)\n \n Antony Flew has retracted one of his recent assertions. In a letter to me dated 29 December 2004, Flew concedes:\n \n ******************************\n Flew: I now realize that I have made a fool of myself by believing that there were no presentable theories of the development of inanimate matter up to the first living creature capable of reproduction.\n ******************************\n \n He blames his error on being \"misled\" by Richard Dawkins because Dawkins \"has never been reported as referring to any promising work on the production of a theory of the development of living matter,\" even though this is false (e.g., Richard Dawkins and L. D. Hurst, \"Evolutionary Chemistry: Life in a Test Tube,\" Nature 357: pp. 198-199, 21 May 1992) and hardly relevant: it was Flew's responsibility to check the state of the field (there are several books by actual protobiologists published in just the last five years), rather than wait for the chance possibility that one particular evolutionist would write on the subject. Now that he has done what he was supposed to do in the first place, he has retracted his false statement about the current state of protobiological science.\n \n Flew also makes another admission: \"I have been mistaught by Gerald Schroeder.\" He says \"it was precisely because he appeared to be so well qualified as a physicist (which I am not) that I was never inclined to question what he said about physics.\" Apart from his unreasonable plan of trusting a physicist on the subject of biochemistry (after all, the relevant field is biochemistry, not physics--yet it would seem Flew does not recognize the difference), this attitude seems to pervade Flew's method of truthseeking, of looking to a single author for authoritative information and never checking their claims (or, as in the case of Dawkins, presumed lack of claims). As Flew admitted to me, and to Stuart Wavell of the London Times, and Duncan Crary of the Humanist Network News, he has not made any effort to check up on the current state of things in any relevant field (see \"No Longer Atheist, Flew Stands by 'Presumption of Atheism'\" and \"In the Beginning There Was Something\"). Flew has thus abandoned the very standards of inquiry that led the rest of us to atheism. It would seem the only way to God is to jettison responsible scholarship.\n \n Despite all this, Flew has not retracted his belief in God, as far as I can tell. But in response to theists citing him in their favor, Flew strangely calls his \"recent very modest defection from my previous unbelief\" a \"more radical form of unbelief,\" and implies that the concept of God might actually be self-refuting, for \"surely there is material here for a new and more fundamental challenge to the very conception of God as an omnipotent spirit,\" but, Flew says, \"I am just too old at the age of nearly 82 to initiate and conduct a major and super radical controversy about the conceivability of the putative concept of God as a spirit.\" This would appear to be his excuse for everything: he won't investigate the evidence because it's too hard. Yet he will declare beliefs in the absence of proper inquiry. Theists would do well to drop the example of Flew. Because his willfully sloppy scholarship can only help to make belief look ridiculous.\n (http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=369)\n \n",

   "Okay. I read it again. Please expose my density. \n\n \n Here's some background.\n \n \nTruthsayer: But there is someting very interesting I would like to share. In my college days, I had to work side jobs. Being a music major with a psyche minor, I found myself working at a state hospital in the \"sunshine <read: rehab< ward.\"\n \n Most people that came in were in before. A few patients actually flew over that cuckoo's nest and went on to lead active and productive lives. Not many achieved that through psycho analysis or medication. For reasons I cannot explain, most of the sucessful cases were attributed to \"Jesus\" or \"God.\" They found religion. Perhaps the opium of the masses is better than aged whiskey. \n\n \n \nDamEtel: Sorry, but that is nothing but hearsay from our point of view. IOW, it's unreliable and untestable.\n\n \n \nTrebor: On the contrary, it is testable. You take the number of people who have come out of an alcoholic rehab , and attribute their getting over their addiction to religion. You then do follow up and see how many stay off the addiction compared to the ones that went strictly through the rehabilitation program.\n\n \n Trebor's proposal doesn't test Truthsayer's personal experiences, which is what Truthsayer conveyed. He even said so himself, more than once:\n \n \nTruthsayer: I am just passing on what I seen personally.\n\n \n and\n \n \nDamEtel: You yourself [Truthsayer] even point out that you were \"passing on what I seen personally\". Get it? What YOU YOURSELF claim to have seen PERSONALLY. Anyone (other than you) who reads your account is outside of the claimed experience. You claim to have witnessed these things, but none of us did. (And hence, without your providing any evidence supporting your claims, they are mere hearsay to us). \n \n Truthsayer: But of course it is sir. Your point? Or was that it?\n\n \n It is Truthsayer's personal experiences that I and he were referring to. And Trebor's proposal would neither confirm nor disconfirm Truthsayer's claimed past personal experiences: all Trebor's proposal could do, essentially, would be help us decide whether or not Truthsayer's claims are reasonable: not if they actually happened.\n \n Which is why I pointed out that Trebor would be testing something completely different: that is, not the same personal experiences that Truthsayer claims to have had. And why I asked if Trebor claims Truthsayer's past personal experiences are testable, then why does he go on to talk about testing something completely different?\n \n \n \n ******************************\n PS: That is what I originally meant throughout: I was addressing Truthsayer's personal experiences, which Trebor's proposal doesn't test. \n \n However, I now have to admit that I thought Trebor was talking about something even more different. When I read Truthsayer's original paragraphs the first time, I noted several key words/phrases such as \"psyche minor\", \"ward\", \"flew over the cuckoo's nest\", and \"psycho analysis or medication\" and the shear weight of them led me to think that he was talking about mental patients in a mental ward. Trebor, on the other hand, was clearly talking about alcoholics. It wasn't until I just reread the two people's posts back to back that I saw the term \"rehab\" in both, and figured out that Truthsayer could have meant something other than a mental patients in a mental ward.\n \n So now I admit that Trebor's proposal could test the general nature of Truthsayer's rehab claims, but it still could not test his claimed personal experiences, which is what I was actually addressing.",
