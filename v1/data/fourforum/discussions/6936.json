   "Jo Bennett: [Einstein] spent the last decades of his life trying, and failing, to come up with a workable theory of quantum gravity. \n\n \n \nDamEtel: No, not quantum gravity. IIRC, what Einstein was trying to unify, but never accomplished, in the last decades of his life was gravity and the electromagnetic force.\n\n \n \nJo Bennett: Current theories unify electromagnetic, strong and weak forces. Einstein was trying to get them to match up with relativity.\n\n \n No, he wasn't. He was trying to unify GRAVITY and the ELECTOMAGNETIC FORCE. He wasn't dealing with the weak nuclear or strong nuclear forces, which weren't even know at the time, and not with quantum mechanics either.\n \n I was going off memory the first time I replied, but now looked and found that I was correct.\n \n \n\"Maxwell had previously unified electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism, and Einstein sought to unify electromagnetism and gravity, but his quest for a unified theory never succeeded.\" (Edward Harrison, Cosmology: The Science of the Universe: Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p232) \n\n \n \n\"Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) ... The last few decades of his life were devoted to an unsuccessful search for a unified theory that would combine gravitation and electromagnetism.\" (Raymond A. Serway & Jerry S. Faughn, College Physics: Fifth Edition, Harcourt College Publishers, circa 2000, p861) \n\n \n \n\"In Einstein's day, the strong and weak forces had not yet been discovered, but he found the existence of even two forces - gravity and electromagnetism - deeply troubling. Einstein did not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. This launched his thirty-year voyage in search of the so-called unified field theory that he hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations of one grand underlying principle.\" (Brian Greene, The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory, Vintage Books, 1999, p15) \n",

   "I just have to remark on how nice and clean and sensible the world of science is in comparison to the world of religion where endless word games and hair splitting go tediously on.\n\n Wow! The words of a true non-scientist.\n Scientists participate in word games and hair splitting all the time.\n It's part of the game.",
