   "I heard two things today that both surprised me and pleased me greatly. First, someone, I don't remember who, offered any employee of the LA Times a half million dollars if they will leak that tape for National viewing before the election. And I understand that someone else added 200,000 more to that figure if it happens. I can't believe that some lib on the staff there wouldn't sell Ossama out for 700,000 dollars. So maybe we'll see that tape before this is finished.\n \n Secondly, and this really surprised me. This democratically orchestrated early voting program intended to give Ossama a big enough early lead over McCain to demoralize the right and keep them from bothering to come out and vote is apparently back firing big time. It seems that Republican turnout for early voting is outpacing the dems by 4 or 5 percentage points. This really surprised me since the dems advertised on TV to push for this, where as the pubs haven't pushed it at all that I have seen.\n \n Add to that the disillusionment of the moderate democrats out there along with the misinformation and manipulations by the dems campaign and I see no reason at all to believe that all of those early voting dems are voting for Obama anyway.",
