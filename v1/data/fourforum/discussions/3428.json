Younger kids in high school who are not as mature and responsable would gain much easier access. So the idea or spectacle that people would gain is high school scores would most likley drop, more teens would be drunk on the road, and mainly drinking is accessible to a younger and not mature and responsable enough age group.\n The reason I beleive 19 would be the best age level is because you are out of that high school age limit.

A YEAR or your life for having something that is found in numorous other products. That is not fair. I've just as many adults make more irresponsible decisions when using alcohols than my peers.
