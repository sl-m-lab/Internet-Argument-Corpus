A claim refuted by modern science, yet these claims persist, and are even supported on a wide variety of anti-gay political web-sites.\n 3) Claiming people are at risk from HIV by being around gays. This has mostly died down, although some gross exaggerations of facts continue. Like Senator Bill Frist claiming that AIDS can be transmitted through sweat or tears.",

   "\"Elaine Donnelly, president of the Center for Military Readiness, told Family News in Focus gay activists are just trying to stir up trouble. In fact, she said, about once a month the pro-gay group, located on the University of California-Santa Barbara campus, puts out inaccurate or outdated information. \n \n \"This is another phony story generated by the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military,\" she said. \"They're trying to create an illusion of support or a need to repeal the law that says homosexuality is incompatible with military service.\" \n \n The document causing the controversy, Donnelly explained, lists a number of reasons a person might be ineligible to serve in the military including mental retardation and physical disabilities. And under \"don't ask don't tell,\" the military has the right to include homosexuals. \"\n http://family.org/cforum/news/a0040987.cfm\n \n MORE anti-gay people lying...\n \n This representative of the \"CMR\" is LYING when she says: \"And under \"don't ask don't tell,\" the military has the right to include homosexuals.\"\n \n DADT does not say gays have a \"right\" to be in the military or that the military has a \"right\" to include homosexuals. The law EXPLICITLY states that gays are not allowed to serve, and DADT only sets up a guideline by which the military isn't as focused on rooting out the gays as they used to be.\n \n And the punch-line? This LYING schmuck EXPLICITLY states on the CMR web-site that DADT does NOT allow homosexuals to serve in the military.\n http://www.cmrlink.org/HMilitary.asp?docID=29\n \n They REPEAT the fact that gays are not allowed to serve in this article on their web-site...\n http://www.cmrlink.org/printfriendly.asp?docID=112\n \n The statements of the PRESIDENT of the CMR are directly contradicted by HER OWN WEB-SITE!!!\n \n Oh wait! There's more!\n Check out the LAST SENTENCE on the last web-site...\n \"CMR President Elaine Donnelly has met with Bush Administration officials to request that the comic book be recalled immediately. Instead, all military personnel should be provided with the actual language and legislative history of the law passed in 1993 with overwhelming, bi-partisan majorities in both houses of Congress.\"\n \n And another statement from this president of the CMR AGAIN directly stating that gays are not allowed to serve in the military: \"Despite Congress' enactment of a law banning homosexuality from the military, these training sessions have been going on for a long time.\"\n http://www.policycounsel.org/18856/37901.html\n \n Not only does his organization's web-site EXPLICITLY state that gays aren't allowed to serve, SHE HERSELF HAS DIRECTLY talked to the president about it and EXPLICITLY stated that gays are not allowed to serve in the military under the law. Like oh-so-many anti-gay people who talk out both sides of their mouth...\n \n Why oh why do so many anti-gay people lie?",
