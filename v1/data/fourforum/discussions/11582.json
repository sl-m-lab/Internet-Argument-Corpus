Instead, a lab led by Jack Szostak, a molecular biologist at Harvard Medical School, is building simple cell models that can almost be called life.\n Szostak's protocells are built from fatty molecules that can trap bits of nucleic acids that contain the source code for replication. Combined with a process that harnesses external energy from the sun or chemical reactions, they could form a self-replicating, evolving system that satisfies the conditions of life, but isn't anything like life on earth now, but might represent life as it began or could exist elsewhere in the universe. \n While his latest work remains unpublished, Szostak described preliminary new success in getting protocells with genetic information inside them to replicate at the XV International Conference on the Origin of Life in Florence, Italy, last week. The replication isn't wholly autonomous, so it's not quite artificial life yet, but it is as close as anyone has ever come to turning chemicals into biological organisms.http://www.yahoo.com/s/950314",

   "Wouldn't you think that if life happened accidently, that with the technology available to us today that we would be able to reverse engineer what we observe and fairly easily create life from non living chemicals?\n\n Try not to keep falling into the trap of false duality. The absence of a creator does not mean the occurrence of first life had to be an accident. To paraphrase an analogy from another post, if you drop a rock the direction it goes is not accidental.\n \n As far as creating life from non-living chemicals, why, we all of us do that, every day of our lives, as we renew the cells of which we are composed. Even a bacterium is capable of taking non-living chemicals and from them constructing - another bacterium. So if you think the idea is somehow implausible you really haven't thought things through.\n \n Most of the difficulties arise in a) accurately manipulating materials on that sort of scale, and b) figuring out what to put together in the first place. Nature had the advantage in the first respect: fairly obviously it's easier for a machine to make something of roughly the same scale as itself compared to something fiddly and small, and you can aptly think of bacteria as machines for making more bacteria. \n \n In terms of figuring out what to put together in the first place, again nature has the advantage over humans. We're limited by lab-space, grant money, patience, etc etc. We can only physically try so many combinations, so we need to model the problem, figure out what we should make in order to enhance the odds of success in creating a simple, self-replicating organism. Nature, on the other hand, had as much time as it needed and an entire universe to work with - not to make complex creatures like people or even bacteria from non-life, but to give rise to the first self-replicators, from which the inexorable forces of evolution could fashion everything else.\n \n \nAnd why can't they get these sequences right so that they could evolve and do something useful\", or evolve into complex animal life?\n\n How do you know they couldn't? Have you waited the 2 billion years it took it to happen the first time? No? Then you're jumping the gun somewhat.\n \nJust look at the chain of symbiotic and interdependent life forms that exists on Earth, can you imagine the odds against even one of those forms of life happening\n\n Let me just pause you there before you finish the strawman you're constructing. I've tried to explain this before but it doesn't seem to have sunk in. The interdependency of life did not all have to spring into existence simultaneously. It evolved.\n \n Take a simple hypothetical example. We start with one species of life on earth, species A. It depends upon nothing other than raw chemicals and sunlight for its reproduction. In the process of performing its biological activity it creates a particular intermediate chemical, Z, which it then processes further. \n \n Next, a mutation arises within species A which results in increased production of Z - which is good, but now there's actually more than it can use, and the excess is secreted into the environment. This opens the door to a second mutation within the population, one which decreases the production of Z. Instead, these mutants consume the excess Z produced by the first mutants. And as it happens, this turns out to be more of a good thing for the first mutants because the excess Z in their environment was getting in the way.\n \n Without anything particularly unlikely occurring, we've ended up with two interdependent species. Thus it is with life on Earth: organisms evolve that exploit opportunities created by other organisms - but because everything's evolving all the time, their existence opens up new opportunities to exploit, and so on, and so on, ad infinitum.\n \nthe fact that given another hundred, or another thousand years, Man will never sequence enough genomes and add enough chemicals to create complex life from non life, which is the goal.\n\n No, it isn't the goal. You may want it to be the goal because it's very difficult and we're unlikely to succeed any time soon, but first life was not complex, it was simple. Complexity arose through aeons of evolution.\n \n Anyway, this is really fascinating news. I wonder how relevant the methods used are to the various theories of abiogenesis...",

   "So, given that Archie will not discuss this in any way which might resemble meaningful discussion, I suggest we ignore him and simply discuss the topic he raised.\n \n Producing some sort of self replicating bubble will almost certainly happen, maybe in our life times. It will be a \"simple\" chemical reaction, at least compare to full scale life, but I think it could happen. But life as we know it is tricky. At some point billions of years ago some \"cell\" absorbed some other \"cell\", and the absorbed cell eventually became mitochondria, the \"powerhouse\" of modern day cells. Life would have progressed without that event, but it would likely have been a much less energetic form of life. To make anything that your average layperson would look at and say \"yeah, that's alive\" would require somehow replicating that happy accident. Perhaps you could code all of the mitochondira's DNA into your artificial cell's DNA, but I wouldn't assume that off the bat. Of course we could find some other energy source, or simply accept a lower energy cell, but either case will take a great deal of thought and experimentation to realize.",

Yet, how long could one interdependent organism survive while waiting for its supporting organism to evolve enough to actually affect it in a symbiotic way? \n \n At the level of simple celled life we are discussing here, and the time it took to evolve into more complex life forms, we are talking about literally billions of years according to your pseudo science.

SO STOP ACTING LIKE THE TEACHER TO MY PUPIL BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING ON ME REGARDING THIS SHODDY THEORY OF YOURS. Back on topic though.\n \n Your method of evolution is self contradictory in that at its core, your cellular evolution is carnivorous and even cannibalistic because the excess chemicals would be consumed by a new variety of chemical which allegedly led to a new and unique, yet symbiotic life form. And we know that microscopic organisms only form of defense is to consume, infect, attack and kill its competition in order to insure its survival. It is why we have developed an immune system specifically designed to attack and kill foreign organisms that invade our bodies.\n \n But you want to now say that these foreign antibodies, germs and chemicals somehow worked in tandem with other foreign bodies that according to natural laws we live by today, would have attacked each other and would never have worked together symbiotically in order to force life forward. Unless the nature of what we know about cellular life has somehow changed.\n \n And add to that, that we are talking about a time over 4 billion years ago when we had an atmosphere of sulfuric acid, and the surface of the Earth was an ocean of lava. neither of which is conducive to promoting life on Earth. \n \n And if you forward this premise to one any species of complex life that relies on a lower species below it on the chain of life, and to the species directly above it on the chain of life, how did it survive from generation to generation and decide which direction to evolve in without the pressure placed on it by it's competing and supporting species, and the predatory species above it?

You've got it exactly backwards. Evolution is opportunistic, not pre-emptive.

We've seen it happen. A few decades ago there was no such thing as Nylon. Subsequent to its invention, a species of bacteria evolved that can digest nylon waste products.

Thus your contention that symbiosis cannot evolve is empirically disproven.\n \nYour method of evolution is self contradictory in that at its core, your cellular evolution is carnivorous and even cannibalistic because the excess chemicals would be consumed by a new variety of chemical which allegedly led to a new and unique, yet symbiotic life form.\n\n No; maybe I wasn't clear enough. In my thought experiment both the organisms overproducing Z and those that have evolved to consume the excess are descended from the same species, A. It's not about brand new life arising to consume Z, but rather a single species diversifying and specialising. \n \n That's the core principle of common descent. First life - the very first replicator - operates in an otherwise lifeless world. But as it reproduces, its offspring find themselves in a world that includes other organisms like themselves. That's not the same as the environment in which their progenitor appeared: there are new chemical byproducts, and competition for resources. So now it's possible for variants to appear that exploit these new chemicals and compete more effectively for those resources in different ways. Life starts to specialise. More exploitable niches appear. On and on and on.\n \nBut you want to now say that these foreign antibodies, germs and chemicals somehow worked in tandem with other foreign bodies that according to natural laws we live by today, would have attacked each other and would never have worked together symbiotically in order to force life forward.

Think: would first life have had an immune system? Of course not: to what would it need to be immune? What defensive or offensive capabilities would it have had? None! It's a simple replicator.\n \n Going back to my thought experiment, why would the two mutants evolve an intolerance of each other? They're beneficial to each other! Any that evolved an intolerance would do less well and be out-bred by those who remained cooperative.\n \n And take you, for instance. You are not inimical to all other species. Your body contains ten times as many bacteria as human cells: you are a mini-ecology in your own right. Your immune system doesn't just protect you, it protects the whole of that ecology. What it does reject are bacteria that unbalance that ecology and jeopardize its survival. So the idea that all life must inevitably attack other life rather than coexist is manifestly wrong.\n \nAnd add to that, that we are talking about a time over 4 billion years ago when we had an atmosphere of sulfuric acid, and the surface of the Earth was an ocean of lava. neither of which is conducive to promoting life on Earth. \n\n Well, not quite; evidence is that the crust would have been solid for almost 500,000,000 years before life arose, and the atmosphere at the time was composed largely of CO2, nitrogen, water vapour and ammonia.\n \nAnd if you forward this premise to one any species of complex life that relies on a lower species below it on the chain of life, and to the species directly above it on the chain of life, how did it survive from generation to generation and decide which direction to evolve in without the pressure placed on it by it's competing and supporting species, and the predatory species above it?\n\n The answer is, once again, staring you in the face: organisms aren't subject to predatory pressure until predators evolve that exploit them. In the meantime, they evolve in response to the pressure placed upon them by the existing environment. Sexual selection also allows a species to impose directional pressure on its evolution. As it happens, the cichlids of Lake Tanganyika demonstrate very nicely what happens when a species finds itself without predators: it diversifies like mad. Absent the pruning force of predation, variation runs riot. \n \n Think about it: if 'squigs' exist, then it's perfectly possible for something that eats squigs to evolve, right? No problem for evolution there. So now squigs are subject to predatory pressure, with the squig-eaters subject to a reciprocal pressure to keep up. And now that squig-eaters exist, something that eats the squig-eaters can evolve, right? Thus putting squig-eaters in the mid-range position you claim is impossible via evolution.

And your belief that any of what you say has been proven, or observed in any real way is wishful thinking at best. Only by perfectly duplicating conditions that existed at the alleged time when life supposedly first appeared approximately 4.6 billion years ago, as your side believes, could convincing experiments, and therefore reliable results possibly be attained. \n \n Not theoretical conditions, but real, verifiable condition.

   "Wouldn't you think that if life happened accidently, that with the technology available to us today that we would be able to reverse engineer what we observe and fairly easily create life from non living chemicals?\n\n \n This was the original question.\n \n \nTry not to keep falling into the trap of false duality. The absence of a creator does not mean the occurrence of first life had to be an accident. To paraphrase an analogy from another post, if you drop a rock the direction it goes is not accidental.\n \n As far as creating life from non-living chemicals, why, we all of us do that, every day of our lives, as we renew the cells of which we are composed. Even a bacterium is capable of taking non-living chemicals and from them constructing - another bacterium. So if you think the idea is somehow implausible you really haven't thought things through.\n\n \n This being the first response, really turns the original question from replicating life, to one of evolution vs creationism.\n \n I'm not going to get into all the cellular stuff cause I'm pretty stupid in that area, however, lets take a look at this from a theological perspective.\n \n Peeling states, \"The absence of a creator does not mean the occurrence of first life had to be an accident.\" and then states, \"To paraphrase an analogy from another post, if you drop a rock the direction it goes is not accidental.\n \n I would argue that in the absence of a creator, the occurence of life did in fact have to be accident. To suggest otherwise negates the logic that any occurence that is non-accidental requires \"purpose\". Even if that purpose is just the end result.

The act of dropping the rock may have been an accident, however it's decent and exact point at where it will come to rest is determined by the laws of nature already put in place.\n \n Answering the underlying question of this thread can certainly be munipulated with symantics, however, if the final answer to evolution is the creation of life, then it must be done in a complete vacuum.\n \n The \"theory\" of creationism, (Christitian, Judiaism, Muslim) states that God \"breathed\" light and matter into existance.\n \n To create life out of existing micro-organisims, is to do so with created matter, and proves nothing short of the ability manipulate God's stuff.\n \n The belief in an accident, requires infinately more faith, than the belief in a Creator with a purpose....... \n \n oooooh, I like that!
