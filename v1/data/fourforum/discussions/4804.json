Whether performed by doctors or not is a non issue.\n\n All right, if it is a non issue let it be so. Let me just note that because of this non issue factor a girl may become infertile etc. etc. At least from that point of view, it's better to rely not on doctors but other sources of practical help.\n \n \nSo let me get this straight: the girl, through the act of murdering her child, asks God to forgive her for making the mistake of getting pregnant? What would lead one to believe that God would accept a child sacrifice as a payment for a mistake?\n\n Wow! How do you want to get this straight if you attempt to make a mess with such new definitions as sacrifice? Nevermind...\n \n Imagine: she totally gave in to a man whom she saw as a moral hero, her partner for life and so on. And then, what a disappointment, he turned out to be a rare XXXXX, traitor and coward. And the main mistake was the wrong guy, not the pregnancy. (Perhaps she was not properly educated not to give herself in to XXXXXX, that happens). So why should she suffer because of one drop of semen? She has learned her mistake, there is no need to have a child. She can find a second guy who is really right for her and have ten children then and be happy... (Mind you, as a result of the same drop of semen and an abortion she can become infertile).\n \n Speaking of sacrifice, it's not bad to remember the ancient cultures with the first child sacrifice to Molokh. The reason was the same: the first child can be a result of who knows what.\n \n \nWhy only in the case of a first pregnancy? We all know that humans make mistakes. We also know that all human don't learn from their mistakes after making them. What happens if a girl finds herself in a second unwanted pregnancy or a third or a fourth?\n\n Nobody likes bad students, after the first pregnancy \"terminated\" through dry fasting the girl has enough time to learn something spiritually and not to do silly mistakes. For about 10 months she can openly have sex without getting pregnant (that is, no contraception required) and receive enough experience not to mess with the XXXXXX.\n \n If the second pregnancy is needed (if that person is expected to be born from Above), they may conserve the fetus in mother's womb for up to three years even if the mother attempts to fast: she will be like female armadillo. Here again, it's not for the human to decide who is to be born.",

Thus, this is no reason whatsoever to say that the first child can be seen as expendable.\n \n \n \nNobody likes bad students, after the first pregnancy \"terminated\" through dry fasting the girl has enough time to learn something spiritually and not to do silly mistakes.

To murder one's child as a means of seeking forgiveness of sin is child sacrafice. I assume that of all the spiritual lessons one may learn in the time after terminating her pregnancy (i don't use quotes because that is what is happening), God's potential disaproval of child sacrifice doesn't enter into the mix.
