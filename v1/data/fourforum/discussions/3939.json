   "I mean think about it. It's pretty clear that parents of today are definitely more lazy and less involved with their kids than parents of the past. Disciplining kids is hard work and takes a great deal of energy and consistency. I firmly believe that many kids diagnosed as having ADD/ADHD (or whatever the hell it is) are simply the product of lazy parents. While I don't have a sampling sufficient enough to classify as a scientific study, I can site my wife's experiences as a pre-school teacher. She is very strict and has had several kids who have been been diagnosed with this \"condition\" and has gotten them under control (without their medication). She evn had one lady who was CONSIDERING taking her child in to be diagnosed and to get the medication and my wife told her that she has him under control in the classroom. The mother said at home he's out of control (I thought this was a condition that couldn't be controlled without medication...go figure) and even with this input provided by my wife, the mother still chose to go for the medication...lazy XXX parent. No doubt I've ****** some folks off here, but I'd sure love to hear the opinions anyway...have at it",

   "I think there is certainly such thing as ADD. I don't think it is nearly as common as some would have you believe. I believe there is such thing as depression. I don't think it is nearly as common as people seem to think (especially health care/mental health professionals in both cases) seem to believe.\n \n You look at the number of cases of ADD/ADHD in this country, and they have been incresing fairly consistently fo a long time. I have trouble believeing that we are just breeding ADD prone children. \n \n To me this is a case of misuse of the prescription pad by doctors. Granted they can prescribe ritalin and the childs perfomance is likely to improve in school. If YOU started taking ritalin, there is a good chance that your performance would improve at work. Cocain would do the same thing for you. It allows hyperattentiveness. Many stimulants do this (ephederine, crystal meth, all sorts of stuff).\n \n I think that before we decide that every kid on the planet who fails to perform at school needs to be on ADD medication (usually ritalin) we need to ask some pretty serious questions regarding the negative side effects of the drug and how badly it is shredding their little brains.\n \n When I was 18 I got a call one night form a friend of my sisters. My sister, who had been taking prescription antidepressants, had run out 3 days before. She was trying to claw out her eyes and kill herself.\n \n the next monday the psychiatrist who had been feeding her things for years told me that \"it is not at all uncommon for young girls who have been taking anti depressants for years to become suicidally depressed if they are taken off of them\". If there had not been 6 other people in the room, I would have smashed that SOB's head against the corner of his desk until there was nothing left but mush.\n \n I started looking into it, and found that giving anti depressants to teenage girls like they are pez is a pretty common practice anymore. Have a bad day? Having a rough time with your teenage years ( I think the teenage years areespecially hard on girls and they tend to go a little nutty sometimes. Boys don't go nuts until their early 20's)? Well, we have some little red pills that will make it all better.\n \n I can certainly envision Ritalin becoming for boys (who are most often diagnosed with ADD/ADHD) what those antidepressants are for teenage girls; prescribed chemical dependance with long term negative effects.\n \n My solution would be to take baout 2/3 of the \"mental health\" professionals out there and make them get real jobs. The remainder can be barred from treating anybodyt who is not seriously mentally ill (schizo, psychotic, whatever). The rest of us can get by without paying somebody $100 per hour to tell us that \"it is not your fault\". \n \n Make a friend, find a good bartender, get married, whatever. Just stay out of the shrinks office. I think those folks destroy more lives than any other profession out there.\n \n As an interesting side note, the same sister, who is to this day heavily medicated, has grown up to be a psychiatrist. You would think that somebody who can't make it through the day themselves without a large assortment of mood altering substances would be a ratehr poor choice to help others with their emotional \"problems\", most of which could likely be solved if they could find somebody to smack them on the back of the head and tell them to \"get your **** together. Call off the XXXXXXn pity parade and quite your whining\". My father was always good at this. I am sure that he would be happy to volunteer to do this for folks on saturday morning (on sundays he could smack them on the back of the head and give his famous \"you'd better straighten up and fly right or you will find my footprint on your XXX\" speech to those who think they have ADD).",

I know its a fantasy, but I`m fairly convident that we could get pretty far by simply realising that behavioural disorders are merely disorders because that particular behaviour is viewed as deviant or obstructive in certain situations.\n\n Imbalance is imbalance - whether it's in the brain due to chemicals or from the lack of simple discipline. It is very hard to diagnose the difference when a child has no clue why they are acting different, or in a way that cannot promote their ability to fit into society, or that a certain behavior is required.\n Like Pnac said, we should not \"hammer\" our children to fit into a society, but we can't allow abnormal behavior to go unchecked, either. It is required that parents be aware of their area's lifestyle, which in the USA doesn't differ that much from coast to coast, and are able to situate a child so that he or she can easily adjust as they mature. When we see that a child is not adjusting, then we have to step in and influence their behavior. It's a touchy subject and one that most parents are reluctant to discuss outside the bubble of parenthood.\n \n Getting any institution to change for the good of just one maladjusted child is a fantasy, Eddie, but a noble one...coming from a loving parent.",

Kids go from the womb right into daycare and then latchkey. Sad. And these parents still have the nerve to say they are parenting. No you aren't. Get a grip. Kids need a parent to care, BE THERE, stay consistant and put them first. It just isn't happening in this society. Kids are getting more and more selfish, egotistical and jerkish just like their parents. It's a sad sad truth.\n\n \n Take your judgements and shove them yingyang.

The fact that he is not a psychiatrist does not mean he cannot have formed a viewpoint on the subject either through personal experience, study, or just pulled one out of his butt. Regardless of how he formed his viewpoint, until shown invalid, it is just as valid as any other put forth.\n \n From a practical standpoint, the field of psychiatric study has gone through so many sweeping paradigm shifts that the fact he is NOT a psychiatrist, and his views are NOT mainstream, makes them (from a historical standpoint) more likely to be correct than if his views were mainstream and he was a professional working in the field.\n \n Besides strictly physiological problems, psychology is an entirely soft science. Very little is proven, and the field is dominated by theories which are often only partially formed to begin with. At one time, Freud was considered a well respected psychologist. Today, his views are widely scorned. \n \n I think if you look at the field of psychology as a whole, you will find that historically it has changed often and drastically. I think you will likely find this prevalent enough that it is safe to say that the majority of the views held by psychologist today will be considered fanciful 100 years from now.",

   "Ok. Prove it. Show studies. Untill then, this is armchair pediatric psychiatry.\nThat was stated as an opinion. Had I made it as a claim of factuality, I would be burdened to back it up.\n \n I can back up my opinion simply with the right to have it until some facts are presented that show otherwise. I have noticed in the articles that I read about ADHD and ADD that the experts seem to have varying opinions on the effects of TV.\n \n I've put several links below, but there are hundreds of other sites available through a simple Copernic search.\n \n My guess (opinion) as to why TV adds to the problem of attention span is that the TV can switch so fast among programs, channels, images, commercials and (I can't find the article at home, but I have a magazine with a super story about subliminal messages on TV) there are subliminal messages that the viewer is virtually unaware of.\n \n \n \n\n Yes. Some people, but the vast majority---no.\nWhat is a vast majority?\n \n I agree with what you say...basically.\n \n \n ...aside (practice with the [Q U O T E]...[/Q U O T E] commands.

You, on the other hand, are saying quite the opposite of them. I would expect you to have some qualifications.\nMy name is not Bud. I'm sure you know what some psychiatrists say, but not all of them.\n \n I am saying the opposite of some of them, but not all of them. I have no idea the percentage of them that argue one side or the other, but I do know one personally who thinks as I do...that ADHD and ADD are not what they are reported to be.\n \n Several of the articles I read say that psychiatrists do not agree with each other. In cases such as this it comes down to agreeing with those who hold more closely to your original viewpoint rather than switching sides to be fashionable.\n \n As daewoo pointed out, psychiatry is a soft science. It contains many points of contention among its experts. When two psychiatrists claim opposing \"facts\", one of them is wrong.\n \n \n \n \n\n Don't think without backup. It's worthless rhetoric otherwise. This is a discussion board, and it inane to go around saying \"I think all these qualiified professionals are wrong, but I am right.\" THIs disorder is just a fake caused by TV~.\nI did not say TV was the sole cause.\n \n \n \n\n Until he shows why he thinks that, instead of reaching into the depths of his college psychological training, it's worthless.\nI had no psychology classes in college. You're being presumptuous.\n \n \n \n\n The I THINK statement is pointless when it comes to him stating ADD is a farce. Say what you know if you aren't willing to put facts on the table with I Think Conjectures.\nNay, nay. My opinion is valid regardless of backup.\n \n I think WWL (\"professional\" wrestling) is a farce.\n \n I think Julia Roberts is pretty. (I also think her lips are too big.)\n \n I think Millie Perkins was prettier. (She played Anne Frank in the B&W movie many years ago...stole my heart with her looks.)\n \n I think Balzac was an ugly dude.\n \n I think Micheal Moore is a piece of dung.\n \n I think Farenheit 9-11 is not a documentary and should not have been given any awards in that category.\n \n I think my grandchildren are the cutest and greatest that have ever been, ever will be.\n \n \n I can't prove any of the above opinions or back them up with anything other than matching opinions from some of my friends or former wives.\n \n Let me concede a bit though and say that I know there are mental conditions (notice I did not say illnesses) that some doctors and a boat load of teachers have come to recognize as ADHD and ADD. These conditions exist. What I say is that they are not mental illnesses and are caused more by the present day environment of instant communication and information gluts rather than a physical condition within the brain cells of the poor lads and lasses who get bombarded with some numbing chemicals. The effects of animation and special effects can also be mind boggling. Children need to see things happen naturally else they will someday believe that Spider Man actually exists.\n \n My wife's grandmother literally loved to watch \"wrestling\", but commented once during a John Wayne movie, \"Now, you know they didn't kill all them indians just to make that movie.\"\n \n Voltaire is said to have claimed that he learned patience by watching a spider. Today's children could come closer to being patient if they observed and enjoyed nature more than they now observe the video screens.\n \n Take your children to the park or the wilderness, and teach them to play chess with real handcarved men.\n \n http://www.sncs.org/articles/television.htm\n add and tv\n \n http://www.turnoffyourtv.com/healtheducation/tv_adhd/tv_adhdmain.html\n \n http://www.time-scout.com/learn/ADHD_Children.pdf\n \n http://www.free-wellness-report.com/add/computer-games-and-attention-deficit-disorder.htm\n \n http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2001895819_tvhurtskids05m.html",
