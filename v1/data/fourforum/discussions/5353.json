   "only met John Kerry once - through Jane - during his Vietnam protest days. You have to remember, Jane and I weren't really close during the late sixties, early seventies, and I was far less into geopolitical minutia than she was, zonked as I often found myself on acid or fifty-cent jug wine, so what I do recollect of ol' Johnny is kinda hazy. Back in the day all we wanted was to party and not be hassled by the man.\n \n The most striking thing about him, as I remember, was just how much he looked like that cartoon chick from the Campbell's Soup ads - same hair, same jut to the jaw, same goofy smile. Only, y'know, Kerry was much taller than the cartoon chick, and he wore fatigues.\n \n Anyway, it was '71, I think, and Hopper and I were having a few friends over one night to watch Willy Wonka, when Jane shows up just before midnight, high on Thai stick and dragging with her this lumbering dude dressed in military casuals. \"This is John Kerry,\" she tells us. \"He's a special friend of the anti-war cause.\"\n \n Hopper just kinda laughed at him and snorted a line of coke, but I was like, \"Hey, man. That's like really groovy. Grab yourself a seat,\" which he did. And he sat there very quietly for the most part - at least until we all took turns licking this toad Dennis'd brought back from the Arizona desert. This was during our \"organic high\" phase. Bufo alvarius, I think the toad is called. Has\n 50-160 mg 5-MeO-DMT/g in it's skin. Good sh*t.\n \n Getting back to the story, though, after we all'd hit the toad a few times, Kerry began giggling like a little girl every time the Oompa Loompas came on screen. He kept pointing at them, calling them \"his little talky fruits\" - though I don't think he meant they were gay or anything, just that they kinda reminded him of oranges, y'know? Then he'd squeal, \"I love midgets. I want to purchase a gross of midgets. Does anybody know where I can find me some freakin midgets for sale?\" I have to laugh at that now, seeing how Kerry was most afraid of that midget Howard Dean during the primaries. Anyhoo, we just sat back feeling groovy and passed the toad around.\n \n And then we all passed out - Kerry by himself on the couch, Hopper and I inside of Kaye Lenz.\n \n In any event, I don't remember seeing him after that. But I'm sure he's a together kinda guy. And I have no doubt he'd have made a serviceable president. I mean hell, you probably could've talked him into adding a couple of dwarves to his cabinet, right?\n \n But now I'm just rambling. Too much grass before lunch does that to me, absolutely ruins me for the rest of the day - though in my defense, who in his right mind is gonna pass up a couple bowls of freshly-packed Hawaiian X, right? Which, kudos to you, Jerry Brown! That was some primo herb.",
