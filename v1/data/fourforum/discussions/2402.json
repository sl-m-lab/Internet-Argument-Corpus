   "I was thinking on the drive home tonight about Robert Frost saying that, \"A liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel.\" That's when it hit me that, using his definition, all but a small percentage of Americans are conservatives. His definition implies that a conservative is a person who takes his or her own side in an argument. It's no surprise that we call a person a conservative when he is a businessman arguing for less regulation or lower taxes, but a union member who fights right-to-work laws or for more generous unemployement insurance is a conservative. So is the women fighting for abortion rights since she wants to ensure her autonomy. A black man arguing racial preferences or expansion of the welfare state is a conservative in this sense. Hispanics pushing for immigration rights and more social programs--yep, they're conservatives too. \n \n Then there is the odd duck we call a liberal. I was a liberal for a long time, so I have some insight into the psychology, at least for someone like me. A liberal is very much guided by a morality; liberals are very moral in a certain sense. The central priniciple of that morality is to be generous to others and miserly toward oneself. It is the guiding spirit behind saying \"No, no\" when someone says that you are special or anything connected with you is special, like for example, your culture. Morality is not to stand up for your interests--standing up for yourself is common, low, small. Morality is to stand up for others. You will be a good person to the extent that you battle for others. \n \n One major problem with this ethic is that the whole world is fighting for their interests, and the liberal is right beside them. But who fights for the liberal? Who fights for the liberal's child? I am reminded of black San Francisco mayor Willie Brown's response to a white mother who said concerning racial preferences, \"But what about MY child?\" He answered, \"I don't give a damn about your child.\" What happens to the liberal in a world of interest-pursuers? Their morality allows no aggressive self-defense, so sooner or later they will be gobbled up by the rest.\n \n I know this is a stupid question, but does anyone disagree? ;)",
