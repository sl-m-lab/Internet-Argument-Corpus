Especially against Americans United for Separation of Church and State....\n \n Now that all efforts have been exhausted, we must begin our Imprecatory Prayer, at the key points of the parliamentary role in the earth where we live.\n \n John Calvin gave the church its marching orders from Scripture. The righteous have dominion, but only through imprecatory prayer against the ungodly.\n \n David as our Old Testament shepherd gives us many Imprecatory prayers, and can be found to be in best focus in Psalm 109....\n \n Pray these back to God and He will answer.... Let us join Paul and declare anathema upon anyone\" who loves not the Lord Jesus.\" \n \n Please join us, with Bible in hand, and let us do battle against the enemies of God.\n\n Pastor Wiley Drake Calls for Imprecatory Prayer against So-Called Religious Liberty Watchdog Group - Christian Newswire\n \n Imprecatory prayer: a prayer wishing harm upon one's opponents",
