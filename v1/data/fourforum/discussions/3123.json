   "The following excerpts are from Mr. Sobrans speech, \"Power and Betrayal: The Clinton Legacy\", delivered on Nov. 15, 1997.\n \n \n \"We speak obsessively of \"hate\", but the hate we refer to is only a certain kind of social prejudice: hatred of racial minorities, and so forth. It seems to be a temptation chiefly for white Christian heterosexual males, and the remedy for it is to give government more power to supervise everyone's associations and even motives...\n ...\n We are constantly reminded of the hatred of whites for blacks, men for women, Christians for Jews, heterosexuals for homosexuals, majorities for minorities, natives for foreigners, believers for non-believers. We have a whole lexicon of cant words: racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, nativism, ethnocentrism, fundamentalism, McCarthyism, xenophobia, even homophobia. These words are like an array of artillery, all aimed in the same general direction.\n \n While these hostilities are emphasized, exagerrated, and even legislated against, we never hear about hostilities in the other direction. Aren't they real too? Just as a matter of simple realism, you might expect a minority to feel a certain amount of spite toward a majority. After all, if a minority has been excluded, it's bound to feel a resentment that the majority never has any reason to feel. If the majority regards itself as morally, intellectually, and esthetically superior, even if this attitude is unconscious, the minority is likely to feel a certain humiliation, and nothing breeds more hatred than hhumiliation.\n ...\n And notice what has happened to the word \"minorities\". It used to refer to pretty clearly distinct groups who were less numerous than the dominant group. Now it has become a moral category of sorts. Homosexuals, for example, are no longer perverts or deviants; they are a \"minority\" in a morally positive sense. Whether their conduct is normal is a forbidden question. (Who is to say what is \"normal\"?) The only question permitted in public life is whether they are \"discriminated against,\" and to ask this question is already to answer it. Of course, they are! And the government should protect them!\n ...\n But modern politics is geared to the alienated. The modern state has to police more and more of our lives, because it has set itself against the normal. It defines normal acquisition as greed, normal group preferences as bigotry, and normal morality as hate. Consequently it has to watch over us at all times to make sure we aren't too assertive about our normality, while it caters to our abnormalities.\n ...\n But in our time, the state itself is the seat of treason. What else can you call a state that calls abortion a right, and assaults even small schoolchildren with propaganda that teaches them that sodomy is good? The public school has become the equivalent of a communist reeducation camp, where moral reality is inverted.\n ...\n The chief everyday business of the modern state is still theft -- taking from some for the benefit of others in the name of \"social justice\". The free and spontaneous arrangements we want to make with our own wealth have to be condemned as unjust; President Clinton recently said it was \"selfish\" of Virginians to object to the state's car tax. This is the fundamental principle of statism: it equates compassion and generosity with the amount of wealth claimed by the state, while equating selfishness and greed with the amount the state can't get its claws into.\n ...\n After the 1994 elections that threw the Democrats out of power in Congress, President Clinton acknowledged that the people were alienated from the government. But the truth is that the government was alienated from the people. How can it profess to \"represent\" them when it is taking their earnings, policing all their activities, and trying to change their way of life? If a private individual did such things to you, you wouldn't say he \"represented\" you. You'd say he hated you.\n \n \n Other witty and enlightening works by Joseph Sobran:\n \n A Commie Christmas Gift: \"Public property\" doesn't really belong to you, and \"public servants\" don't really work for you:\n \n http://www.sobran.com/columns/2003/031223.shtml\n \n \n Israel and Rape: Let's keep Satan out of it, shall we? :\n \n http://www.sobran.com/columns/2003/031211.shtml\n \n \n The Former Confederacy: A short corrective to American history:\n \n http://www.sobran.com/columns/2003/031204.shtml\n \n \n The Church and Jewish Ideology:\n \n http://www.sobran.com/jewid.shtml\n \n \n How Tyranny Came to America:\n \n http://www.sobran.com/tyranny.shtml\n \n \n Full archive:\n \n http://www.sobran.com/articles.shtml\n \n \n \n .",
