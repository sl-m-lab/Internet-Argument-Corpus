   "Sharon says U.S. should also disarm Iran, Libya and Syria\n \n Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said yesterday that Iran, Libya and Syria should be stripped of weapons of mass destruction after Iraq. \"These are irresponsible states, which must be disarmed of weapons mass destruction, and a successful American move in Iraq as a model will make that easier to achieve,\" Sharon said to a visiting delegation of American congressmen.\n \n In a meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton yesterday, Sharon said that Israel was concerned about the security threat posed by Iran, and stressed that it was important to deal with Iran even while American attention was focused on Iraq.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=263941\n \n \n Let's not forget: Sharon Urged US Military Confrontation with Iran, Syria in April, 2003\n \n Israel will suggest that the United States also take care of Iran and Syria because of their support for terror and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Israel will point out the support of Syria and Iran for Hezbollah, which the U.S. considers an important target in the war against international terrorism.\n \n (Sharon's bureau chief) Weisglass is scheduled to meet National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and present Israel's reservations on the road map. Senior government sources said Weisglass's goal is \"to make sure things that disturb us (Israelis) won't happen.\"\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=283271&contrassID=1\n \n \n When Sharon Says Jump, Bush Says, \"How High?\"\n \n This article is going to be about Jews. So if you're uncomfortable with the subject I suggest you bail out right now.\n \n Several months ago I wrote an article for our daily newspaper that I shouldn't have written if I were promoting my career.\n \n It seems that I had the unmitigated gall to question what America was getting in return for the 3 to 5 billion dollars we are \"investing\" in Israel every year.\n \n The article got me blackballed. Well, not exactly blackballed. But along with being demonized as an anti-Semitic, the paper never accepted any further articles I wrote. Na\u00efve me, I couldn't understand what I had done wrong. Now I know better.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.etherzone.com/2003/moor022403.shtml\n \n \n \n .",
