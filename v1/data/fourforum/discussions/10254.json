Kathy Hurt, senior pastor at the Granville church.\n \n Since then, the group has been visiting the church every Sunday, she said.\n \n On one of the first Sundays, six people came to the church's 11 a.m. service and addressed the congregation during a time designated for prayer requests and comments.\n \n Hurt said a man, who introduced himself as a minister from the New Beginnings Church in Warsaw, Ohio, started to give a sermon about how the church was acting against God's word by accepting homosexuals.\n \n Members of Minutemen United also visited King Avenue United Methodist Church in Columbus that same morning, said the Rev. John Keeny.\n \n \"They rebuked me as a pastor for preaching that God's love is for everyone,\" Keeny said.\n \n The pastor said he was proud of the way his congregation responded to the interruption, and he asked them to pray that the hearts of the Minutemen would be open.\n \n \"At our church, we welcome all people,\" he said. \"We would welcome them in worship, too, but we expect hospitality and acceptance to be demonstrated by all who come to worship here.\"\n \n Max Erwin Sr., an evangelist with the New Beginnings ministry and a member of Minutemen United, said he attended services at King Avenue and First Baptist churches.\n \n \"What I do is not about hate; it's everything to do with love,\" Erwin said. \"Homosexuality is a sin.\"\n \n He said he plans to concentrate his efforts on First Baptist Church. He will be outside the church building every Sunday, as long as it doesn't rain.\n \n \"There are people there who are truly hungry for the true word of God,\" Erwin said. \"The word of God is the word of God. It is not subject to private interpretation.\"\n \n Dave Daubenmire, the founder of Minutemen United, said the group believes in taking its faith to the streets.\n \n \"People point us out to be haters,\" he said. \"Jesus loves the homosexual, but he doesn't love homosexuality. This is about holding each other accountable.\"\n \n Daubenmire said he wants to protect others by raising the standards of right and wrong.\n \n \"I don't care what anyone does at home, but when they want to bring it out of their homes and into the street, now it becomes a public issue,\" he said. \"I have an obligation as a Christian and father to stand up and say, 'My faith says this is a sin.' \"\n \n The Rev. Tim Ahrens, of the First Congregational Church Downtown, said that when he heard about the situation, he asked his congregation to pray for the Minutemen as well as the church congregations.\n \n \"It's one thing to have your opinions, but it's another thing to take it to the next level by crossing the threshold of a worshipping congregation,\" Ahrens said.",

Hundreds of Flashpoint readers have personally sent him copies of my newsletters revealing his ungodliness. But still, the man the Baptists and others believe to be their sterling and ecumenical \"Evangelical Pope,\" continues down the path of depravity, refusing to repent. It's bad enough that on NBC television recently, Billy Graham flippantly excused President Bill Clinton's lewd and lascivious sexual sins by declaring that, well, the man just can't help himself. Clinton is handsome and virile, said Graham, and the girls are just \"wild\" over him.\n \n \n It's bad enough, too, that in his crusade last October in San Francisco--Sodom and Gomorrah reborn--Graham announced to the homosexuals, \"Whatever your background, whatever your sexual orientation, we welcome you tonight.\"\n \n Earlier, at a news conference, the famed evangelist thrilled the cockles of the homosexuals' lusty hearts when he snapped to a reporter that he was tired of people trying to get him to criticize gays. \"It's not the biggest of sins,\" Graham said. Billy followed this up by telling the smiling and happy liberal media: \"What I want to preach about in San Francisco is the love of God. People need to know that God loves them no matter what their sexual orientation.\" Graham also proudly confided: \"I have so many gay friends, and we remain friends.\" \n \n http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Wolves/billy_graham_exposed.htm\n \n I believe his son, Frank Graham, is anti-gay, however.",

   "Young Christian Soldiers\n By David Neiwert Sat Jun 10, 2006 at 10:37:17 AM EST\n topic: Religious Militarism section:Front Page printable version print this story\n Hitler Youth ?\n \n We are honored that David Neiwert proprietor of the blog site Orcinus,among other things, agreed to crosspost this piece to our front page. --ed\n \n Digby brings our attention to the recent \"Battle Cry\" rally in Philadelphia, where a crowd of about 25,000 -- mostly teenagers and young adults -- pledged their fealty to a vision of a theocratic Christian nation. This pledge was obtained, mostly, by scaring the #### out of them,\n \n That was clear from this account on DKos:\n \n But BattleCry Philadelphia was more than just a vulgar carnival designed to suck donations into the coffers of Ron Luce's corporation \"Teen Mania\". Indeed, it had a point, to recruit the future elite \"warriors\" in the coming battle against the separation of church and state. It turned dark and frightening on Saturday afternoon. After Franklin \"Islam is a Wicked Religion\" Graham came out to thunder against the evils of homosexuality and the Iraqi people (whom he considers to be exactly the same people as the ancient Babylonians who enslaved the tribes of Israel and deserving, one would assume, the exact same fate) we heard an explosion. Flames shot out on stage and a team of Navy Seals was shown on the big TV monitors in full camouflage creeping forward down the hallway from the locker room with their M16s. They were hunting us, the future Christian leaders of America. Two teenage girls next to me burst into tears and even I, a jaded middle-aged male, almost jumped out of my skin. I imagined for that moment what it must have felt like to have been a teacher at Columbine high school. 10 seconds later they rushed out onstage and pointed their guns in our direction firing blanks spitting flames. About 1000 shots and bang, we were all dead.\n \n \n Perhaps most disturbing, the rally included an endorsement from President Bush, as Sunsara Taylor reported:\n \n It began with fireworks so loud and startling I screamed. Lights and smoke followed, and a few kids were pulled up on stage from the crowd. One was asked to read a letter.\n \n This was the letter that opened the event. Its author was George W. Bush. Yes, the president of the United States sent a letter of support, greeting, prayer and encouragement to the BattleCry event held at Wachovia Spectrum Stadium in Philadelphia on May 12. Immediately afterward, a preacher took the microphone and led the crowd in prayer. Among other things, he asked the attendees to \"Thank God for giving us George Bush.\"\n \n On his cue, about 17,000 youths from upward of 2,000 churches across America and Canada directed their thanks heavenward in unison.\n \n Taylor filed an earlier report at Counterpunch, and likewise noted Battle Cry's ties to the White House, including the appointment of founder Ron Luce to the White House Advisory Commission on Drug-Free Communities, and extending to Bush's circle of contacts with the religious right:",
