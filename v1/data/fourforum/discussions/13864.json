   "Saw this on CNN: Report: Iran opens two missile plants - CNN.com\n \n \n \n From there:\n \n \nTwo new missile production plants opened in Iran on Saturday. \n \n The inauguration of the production lines for the anti-helicopter Qaem missile, and the anti-armor Toofan-5 (Hurricane) missile, came three days after Iran test-launched a rocket capable of carrying a satellite, a launch deemed a \"provocative act\" by Washington.\n \n \n \n The Defense Ministry told Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency that both missiles have \"high penetration and destructive powers.\"\n \n \n \n By mass producing and delivering these modern arms, Iran's department of defense aims to increase its ground and air defenses, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.\n \n \n \n The announcement of new missile production coincided with a 10-day period marking the 31st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.\n \n \n \n \"Toofan 5 is one of the most advanced missiles. It has two warheads which can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles,\" Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi told Fars.\n \n \n \n The Qaem is a \"missile which can destroy targets in the air traveling at low speed and at low altitude, especially assault helicopters,\" Vahidi added.\n \n \n \n The laser guided anti-helicopter Qaem rocket is designed to resist enemy actions in electronic warfare.\n \n \n \n Iran is embroiled in a dispute with the West over its nuclear program and often makes announcements of progress in its military capabilities.\n \n \n \n The West suspects Iran of trying to build nuclear bombs, but Iran says its program is for peaceful power generation.\n \n \n \n On Friday, Iran's foreign minister said he believes a solution will be reached over a proposed deal to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations who worry that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons.\n \n \n \n \"The amount of uranium [for export] is negotiable. But I am confident that a solution can be found,\" Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Iran's state-run Press TV reported.\n \n \n \n Earlier this week, Iran's atomic energy chief said no deal had been struck to export uranium for enrichment.\n \n \n \n \"The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements,\" said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, on Wednesday according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency.\n \n \n \n Asked what countries in addition to France and Brazil were under consideration, he said it was an Asian country, but would not name it.\n \n Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has told Press TV that Iran would have \"no problem\" turning over most of its low-enriched uranium to the West for further enrichment. Iranian diplomats had initially accepted the idea, which was proposed by the West, but then rejected a plan put forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the atomic watchdog of the United Nations.\n \n \n \n \"In our opinion, there are no issues with the exchange\" of 3 percent to 5 percent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched uranium, Ahmadinejad said.\n \n \n \n He added that, if the West were to refuse to return the enriched fuel, world opinion would shift.\n \n \n \n \"If they don't live up to their agreement, the international atmosphere will change in our favor,\" he said.\n \n \n \n \"They [Western countries] can come and build 20 nuclear power plants for us; Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts and build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point to build our own power plants.\"\n \n \n \n Mottaki on Friday said Ahmadinejad's comments show that the Islamic republic is \"eager\" to discuss the proposal.\n \n \n \n Iran insists its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes.\n \n \n\n \n Comments?\n \n \n \n Mine are - I would be arming up too if I was Iran, with the threatening dialogue going back and forth between Iran and Israel.\n \n \n \n I don't blame them in the least. And certainly we have no room to complain about them improving their weapons when we do this every day in this country.",

From the United States, the non-profit American Type Culture Collection and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control sold or sent biological samples to Iraq up until 1989, which Iraq claimed to need for medical research. These materials included anthrax, West Nile virus and botulism, as well as Brucella melitensis, and Clostridium perfringens. Some of these materials were used for Iraq's biological weapons research program, while others were used for vaccine development.[2] In delievering these materials \"The CDC was abiding by World Health Organization guidelines that encouraged the free exchange of biological samples among medical researchers...\" according to Thomas Monath, CDC lab director. It was a request \"which we were obligated to fulfill,\" as described in WHO and UN treaties.[3]\n ^ Associated Press (October 1, 2002). \"Iraq got seeds for bioweapons from U.S.\".

I'd be willing to bet the Obama liberals big money Iran basically laughs at any new sanctions.\n \n I also predict Israel will attack Iran's nuclear sites at some point in the future. Obama is a wuss. He loves to hear himself talk. He won't push things too far on Iran, even though he said he would not let Iran develop nuclear weapons. So Israel will have to act on its own.\n \n It all reminds me of the U.N. ineptitude.\n \n After the appeasing liberals are done with their seemingly endless, hot-air, wind-jamming sessions at the inept and corrupt U.N. - after clinging desperately to the coat tails of liberal blowhards and Rosie O'Donnell; after all their sophomoric Jane Fonda and Cindy Sheehan surrender rallies and Neville Chamberlain pseudo-peace ploys; and with the bad guys still refusing to budge one iota - they're done.

   "Saudi Arabia Gives Israel Clear Skies to Attack Iranian Nuke Sites\n \n LONDON -- Saudi Arabia has conducted tests to stand down its air defenses to enable Israeli jets to make a bombing raid on Iran's nuclear facilities, The Times of London reported Saturday.\n \n In the week that the U.N. Security Council imposed a new round of sanctions on Tehran, defense sources in the Gulf say that Riyadh has agreed to allow Israel to use a narrow corridor of its airspace in the north of the country to shorten the distance for a bombing run on Iran. To ensure the Israeli bombers pass without hindrance, Riyadh has carried out tests to make certain its own jets are not scrambled and missile defense systems not activated. Once the Israelis are through, the kingdom's air defenses will return to full alert.\n \n \"The Saudis have given their permission for the Israelis to pass over and they will look the other way,\" said a U.S. defense source in the area. \"They have already done tests to make sure their own jets aren't scrambled and no one gets shot down. This has all been done with the agreement of the [U.S.] State Department.\"\n \n Sources in Saudi Arabia say it is common knowledge within defense circles in the kingdom that an arrangement is in place if Israel decides to launch the raid. Despite the tension between the two governments, they share a mutual loathing of the regime in Tehran and a common fear of Iran's nuclear ambitions. \"We all know this. We will let them [the Israelis] through and see nothing,\" said one.\n \n The four main targets for any raid on Iran would be the uranium enrichment facilities at Natanz and Qom, the gas storage development at Isfahan and the heavy-water reactor at Arak. Secondary targets include the lightwater reactor at Bushehr, which could produce weapons-grade plutonium when complete.\n \n FOXNews.com - Saudi Arabia Gives Israel Clear Skies to Attack Iranian Nuke Sites\n \n I've always said Israel will whack Iran, and it looks like that time is getting closer and closer.",
