Not everyone is as selfish as you. A minimum wage increase would no effect on most people I know, but would help a lot of people who are living below the poverty line. Raising the minimum wage will raise prices somewhat, and will dip into the amount available for executive pay, bonuses and dividends. Yes there is a point where, raised too high and too fast, companies won't have time to adjust their structures to deal with it, but that is a matter of amounts, not the principle. The UK did not have a minimum wage for many years, and there is no evidence of a link between employment levels and the introduction or level of the minimum wage. This is because economic models of supply and demand assume perfect information and perfect price elasticity. The problem is that people's cost of living can't decrease to meet reduced pay, yet they can't not work because even only paying 50% of your living expenses is better than paying none. Likewise, as soon as there is one more suitable person available to do a particular job than there are jobs, the employer is able to supress wages completely, unless there is a minimum wage or trade union involved. I'm quite happy to see the minimum wage removed, so long as the anti-union legislation is removed at the same time.",

   "Since Pappillion is too dense or too dishonest to answer the simple question: \"Why not a million dollar minimum wage?\" I will answer for him.\n\n \n Not liking my answer or not giving you the answer that you wanted so you could try and make a point is neither dense or dishonest. \n \n What is dense, dishonest and hypocritical is your interpretation of what I have said, is your conclusion and what it implies and your refusal to answer any question about your position. \n \n Maybe I am missing your point, are you saying there should be no minimum wage because if it was a million dollars unemployment would effect almost everybody? Seriously? You can't even follow your own statement to some meaningful conclusion. \n \n \nBecause a million dollar minimum wage would result in 99% unemployment.So why not a minimum wage of $20? Because it would result in more unemployment than a $10 minimum wage, and more still than no minimum wage at all.\n \n\n \n Well that sure is eye opening. Did you want to add anything to that? You seem content to share your observation seemingly under the impression that you have made some significant point. \n \n If we are going to use unrealistic scenarios why can't we continue with this statement of yours and ask so now what? I doubt Americans would just all commit mass suicide and so end of story. I would think prices would skyrocket to match the increase. Transactions would have to be on a credit basis since no one would have the actual cash in hand eventually everybody would catch up and we would be right back where we started just everything would have an extra half dozen 0's. 20 is more reasonable but still in the realm of unrealistic. \n \n \nWhen someone says \"Raising minimum wage rates to certain levels has positive and negative effects on various groups\" (and is therefore good), the hidden meaning is;\n \n \"Raising minimum wages to certain levels has positive effects on people like me, and negative effects on people I don't give a XXXX about\"\n\n \n That is what you got from what I said? Your one bitter little boy aren't you. I will leave it at your interpretation is inaccurate. Nothing even resembling that crossed my mind and if it had I would have no problem admitting it.\n \n The effects of a minimum raise increase depend on who is doing the research, when it is done, methods and who the study uses for data. Research shows no impact, positive impact and negative impact so it is hard to sit there and say minimum wage laws impact an economy negatively, disregard the positive and remain credible. \n \n That would also mean that some people are harmed by it and some people benefit from it but in my opinion and with great concern for those adversely affected, the benefits are greater than the harm.\n \n The Effects of Increases in the Minimum Wage\n \n http://www.nyu.edu/econ/user/flinnc/papers/mw-flinn.pdf",

   "So the people that do lose out because again the kid doesn't need it so nobody should get it? Your still denying it saying a particular group may not need it so it isn't needed by anyone. Would it be to their detriment to get it even if they don't need it?\n\n \n I am not denying anything. There is nothing in my argument that suggests that it is impossible for an individual to work as a cashier as their sole means of support. It is equally obvious that this is a job that requires little skill and can be performed as an entry job by teenagers who are demonstrably NOT subsisting on that 20 hr work week. What I have pointed out twice now is that in the case of low skill jobs it is the JOB, not the SKILL that dictates remuneration. As our next paragraph amply demonstrates:\n \n \nOr business doesn't make it any more or business figures out a way to make it work. If business can't sell it at a price that is profitable then it won't be available. If the consumer does not have disposable income then demand declines. Willing buyer willing seller\n\n \n It hardly needs to be restated but the company with the higher expense ratio per product will have the lower profit margin per product. That company with the articifially inflated salaries will not be able to compete. \n \n\n Good then you realize Asia specifically china right now used to have really cheap labor but a lousy labor market. As they kept making worthless junk their labor force began to become more skilled. This brought more complex work at better prices which let workers earn higher wages and better benefits and round again and round again and you have a developing middle class of a billion people with enough disposable income to buy some things extra and the time to enjoy it enough to want to continue to do so\n\n \n Skill drives wage, not the other way around as you have suggested. \n \n \n Nobody is arguing for an inflated minimum wage. Where do we start to develop those better trained workers and how do we train them better to have the skills to justify those higher wages? \n\n \n YOU don't, they do. \n \n \nI was being sarcastic. A the cashier was yours I had the bagger. B if we create people in situations that fit the the circumstances being expressed then they can be anything we need or want them to be.\n\n Regardless, the question stands as noted below:\n \n \n \nWithout knowing the industry I can only guess that an experienced cashier will be plug and play, they can be put in front of any register and start working, they will be faster and know how to deal with issues that may come up. The would be able to accept other responsibilities as needed including teaching newer cashiers what they know. What is that worth, I couldn't say. To a large store with a dozen cashiers maybe not as much as a small store with only a couple or it might be the opposite. \n\n \n First, the LEAST skilled cashier can move from one register to another. Registers are not custom built mind you. The numbers are in the same place. \n \n Second, undoubtedly an experienced cashier will punch keys faster than a cashier on their first day's employment. The question is how much faster and what is the net value of that increased speed? You must then consider that regardless of the speed of that experienced cashier a self-scan can do the same job. You are again faced with the fact that the job is not high skill and has no expectation of providing a \"liveable wage\".\n \n \n \n \nThen why keep the consumer at a level where he can only purchase necessities?\n\n \n I am not keeping the consumer anywhere. The consumer determines what level he or she reaches. \n \n \nThat is what tariffs are for. An industrialized nation is not going to be able to compete with a 3rd world or in many cases a 2nd world nation for cheap labor.\n\n \n Tariffs are transfers of wealth from domestic consumers to domestic producers. You may just as easily have noted that the skilled worker cannot compete with the unskilled worker for the unskilled job. Why pay more for something you don't need? Why pay a \"liveable wage\" to someone 40 hrs per week and have to pitch in for benefits as well when you can simply employ a couple of teenagers for 20 hrs each, pay them less, and not have to cover their benefits packages? \n \n \n \nNice try. I have given several reasons why I think a minimum wage produces more benefit than harm in the long term. I am still waiting for the reasons why there should be no minimum wage.\n\n \n Answered. The market determines wages - minimum AND maximum.\n \n Again, the same obfuscation. You have claimed to have addressed the question of the opposite extreme, you even suggest \n \n \nNot liking my answer or not giving you the answer that you wanted so you could try and make a point is neither dense or dishonest.\n\n \n It's not that I do not like your answer I have not detected an answer. Please clear up this misunderstanding by clearly posting your answer here. If that is to difficult, please cut and paste where you have previously addressed this question as neither I nor Symbiote have seen you do so.",

Recent studies show increases in the minimum wage in states that match the Fed or are higher dismployment either does not occur, is consistant with states that did not increase or is negligable.

Research is showing that minimum wage increases did not prevent employment or that unemployment was consistent in comparable ares that did not have an increase.Typical advances in technology wipe out more jobs than that daily. \n \n If you want to keep everybody working outlaw technology. Get rid of automation. We can go back to manufacturing everything by hand. \n This is sarcasm, to do so would be idiotic.\n \n Why is answering a question so difficult for you? I have asked you the same questions what 4, 5, 6 times and nothing just a repeat of why not make minimum wage 1M dollars if you don't then you really don't care about poor people. And you want to raise tariff's so people in Asia will starve.\n \n Do you see how pointless it is to have a discussion with someone when they just repeat the same nonsense over and over. You offer nothing to validate your position or claims. I am aware of the economic theories that say a minimum wage will cause inefficiencies and prevent equilibrium. I am also aware that those models don't factor in circumstances that are causing a different result than that expected. \n \n I have offered proof why I believe your claims are incorrect, until you can provide some evidence for your claims there is no reason to keep listening to your opinion. We have reached an impasse and the only way to move forward is up to you.\n \n \nThe reality is you do not. Just like the segregationist South Afrcan Whites, you want to fix it only at a point where it causes systemic unemployment amongst minority groups.\n\n \n Blah Blah Blah Do I? Exactly how do you come to this conclusion? It is not from any evidence I have presented, that shows minorities benefiting. It isn't from your evidence because you have not offered any. Which means you are just looking to avoid any type of rational discussion and just want to push your ideas out onto someone else. \n \n No thanks, you can keep them\n \n \n(Oh and of course, put up trade walls to stop those evil chinese from getting jobs)\n\n \n Who would loan us money if we did that?",

I bet some business could benefit from changing their prices or advertising campaigns or supply chains, suppose you should just go in and do that for them too; wait isn't that just the government running the company (yes).

We slide backwards 1200 years.\n\n We have been building wealth and with the wealth we invest to create even greater wealth. That is how it works. If you don't have it make it. Everyone starts out with the asset of their body, and of course the most important asset the engine of production itself.\n \n \nThe definition of economics has to do with scarcity. There are not enough resources for everybody. \n\n This is a totally perverted way to look at economics. Humans partake in trade for profit not to direct wealth towards themselves but to maximize their creation of it through cooperation.\n \n The premise of any trade is not that there isn't enough for both parties it's that the transfer creates an increase in wealth because the item or product received is more valuable to the receiver than the item given. Free trade (real trade) only occurs when this is the case for both parties.\n \n It is not a lack of resources that drive trade it's an excess of production. Production cannot occur without resources so it is in fact an abundance of resources that allows the production of wealth.\n \n \nBusiness and people never look to achieve break even. Business wants to sell high and buy low.\n\n You mean they want profit. Yes there is no point in doing something that doesn't create wealth.\n \n \nThey see high high they can go before the amount they sell drops lower than desired. If they can't manage that they either fail, lower quality and/or costs or cheat. People are not much different. Efficiency is just a number that suggests the one being measured may avoid the effects of scarcity as long as those conditions can be maintained.\n\n Trade is based on the fact that productive entities have an excess of a product and nothing else. Wealth is created more efficiently because of specialization. Efficiency refers to how well the labor of individuals translates to wealth, not how long they can avoid scarcity!\n \n \nI see, business looks to break even creating balance.\n\n You said that without tariffs an imbalance would be formed, I assumed you meant in the availability of products.\n \n \nThere must be rich to offset the poor.

He is free to employ as many or as few as he feels are needed given his resources, capabilities and the market. \n \n The second may at times endanger the first. The decline of social structure leads to social unrest which leads to a loss of government able to preserve morality or defend rights.\n \n \nProviding a safety net is a social action not a right to be guaranteed.\n\n \n same answer as above\n \n \nI love all the precisely defined terms in there. Basic, some ability, without resorting to welfare (when apparently a living wage ought to be guaranteed by welfare).\n \n The article itself remarked on how food isn't considered enough anymore.\n\n \n Just skimmed it huh? Don't blame you more than a couple paragraphs gets tiresome after awhile.\n \n Those actually are in context pretty specific to what is being discussed.\n \n The issue with food is that it doesn't represent the same percent of expense it once did, but this is offset by increases in other expenses some of which are not even considered.\n \n \nSo you realize that the bad effects if immorality may not always immediately show up?\n\n \n Not everything is instant gratification or obviously wrong from the get go.\n \n \nJobs were better than begging before minimum wages, and if they weren't that would mean some people should beg instead of getting a job :p\n\n \n Some do. It is in a way a business without much of the requirements imposed on other business, yet those others always seem to do so much better\n \n \nlol, you obviously didn't realize that the statement was sarcastically making fun of the notion you just advanced further; that it's not stealing if you claim you were benefiting the party stolen from.\n\n \n They actually have to agree that there was a benefit. Leaving a mint no matter how good will never be voluntarily exchanged for the banks money taken by threat, force or lacking consent.\n \n \nIt doesn't matter how tasty to mint is and it doesn't matter if a business would get some use out of high wages, all that matters is that the bank didn't let the thief take the money, that the business doesn't want to have high wages.\n \n\n \n The business would not want any wages. So government in protecting rights is more concerned with the right of a business to not pay a wage then the worker to receive one. Then it looks to the social welfare of the worker. \n \n \nIf higher wages are better for the business let them raise them, if they don't despite the benefit let them destroy themselves. \n\n \n Do you suppose they would? History says no over and over again. Business wants cheap labor. \n \n \nI bet some business could benefit from changing their prices or advertising campaigns or supply chains, suppose you should just go in and do that for them too; \n\n \n I suppose there would be no need if they could reduce labor costs. That seems fair share the loss but not the profit.\n \n \nwait isn't that just the government running the company (yes).\n \n \n Aren't you glad they don't.\n \n \nWell there is a better way to do this, forget the company front just have the government do the job itself. Communism is the logical implication of the premise that society runs businesses.\n \n\n \n \n So by implementing the minimum wage we really are a communist economy. Now if we just told business they had to hire x amount of people then there might be something, but the government doesn't. They are permitted to hire as many as they want and can do so anywhere they want.\n \n \nWe have been building wealth and with the wealth we invest to create even greater wealth. That is how it works. If you don't have it make it. Everyone starts out with the asset of their body, and of course the most important asset the engine of production itself.\n\n \n So we all start out even. Does everybody start from scratch again each month? No we are not all equal from the start, even our bodies as the basic principal are not always equal. Minimum wage attempts to create an opportunity for what you describe to happen. \n \n Why do you think almost every nation has a minimum wage? \n \n \nThis is a totally perverted way to look at economics. Humans partake in trade for profit not to direct wealth towards themselves but to maximize their creation of it through cooperation.\n\n \n Economics is the \"study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable commodities and distribute them among different people.\"\n -- Paul A. Samuelson, Economics (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948)\n \n Do you live in a cave? Maximize the creation of wealth through cooperation and then what? They direct it towards themselves. Unless they happen to be a non-profit but even that isn't a guarantee.\n \n \nThe premise of any trade is not that there isn't enough for both parties it's that the transfer creates an increase in wealth because the item or product received is more valuable to the receiver than the item given. Free trade (real trade) only occurs when this is the case for both parties.\n \n It is not a lack of resources that drive trade it's an excess of production. Production cannot occur without resources so it is in fact an abundance of resources that allows the production of wealth.\n\n \n If there was enough for everybody plus 2 what would happen? We would all have what we want for free, until someone took 3 and said I will sell you this extra widget I have for 4 tasty mints. That person finds someone who has 3 tasty mints which he trades for the widget he didn't have, but he is now at a disadvantage because now he has no mints until he can get one mint more than what he consumes. Now we have supply and demand\n \n \n \nYou mean they want profit. Yes there is no point in doing something that doesn't create wealth.\n\n \n Unless you are cheap labor then there is a point.\n \n \nTrade is based on the fact that productive entities have an excess of a product and nothing else. Wealth is created more efficiently because of specialization. Efficiency refers to how well the labor of individuals translates to wealth, not how long they can avoid scarcity!\n\n \n Having an excess would be inefficient. That would mean they made one more than was necessary. Efficiency is the point at which something there is no excess and no shortage. That to complete the last unit creates no excess and leaves no resources used in production.\n \n \nYou said that without tariffs an imbalance would be formed, I assumed you meant in the availability of products.\n\n \n In the cost of production\n \n \nWhat are you talking about?\n\n \n I was being sarcastic. In order to have balance there must be rich and poor to have one or the other would create a imbalance.\n \n \nWhat right does the minimum wage protect?\n\n \n Basically the same rights as discussed at the top\n \n \nIf something is a certain way unless you change it and he wants you to not change it the end result is that it is a certain way. Yes, obviously. That does not mean he wants to change it.\n\n \n He doesn't want to not change it and he doesn't want it to stay unchanged, so I see only he wants to change it as a possibility.",

   "Keeping to the topic\n\n That was the topic you said exploitation is immoral.\n \n \nlet's say exploitation is gain realized by one person using either deception or coercion that under normal circumstances the second party would not accept.\n \n Then I cede that is immoral, the key words that made me agree are bolded.\n \n Now, how is offering someone a job deception or coercion, something which a person would not accept? I was under the impression that by the definition of offering one is asking if they will agree.\n \n \nIf moral action is includes the concern of human good then to disadvantage another person, taking a gain from their loss cannot be thought of as moral\n\n Unless the want you to, but of course either they disagree that they have lossed or they are mentally ill with altruism and think their loss is their virtue.\n \n \nThe point was you were not comparing apples to apples.\n\n I'm comparing humans to humans.\n \n \nWould someone today sent back be as thankful? Probably not\n\n You mean if someone was stranded in time and they were retrieved they would not be happy with half minimum wage?\n \n That depends on how used to a less comfortable life style they got. My analogy would still work but it would be embodied by their shock at losing all the things they had taken for granted, how they would perceive their new life style as unacceptable and barbaric. I do not disagree it is worse but my point was to illustrate all the benefits merely being born into an advanced society already gives, it is naive to say that what is necessary for human life has increased. It has always been our values that have driven our pursuit of wealth or else we would be sitting in Africa living like apes. There is one phrase that comes to mind that I have always thought wrong on many levels 'necessity is the mother of invention' because 'necessary' is always defined by a value. i.e. it's 'necessary' that we win this war, it's 'necessary' that I don't have to take that darn walk down to the Nile every time I get thirsty etc..\n \n \nThat isn't the question. Minimum wage doesn't prohibit people from having to earn a living.\n\n It's based on the premise that they can't do it honestly.\n \n \nMinimum wage does not encourage people not to work and it is hardly sufficient to be considered able to provide any type of luxury.\n\n but that is my exact point with the mesopotamian thing, the difference between luxury and 'necessity' is entirely arbitrary.\n \n \n5,000 years ago you could camp on the side of the road (if there was a road). You could hunt for food or fish. It was possible to have maybe some clothes and nothing more and survive and possibly even prosper.\n\n You presume a standard of 'prospering' defined by the opinions of contemporaries. This person would never go to college, probably never learn to read or write, never watch a tv show, probably never stray more than 50 miles from their home, would never comprehend electricity; and the food that you could buy for $7 at any restaurant would represent a fine and time consuming feast.\n \n \nToday that is highly unlikely.\n \n Why? (I would answer because no one would be satisfied having so little knowing the magnitude of value that can be attained)\n \n \nMaybe we take things for granted but that doesn't mean that standards don't exist or they should be deducted in determining basic needs\n\n Standards for what? A human being needs calories some rare nutrients every once in a while, an internal temperature of 98, and a place to sleep other than where they defecate.\n \n Prisons have proved that.\n \n A human being wants so much more... and that is what makes persons and peoples great.\n \n \nAn employer has the right to be an employer.\n\n No they don't, that is a privilege granted them by the consent of the employed.\n \n \nThere exist conditions that he agrees to to enjoy the benefits of being an employer in some particular place. He is free to move someplace else if finds that place more to his advantage. He is free to employ as many or as few as he feels are needed given his resources, capabilities and the market.\n \n Agreed.\n \n \nThe second may at times endanger the first. The decline of social structure leads to social unrest which leads to a loss of government able to preserve morality or defend rights.\n\n Agreed.\n \n \nsame answer as above\n\n You didn't answer above you made some statements. Do you agree or disagree with my statement?\n \n \nJust skimmed it huh? Don't blame you more than a couple paragraphs gets tiresome after awhile.\n \n Those actually are in context pretty specific to what is being discussed.\n \n The issue with food is that it doesn't represent the same percent of expense it once did, but this is offset by increases in other expenses some of which are not even considered.\n\n ... and?\n \n \nNot everything is instant gratification or obviously wrong from the get go.\n\n I'll take that as a yes.\n \n \nSome do. It is in a way a business without much of the requirements imposed on other business, yet those others always seem to do so much better\n\n lol\n \n \nThey actually have to agree that there was a benefit.\n\n No they have to agree there was a trade. Which is not just agreeing there is a benefit but agreeing to the specific transfer of wealth in question, which assumes benefit, but that is not the same as benefit being the sole condition.\n \n If someone came up to you with a delicious but expensive pizza while you had more cost efficient food at home, you could hardly argue that the pizza wouldn't be beneficial to your stomach and taste buds; but that doesn't mean that you agreed to buy the pizza. It doesn't mean that from the moment the vendor hears 'that smells good' he can jump you take $400 from your pocket and leave you a single slice.\n \n \nLeaving a mint no matter how good will never be voluntarily exchanged for the banks money taken by threat, force or lacking consent.\n\n Of course not. So why bring up the mint? It's irrelevant to the nature of the act being clearly identifiable as theft.\n \n \nThe business would not want any wages.\n\n They want to have employees so they need to have wages.\n \n \nSo government in protecting rights is more concerned with the right of a business to not pay a wage then the worker to receive one.\n\n A business (exact same rights as a person and a government) does have the 'right to not pay a wage', but a worker does not have a right to receive a wage.\n \n \nDo you suppose they would? History says no over and over again. Business wants cheap labor. \n\n Are they destroyed? (not destroyed by immoral mobs with guns, destroyed by the market).\n \n \nI suppose there would be no need if they could reduce labor costs. That seems fair share the loss but not the profit.\n\n ?\n \n \nAren't you glad they don't.\n\n I'm indifferent to societal actions of which I do not wish to participate, I would be annoyed at the incompetence of a very large group of people though.\n \n \nSo by implementing the minimum wage we really are a communist economy.\n\n Same premise, a difference of degree only. Not just the minimum wage, taxes, and all the programs they fund as well. The degree of this and other countries success and moral integrity has been the limitation of conventional governments, which is why you have conservatives totally obsessed with small government.\n \n \nNow if we just told business they had to hire x amount of people then there might be something, but the government doesn't. They are permitted to hire as many as they want and can do so anywhere they want.\n\n You think that in soviet Russia people were forced into jobs? Lol of course not they could 'choose' their path in life, all the government did was to describe the castes into which one may enter.\n \n They are permitted to hire as many as they want, and can do so anywhere they want (but apparently not overseas), but they are not permitted to offer the rates they want.\n \n \nSo we all start out even.\n\n I didn't say that, every year that civilization exists it has in general given great value to the next generation in the form of knowledge, infrastructure, and culture. Parents and communities also give wealth and support to people starting out.\n \n I said that while it is true that we invest wealth to create wealth we all start with some wealth so the argument that it is possible to be in a completly without assets to invest is not applicable to healthy human beings. This should be quite obvious because it is clear that 'mother nature' did not grace ancient technology lacking humans with any nest egg but the technology of their DNA.\n \n We in fact all start with the most valuable thing possible, the engine of production; a human mind. It is the producer of all wealth.\n \n \nMinimum wage attempts to create an opportunity for what you describe to happen. \n\n Minimum wage is no more necessary to thought, production, investment, or wealth than UFO's are.\n \n \nWhy do you think almost every nation has a minimum wage?\n\n The same reason they have taxes, they do not understand morality fully, and they do not exist in the proper framework. A proper governmental framework defines methods and structure for both functions not just one.\n \n \nEconomics is the \"study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable commodities and distribute them among different people.\"\n -- Paul A. Samuelson, Economics (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948)\n\n You can add scarce resources like that but it is no more than fancy semantics, the crucial definition follows that with 'to produce valuable commodities and distribute them'.\n \n No matter how abundant natural resources are there would still be trade because the fundamental essence of the value being traded is, and always has been; the thought and labor of the person who produced it.\n \n \nDo you live in a cave? Maximize the creation of wealth through cooperation and then what? They direct it towards themselves.\n\n They don't need to direct it towards themselves it was generated in their possession.\n \n \nIf there was enough for everybody plus 2 what would happen? We would all have what we want for free, until someone took 3 and said I will sell you this extra widget I have for 4 tasty mints. That person finds someone who has 3 tasty mints which he trades for the widget he didn't have, but he is now at a disadvantage because now he has no mints until he can get one mint more than what he consumes. Now we have supply and demand\n\n We don't trade things we just find around on the ground, we haven't for twenty thousand years.\n \n If there was enough cars for everybody plus two we could have cars for everybody for free.\n \n Unfortunately there are zero cars until someone builds them. A car represents thought labor and physical labor all the way down to the constituent ores from which it was mined, and even those are not merely picked off the ground but must be searched for with geological knowledge and accessed with other ingenious machines.\n \n So if economics is the avoidance of scarcity, how have we overcome the infinite scarcity of cars?\n \n \nUnless you are cheap labor then there is a point.\n\n What point?\n \n \nHaving an excess would be inefficient.\n\n Not if they could trade them for a profit.\n \n \nThat would mean they made one more than was necessary.\n\n Not if the intention was to trade them.\n \n \nEfficiency is the point at which something there is no excess and no shortage. That to complete the last unit creates no excess and leaves no resources used in production.\n\n Which is why trade increases efficiency. A person or a group of persons often produce something very well very efficiently, so much so that it is far in excess of their personal demand; so they trade.\n \n The efficiency of their work is preserved through the trade.\n \n The efficiency of someone who produces the raw materials is also preserved where it might have been wasted before.\n \n Thus if production of everything was equally accomplish-able by everyone trade would be useless, but it isn't because it's more efficient to specialize and focus.\n \n \nIn the cost of production\n \n The cost of production is ever seeking the lowest, of course there would be an imbalance, like I just said some people and companies will set out to do one thing better than most (or perhaps even all).\n \n \nI was being sarcastic. In order to have balance there must be rich and poor to have one or the other would create a imbalance.\n\n So having both rich and poor is an imbalance?\n \n \nBasically the same rights as discussed at the top\n\n I am afraid you will have to state them explicitly I didn't see what you could be refering to.\n \n \nHe doesn't want to not change it and he doesn't want it to stay unchanged, so I see only he wants to change it as a possibility.\n\n Where did he say he wants it to change?",
