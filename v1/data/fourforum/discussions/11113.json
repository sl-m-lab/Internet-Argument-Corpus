   "Despite Romney's populist message and criticizing of McCain's jobs statement, McCain is dead on the mark about the future of the US economy.\n \n The lost manufacturing jobs are, in his words \"not coming back.\" The future lies in brains, not brawn, which has been obvious to many people for a long, long time. However, the US education sector largely in the grade school element is hardly conducive to creating such an economy.\n \n Does McCain have a plan to actually favor brains over brawn? Aka, overhauling the public education system to favor math and science?\n \n As GI Joe used to say, \"Knowing is half the battle\" but half the battle won't cut it.",
