They tried to kill that bill. \n \n Maybe you missed the last 10 years, but what the democrats wanted had pretty much ZERO impact on what happened during the Bush presidency. The republicans controlled both houses of congress and the white house and they would not even let the democrats introduce legislation. \n \n And they passed the biggest unfunded entitlement program in the history of the united states. If that is not bad enough, they literally let the DRUG COMPANIES write the bill, so the net impact of the bill has been that is has made prescription drugs MORE EXPENSIVE to seniors. \n \n \n\n Brutus: 1) it saved the country from crisis caused by liberal regulation 2) it was virtually all paid back!!\n\n \n It didnt \"Save\" the country from anything, and the idea that the financial crisis was caused by the evil liberals is just plain dumb. What the bailout did was provided a slush funds to keep the big banks going until the fed had a chance to buy all those junk mortgages, thus transferring those losses from the banks to the taxpayer. \n \n \nBrutus: Clinton inheritied boom from Bush 41, thanks to Perot.

Bush 43 inheritied tech bust, Clinton recession, and 9/11. Now you know true Bush 43 story\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. Clinton inherited a recession, genius. He ran on \"Its the economy, stupid!\" That is not because the economy was in good shape.\n \n And the stock markets had recovered from the dot com crash by the time Bush took office. In fact, the average fall was only 7%, and markets recovered that in only 2 months. 12 months after the crash they were actually up 12%. \n \n\n \n Brutus: So????????????????????????\n\n \n So your argument that they were just doing what they had to do to stay in office do not hold any water at all.

   "\n Brutus: after supply side 2003 cuts revenue exploded and so did GDP \n\n \n UH....thats the point.

That is not even debatable...COMPLETELY disproved...mathematically impossible. \n \n That should not be surprising. Reagan was the guy who really pushed supply side theory, and even his OWN BUDGET DIRECTOR has been trying to explain for decades that Reagan DID NOT understand what we was talking about. \n \n \n\n Brutus: did someone disagree????????????????? \n\n \n Yes, you did, as did, apparently, the people you quoted. If tax policy effectiveness is a function of gross revenue then the fact that gross revenues decreased means that the tax policy was ineffective.\n \n That is why they measure policy effectiveness as a percentage of GDP, and why pretty much everything you have relied on as \"evidence\" is a crock. \n \n \n \nBrutus: CBO estimates????? where???????? easy to pretend isn't it???\n\n \n First, I mis-spoke. The $700 billion was if we just continued the cuts for the middle class and let the cuts for the upper class expire. Instead we continued them all, which was a different estimate:\n \n CBO: Extending Tax Cuts Could Have Huge Debt Impact\n \n \nLast week, CBO projected a fiscal year 2010 deficit of $1.34 trillion, second-largest since World War II (with last year's being the largest). It also projected deficits totaling more than $6 trillion over the next decade. These are huge numbers, even though they track closely with earlier reports. But CBO's predictions are based on current law - meaning that they assume that the tax cuts expire on schedule. Extending all the Bush cuts through 2020 would add another $2.7 trillion to the debt.\n\n \n Nobody on either side of the isle disputed those numbers. \n \n \n \nBrutus: so you want to disagree with what BO and Hillary agree to in public, although with huge reluctance. Neither is an economist but supply is so proven that even they know better than to argue with the experts in their own party. Where have yo been??\n\n \n Where have I been? The above statement is literally quite possibly the most ignorant thing I have ever read on an internet forum. It is absolutely the most ignorant thing I have ever read about economics. \n \n First, what you are referring to as \"supply side economics\" was never actually a valid theory. It was essentially a misunderstanding of the laffer curve by Reagan. The idea behind the laffer curve is that if you tax too heavily, you eventually reach a point where increased tax rates lead to decreased tax revenues because you are damaging your economy due to the high tax rates. \n \n THAT is actually indisputable. We can model it. We can see examples of it in history. The problem is that the tipping point between \"damaging your economy\" and \"not damaging your economy\" is somewhere between 50% and 80% taxation. \n \n Reagan, and a lot of people who came after him who also did not bother to actually try to understand the theory, completely misunderstood. They thought it meant that pretty much ANY tax cut would spur the economy and increase revenues...even though that is complete and utter nonsense.\n \n The CBO has completely and totally killed off the whole idea twice now, but the uninformed and ignorant keep using it. \n \n DLC: The Death of Supply-Side Economics\n \n \nThe Death of Supply-Side Economics\n \n For years, advocates of supply-side economics have justified repeated calls for tax cuts for high earners by arguing the cuts will pay for themselves by dramatically boosting economic growth and thus tax revenues. They have just as adamantly insisted that if only Capitol Hill's official arbiter of the budgets, the Congressional Budget Office, would evaluate tax cuts through the prism of \"dynamic scoring\" -- which projects the macroeconomic impact of tax cuts as well as the lost revenues they produce -- their point of view would be vindicated.\n \n Well, CBO has done just that with President Bush's budget, and guess what? In a report prepared under the supervision of a supply-side economist handpicked by the White House and published last week, CBO concluded the president's budget would make long-term budget deficits worse rather than better.\n \n It's taking a while to sink in, but that CBO document pretty much pronounced the death of the supply-side economics. \n \n\n \n The report in question can be found at:\n \n http://www.dlc.org/documents/03-25-AnalysisPresidentBudget-Final.pdf\n \n Cheny, literally one of the original supply side advocates, did not believe them. He decided that the problem was the actual tax cuts in question, and if they were DIFFERENT tax cuts, it might be different. He threw a big enough fit that the CBO did an entirely DIFFERENT study in 2005, again using the white houses hand picked economists, to study the supply side impact of a 10% GENERAL cut in taxes...basically a generic 10% tax cut. Their results can be found here:\n \n http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6908/12-01-10PercentTaxCut.pdf\n \n Not surprisingly it came to the EXACT SAME conclusion. \n \n Even the wall street journal, traditionally a strong supporter of supply side theory, pronounced it DEAD in 2003.\n \n Whoever you are getting your information from is ignorant and WAY behind the times.",

Mr. Gibson quoted Mr. Obama as talking about raising the tax to 28% from 15%. \"But actually, Bill Clinton, in 1997, signed legislation that dropped the capital gains tax to 20 percent,\" Mr. Gibson said. \"And George Bush has taken it down to 15 percent. And in each instance, when the rate dropped, revenues from the tax increased; the government took in more money. And in the 1980s, when the tax was increased to 28 percent, the revenues went down. So why raise it at all, especially given the fact that 100 million people in this country own stock and would be affected?\"\n \n Why, Robert Bartley couldn't have put it better himself. Mr. Obama was totally flummoxed, betraying a fundamental lack of understanding of the Laffer Curve. The Democrat of Illinois spoke of the need to \"finance health care for Americans who currently don't have it,\" and of the need to \"invest in our infrastructure\" and in \"our schools.\"\n \n Mr. Gibson, to his credit, wouldn't let the point go. \"But history shows that when you drop the capital gains tax, the revenues go up,\" he replied to Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama replied by changing the subject, to \"a housing crisis that this president has not been attentive to.\"\n \n Mr. Gibson tried the same question, more or less, on Senator Clinton. She, at least, disavowed raising the capital gains rate above 20%, ruling out a return to the 28% rate contemplated by Mr. Obama. But when Mr. Gibson pressed her on why she would raise it at all, she went into lunk-headed, static analysis mode, displaying a lack of understanding as severe as that afflicting her rival. \"You know, Charlie, I'm going to have to look and see what the revenue situation is,\" she said.",

   "In fact he was, and he stood for exactly what modern Republicans stand for. Does anyone dispute this?\n\n \n Yes I dispute it. And History Disputes it as well.. For example..\n \n From the Encyclopedia on my shelf...\n The Democratic Party\n The Democratic Party evolved from Anti-Federalist factions that opposed the fiscal policies of Alexander Hamilton in the early 1790s. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison organized these factions into the Democratic-Republican Party. The party favored states' rights and strict adherence to the Constitution; it opposed a national bank and wealthy, moneyed interests. The Democratic-Republican Party ascended to power in the election of 1800. After the War of 1812, the party's chief rival, the Federalist Party disbanded. Democratic-Republicans split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe, and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the Democratic Party. Along with the Whig Party, the Democratic Party was the chief party in the United States until the Civil War. The Whigs were a commercial party, and usually less popular, if better financed. The Whigs divided over the slavery issue after the Mexican-American War and faded away. In the 1850s, under the stress of the Fugitive Slave Law and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, anti-slavery Democrats left the party. Joining with former members of existing or dwindling parties, the Republican Party emerged.\n \n From the The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition | 2008\n Democratic party\n \n Origins in Jeffersonian Democracy\n \n When political alignments first emerged in George Washington's administration, opposing factions were led by Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson . In the basic disagreement over the nature and functions of government and of society, the Jeffersonians advocated a society based on the small farmer; they opposed strong centralized government and were suspicious of urban commercial interests. Their ideals-opposed to those of the Federalist party -came to be known as Jeffersonian democracy, based in large part on faith in the virtue and ability of the common man and the limitation of the powers of the federal government. This group of Anti-Federalists, who called themselves Republicans or Democratic Republicans (the name was not fixed as Democratic until 1828), supported many of the ideals of the French Revolution and opposed close relations with Great Britain.\n \n Led by Jefferson and his ally James Madison , the group had become a nationwide party by 1800, winning the support of Aaron Burr and George Clinton in New York, of Benjamin Rush and Albert Gallatin in Pennsylvania, and of most influential politicians in the South. Jefferson became President in 1800 in an election that has often been called a turning point in American history. With this election emerged an alliance between Southern agrarians and Northern city dwellers, an alliance that grew to be the dominating coalition of the party. With Madison and James Monroe succeeding Jefferson, the party's \"Virginia dynasty\" held the presidency until 1824. \n \n From The Oxford Companion to United States History | 2001\n Democratic Party. \n No certain date marks the beginning of the Democratic party, but its intellectual heritage can be traced to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, both of whom shunned parties even as they shaped the policies and sensibility of the so&#8208;called Democratic&#8208;Republican political movement during the 1790s. Opposing the centralizing programs of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who urged a revenue system based on tariffs, excise taxes, a federal bank, and funding of the national debt, Jefferson and Madison established enduring party themes. Champions of the common people, especially small farmers, they spoke for small and frugal government, of states' rights, and the people's sovereignty. In their presidential administrations from 1801 until 1817, the two Virginians sought to retire the national debt, remove the government from the nation's economic life, and rely on state militias rather than a federal army.\n \n And From Dictionary of American History | 2003\n DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n the oldest mass-based political party in the world. The party traces its ancestry to the collaboration between Thomas Jefferson and James Madison of Virginia and Aaron Burr and George Clinton of New York. The four founders of the party may first have gathered in upstate New York in 1791 when Jefferson and Madison were allegedly on a botanical expedition to observe the vegetation and wildlife of the region. The fateful alliance between Virginia and New York, between the planters and small farmers of the South with the small farmers of the West and urban workers of the East, began a durable coalition of American politics that endured into the middle of the twentieth century.\n Jeffersonian Origins\n \n Jefferson, Madison, Burr, and Clinton began their party as an organized opposition to the politics of Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton and his supporters favored a strong central government, debt, credit, banking, and trade policies to further commercial and manufacturing interests, an expanded military and naval budget, and a conciliatory policy toward Great Britain. The Jeffersonian \"Republicans\" as they were then known, favored minimalist government, retirement of the national debt, no favoritism for banks or for manufacturing enterprises, and discriminatory trade policies that would favor France over Britain. The Jeffersonians conceived that they could make America's agricultural exports into a potent instrument of diplomacy. Jefferson, Madison, and Albert Gallatin, the ablest political economist among them, disdained military and naval expenditure as inherently wasteful and corrupting in peacetime.\n \n So you see History does not support your claims. Abraham Lincoln was the First Republican President and Jefferson was a Liberal.",

Kindly produce said example. It would be a far more eloquent riposte than stamping \"Are you people really so ignorant\".\n \n \nPlus the fact that when the Bill was finally finished and introduced to be voted on Jefferson was in Paris, so he never cast a vote for or against it. The bill never passed.. \n\n \n Oh dear. This particular piece was authored in 1778 when Jefferson was a member of the Virginia Assembly. While it follows that Jefferson could not have voted on this legislation by virtue of having been in Paris it does NOT follow that his lack of voting for or against a piece of legislation he helped author contitutes opposition. Jefferson also did not vote on the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom which he authored but that did not prevent him from considering it an achievement on the level of authoring the Declaration of Independence and the founding of UVA.\n \n Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half diameter at the least.\n \n The above is a section of Bill 64[1] \"A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishment in Cases Heretofore Capital,\" one of 126 Bills submitted to the Virginia Assembly in 1779 by the Committee of Revisors. This committee, headed by Thomas Jefferson, worked for two years revising the colonial laws, as Virginia began making the legal transition from colony to commonwealth.[2]\n Bill 64 Thomas Jefferson?s Monticello\n \n Perchance those Princeton villains infiltrated Monticello and infected its ability to research Jefferson's writings but still this leaves the unfortunate matter that Jefferson was a member of the committee that oversaw the drafting of this bill and Jefferson's objections regarded the punishments not the crimes.  \n \n \nSo as you well know, EZ has picked the first thing he could find that MIGHT connect Jefferson to being Anti Gay.. or Anti Gay Sex, since that is EZ's obsession, and he has posted it here as PROOF, that Jefferson was a conservative..\n\n \n Mayhap he did, mayhap he didn't, but his motivation hardly changes what Jefferson wrote. So rather than attacking the messenger, focus on rebutting the message if you would.\n \n \nPlease.. If you call that winning a debate of any kind then you just went down a few notches yourself in my book....\n\n \n Well now I don't exactly have a dog in this hunt, but a source has been posted.

I do not suppose that Jefferson would hazard to opine on morality of future generations as he was rather adamant in not allowing the mores of the past to govern the times in which he lived.\n\n \n From the The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition | 2008\n Democratic party\n \n Origins in Jeffersonian Democracy\n \n When political alignments first emerged in George Washington's administration, opposing factions were led by Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson . In the basic disagreement over the nature and functions of government and of society, the Jeffersonians advocated a society based on the small farmer; they opposed strong centralized government and were suspicious of urban commercial interests. Their ideals-opposed to those of the Federalist party -came to be known as Jeffersonian democracy, based in large part on faith in the virtue and ability of the common man and the limitation of the powers of the federal government. This group of Anti-Federalists, who called themselves Republicans or Democratic Republicans (the name was not fixed as Democratic until 1828), supported many of the ideals of the French Revolution and opposed close relations with Great Britain.\n \n Led by Jefferson and his ally James Madison , the group had become a nationwide party by 1800, winning the support of Aaron Burr and George Clinton in New York, of Benjamin Rush and Albert Gallatin in Pennsylvania, and of most influential politicians in the South. Jefferson became President in 1800 in an election that has often been called a turning point in American history. With this election emerged an alliance between Southern agrarians and Northern city dwellers, an alliance that grew to be the dominating coalition of the party. With Madison and James Monroe succeeding Jefferson, the party's \"Virginia dynasty\" held the presidency until 1824.",

The idea was, of course, based on the British monarchy. A leading nationalist at the Constitutional Convention was Alexander Hamilton.\n \n Second, there were the Federalists. Federalists supported a federal government formed by a union of the various states that had powers that were limited to those specifically granted in the Constitution. Those powers not specifically granted to the federal government were reserved to the states. Leading federalists were George Washington and James Madison.\n \n Third, there were the Republicans (as they called themselves at the time). It has become more politically correct to call the Anti-federalists in recent years. Republicans opposed centralized government, whether national or federal, and thus, subsequently opposed the ratification of the Constitution. Some Republicans walked out of the Constitutional Convention, refusing to sign it.
