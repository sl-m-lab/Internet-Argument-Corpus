What does everyone think?\n\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/07/19/france.sharon/\n Chirac says Sharon is not welcome in France\n \n http://www.lexnotes.com/misc/jacques_iraq.htm\n Chirac and Iraq (a long history-starting with DeGaulle and the French reactor that Israel destroyed.)\n \n http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,10140919%255E2703,00.html\n A hoax concerning anti-semitic attack fools Chirac\n \n I think:\n Chirac has recently been earnest with his attempts to curb anti-semitism in France. For a while, he denied that it was bad. Worldwide pressure came to bear and he got off his duff and at set people to work battling it.\n \n As in the third link above, there was at least one hoax involving one purported attack.\n \n In the lexnotes link, you can see why France and Iraq were such friends. It has multiple links embedded in it that explain the relationship that really started under DeGaulle. The French built reactor in Iraq was destroyed by Israel. This likely prompted anti-semitic activity to increase in France.\n \n The cnn link shows a headline that Sharon is not welcome in France (until he explains himself). This, in itself, sounds anti-semitic to me. If anything it is a haughty attitude.\n \n The French probably don't want their Jewish population to leave because they would likely take their money with them.",
