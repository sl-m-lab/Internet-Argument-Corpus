   "Well, by googling a few times. I've realized that the \"no war between democracies\" argument has been around for some time.\n \n Here's what I came up with.\n http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/demowar.htm\n http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_328.html\n http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/PK.APPEN1.1.HTM\n \n So that's an old argument that has nothing to do with this thread. It depends on your definition of democracy. According to the definitions that make the argument work, the US wasn't a democracy until either the end of the civil war or in 1920 when women were given the vote. But that is neither here nor there. I do agree that the proliferation of democracy would lead to more widespread peace. Anyway.....\n \n So we know that Kerry wrote the book. But have we decided whether an upside down flag is a defacement? \n \n Well, a lot of people say that this is Bush on the campaign trail.\n http://www.dubyaspeak.com/incidents.shtml\n http://www.ollapodrida.org/archives/000046.html\n http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2003_07_20.html\n And there is a yahoo news story linked to by a dozen websites, but it has been removed.\n http://edwardpig.typepad.com/edwardpig/2004/01/flag_desecratio.html\n http://www.sicmuse.com/weblog/archives/000176.htm\n \n Speaking of dictatorships vs. democracies:\n \"If this were a dictatorship,it'd be a heck of a lot easier... just as long as I'm the dictator...\"\n -G.W.Bush, Washington DC, Dec.18, 200, during his first trip to Washington as President-Elect",

   "Actually, If there were no dictatorships, Communist countries, and the like, there would be no need for a military between Democracies.\n\n \n Well, that is a naive statement. If there was no greed, there would be no need for militaries. There hasn't been a communist country in the world's history, the closest has been the alturistic societies of people in the Andes and jungles of Africa. As for dictatorships, Persuses was a darn good one, but they needed the military aganist Sparta, a form of democracy mixed with alot of toliatarism, and Persia. If you remember, the War of 1812, was between two democracies.\n \n \n\n If every country on the planet were a Democracy things would be alot different, and better.\n\n \n No, there would probably be more wars. Democracies are ruled by it's people, and majorities often do really bad things, as well as have tempermeants that are not concucive to peace. Britain is a democracy and jumped for war. America has been considered one of the most warlike countries since it's birth. They would be different, but not necessarily better. \n \n \n\n I don't like war any more than anyone else does. But something had to be done about these dictatorships/communist countries taking one country after another in africa and Asia like they were doing from 1950-1980's.\n\n \n Primarily with the support of the US, well at least the dictatoships, as for communist, never seen it. \n \n \nFunny how \"joining\"(often by force) the commie countries was a one way membership, with no wayout, and thiose citizens who opposed the loss of their freedoms when they came in were systematically neutralized by them.\n\n \n That's not what the nicraguains thought. \n \n \n\n The picture of Bush needs to be authenticated. You can't tell if that is Bush. You can't see the man's face! The book by John Kerry has been authenticated.\n\n \n But it is your opinion on the flag. As for pictures, unless it's directly off flim, I wouldn't trust it. Photo editing software can do virtually anything today.",

   "Also, I don't know if you'd count the US's meddlings in other governments as war, but they are acts of war.\n \n Like the coup in Chile, where we helped overthrow a democratically elected government in favor of a dictator.\n http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm\n \n And in Guatemala (it was in the name of rooting out communists, but we now know it was so we could have Chiquita bananas):\n http://www.newspoetry.org/1999/991226.html\n \n And in Iran against Mohammed Mossadegh:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Mossadegh\n \n And in Venezuela against democratically elected Chavez:\n http://www.workers.org/ww/2002/venezuela0425.php\n \n So the US doesn't care if it's a dictatorship or a democracy as long as US businesses can control the country.",
