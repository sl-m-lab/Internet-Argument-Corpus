   "Is your title intended for a double-meaning?\n Cause I think the Prop 8 passing shows a certain level of people being intolerance towards gays, as those opposed to gays insist on tolerance for their view to discriminate against gays.\n To think of it another way, how tolerant do you think blacks or Jews would be if we suddenly decided to vote on whether or not they could marry?\n I would hope the title was not intending to be stereo-typing, cause it's hardly indicative of gays overall...\n \n Emotions are running high.\n If Obama were to remove a right from the people, like the right to bear arms, and a bunch of Obama supporters showed up in a city that was heavily affected by the move, what do you think the outcome would be?\n \n What happened to this Christian group was clearly wrong. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the \"mob\" participants felt regret over their actions the next morning.\n If you read the description attached to the youtube.com video, it clearly describes this as something significantly different from their usual reception.\n \n And this web-section IS FILLED with people clearly showing intolerance towards gays.

And I will repeat this mantra every time you continue to use this \"EQUALITY\" buzz word which is totally fallacious. \n \n Our system of governing has created hate crime legislation specifically to deal with gay bashing issues. I agree with special punishments for people who target certain people for any reasons of prejudice or bigotry. \n \n And this government doesn't tell you you can't have gay partners and has made great progress in seeking partners rights and benefits.

They are obviously locals who live nearby and going to the Castro is a regular thing for them. But they weren't there for a Prop 8 protest at all. that is very telling based on the reaction. And this explanation is very watered down as we saw them get followed out of the area by a screaming and taunting crowd of haters. In spite of the fact that they didn't press charges on the guy that assaulted them. \n \n It seems that the mere presence of christians is enough to enrage these bigots who demand that we tolerate their lifestyle, as they refuse to tolerate our presence. Hopefully foundit will read the explanation and stop trying to imply that they did something to provoke this attack.",

   "You also miss the point jito. The point is that what the gays would find so perfect an existence, would ultimately wipe them out as a people. Straights would never consider such an offer to be one of paradise in the first place if they had to live out their lives without the love of someone from the opposite sex. Thus, homosexuality is an aberration of nature, not normal or right according to the very laws of nature which determine the survival of any species. \n \n I don't say this to condemn or dismiss homosexuals at all. They are as precious and valuable as every straight human being. But homosexuality is what I'm talking about. It is an unnatural expression of sexuality. And that is why redefining marriage for all of us, just to serve the 3 or 4% of this tiny minority is absolutely ludicrous.\n\n \n This isn't reality, though. Gay men don't all live on an island. We have sexual diversity in all human socities and many documented animal groups. Not everything in nature reproduces(kin selection), and not all humans reproduce. It's natural. We're not robots or a strange alien species. The processes of nature are much more complex than saying, \"oh you're not reproducing, so it's not natural and has no benefit to our species\"---\n Male Homosexuality Can Be Explained Through A Specific Model Of Darwinian Evolution, Study Shows \n \n Gays may reproduce in a variety of ways, or adopt. We don't base marriage rights on reproduction. Gay people may still enter marriage in such a scenario. After all, you don't have to be in love to reproduce. We can have loveless marriages, the value of which would only be determined by breeding.",

It was a hypothetical example to show only that if gay men had a completely closed society, no matter how self sustaining that they wouldn't survive past the first generation. No part of it was based on any real world scenario at all. \n \n So read it in context and I will respond to that since I think we're getting off of the subject that Phyllis framed on this thread. The issue here should be the hateful treatment these young christians received in the Castro when they weren't even there to protest for Prop 8, but were doing something they have done for 3 years and just worshiped the Lord with love for the area. \n \n I just don't want to derail this thread out of respect for her thread subject. Maybe this discussion deserves its own thread.\n  [Archangel] You continue to use the gay talking points and buzz words like equality when you have total and complete equality to me in every way, or are getting them as walls are knocked down. You continue to insist that until you have the right to marry a man you don't have equality yet there are many lifestyles which can't marry either, yet they are also equal in every way to me. You're asking 96%-97% of our population to redefine marriage for all of us so that you 3-4% can consider yourself equal. When you already have the same rights to marry that we have. \n \n What you don't have, but are demanding is a special right which will change the definition of marriage which has stood the world over for 5000+ years. And I will repeat this mantra every time you continue to use this \"EQUALITY\" buzz word which is totally fallacious. \n \n Our system of governing has created hate crime legislation specifically to deal with gay bashing issues. I agree with special punishments for people who target certain people for any reasons of prejudice or bigotry. \n \n And this government doesn't tell you you can't have gay partners and has made great progress in seeking partners rights and benefits. All of which you can get without redefining marriage for the rest of us. \n \n Your demand for marriage rights is your attempt to feel like homosexuality has been accepted as normal and right, and you just have to accept that many in the mainstream will never accept that definition of what homosexuality represents. And the reason is because it isn't normal or right or natural according to the way the species procreates and assures its survival.\n \n Homosexuality is a sexual aberration and if we took every Homosexual man in america and stuck you all in the Garden of Eden, a true Paradise Island where all of your needs were met for life; and did the same thing for every Lesbian in America on their own Gay Paradise Island, You would all last exactly one generation and as you died off from old age, there would be no one to replace you. No progeny, no legacy at all. You would go the way of the Incas and just disappear as a people. That is hard and fast solid evidence that what homosexuality represents in unnatural and doesn't fit the definition of marriage. Because no matter how long you are married, you can never procreate and create offspring as a result of your love or your bond, not naturally anyway. And if we placed all men with men and all women with women, neither of you could even reproduce artificially.\n \n It is not my intent to imply this makes you bad or worthless or evil or terrible human beings in any way, not in your personal value as human beings that is. It is to say that homosexuality is no more worthy of redefining marriage for, than for any of the other lifestyles which have never been allowed to marry according to the definition of one man, one woman. Like it or not, that is the definition of what makes up the historical nuclear family the world over, and just by continuing to scream that you aren't being treated equally, isn't an excuse for redefining marriage for the rest of society.",

   "I agree with moose. This seems like an isolated incident, and like he said, definitely wrong place wrong time.\n \n I am not OK with any kind of physical attack unless it is in self defense. Gays have a right to retribution to the people who passed Prop. 8, however physical abuse is not the answer. I'm OK with verbal attacks, but definitely not physical. The gays' actions were also understandable. They had just had a fundamental civil right stripped from them by the Christians, and all of that anger was probably directed toward the Christians on the street. It would be like plopping a couple of KKK members in the middle of Compton, CA. Its not gonna end pretty.\n\n \n No, it's more like if the KKK specifically did something, and then there was a gathering of white people were shouted down and attacked as if they were all KKK members when they weren't. Again, these Christians may have not had anything to do with Prop8. Apparently they were coming here long before Prop 8 was ever even passed. It's bad judgment for these kids to not have taken into account that Prop 8 just passed, but there's nothing understandable at all about the way they were treated.

Here's evidence of it.\n GOING DUTCH?: Stanley Kurtz \n \n ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO, two prominent demographers hailed the Dutch family as a model for Europe. Somehow the Dutch had managed to combine liberal family law and a robust welfare state with a surprisingly traditional attitude toward marriage. Even as a new pattern of highly unstable parental cohabitation was sweeping out of Scandinavia and across northern Europe, the Dutch were unswayed. To be sure, premarital cohabitation was widespread, but when Dutch couples decided to have children, they got married. At least they used to. \n \n Today, marriage is in trouble in the Netherlands. In the mid-1990s, out-of-wedlock births, already rising, began a steeper increase, nearly doubling to 31 percent of births in 2003. These were the very years when the debate over the legal recognition of gay relationships came to the fore in the Netherlands, culminating in the legalization of full same-sex marriage in 2000. The conjunction is no coincidence. \n \n A careful look at the decade-long campaign for same-sex marriage in the Netherlands shows that one of its principal themes was the effort to dislodge the conviction that parenthood and marriage are intrinsically linked. Even as proponents of gay marriage argued vigorously--and ultimately successfully--that marriage should be just one of many relationship options, fewer Dutch parents were choosing marriage over cohabitation. No longer a marked exception on the European scene, the Dutch are now traveling down the Scandinavian path. \n \n Call it the end of the Dutch paradox, the distinctive combination of liberal social policies and traditional behavior. On euthanasia, prostitution, drug use, and now gay marriage, Dutch law is the cutting edge of Western liberalism. Yet among Dutch people, drug use and sexual license are far from rampant. Many have asked whether this balance of tolerance and tradition, with its deep roots in Dutch culture and history, is sustainable over the long term. At least for marriage, the answer appears to be no. ... \n \n Van der Staaij pointed out a critical problem in the government's proposal for same-sex marriage. Would the law recognize the usual ties of descent between children and married couples? Would, say, the female spouse of a mother who conceived a child automatically become the parent of the biologically unrelated child? If so, the implication was, might such a child have three simultaneous legal parents? And if so, would this not set off a cascade of legal pressures to repudiate the two-parent standard (a process that is playing itself out right now in Sweden)? \n \n The government opted to avoid the issue by denying automatic parental rights to same-sex spouses. But, as Van der Staaij noted, that decision opened up a dangerous gap between the traditionally conjoined notions of marriage and parenthood. The dilemma itself stood as stark proof that in a matter heretofore central to marriage, homosexual and heterosexual couples are indeed differently situated. ... \n \n To appreciate gay marriage's role in encouraging the recent upsurge of Dutch parental cohabitation, we need only take seriously what participants in the Dutch debate said. Spend a decade telling people that marriage is not about parenthood and they just might begin to believe you. Make relationship equality a rallying cry, and people might decide that all forms of relationship are equal--especially young people, of family-forming age, most of whom have left religion behind. Dutch conservatives made a valiant stand for procreation and parenting as of the essence of marriage, and they were soundly beaten. Having duly considered and rejected the essential tie between marriage and parenthood, the Dutch started to abandon their inertial traditionalism and began to experiment with parental cohabitation in record numbers. \n \n Again and again, voices from across the political spectrum argued that gay marriage signifies the demotion or abolition of marriage as the socially preferred setting for parenthood. It should come as no surprise when Dutch parents act accordingly. iMAPP.org | Institute for Marriage and Public Policy\n \n \nThe sad part is that a few years ago, U.S. state governments DID tell gays they couldn't have gay partners, in a sexual way.\n And we fought against that, and won.\n While people like you fought against it...\n\n \n That's because we stand against homosexuality as a practice. We understand its harmful effects on the individual and the larger society as is shown in the link above.\n \n \nBut telling us what we \"can\" do doesn't address the discrimination in the system. It doesn't justify the discrimination in the system.\n If we had blacks being forbidden from voting, would it be reasonable to tell them \"but you can marry a black woman\"...\n\n \n Stop comparing your issue to the black plight for equal right. You do not represent a race, but a lifestyle.\n \n \nThis is an absurd lie.\n Marriage rights exist in Massachusetts.\n Does that mean all the citizens \"accept\" homosexuality? No.\n\n \n It will take another 10 years to determine the psychological impact of normalizing homosexuality on the next generation, by redefining marriage in Mass, so don't even try to make any absolute claims at this point\n \n \nThe really boring part of this is how I EXPLICITLY TELL YOU that legalized gay marriage WILL NOT mean \"homosexuality has been accepted\", and yet you continue to lie and claim that's what I think...\n\n \n It's interesting how you claim boredom or tiresome those arguments which you can't refute.\n \n \n1) \"Normal\" is irrelevant.\n 2.x kids is \"normal\". That doesn't mean squat about people that have 5 kids.\n 130 IQ is abnormal. Doesn't mean its bad or wrong.\n\n \n You constantly prove how irrational your thinking is foundit. A 130 IQ isn't abnormal at all. It is just less common than 110. And it doesn't threaten the survival of the species either. If it did it would be considered abnormal and detrimental. If homosexuality was to become a forced universal standard, the human race would cease to exist in one generation. That is detrimental to humanity.\n \n \n2) \"right\" is a value judgment repeatedly being debated on this forum.\n Just because your religion says \"it's wrong\" doesn't mean squat.\n Your religion says women can't be teachers. Your religious history had no problem with genocide, slavery, or misogyny.\n Your religion should not be taken as an expert on morality.\n\n \n Are you now claiming that every single person in Cali which supported Prop 8 was religious? You know better than that. But you must focus on the christians as a reason for losing. Many who never step foot in a church supported this prop for purely moral and common sense reasons.\n \n \n3) \"natural\"?\n Homosexuality is observed throughout nature. Claims that it is not \"natural\" are based on how you want to redefine the word \"natural\" to ignore what happens in nature.\n\n \n Sure it is, in approximately the same percentages that it is in humans. It is a tiny minority. And how sad that as a human being you must justify your lifestyle based on the activities in the animal kingdom.\n \n \nInteresting test.\n If we take every heterosexual man in america and stuck you all in the Garden of Eden, a true Paradise Island where all of your needs were met for life; and did the same thing for every heterosexual woman in America on their own Straight Island, You would all last exactly one generation and as you died off from old age, there would be no one to replace you. No progeny, no legacy at all.\n\n \n Complete obfuscation of the hypothetical point I was making as I pointed out twice already. But at least you're being consistent. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nThis is a stupid and inaccurate definition. Marriage has NOTHING to do with procreative requirement.\n\n \n A requirement, NO. But a realistic option if they choose to? Absolutely necessary, and is why marriage has been defined as between a man and a woman for 5000+ years now.\n \n \nPop Quiz.\n Can a polygamous marriage with one man and three women procreate? Yes.\n Can a man marrying a 14-year old girl have kids? Yes.\n\n \n So what? If they don't qualify as fitting the criteria for a nuclear family, then how in the world can you claim you do?\n \n \nHow about people that are allowed to marry?\n Can a man and woman, both over 60, marry? Yes. Can they procreate? No.\n If a woman gets surgically sterilized, can she still marry? Yes.\n If a man surgically sterilizes himself, can he marry? Yes.\n If a man and woman go to the justice of the peace and state \"We want to marry, but we will never have vaginal intercourse. We will not procreate.\", can they get married? Yes.\n Marriage has no requirement for procreation.\n\n \n True, and it shouldn't be one, but they do fall within the historically accepted definition of marriage so they fall within the accepted standard for marriage.\n \n \nArchie, THAT DESCRIPTION is what I was talking about in my previous posts.\n I welcome you to quote ANYWHERE where I said the prayer people did anything to \"provoke this attack\".\n As usual, you lie like a dog on a rug.\n\n \n You said they have doing this for 3 years, implying that they provoked the response they got. Here is what you said.\n \n \nArchie, if you actually READ the description that came with the video you would see that these people do this ON A REGULAR BASIS.\n This reaction is NOT the usual reaction they see.\n \n And like I told you earlier, the video does say that these Christians ALREADY DO THIS on a regular basis, which is something you didn't realize either.\n You act like \"straight people protesting the gay lifestyle\" is some new concept. It's been going on for YEARS.\n Christian protesters at gay pride events is a standard and expected occurrence.\n \n\n \n Your implication was that the christians were protesting against the gays when they were singing, praying and doing no harm at all. The girl who was hit and kicked even forgave her attacker, preventing him from getting arrested. And as the video showed, even after that, the militant gays chased them out of the neighborhood by following them like a gang of thugs.

   "But it's totally consistent with the legal definition of what defines a family. It may not seem fair to you, but it's legally justified for that reason.\n\n Archie, there IS NO legal definition of \"family\".\n A single person can adopt in Florida, if straight. One man and a child, or one woman and a child.\n But if that person is gay, it's still \"one man and a child\" or \"one woman and a child\".\n But when that person is gay, they CANNOT adopt.\n That is not equality.\n \n Military service has NOTHING to do with \"family\". Gays are discriminated against in the military.\n \n \n \nYour analogy is once again fallacious as you're attempting to equate legally recognized religious freedoms with homosexual marriage which isn't a legally recognized activity.\n\n That's a rather feeble excuse to ignore the analogy.\n In Massachusetts, gay marriage is legal, so there the analogy is valid, right?\n Let me guess. No response, right?\n \n The point involves the UNDERLYING LOGIC of pretending that two groups have \"equality\" when the law favors the practices of one group at the exclusion of the other group.\n And it's really, really, REALLY stupid how your analysis of the analogy will say \"you have equality\" in BOTH situations where gays have gay marriage, and where we don't.\n \n \n \nExactly, and that definition isn't limited to just your community but will redefine marriage universally so all of the other groups who don't fall within the historical definition will now be able to demand the same rights under the new definition. And to deny that fact is to deny the reality of what will result in redefining marriage for everyone.\n\n Archie, you don't recognize what's really going on here.\n The other groups HAVE ALREADY MADE their demands. After Loving v Virginia, there was a SCOTUS case on polygamy where polygamists were shot down.\n You're trying to blame us as the initial domino, when the truth is that LOVING V VIRGINIA was ACTUALLY the first domino in this trend.\n \n But at the same time, you have this mistaken belief that EVERY domino will fall, when that is not the case. Restrictions in marriage will STILL EXIST when gay marriage is granted.\n Just look at Massachusetts. Is polygamy legal there? NO.\n \n \n \nFoundit, it's irrelevant how the individual citizen personally defines marriage at that point. What is relevant is that it is redefined for everyone. \n\n I am repeatedly amused when I find people come forth with the position that:\n a) no INDIVIDUAL is affected, but \n b) they still claim EVERYONE is affected.\n \n So NO INDIVIDUAL person's definition of marriage will be redefined, but EVERYONE's definition of marriage will be redefined?\n That's absurd!\n \n The GOVERNMENT's definition will be defined differently. That's entirely different than any individual (or everyone) who will still define \"marriage\" as they did before the ruling.\n \n \n \nIt's not a lie, it's a rational concern which is proven by observing how marriage has been negatively transformed in countries which have bought into civil unions and gay marriage. Here's evidence of it.\n GOING DUTCH?: Stanley Kurtz \n\n Archie, THIS IS ACTUALLY the article that Badgett was referring to earlier when I gave her article.\n Kurtz is doing the same thing that your earlier article did.\n Kurtz is looking at a trend that existed LONG BEFORE GAY MARRIAGE EXISTED, and then pretending to blame it all on gay marriage.\n He gives ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY gay marriage is to blame either...\n \n So gay marriage exists.\n HOW does that cause some couple to decide to not get married, even if they have a kid?\n It doesn't. It's an absurd proposal!\n \n \n \nThat's because we stand against homosexuality as a practice.\n\n It's hilarious how you keep doing that.\n I've run across a few individuals in the past who will also consistently perform this trick upon command, but they are few and far between.\n \n People like you pretend that gays have equality.\n And when inequality is pointed out, YOU SHOW SUPPORT for that inequality.\n And then, at some time in the future, you'll STILL pretend gays have equality...\n \n \n \nStop comparing your issue to the black plight for equal right. You do not represent a race, but a lifestyle.\n\n It's an analogy Archie.\n And I would love for you to explain what \"lifestyle\" I have.\n Is there a straight \"lifestyle\" as well?\n \n \n \nIt will take another 10 years to determine the psychological impact of normalizing homosexuality on the next generation, by redefining marriage in Mass, so don't even try to make any absolute claims at this point\n\n What absolute malarkey!\n Archie KNOWS he can't show any damages, so he just whines that the evidence won't be available until some time in the future.\n And when \"another 10 years\" comes past, he'll claim he needs twenty.\n \n \n \nIt's interesting how you claim boredom or tiresome those arguments which you can't refute.\n\n Wow. Just unbelievably WOW!\n I DID refute your argument.\n Let me repeat the refutation...\n \"I EXPLICITLY TELL YOU that legalized gay marriage WILL NOT mean \"homosexuality has been accepted\", and yet you continue to lie and claim that's what I think...\"\n \n You obviously don't listen very well at all.\n \n \n \nYou constantly prove how irrational your thinking is foundit. A 130 IQ isn't abnormal at all. It is just less common than 110.\n\n Is this where you make up your own definitions of words to try to justify your claims?\n 130 IQ IS abnormal. Look up the meaning of the word \"abnormal\".\n \n \n \nAnd it doesn't threaten the survival of the species either.\n\n Homosexuality supposedly \"threatens the survival of the species\"???\n Homosexuality has been with us since the beginning. It exists in NUMEROUS animal species across the animal kingdom.\n This claim of yours is obviously false, and yet you continue in the delusion anyways...\n \n \n \nIf homosexuality was to become a forced universal standard...\n\n Geezus!\n NOBODY is talking about making homosexuality a \"forced universal standard\".\n That would NEVER result out of ANY of the equality I am talking about.\n \n By your logic, if the entire body was made up of the foot, then the body would die and rot, right?\n So the foot must be harmful to the body then, right?\n Your thinking is obviously stunted!\n \n \n \nMany who never step foot in a church supported this prop for purely moral and common sense reasons.\n\n And yet, when challenged for ANY of these imagined \"purely moral and common sense reasons\", you give these absolutely ridiculous responses like \"if everybody was forced to be gay...\"\n That's not common sense.\n \n \n \nSure it is, in approximately the same percentages that it is in humans. It is a tiny minority.\n\n So?\n Does the fact that we are a minority somehow justify condemnation?\n \n \n \nAnd how sad that as a human being you must justify your lifestyle based on the activities in the animal kingdom.\n\n Again, you can always count on some people to chase their tails...\n YOU BROUGHT UP \"NATURAL\" as a means to condemn gays in the first place.\n NOT me.\n I don't think there is any sense in condemning or justifying anything based on behavior in nature.\n All I did was refute your idiotic contention (and you should know better by now) that homosexuality was unnatural.\n I never said anything about \"natural\" justifying anything.\n \n \n \nComplete obfuscation of the hypothetical point I was making as I pointed out twice already.\n\n No. It's a perfect example of why your \"hypothetical point\" is ridiculous.\n Put ALL GAYS on one island, men and women, and we'll survive.\n \n You just can't get past the mentality of different standards for gays and straights.\n \n \n \nA requirement, NO. But a realistic option if they choose to? Absolutely necessary...\n\n Then explain to me why we allow 60 year olds to marry.\n A 60 year can't have any kids.\n Surgically sterilized people can't have kids.\n But we still allow them to marry...\n \n Your claim is false. Procreation IS NOT any sort of restriction.\n \n \n \nTrue, and it shouldn't be one, but they do fall within the historically accepted definition of marriage so they fall within the accepted standard for marriage.\n\n And you just moved the goal-posts.\n A minute ago, you tried to put up \"procreation\" as some sort of barrier for marriage.\n I proved that it has NEVER been a barrier for marriage.\n So now you change your standard to \"historically accepted\".\n \n Interracial marriage WAS NOT \"historically accepted\" in the U.S. In fact, it wasn't until the late 80's / early 90's that the support for interracial marriage finally grew to a majority.\n \"historically accepted\" has nothing to do with it. By that standard, ANY form of historical prejudice would have to be accepted without question.\n \n \n \nYou said they have doing this for 3 years, implying that they provoked the response they got.\n\n NOTHING in your quote gives ANY sort of \"implication\" that they \"provoked\" the attack.\n I pointed out that they have been DOING THIS FOR YEARS WITH NO ATTACK, so obviously their actions were not unique.\n Anybody with half a brain could see that their ACTIONS were not provoking, but rather it was the Prop 8 frustration which was the real impetus.\n \n Can you explain how anybody can think they \"provoked\" anything when they've been doing the exact same thing for years now?",

How does that really justify anything? How does that make it ok to target these kids, a lot of whom probably didn't even have anything to do with Prop 8 whatsoever? I already said I agree it was unwise for the kids to do their thing on THAT particular date since it followed the Prop 8 vote so soon. But you're arguing about this as if the fact of Prop 8 makes the reaction of the mob any more right. It doesn't. If that's not what you think, then I'm honestly not sure what your whole point is here.\n \n \nCan you just explicitly admit that PROP 8 is the REAL impetus of the situation?\n \n That WITHOUT prop 8, NONE of this would have happened.\n\n \n Sure, no one is saying to the contrary! But I don't see how that's really relevant. Look at the logic ...\n \n - Frustrating-Event by Group A happens\n \n - Angry mob is frustrated by Frustrating-Event\n \n - Angry mob attacks Group B over frustrating-event, even though they have no idea if Group B was complicit in Frustrating-Event.\n \n So we have 2 identifiable groups here: Group A (which we define as having voted or pushed for Prop 8). And Group B (which we define as being on the streets evangelizing every week). It's possible SOME of the member of Group B were also a part of Group A, but no one really knows, and since Group B is about behavior (evangelizing) that is very common to Christians all over the place, then it's a safer assumption to think that they weren't doing what they were doing for same reasons that drove Group A. I think it's safe to say that the actions of Angry Mob toward Group B are not justifiable because of what Group A did. And before you start in on any knee-jerk CLAFCLOWN mess, I'm not claiming that you made that claim. I'm saying that I can't see how pointing out that it wouldn't have happened without Prop 8 really means anything. People are responsible for their actions no matter what could be said to \"not have happened\" if so-and-so hadn't happened first. To use a very extreme example, the A bomb wouldn't have been dropped on Japan if Pearl Harbor hadn't taken place, but that doesn't mean the ethical issue of the A bomb isn't right or wrong on it's OWN merits or the merits of OTHER events as well. The fact that it wouldn't have happened without the impetus of Pearl Harbor may be factually true, but that's about as far as the relevance of the impetus goes. It can FACTOR in, but all I'm saying is that it's not justifiable by that prior event alone, by any stretch of the imagination.",

It shouldn't be \"news\" anymore than the Christians coming into the gay pride or Castro.\n \n I'm just giving the full picture here.\n \n \n \nBut you're arguing about this as if the fact of Prop 8 makes the reaction of the mob any more right.\n\n Yeah.\n When I repeatedly say their actions are to be condemned and inexcusable, I am obviously trying to give some way of saying the mob is right... emoticon_frazzled\n Thanks for misrepresenting my position, yet again...\n \n \n \nSure, no one is saying to the contrary!\n\n But the funny thing is that some people ARE trying to use this ONE TIME SCENARIO to indict the ENTIRE gay community, ignoring the bigger picture.\n Look at the title of the thread. A vague lumping in of people.\n LOOK at your reference to these guys as \"gay rights folks\".\n \n By leaving out these BIG details about the REAL causes and the REAL things involved, people are trying to denigrate the entire gay community.\n It's disgusting.",

It sort of flies in the face of gay marriage being a \"progressive\" issue when the examples used to say gay relations are acceptable and normal are those which existed as an accepted form of relationship in ancient civilizations. Let's be straight up here--a closer look shows these were often really cases of legalized pederasty. These were cultures that were rather brutal and NON-progressive by anyone's standards today. If greek or Roman culture is some height of homosexual culture, is that REALLY a good thing? If anything, it's somewhat hypocritical to chastise religious people for invoking an ancient culture in terms of standards, but then turn around and do (or allow) the very same thing about OTHER ancient cultures happened to allow some form of homosexual relationships.\n \n As a related side note, the other interesting thing along these lines that sometimes happens is how the whole gay-sex-exists-among-animals thing is sometimes used to argue for it. The whole \"it-exists-in-nature-so-it's-natural-for-humans\" thing. As if that's any standard most human beings use to go by in determining the normalcy or acceptability of a given behavior. (Hey, it's normal for animals to mate with their own kin, as well as kill each other for food sometimes. So I'm really not sure most people are going to want to go by any standard set there for normalcy and 'acceptable' behavior.) If people want to argue for gay relationships to be acceptable, then they are certainly free to do so. And I think there are some compelling arguments in terms of what should be legal and allowed in terms of rights. But I just don't find these arguments about acceptability particularly compelling at all, and can't imagine why anyone would.",

Because when they are rejecting what the bible say's about homosexuality in that time period, they will refer to those ancient cultures practices and attempt to assert that only pederasty took place. Yet when arguing this aspect of the argument, they will refer to those same practices as justification for their opinions.

If you look at all of the civilizations which have existed over the last 5000 years through out the world, the standard in the vast majority of them has been between a man and a woman. Sure, there have been some exceptions, although we would both be hard pressed to produce even 10 who differed from this norm and allowed same gender marriages. And it must also be noted that none of those civilizations have survived the centuries to prove to us this resulting moral collapse which led too same gender marriage did anything to promote or secure the civilizations them selves as they obviously no longer exist.
