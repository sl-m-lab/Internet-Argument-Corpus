   "Here is a recent comment from Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart: \n \n \"I'm trying to find the correct name for it ... this utter absolute, asinine, idiotic stupidity of men marrying men. ... I've never seen a man in my life I wanted to marry. And I'm gonna be blunt and plain; if one ever looks at me like that, I'm gonna kill him and tell God he died.\"\n \n I thought they were suppose to teach love, and christian values like following the ten commandments. Thou shalt not kill.......\n \n \n And the right can't seem to figure out why we gays and lesbains call it \"HATE\" speech. \n \n The funniest part of this if you have never seen this guy....trust me no gay man is looking at him....no straight women either. He isn't exactly a hunk. Why would he think anyone would \"look and me like that\"\n \n \n \n source:\n www.365gay.com/newscon04/09/092004swaggart.htm",

They find all the negatives of being gay and exergerate them.

Best part, they do it in God's name! How christian!",
