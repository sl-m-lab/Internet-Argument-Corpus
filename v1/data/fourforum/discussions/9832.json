I believe in laws that protect others from harm, such as murder, theft, arson, abuse, and hate. There should be no laws resticting freedom of assembly or sexual freedom. I also believe that we have a responsiblity to look after those who are less fortunate then ourselves, feed the hungry, house the homeless, take care of the sick and injured.

   "Why do many gays find it necessary to purposelly distort their personalities and speech in order to imitate a stereotype of an opposite gender? For instance the whole lisping, nancy boy thing. Its disgusting. The act of homosexuality is bad enough, but conciously warping your own personality, the very way you talk - and for WHAT? Why do gay guys try to imitate women and gay women imitate men? Its disgusting and tragic and totally contrived.\n\n I guess I can answer is these in order (lord knows us gay people are so neat and organized:xbanghead )\n \n 1.) I can't honestly tell you why some gays do that. But I don't. I promise. I am myself, and only myself. I do not try to change myself to fit a \"stereotype\". I have no lisp, and the only Nancy I know is Nancy Drew.\n 2.) Oh please, you think it's bad, you think it's disgusting how we get it on, we don't exactly think that doing the opposite sex is anything fun either. Been there. Trust me. UGH.\n 3.) It's just a matter of gender identity. Some men feel they are a woman trapped in a man's body, and vice versa. Why should you care?\n 4.) Don't act like a tool. Try minding your own business and don't care so much how other people behave.\n \n \nYou do realize that some of us find the act of heterosexuality sick, nasty, disgusting. I cringe at the thought of touching a woman.\n\n haha I couldn't have said it better myself. emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xgood",

That I as a gay man have the right to discriminate and oppress heterosexuals?\n\n \n \n Speaking from ONLY my personal experience on this, I have seen far more homosexuals be discriminatory towards heteros. Ranging from kiosks in the local mall run by gays and only hiring gays to A homosexual mgmt at a Wendy's restaurant years ago that promoted gays over heteros.\n \n This is NOT how most of the world is and I'm sure the reverse is also true for some.\n \n As to your points, NO, you do not have to recognize the marriages of others unless forced to do so. But, you may find it political to do so.\n As for hirings and firings, same but there are often laws to prevent that. Just as laws are being introduced to protect your kinds also. Laws against ANY type of discrimination didn't just pop up over night. It took hard WORK and PATIENCE to get the masses or judges to agree with them using tools of persuasion and a sound logic to get others to listen to your pleas.\n Ranting about the unfairness of the situation you find yourself in isn't going to CHANGE it. Might as well scream to the uncaring sky god for all the good it's going to do you.\n \n What I'm saying is you're not in a good position to enact your will upon the majority without suffering a massive defeat. Not only for yourself but for those who would ally with you. Be them fellow gays or those sympathetic to your plight. You're being counter productive. Personally, in the byzantine world, if you didn't take sound advice and chill, I'd remove you as an embarrasement to the 'casue'.\n \n So, you can discriminate all you want. But there could be consequences. The chances of you oppressing anyone is slim.\n I'm suggesting you change your strategy as your tactics are counter productive. I can understand your emotional painms at being denied fair treatment but think of all those who would say 'You haven't conviunced me and if this is how all gays act, I don't think I'll give an inch as you'll take a mile...I'm voting against you out of spite...so Nyaahh'",
