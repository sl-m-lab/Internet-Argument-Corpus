   "How is this praise of feminism? What does this have to do with feminism? It appears to be a list of ways to masculinize women. That would be masculinism! Women don't need to be masculine. I don't think they want to be masculine. I hope they don't want to be masculine.\n \n I'm guessing some of the original comments are tongue-in-cheek and not intended for serious debate. However, the OP's apparent attitude, intended or not, is part of the problem between the men and women of the world.\n \n 1. There is nothing liberating about making women share jail cells with men. It's hard enough getting them to peacefully share the bedroom at home.\n \n 2. Some women are more fit to serve in the infantry than some men. Why shouldn't they be allowed to by way of their own choice? We currently have a volunteer army anyway.\n \n So many people confuse feminism. with dykism and penis envy. To feminize, you remove the rough edges and pamper the smooth curves that are generally perculiar to the female form. You take away the smelly armpits and the drooling lust, substitute them with mating musk and a coy 'come-and-get-it' smile.",

   "I am new to this particular \"Society Debates\" forum, but this thread caught my eye - not because it had anything particularly serious to say but because the issue of feminism came up and was painted as extreme.\n \n So, if anyone wants to address a serious question, my question is: What aspects of mainstream claims of those advocating women's rights would you consider extreme? I used to occasionally hear of extreme versions of feminism that would make obsurd statements (such as a man opening a door for a woman making her feel like she was raped) but those were so fringe that nobody pays attention to them anymore. My question addresses mainstream women's rights issues. What objections do you have to the mainstream issues?",

   "I'll do some research today and come up with something if I can. I'm pretty confident I can find lots of feminazis who said lots of dumb things, however I gotta ask before I start, whom do you consider to be moderate, level headed women's rights activists? Because I think the problem will NOT be finding dumb things that various feminists have said over the years (i grew up during the 90's and heard A LOT of stupid things come from that particular camp) but rather agreeing how, or to what extent they are mainstream. \n \n Also, you have to factor in that a more radical center may have existed some time in the past. I hope to show you and to prove pretty solidly that \"mainstream\" feminism has not historically been the voice of the strong, empathetic, courageous, love filled woman speaking out with a level headed, empassioned and common sense view point. \n \n It has only been in recent times that feminism has restyled itself as a moderate, common sense position. Thats my hypothesis anyway. If you disagree with my starting premises lemme know! Get back to you tommorrow hopefully with some links proving or disproving (highly unlikely but I leave that possibility open) my point.",

   "Mainstream or uncontroversial feminist demands boil down to: \n \n 1). Equality of educational opportunity and access to careers: equal pay for equal work.\n \n 2). Full civil rights for women and legislation (or revaluation) to correct conceptual and social biases that lead to the subordination of women or disparagement of their experience. \n \n Academic feminism goes a lot further and claims that \"gender bias\" is implicit, for example, in the study of history, literature, psychology, and science. A feminist critique has evolved in these fields of inquiry that discovers and censures discrimination. But more contentiously, as far as scientific inquiry is concerned, some feminist critics have made sweeping or extreme claims and seek a reformulation of science that reaches deeply into its methods, content, ideas, and findings. \n \n James.",
