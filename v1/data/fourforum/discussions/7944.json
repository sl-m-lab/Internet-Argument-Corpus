   "Thought this was a thoughtful article on the inevitable attacks on the oil industry and attempts to link them to Republicans in the wake of rising gas prices. It deals with pending legislation to put further regulation on oil companies.\"Taking on Big Oil six months before November's election is a can't miss proposition for politicians, of course. Besides calling on the federal government to make OPEC liable under U.S. anti-trust laws, Kohl's Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006 would mandate the creation of a joint state-federal task force to investigate whether producers, refiners and marketers are sharing information in a bid to keep prices high. It would also ask the DOJ and the FTC to examine the consequences of the mega-mergers that have transformed the industry in recent years.\n \n There's no harm in having the government keep a closer watch on the energy industry, and Kohl's sympathy for consumers is commendable, but blaming Big Oil for high gas prices is a little like blaming McDonald's (Research) for obesity. (Yes, I know that also makes for effective politics.)\n \n Because while those profits might seem outrageous - ExxonMobil (Research) earned over $36 billion last year - Big Oil makes its money by pumping oil out of the ground, not refining and selling it as gasoline. Of Exxon's mammoth haul, only a tiny fraction came from making and selling gas in the U.S.\n \n The idea that prices are set by Big Oil, not the traders at the NYMEX and other global bourses, is a misconception that seems to come into vogue whenever energy prices start making new highs. And putting the blame on OPEC, let alone trying to subject a foreign cartel to U.S. laws, seems to be doing anything but dealing honestly with the problem of too much demand and too little supply here at home.\"\n \n http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/12/magazines/fortune/pluggedin_fortune/index.htm?cnn=yes",

   "I think that Jyoshu is correct on this one. It is not just a quesiton of whether Americans would like to use less energy, since I think that most would, especially when energy prices rise, but a quesiton of whether they are capable of doing so.\n \n american society is essentially based on cheap energy. If cheap energy is no longer available, our system breaks down. Most americans are now suburbanites On average we live further form our work than citizens of any other country. Mass transit within our major cities is not a problem, but mass transit covering a significant portion of the suburbs is a pipe dream. \n \n In addition to personal consumption, our transportation infrastructures for everything from manufatured goods to foodstuffs is based on cheap energy as well. We have a rail system that Bulgaria would be embaressed to claim, and most of our goods are transported by (inefficient) trucks. \n \n Significant energy savings cannot be realized without dismanteling our current suburbanite lifestyle. This will not happen unitl the cost of energy has reached a point that people choose to move back into the cities. \n \n From a practical standpoint, Georges post is probably the most relevant to the thread. Couple that 70% (and the numbers I have seen show that as JUST credit card purchases....debit card purchases are a seperate category) with the increased mortgage foreclsure rates we have already seen, and are going to accelerate by all accounts, and the increased energy prices are obviously just another component of the perfect finacial storm that is brewing.",

A fuel tax adequate for financing a public transportation system to drastically reduce private passenger transportation would immediately raise the cost of living proportionately in a time of stagnant wages and inflation, politically unacceptable in an internal transaction economy accumulating debt. Unless the feds finance even that. A long-term project, it would break a lot of people just making ends meet and. \n \n 2. The US hasn't had government since Volker's era that could keep its hands out of public trusts. After experiencing mismanagement of SS and fuel tax trusts, I have no confidence in our single party leadership keeping their hands out of a new cookie jar. Especially current administration.\n \n I believe the US is experiencing difficult economic times unrealized by the general public, Katrina's aftermath still has no plan other than a larger FEMA due to funds, and agree with you it will take force to modify inbred public habit. In my opinion, that force will be economic hardship.",

Population density essetnially ensures that simply by the law of averages, you will be able to get enough people all headed in the same direction to make it worthwhile. Even public transport in NEw York and Chicago does not really extend to the suburbs to any real extend because as population density falls, so does the efficiency of your program.\n \n Mass transport is something that certainly sounds good, and works well in its place, but most American cities are not set up in such a manner that makes it an efficient solution. History has shown that for the most part, if the system is there, and it meets peoples needs, they WILL use it. It is getting the system there and getting it to meet peoples needs that is the problem.\n \n My real problem with your plan is the tax to fix the problem. That has never worked in the past and will probably never work in the future.\n \n First problem I see is that no politicians is willing to keep their hands off of money, regardless of what it is earmarked for. That is why Social Security is shot... we spent all the money in the trust fund and replacesd it with worthless IOUs.\n \n Second problem is that it takes 10-15 years to implement such a program. So, we start taxing the bejesus out of gas tomorrow and tell people \"In 15 years you will thank us\"? In the mean time, we have stangnant or even declining wages.

This is NOT a good combination.\n\n \n Actually, the first problem would be that no politician would be wiling to put their career on the line to implement this. Other than that you're pretty much right, though I think your second problem could probably be worked around somewhat. First off, only tax gas, not diesel. That will keep trucking costs steady, so that shouldn't hit people. Your other concern could probably be dealt with by creative financing. Sell bonds now to finance the infrastructure construction, and pay them off with the taxes that will be implemented a few years down the road, or something like that. The trick will be that you'll want the completion of the infrastructure to coincide with the tax increase, so that people have a viable alternative to their cars when money becomes an issue.",

   "Somehow I have trouble taking seriously an article which refers to eletrolysis resulting in browns gas as \"an Amazing Breakthrough\"\n \n Lets take a look at some of the other fine, factual articles offered by this publication:\n \n http://www.netmar.com/~maat/archive/feb2/trombly.htm\n \n \nI used to have a company called Zero Point Technology. As soon as you put something like that on your shingle, you discover just how unacceptable this concept is to those whose growth stopped so long ago.\n \n People are being bombarded with subliminal messages that tell them that aliens don't exist. Even The \"X-Files,\" which is a joke (thank God they're canceling it), was originally intended, by Chris Carter, to be something more than just random amusement. It was intended to be groundbreaking. But there's government interference. And this is a huge subject. People don't understand that the \"other U.S. government\" has had contact for decades with cultures that aren't from this planet.\n\n \n \n I \nknow that there's an alien agenda because my father wrote this in his journals. He said he had discovered that the U.S. government had become involved in its implementation. He went further to say that this alien agenda, in his opinion, was contrary to the good of the human species and the planet.\n \n He believed that a sector of the military/industrial complex was involved in a program, basically, to transform our atmosphere, which is benign to our species and other Earth species, into one that is greatly reduced in terms of its oxygen content.\n \n So this is a force which doesn't have good intentions for us. It is a force that would gladly exterminate us. And yet human beings act as agents for this force. The \"human\" species is exterminating itself, by its own hands.\n \n My father spoke of alien agendas in his most secret thoughts. This was not something he spoke of in public. He would never have given this interview, I'll tell you that much.\n\n \n What a bunch of fruit cakes. Following the links on the left from the above quoted article, it appears that most of the articles seem to be about alien technologies that provide free energy and which our government is hiding from us as part of a massive alien conspiracy. \n \n Freejoe, if you want to be taken seriously you need more credible sources.",
