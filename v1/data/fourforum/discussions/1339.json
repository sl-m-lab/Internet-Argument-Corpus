It is a perversion of logic in that it uses circular logic as if it were a valid method. I.E. \"In order to believe in god you must first believe in god...\"\n \n \nI am very experienced. You generalize a lot and make that your argument.\n\n \n I could tell that you were trained because you kept using all of the old arguements and examples which actually don't prove anything. All of them boiled down to blind faith. Got that siphon ready?\n \n \nHowever, we are degenerating into a personal argument. I would suggest we set a thread in an open forum or cease all together. I do not want to dilute the remaining posters.\n\n \n You were the one who degraded it into such. All I did was ask you to actually prove your point without resorting to blind faith as you excuse and you got angry when I wouldn't accept your logical fallacy.\n \n Plus, you couldn't get what I had meant by morality being subjective to each culture as well. You mistakenly thought that I meant that everyone would do as they pleased. I even gave an example, but you still couldn't get it.\n \n Yes, each culture believes that it is wrong to kill, steal, or harm, but only towards their own kind. All others are fair game. Even the Jews and their commandment against murder says that it isn't murder to kill heathens, or gentiles. In the old West Americans thought nothing of killing \"indians\" (The only good Indian was a dead one..), they even had a bounty on their scalps (The \"indians\" learned this practice from the white man).",
