   "Watch 60 minutes tonight!!!\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Did Bush Press For Iraq-9/11 Link?\n March 20, 2004\n \n \n In the aftermath of Sept. 11, President Bush ordered his then top anti-terrorism adviser to look for a link between Iraq and the attacks, despite being told there didn't seem to be one. \n \n The charge comes from the advisor, Richard Clarke, in an interview airing Sunday at 7 p.m. ET/PT on 60 Minutes. \n \n The administration maintains that it cannot find any evidence that the conversation about an Iraq-9/11 tie-in ever took place. \n \n Clarke also tells CBS News Correspondent Lesley Stahl that White House officials were tepid in their response when he urged them months before Sept. 11 to meet to discuss what he saw as a severe threat from al Qaeda. \n \n \"Frankly,\" he said, \"I find it outrageous that the President is running for re-election on the grounds that he's done such great things about terrorism. He ignored it. He ignored terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11. Maybe. We'll never know.\" \n \n Clarke went on to say, \"I think he's done a terrible job on the war against terrorism.\" \n \n The No. 2 man on the president's National Security Council, Stephen Hadley, vehemently disagrees. He says Mr. Bush has taken the fight to the terrorists, and is making the U.S. homeland safer. \n \n Clarke says that as early as the day after the attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was pushing for retaliatory strikes on Iraq, even though al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan. \n \n Clarke suggests the idea took him so aback, he initally thought Rumsfeld was joking. \n \n Clarke is due to testify next week before the special panel probing whether the attacks were preventable. \n \n His allegations are also made in a book being published Monday, \"Against All Enemies.\" \n \n Clarke helped shape U.S. policy on terrorism under President Reagan and the first President Bush. He was held over by President Clinton to be his terrorrism czar, then held over again by the current President Bush. \n \n In the 60 Minutes interview and the book, Clarke tells what happened behind the scenes at the White House before, during and after Sept. 11. \n \n When the terrorists stuck, it was thought the White House would be the next target, so it was evacuated. Clarke was one of only a handful of people who stayed behind. He ran the government's response to the attacks from the Situation Room in the West Wing. \n \n \"I kept thinking of the words from 'Apocalypse Now,' the whispered words of Marlon Brando, when he thought about Vietnam. 'The horror. The horror.' Because we knew what was going on in New York. We knew about the bodies flying out of the windows. People falling through the air. We knew that Osama bin Laden had succeeded in bringing horror to the streets of America,\" he tells Stahl. \n \n After the president returned to the White House on Sept. 11, he and his top advisers, including Clarke, began holding meetings about how to respond and retaliate. As Clarke writes in his book, he expected the administration to focus its military response on Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. He says he was surprised that the talk quickly turned to Iraq. \n \n \"Rumsfeld was saying that we needed to bomb Iraq,\" Clarke said to Stahl. \"And we all said ... no, no. Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan. We need to bomb Afghanistan. And Rumsfeld said there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan. And there are lots of good targets in Iraq. I said, 'Well, there are lots of good targets in lots of places, but Iraq had nothing to do with it. \n \n \"Initially, I thought when he said \"There aren't enough targets in-- in Afghanistan\" I thought he was joking. \n \n \"I think they wanted to believe that there was a connection but the CIA was sitting there, the FBI was sitting there, I was sitting there saying we've looked at this issue for years. For years we've looked and there's just no connection.\" \n \n Clarke says he and CIA Director George Tenet told that to Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Attorney General John Ashcroft. \n \n Clarke then tells Stahl of being pressured by Mr. Bush. \n \n \"The president dragged me into a room with a couple of other people, shut the door, and said, 'I want you to find whether Iraq did this.' Now he never said, 'Make it up.' But the entire conversation left me in absolutely no doubt that George Bush wanted me to come back with a report that said Iraq did this. \n \n \"I said, 'Mr. President. We've done this before. We have been looking at this. We looked at it with an open mind. There's no connection.' \n \n \"He came back at me and said, \"Iraq! Saddam! Find out if there's a connection.' And in a very intimidating way. I mean that we should come back with that answer. We wrote a report.\" \n \n Clarke continued, \"It was a serious look. We got together all the FBI experts, all the CIA experts. We wrote the report. We sent the report out to CIA and found FBI and said, 'Will you sign this report?' They all cleared the report. And we sent it up to the president and it got bounced by the National Security Advisor or Deputy. It got bounced and sent back saying, 'Wrong answer. ... Do it again.' \n \n \"I have no idea, to this day, if the President saw it, because after we did it again, it came to the same conclusion. And frankly, I don't think the people around the president show him memos like that. I don't think he sees memos that he doesn't-- wouldn't like the answer.\" \n \n Clarke was the president's chief adviser on terrorism, yet it wasn't until Sept. 11 that he ever got to brief Mr. Bush on the subject. Clarke says, prior to Sept. 11, the administration didn't take the threat seriously. \n \n \"We had a terrorist organization that was going after us! Al Qaeda. That should have been the first item on the agenda. And it was pushed back and back and back for months. \n \n \"There's a lot of blame to go around, and I probably deserve some blame too. But on January 24th, 2001, I wrote a memo to Condoleezza Rice asking for, urgently -- underlined urgently -- a Cabinet-level meeting to deal with the impending al Qaeda attack. And that urgent memo-- wasn't acted on. \n \n \"I blame the entire Bush leadership for continuing to work on Cold War issues when they back in power in 2001. It was as though they were preserved in amber from when they left office eight years earlier. They came back; they wanted to work on the same issues right away: Iraq, Star Wars. Not new issues, the new threats that had developed over the preceding eight years.\" \n \n Clarke finally got his meeting about al Qaeda in April, three months after his urgent request. But it wasn't with the president or cabinet. It was with the second-in-command in each relevant department. \n \n For the Pentagon, it was Paul Wolfowitz. \n \n Clarke relates, \"I began saying, 'We have to deal with bin Laden; we have to deal with al Qaeda.' Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, said, 'No, no, no. We don't have to deal with al Qaeda. Why are we talking about that little guy? We have to talk about Iraqi terrorism against the United States.' \n \n \"And I said, 'Paul, there hasn't been any Iraqi terrorism against the United States in eight years!' And I turned to the deputy director of the CIA and said, 'Isn't that right?' And he said, 'Yeah, that's right. There is no Iraqi terrorism against the United States.\" \n \n Clarke went on to add, \"There's absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al Qaeda, ever.\" \n \n When Stahl pointed out that some administration officials say it's still an open issue, Clarke responded, \"Well, they'll say that until hell freezes over.\" \n \n By June 2001, there still hadn't been a Cabinet-level meeting on terrorism, even though U.S. intelligence was picking up an unprecedented level of ominous chatter. \n \n The CIA director warned the White House, Clarke points out. \"George Tenet was saying to the White House, saying to the president - 'cause he briefed him every morning - a major al Qaeda attack is going to happen against the United States somewhere in the world in the weeks and months ahead. He said that in June, July, August. \n \n Clarke says the last time the CIA had picked up a similar level of chatter was in December, 1999, when Clarke was the terrorism czar in the Clinton White House. \n \n Clarke says Mr. Clinton ordered his Cabinet to go to battle stations-- meaning, they went on high alert, holding meetings nearly every day. \n \n That, Clarke says, helped thwart a major attack on Los Angeles International Airport, when an al Qaeda operative was stopped at the border with Canada, driving a car full of explosives. \n \n Clarke harshly criticizes President Bush for not going to battle stations when the CIA warned him of a comparable threat in the months before Sept. 11. \n \n \"He never thought it was important enough for him to hold a meeting on the subject, or for him to order his National Security Adviser to hold a Cabinet-level meeting on the subject.\" \n \n Finally, says Clarke, \"The cabinet meeting I asked for right after the inauguration took place-- one week prior to 9/11.\" \n \n In that meeting, Clarke proposed a plan to bomb al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan, and to kill bin Laden. \n \n Hadley staunchly defended the president to Stahl. \n \n \"The president heard those warnings. The president met daily with ... George Tenet and his staff. They kept him fully informed and at one point the president became somewhat impatient with us and said, 'I'm tired of swatting flies. Where's my new strategy to eliminate al Qaeda?'\" \n \n Hadley says that, contrary to Clarke's assertion, Mr. Bush didn't ignore the ominous intelligence chatter in the summer of 2001. \n \n \"All the chatter was of an attack, a potential al Qaeda attack overseas. But interestingly enough, the president got concerned about whether there was the possibility of an attack on the homeland. He asked the intelligence community: 'Look hard. See if we're missing something about a threat to the homeland.' \n \n \"And at that point various alerts went out from the Federal Aviation Administration to the FBI saying the intelligence suggests a threat overseas. We don't want to be caught unprepared. We don't want to rule out the possibility of a threat to the homeland. And therefore preparatory steps need to be made. So the president put us on battle stations.\" \n \n Hadley asserts Clarke is \"just wrong\" in saying the administration didn't go to battle stations. \n \n As for the alleged pressure from Mr. Bush to find an Iraq-9/11 link, Hadley says, \"We cannot find evidence that this conversation between Mr. Clarke and the president ever occurred.\" \n \n When told by Stahl that 60 Minutes has two sources who tell us independently of Clarke that the encounter happened, including \"an actual witness,\" Hadley responded, \"Look, I stand on what I said.\" \n \n Hadley maintained, \"Iraq, as the president has said, is at the center of the war on terror. We have narrowed the ground available to al Qaeda and to the terrorists. Their sanctuary in Afghanistan is gone; their sanctuary in Iraq is gone. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are now allies on the war on terror. So Iraq has contributed in that way in narrowing the sanctuaries available to terrorists.\" \n \n When Clarke worked for Mr. Clinton, he was known as the terrorism czar. When Mr. Bush came into office, though remaining at the White House, Clarke was stripped of his Cabinet-level rank. \n \n Stahl said to Clarke, \"They demoted you. Aren't you open to charges that this is all sour grapes, because they demoted you and reduced your leverage, your power in the White House?\" \n \n Clarke's answer: \"Frankly, if I had been so upset that the National Coordinator for Counter-terrorism had been downgraded from a Cabinet level position to a staff level position, if that had bothered me enough, I would have quit. I didn't quit.\" \n \n Until two years later, after 30 years in government service. \n \n A senior White House official told 60 Minutes he thinks the Clarke book is an audition for a job in the Kerry campaign.\n \n \n \u00a9 MMIII, CBS Worldwide Inc.

   "\"Declaration of the World Islamic Front.\" On 22 February 1998, an edict over Bin Laden's signature was published in the Arabic-language paper Al-Quds al-Arabi; it was entitled the \"Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders.\" It was a more significant document than the \"Ladenese Epistle.\" It articulated more fully why Bin Laden views the United States as an enemy and how he proposed to deal with that enemy.\n \n In the 1998 epistle he offered three major reasons why America is to be considered an enemy of the Islamic peoples: \n \n First-For more than seven years the United States [has been] occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of its territories, Arabia, plundering its riches, overwhelming its rulers, humiliating its people, threatening its neighbors, and using its bases in the peninsula as a spearhead to fight against the neighboring Islamic peoples. . . . \n \n Second-Despite the immense destruction inflicted on the Iraqi people at the hands of the Crusader-Jewish alliance and in spite of the appalling number of dead, exceeding a million, the Americans nevertheless, in spite of all this, are trying once more to repeat this dreadful slaughter. . . . They come again today to destroy what remains of this people and to humiliate their Muslim neighbors. \n \n Third-While the purposes of the Americans in these wars are religious and economic, they also serve the petty state of the Jews, to direct attention from their occupation of Jerusalem and the killing of Muslims in it. \n \n There is no better proof of all this than their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the strongest of the neighboring Arab states, and their attempt to dismember all the states of the region, such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Sudan, into petty states, whose division and weakness would ensure the survival of Israel and the continuation of the calamitous Crusader occupation of the lands of Arabia. \n \n \n link \n \n what would your thoughts be on 912 when you are reminded of this?\n september of 1998 there was no talk of war with iraq. all the US was doing is maintaining a UN sanction against iraq, with a no fly zone while the UN inspection was thrown out in 98, and saddam was bribing and exploiting the UN's oil for food program.\n so we should dismiss any link? that it would be beyond the realm of possibility that there is collusion between saddam and the latest and most vocal defender of iraq?\n \n interesting the bin laden makes a link with iraq for his reason to attack on 911 and we still work to deny a link.",

Agreed, except that I still find it a bit strange to prove that there is nothing. Normal trials have to prove the guilt, not the innocence.\n 2. Saddam survived for more than 20 years and during that time he never was really liked among his neighbours. Still he kept his power after losing 2 wars. He was clever and sneaky and imo not short sighted.\n 3. Yes, he did \"find religion\". It was a desperate attempt to gain a bit of respect and support from the Arabic nations. But it didn't work. And I also think that Al Quaida (their supporters, respectively) would have had inner problems to work together with a heretic to support a country with a majority of shiits and a government of sunnits.\n \n But what I admit is that Saddam might indeed had the idea to sell WMD to any terrorist group; but only when he was finished anyway and had nothing to lose.

   "1. Clarke is a registered Republican, said he would not serve in any Kerry administration, and worked first under Regan. He worked for both Bush's and Clinton, and was kept in all four administrations for a reason. About 20 years of service and expertise would seem to allow him his chance to say what he sees.\n \n 2. In chronological order:\n \n -On 26 February 1993, a car loaded with 1,200 pounds of explosives blew up in a parking garage under the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring about a thousand others. The blast did not, as its planners intended, bring down the towers - that was finally accomplished by flying two hijacked airliners into the twin towers on the morning of 11 September 2001.\n \n Four followers of the Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman were captured, convicted of the World Trade Center bombing in March 1994, and sentenced to 240 years in prison each. The purported mastermind of the plot, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, was captured in 1995, convicted of the bombing in November 1997, and also sentenced to 240 years in prison. One additional suspect fled the U.S. and is believed to be living in Baghdad.\n \n -On 13 November 1995, a bomb was set off in a van parked in front of an American-run military training center in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, killing five Americans and two Indians. \n \n Saudi Arabian authorities arrested four Saudi nationals whom they claim confessed to the bombings, but U.S. officials were denied permission to see or question the suspects before they were convicted and beheaded in May 1996.\n \n -On 25 June 1996, a booby-trapped truck loaded with 5,000 pounds of explosives was exploded outside the Khobar Towers apartment complex which housed United States military personnel in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing nineteen Americans and wounding about three hundred others. \n \n Once again, the U.S. investigation was hampered by the refusal of Saudi officials to allow the FBI to question suspects. (Keeping in mind Bush has done no better in working with the Saudis).\n \n -On 21 June 2001, just before the American statute of limitations would have expired, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted thirteen Saudis and an unidentified Lebanese chemist for the Khobar Towers bombing. \n \n The suspects remain in Saudi custody, beyond the reach of the American justice system. (Saudi Arabia has no extradition treaty with the U.S.)\n \n -On 7 August 1998, powerful car bombs exploded minutes apart outside the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people and wounding about 5,000 others. \n \n Four participants with ties to Osama bin Laden were captured, convicted in U.S. federal court, and sentenced to life in prison without parole in October 2001. Fourteen other suspects indicted in the case remain at large, and three more are fighting extradition in London.\n \n -On 12 October 2000, two suicide bombers detonated an explosives-laden skiff next to the USS Cole while it was refueling in Aden, Yemen, blasting a hole in the ship that killed 17 sailors and injured 37 others. \n \n No suspects have yet been arrested or indicted. The investigation has been hampered by the refusal of Yemini officials to allow FBI agents access to Yemeni nationals and other suspects in custody in Yemen.\n \n (The USS Cole bombing occurred one month before the 2000 presidential election, so even under the best of circumstances it was unlikely that the investigation could have been completed before the end of President Clinton's term of office three months later.)\n \n -In August 1998, President Clinton ordered missile strikes against targets in Afghanistan in an effort to hit Osama bin Laden, who had been linked to the embassy bombings in Africa (and was later connected to the attack on the USS Cole). The missiles reportedly missed bin Laden by a few hours, and Clinton was widely criticized by many who claimed he had ordered the strikes primarily to draw attention away from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. As John F. Harris wrote in The Washington Post:\n \n In August 1998, when [Clinton] ordered missile strikes in an effort to kill Osama bin Laden, there was widespread speculation - from such people as Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) - that he was acting precipitously to draw attention away from the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal, then at full boil. Some said he was mistaken for personalizing the terrorism struggle so much around bin Laden. And when he ordered the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House after domestic terrorism in Oklahoma City, some Republicans accused him of hysteria.\n \n . . . the federal budget on anti-terror activities tripled during Clinton's watch, to about $6.7 billion. After the effort to kill bin Laden with missiles in August 1998 failed - he had apparently left a training camp in Afghanistan a few hours earlier - recent news reports have detailed numerous other instances, as late as December 2000, when Clinton was on the verge of unleashing the military again. In each case, the White House chose not to act because of uncertainty that intelligence was good enough to find bin Laden, and concern that a failed attack would only enhance his stature in the Arab world.\n \n . . . people maintain Clinton should have adapted Bush's policy promising that regimes that harbor terrorism will be treated as severely as terrorists themselves, and threatening to evict the Taliban from power in Afghanistan unless leaders meet his demands to produce bin Laden and associates. But Clinton aides said such a policy - potentially involving a full-scale war in central Asia - was not plausible before politics the world over became transformed by one of history's most lethal acts of terrorism, 9/11.\n \n Clinton's former national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger . . . said there [was] little prospect . . . that Pakistan would have helped the United States wage war against bin Laden or the Taliban in 1998, even after such outrages as the bombing of U.S. embassies overseas.\n \n \n source: http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.htm\n \n \n Clinton bombed Iraq. He bombed Afghanistan. He focused on bin Laden.\n Note: Even French troops are in Afghanistan and were with Bush there. It's Iraq that is the contentious issue. And it would seem rightfully so.\n \n Saudi Arabia keeps popping up as a refuge, a source of funding and man-power, the birth place of bin Laden himself. Yet seemingly nothing is done by any American persident as of yet.\n \n Clarke's coming out would seem to indicate that indeed the administration had it in for going to war. We shall see about the veracity later on, but we have little reason to doubt it at this point.",

But you need proof to start a war. \n But maybe I didn't understand the meaning of your sentence. If so, could you please clarify?\n \n 2. Well, this could be regarded short sighted. But when you get encouraged to fullfill your dream of a \"new Babylon\", you start a war; especially when you can rely on Western intel and equipment.\n But the war against Kuwait was based on a stupid assumption by Saddam, you're right.\n \n 3. The respect that bin Laden and his fellows showed to Saddam wasn't very high in former times. And the bunch of Saddam's tribesmen are more a group of thugs than religious men imo.\n \n 4. No, I think he saw the effect that religious motifs could have on followers and misled people. But fundamentalists saw that he would never really work together with them.\n So nothing happened until the war was over.\n And then they had the war-playground in the ME they were waiting for.",

If you believe this guy wasn't taking marching orders from somebody higher up, your on wacky weed! What is interesting is that they blame not finding WMD on faulty intelligence, why was the intelligence better for Al Queada being the ones who were responsiable for 911. I mean within 48 to 72 hours they had names, pictures, cars with korans in them, wills, and how to fly books. Why couldn't that intelligence be as faulty and we invaded two countries for no reason, other than Capsian sea oil. Bush came into office with the agenda to Invade Afakanastan and Iraq. His cabinet is salted with ex high ranking oil people, coincident, I think not, also Richard Pearl and Wolfowitz, both Jewish chicken hawks. 911 was the chance to move, real or constructed! Its all about continuing to keep this country a fossil fuel economy, better known as National Interest. And they will do what ever it takes, the sad part is the reputation of the US is going down the tubes. The Oil people will keep sucking oil from the earth until it looks like a deflated balloon, you need to look at the US Energy Strategy, you'll notice it doesn't say republican or Democrate Energy Strategy!
