   "I was reading an article on stem cell research today and didn't realize the full benefits this research could provide. \n \n I don't understand what the hold up is on being able to use stem cells for research and rehabilitation? I know that it requires the stem cells taken from a fetus and that by doing this, destroys the fetus, but given that abortions are legal, why can't they just take the material from \"donors\" who are having abortions anyway? I would think that at least that life would not have been a total loss.",

As long as Bush is president and the bible run's the united states and not the constitution, stem cell research will not pass. It is unfortunate but hopefully America will vote in a less stubborn redneck in 2008. There are things you can do to try to help as far as rally and sign any petitions that come your way. :)",
