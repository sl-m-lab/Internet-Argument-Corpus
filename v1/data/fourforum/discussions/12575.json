   "Here is a rather long list of excerpts from Roesgen08. I for one cannot stand his below the belt tactics, his malicious insults, and his slander upon others. Enjoy your dose of hate:\n \n \n \nI oppose it because it is disgusting. Two men having a sexual relationship with each other is disgraceful, unmanly and perverted. I view it the same way you might view a man and a goat ####ing each other up the XXX and then calling that marriage.\n \n It is worth my time and energy to fight this immorality and immorality backed by government because morality means something to me, and I don't like to see morality destroyed.\n \n Gay marriage is ruining lives because it teaches young impressionable minds that it is ok to engage in disgusting degenerate acts.\n \n influencing young people from the moment they are born that being gay is alright allows them to think that something which is degenerate is acceptable. It thus increases the chance of an unknowledgeable person making a grave mistake. That is ruining a life.\n \n As for your accusation that this is a personal issue for me, rather than a broader general reason, that seems pretty hypocritical coming from a guy who spends his every waking moment of his life to legalize gay marriage.\n \n \n You seek to destroy democracy in order to force your personal opinion on the country.\n \n I would sooner ship you off in a crate to a country where there is no democracy, perhaps North Korea or Cuba would suit you. If you can somehow hijack the state as you are attempting here, you can then tell people what is right and what is wrong and then use the state and propaganda to enforce your will.\n \n You can teach people that it's ok to stick a paper towel roll up their butt with a hamster inside and they'll do that. People are malleable, especially young people.\n \n A child who has been taught that being gay is fun and becomes gay has had his life ruined.\n \n The only bigot here is you. You are bigoted against religious people. I do not have any pastor because I am agnostic. I don't belong to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism or any of those religions. So when you start talking about my \"bigoted pastor\" you merely show that you are a bigot against religious people and a filthy pervert.\n \n It is people like you who take away the decency of America's youth and corrupt them, just so that you might force people to accept you. You would tear us all down, just to bring you up a little. You use the dead to demagogue for your political agenda. You are selfish, disgusting and you have no honor.\n \n It's because of you that there will be more children who grow up to be gay, when they might otherwise not have been. You will take away the pride and joy of many parents and destroy that, just for your convenience. You will corrupt and destroy what could have been a very fulfilling and decent life for those kids.\n \n You need a life. I have been on this forum for one day and I can see that all you do is post on this forum trying to legalize gay marriage. You prefer drama and this is all your life is about. Sad.\n \n Of course you won't accept, because your whole argument is a lie. Your whole argument is to play the victim, while using the government (without a popular vote) to use force and propaganda to change people's beliefs.\n \n Your attempt to hijack the civil rights movement is also a well-practiced sham by the gay activist movement.\n \n You are not capable of having a debate. Now I'm in favor of \"beating a dead gay teenager.\" Wow. You really know how to exploit that kid's death. You are a real disgrace.\n \n he only thing I blot out of my mind is your drama and your personal filth.\n \n Well you did tip your hand. As much as you call most Americans \"bigots\", the actual bigot is you. You hate religious people. It's almost like you are the equal of the Westboro Baptist Church. They hate gays with all their hearts, and you hate religious people with all yours. Interesting. \n \n In any case, you are no \"minority.\" Blacks are minorities. Latinos are minorities. Asians and Arabs are minorities. You are as much of a minority and entitled to special rights as are porn stars. Having different sexual preferences doesn't make you a minority.\n ________________________________________\n Last edited by admin; Today at 08:05 AM. Reason: language \n \n \n @ jason\n \n You and your pro-gay marriage friends show a vileness in pursuing your political agenda that's only mirrored by the lifestyle that you try to push on others. You have no rational arguments; only demagoguery, lies, insults and appalling and disgusting tactics of doing whatever it takes to smear people who disagree with you (including exploiting dead children). \n \n Regardless of what happens with regards to gay marriage; you've only shown that you have no respect for our country's democracy or people's freedom of belief and that you have no valid arguments to support your agenda; only hate and propaganda.\n \n You're nuts. Your lunatic rants have shown that. The easiest indicator of how dishonest and ruthless you are in your pursuit of gay marriage is your exploitation of that gay kid who killed himself.\n \n Yeah, more like a Dishonorable discharge, probably for cowardice in the face of the enemy. \n \n Three words: \"basic human rights\" does not a valid argument make, outcast. You prove my point. \n \n lol Wow, an attack on my avatar. Again proving my point that you have only these lame attacks, your drama and desperate lies to argue for gay marriage.\n \n So go ahead and make your cute gay jokes. You have no intellect, and in real life you're the one who gets his @ss kicked for the lifestyle you lead. Your 3 or 4 friends on this forum, who are as deranged as you, ain't gonna change that. Have a real good day. \n \n Resident homophobes indeed, labeled as such by resident degenerates.\n \n Seems that you really don't give a rat's XXX about this poor dead kid at all. You just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner. How noble of you.\n \n Well, I understand the rationality of why you want to hijack our democracy and use the government to teach people to become more open to accepting and being gay. I see why you do what you do. It's still wrong though.\n \n You are worse than disgusting filth. You exploit the death of this kid for your political purposes. Your lack of decency in your personal life has its parallel in your political agenda.\n \n I'm not insane, you're a dishonest filthy degenerate. Gay marriage activists like yourself have hijacked democracy by passing laws without popular vote, and by getting judges to legislate from the bench, and getting politicians to impose their will on their state from the state capital and not a popular referendum. \n \n You say that I questioned your service? Show me where I questioned your service. You can't, because your too busy putting on a show that you don't care what's being said. You're just doing an act. This is just a big play for you. I could copy and paste numbers out of a telephone book and your replies would be no different.\n \n Oh boy, there we go with the insults again. Your truth is bullsh!t. It's all drama. The bottom line is that I favor a popular referendum to decide gay marriage and you don't. You want to force society to accept you and indoctrinate kids, since you have this mental instability about being gay.\n \n ou fill your posts with your stories of how you were beaten for being gay while in the military, ridiculed as a child for it, and you nearly killed yourself. You then make wild attacks on people if they disagree with you about gay marriage. If you want to maintain that you're sane after that, be my guest.\n\n \n \n I ask that the admin review these posts in accordance with the forum guidelines and have this user banned from these boards for good. You are open to review my posts in turn and I realize I replied in hostility and utter disgust and shock. If you wish to also ban me so be it. I'd rather have these forums be a safe place for all. Not a shooting gallery for hatemongers and bigots.",

There has been no proof of unit in cohesion or that gays and lesbians perform worse or make unit morale suffer.\"\n \n I repeat your criticism of Jason's remarks and your apology for insulting Easyrider:\n \n \n \n Oh right, you never did that. I forgot that you don't actually follow your own standards.\n \n \n\n And like I said, after you leveled insults at Jason, I am not going to indict him for returning fire.\n\n \n Again, so because Jason supports gay marriage you automatically assume that I leveled insults first at Jason, and you also give his insults a free pass. You also support gay marriage, while I oppose it. You are not biased on this issue. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Who was it that posted this baiting attack thread against a fellow poster and has attempted to make him the subject of the debate rather than the issue of homosexuality itself? It was Jason, someone who will also claim that he endorses human rights equality and free speech. But what this thread proves is that Jason only supports free speech for those who agree with his preferred lifestyle. All others better learn to shut up or else they will be lambasted and attacked as haters and bigots.\n \n Roesgen is correct in his opposition to what you believe and promote and I respect his courage in daring to stand against it. Just so he knows, I have been through the same fire with these same posters in the past which is why I have been offering support from a distance but haven't gotten into the thick of the debate with him. Beside, he is doing fine which is evidenced by the rage being voiced against him. \n \n To Jason I would say, grow a pair and learn that you can't silence the opposition just because you can't effectively dispute their arguments. There are two sides to this issue and both sides deserve a hearing. \n \n I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly invite roesgen08 to become one of my friends here, just go to this link: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel and if you want to join my group of friends, just click on the \"befriend Archangel\" link since the invitation has already been made and the process will be completed. We don't all agree on every issue, but we try to support each other against the unified opposition here and we debate each other respectully and without personal malice.\n\n \n \n Archie I posted this thread to show the Admins and others of this forums the direct insults and injuries Roes said towards me. I in turn insulted back. I am not denying that. But calling me a child molester and a failure to the Armed Forces is not just a simple insult, it is a degradation. \n \n Also, I have a pair Archie thanks, plenty big enough too. Also, Maybe the reason I cannot communicate my side of a debate to you and those of the roes clan, is because maybe you don't have the open mind, or the willingness to listen.\n \n Also, way to go on boosting your friends list on this thread Archie, your really looking up in the world......",
