   "Seeing as I read on towleroad how the FRC is already trying to repeal the repeal of DADT I took it upon myself to wish Mr. Perkins a Merry Christmas... enjoy...\n \n Dear Mr. Perkins. My name is (removed) and I am a 22 year old veteran of the US Navy and a Distinguished Plankowner. I am growing more and more concerned at why and how your organization dares to dictate what is proper and positive for our American Military especially in a time of war. \n \n I myself am an openly gay Christian who was discharged under the DADT policy based solely upon rumor. Not only was I discharged, I was physically beaten by four other members of my own crew for these supposed \"rumors\" of my sexual orientation.\n \n I find it alarming and sickening that your organization dares to claim to take the mantle of Christ and slander His words in the name of self righteous indignation at the expense and suffering of others and the potential risk to our Nations Military.\n \n It has been well documented that Gays have served, fought and died for this Nation since Valley Forge and have done so in silence for over two centuries.\n \n Whatever your ideals may be upon my life which is NOT a style since i do not define my life based upon whom I love, it in no way should dictate nor implore you to in ANY way interfere with the policies that are being enacted to allow gays to serve openly without reproach and without shame, guilt, or fear.\n \n I am third generation military. My grandfather served in World War 2 and my father served during the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. My own childhood idol was George Patton. \n \n You clearly have no idea the pain, the suffering, and the wounds your are spreading to people by spreading misinformation and half baked truths about gays based upon stigma and lies. \n \n I have no interest in destroying families but promoting families. I have no interest in promiscuous sex since I am monogamous and have only one partner.\n \n I have no desire to destroy anyone's ability to worship seeing as I myself believe spirituality to have a great impact on a persons well being. \n \n These half truths you spread only serve as ammo used to spread hurt toward gay youth as we continue to see alarming rates of increase in youth suicide, homelessness and depression. \n \n These teens are teased until they cannot bear it no longer and take the dark road leading to self inflicted death. \n \n Does your organization attempt to love these young people? Does your organization DARE to speak out for them? Certainly not.\n \n I watched a presentation of your organization sent to Calvary Chapel Corona during the prop 8 election only to be horrified at the lies and propaganda you feed ignorant people enacting only upon their good will and faith in the way they know best.\n \n I write this to let you know that I nor any other self affirming true Christian will dare allow you to slander others anymore in the name of Christ. i will not allow you to continue to enforce depression and despair in our youth and I will never allow you to defile nor dehumanize another gay soldier who dares to put their life on the line to defend the very freedoms you use to oppress him.\n \n I pray your organization one day wakes up and realizes your mistakes and hurts upon others and asks forgiveness for the hurt you have caused to hundreds upon hundreds of people who want nothing more than to love. To serve. And be what our Founding Fathers stated : Equal.",

That's not very nice this holiday season. \n \n I guess your biggest oxymoron would be \"compassionate zealot.\"\n \n \n Repentance isn't in their vocabulary. \n\n \n Neither is acceptance nor non judgmental in yours.

The reason for the season certainly isn't you although you never fail to prop yourself up so everyone can see your not a homosexual, or a \"heathen\".

   "The Bible says ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. \n So you base your entire perception of the world around you on ancient texts that were written by utter delusional men? Just like Islam Easy. The only difference is in the way both religions bound spellbound believers to their pages.\n \n In and of itself in the old testament the Bible even commands you to sin! It commands you to kill others, to enslave them, to wipe out children and all in the name of a ferocious god. \n \n Even Christs demands for a heaven were contradictory in and of itself. You attempt to bind everyone by the same mindset of fear that keeps you spellbound, yet fail to see our reasoning why we disagree with you!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n It also says everyone needs to repent. \n\n \n The Bible also says you need to sell everything you own, love those, then hate those, and many other contradictions even a laymen could grasp. The evidence is right there Easy. Yet like I used to be, your bound by the brainwashing that holds many in fear and in shackles like my mind once was.\n \n \n \n Mother Theresa wasn't sinless, so she too needed a Savior and needed to repent of her sins.\n\n \n Mother Theresa was a woman Easy. Who helped others but perhaps her methods were primitive as well. The only person you need fear is the man in the mirror. Everyday you must face that and your inner beast.\n \n The question is though can you work past it? Your posts on this forum clearly indicate you are bound by the impressionable beast and not the mind for which makes us human.",
