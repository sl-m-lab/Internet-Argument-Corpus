   "And since we're pointing out Obama's questionable character, Here's more about his long standing relationship with Louis Farrakhan from Dr. Vibert White Jr., who spent most of his adult life as a member and ultimately top officer of the Nation of Islam. Here's an excerpt.\n Obama-Farrakhan Ties Are Close, Ex-Farrakhan Aide Says\n \n Saturday, November 1, 2008 2:59 PM\n \n By: Kenneth R. Timmerman Article Font Size \n \n A former top deputy to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan tells Newsmax that Barack Obama\u00eds ties to the black nationalist movement in Chicago run deep, and that for many years the two men have had \u00ecan open line between them\u00ee to discuss policy and strategy, either directly or through intermediaries.\n \n \u00ecRemember that for years, if you were a politician in Chicago, you had to have some type of relationship with Louis Farrakhan. You had to. If you didn\u00edt, you would be ostracized out of black Chicago,\u00ee said Dr. Vibert White Jr., who spent most of his adult life as a member and ultimately top officer of the Nation of Islam.\n \n White broke with the group in 1995 and is now a professor of African-American history at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.\n \n White said Obama was \u00ecpart of the Chicago scene\u00ee where Farrakhan, Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. and radicals would go to each other\u00eds events and support each other\u00eds causes.\n \n \u00ecEven though Chicago is the third-largest city in the country, within the black community, the political and militant nationalist community is very small. So it wouldn\u00edt be uncommon for [Obama and Farrakhan] to show up at events together, or at least be there and communicate with each other,\u00ee White told Newsmax.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League has denounced Farrakhan and his Nation of Islam as a \u00echate group.\u00ee\n \n Farrakhan has called Jews \u00ecbloodsuckers,\u00ee \u00ecsatanic\u00ee and accused them of running the slave trade. He has labeled gays as \u00ecdegenerates.\u00ee In a 2006 speech, the ADL again condemned Farrakhan when he said: \u00ecThese false Jews promote the filth of Hollywood that is seeding the American people and the people of the world and bringing you down in moral strength. \u00d6 It's the wicked Jews the false Jews that are promoting lesbianism, homosexuality. It's wicked Jews, false Jews that make it a crime for you to preach the word of God, then they call you homophobic!\"\n \n Obama was careful to \u00ecdenounce\u00ee Farrakhan\u00eds comments \u00f1 but not the man -- during the Democratic primary season earlier this year, but only after Hillary Clinton called him out for benefiting from Farrakhan\u00eds support.\n \n Farrakhan endorsed Obama in a videotaped speech to his followers at Mosque Miryam in Chicago in February. \u00ecYou are the instruments that God is gonna use to bring about universal change, and that is why Barack has captured the youth,\u00ee Farrakhan said.\n \n He told the crowd that Obama was the new \u00ecmessiah.\u00ee See Video: Farrakhan Endorses Obama, Calls Him Messiah.\n \n Once the news media and the Clinton campaign got hold of those comments from Farrakhan, demands mounted from all sides that Obama \u00ecrenounce\u00ee Farrakhan.\n \n But as he has done repeatedly throughout this campaign, Obama was careful to parse his words.\n \n \u00ecYou know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments,\u00ee he said during one appearance on \u00ecMeet the Press.\u00ee \u00ecI think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible.\u00ee\n \n Obama hastened to point out that Farrakhan had been praising him as \u00ecan African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can't censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we\u00edre not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.\u00ee\n \n But Obama, once again, was less than candid.\n \n In 1995, according to a profile of Obama that appeared in the Chicago Reader newspaper, Obama \u00ectook time off from attending campaign coffees to attend October\u00eds Million Man March in Washington, D.C.\u00ee\n \n At the time, Obama was running for the Illinois Senate from Chicago\u00eds South Side, a seat he won after getting surrogates to challenge the signatures on nominating petitions for his chief rival, the incumbent Alice Palmer.\n \n The march, which fell far short of attracting the million men it advertised, was organized by Farrakhan and by Obama\u00eds then-pastor, the anti-white black nationalist Wright.\n \n Obama spoke at length with the Chicago Reader upon his return from the Million Man March. \u00ecWhat I saw was a powerful demonstration of an impulse and need for African-American men to come together to recognize each other and affirm our rightful place in the society,\" he said.\n \n \u00ecThese are mean, cruel times, exemplified by a \u00eblock \u00edem up, take no prisoners\u00ed mentality that dominates the Republican-led Congress,\u00ee Obama said.\n \n \u00ecHistorically, African-Americans have turned inward and towards black nationalism whenever they have a sense, as we do now, that the mainstream has rebuffed us, and that white Americans couldn't care less about the profound problems African-Americans are facing.\"\n \n \u00ecBlack nationalism\u00ee is a current of thought and political action in the African-American community that has been championed by the likes of Farrakhan, Wright, Malcolm X, the Black Panthers and Khalid al-Mansour. Obama discussed his attraction to black nationalism at length in his 1995 memoir \u00ecDreams of My Father.\u00ee\n \n Obama further parsed his words in a Feb. 25, 2008, presentation to a Jewish community meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, where he insisted that Wright \u00ecdoes not have a close relationship with Louis Farrakhan.\u00ee\n \n And yet, just months earlier, Wright\u00eds Trumpet magazine gave Farrakhan its Lifetime Achievement Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. Trumpeter Award, saying that Farrakhan \u00ectruly epitomized greatness.\u00ee\n \n That award was the fruit of a long and deep relationship between the two men, White told Newsmax. In 1984, Wright accompanied Farrakhan on his much-criticized trip to meet Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, at a time when Gadhafi was considered an enemy of the United States.\n \n Wright also accompanied Farrakhan and Jackson to Syria in 1986, where they successfully negotiated with Syrian strongman for the release of downed American pilot Robert O. Goodman.http://news.newsmax.com/?KK4RYqpuV9g-jaScXTGoYBA1nxbkxJU1K&http://www.newsmax.com/timmerman/farrakhan_obama_islam/2008/11/01/146685.html?s=al&promo_code=6F79-1",

   "On the subject of the missile shield in Europe, I had a chance to travel to Poland this September to visit relatives - one of which is an uncle that I recently met that used to be an officer in the Polish army commanding 400 people in an anti-missile brigade. He has been retired for ten years now, but still had contacts in the anti-missile side of the Polish army. He also has read that this missile shield has a low probability of success - ~30% is what he quoted. Also, my understanding is that, despite the approval of the Polish government, most Poles are against the instalation of the missile system in their country - partly because it will financially cost them too much, and partly because of the potential risks in angering Russia (on whom they depend for oil, and who still could potentially pose a military risk if pushed too far). Nevertheless, despite the fact that the missile shield was approved by the Polish government, there is a critical component that is in the Czech Republic - i.e. the radar system - where it appears fairly certain that the Czech government will reject having the radar system in their country. This is something that most Poles are counting on to stop installation of the missile shield in Poland. So, even if Obama takes no action, the missile shield may not happen because of oposition in the countries where it would be installed. His best move might then be to take no action and let it die on its own.",

   "The warnings about 9/11 that Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld ignored:\n \nHowever, the reality is much different from what Bush and Cheney would have you believe. The fact of the matter is that the Bush administration ignored hard evidence from its top intelligence officials between April and September of 2001 about an impending attack by al-Qaeda on US soil. There's no chance that the National Security Agency's domestic wiretapping initiative would have saved the lives of 3,000 American citizens if an intelligence memo titled \"Bin Laden determined to attack inside US\" that President Bush received a month before 9/11 couldn't move Bush to take such threats seriously.\n \n .... Simply put, terrorism was not a priority for the Bush administration during the first nine months of 2001. As former Bush administration counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke told the 9/11 Commission investigating the attacks in 2004: \"To the loved ones of the victims of 9/11, to them who are here in the room, to those who are watching on television, your government failed you.\"\n \n Clarke served as a White House counter-terrorism official in three presidential administrations.\n \n The truth is that the administration received warnings about al-Qaeda's intentions to use jetliners as bombs in August 2001, but it was too busy obsessing about a war with Iraq to take action. Although President Bush has maintained over the years that terrorism was his number one priority before 9/11, evidence suggests otherwise.\n \n A little known article in the January 11, 2001, edition of the New York Times titled \"Iraq Is Focal Point as Bush Meets with Joint Chiefs\" confirms that the administration was more interested in toppling Saddam Hussein than dealing with the growing threat of domestic terrorism.\n\n http://www.truthout.org/article/jason-leopold-bush-ignored-911-warnings\n \n Which explains exactly why Bush/Cheney/'Rumsfeld failed to finish cleaning up in Afghanistan and let Osama bin Laden get away.\n \n I have never forgiven Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld for dropping the ball in Afghanistan and embroiling us in a costly and worthless invasion and never-ending occupation of Iraq.\n \n These men are traitors to my nation for their inattention and misdirection.",

   "The generals speak out:\n \nGenerals versus Rumsfeld\n By Andrew J. Bacevich\n April 15, 2006 in print edition B-15\n THE ENDGAME of America's misbegotten crusade in Iraq may be nowhere in sight, but the search for scapegoats has begun in earnest. Who shall bear primary responsibility for this shipwreck, the civilian officials who conceived the war or the generals charged with waging it? After three years during which no one paid much attention to matters of accountability, those questions are now assuming a sudden urgency.\n \n In recent days, one retired general after another has declared his views, hurling accusations of recklessness, bad judgment and bad faith at the Pentagon's senior civilian leadership. Gens. Anthony Zinni, Greg Newbold, John Riggs, John Batiste, Paul Eaton and Charles Swannack - the latter three of whom are Iraq war veterans - have singled out Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for particular abuse and are demanding that he be sacked.\n \n ....Especially telling, in their eyes, was Rumsfeld's treatment of Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army's chief of staff, who before the Iraq invasion warned that the occupation was likely to pose large challenges. Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz immediately retaliated. For speaking unwelcome truths, Shinseki found himself pilloried, humiliated and marginalized. In the eyes of his fellow generals, Shinseki became a martyr.\n\n Generals versus Rumsfeld - Los Angeles Times\n \n Let's see, hmmm, Rumsfeld's military service:\n \nRumsfeld served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957 as a naval aviator and flight instructor. His initial training was in the North American SNJ Texan basic trainer after which he transitioned to flying the Grumman F9F Panther fighter. In 1957, he transferred to the Naval Reserve and continued his naval service in flying and administrative assignments as a drilling reservist until 1975. He transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve when he became Secretary of Defense in 1975 and retired with the rank of Captain in 1989.\n\n Donald Rumsfeld - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Naval pilot. No combat experience. No on the ground combat experience.\n \n I kind of favor military personnel who have actual nitty-gritty on the ground combat experience, especially if I wanted advice on how to run a war.\n \n I'm kind of funny that way. What pilots see and do has little to do with the planning and execution of a war. All they have to do is have good eyesight and the flying skills to frollow orders and hit a target. They have no idea which targets to hit, what the overall plan of the war is because they can't see and understand that kind of stuff from their vantage points.\n \n You dig how you conduct a war? You understand how you plan a war, how you bring about execution of such plans, how you also plan to change courses rapidly if facts from the ground indicate htat rapid change is necessary?\n \n Do you understand how war is done?\n \n Not by pointy-headed heads-in-the air NeoCon intellectuals who do everyting by stupid theory and then they don't understand why their stupid theories don't work.",
