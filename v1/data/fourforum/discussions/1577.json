Josephus (aka Joseph ben Matthias) The Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 3: the so called Testimonium Flavianum\n \n This passage is clearly a forgery, probably inserted by Eusebius.

Of particular significance, in view of the subsequent appearance of the book of Genesis, were Babylonian stories of a Great Flood (complete with a hero, an ark and animals); an Assyrian tale of a ?tower of Babel?; the early life of King Sargon of Sumaria (who as an infant was floated down the Tigris in a reed boat and subsequently brought up by a princess); and a tale of the giving of the law to King Hammurabi of Babylon by the sun god Shamash ? 3,654 lines of text inscribed on an eight-foot high block of black diorite.\n \n Wonder of wonders, on this ancient tablet of stone, carved six hundred years before ?Moses?, are ?some fifty articles of the so-called Mosaic laws, the identity of which is practically verbatim.? \n(Bratton, p37)\n \n \nThis is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the Land of Israel: the Israelites were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel.

WHY CAN'T IT BE THAT SOMEONE BORROWED FROM THEM, OR THAT TWO CULTURES WROTE ABOUT A SIMILAR THING? MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT OF A FLOOD \n OR TOWER OF BABEL ACTUALLY POINTS TO IT AS BEING TRUE. THE THEME OF JOB \"WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE?\" IS A COMMON THEME IN ALL CULTURES, BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT ALL SUCH ACCOUNTS BE MERE STORIES AND MADE UP? LIKEWISE, WHY DO SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF LAW MEAN THAT THE OT IS FALSE? WHAT CULTURE DOESN'T HAVE CERTAIN LAWS SIMILAR TO THE LAW OF MOSES? THEY ALL DO. SO WHAT?\n \n \nThis is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the Land of Israel: the Israelites were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel. Perhaps even harder to swallow is that the united monarchy of David and Solomon, which is described by the Bible as a regional power, was at most a small tribal kingdom.\n (Ha'aretz Magazine, October 1999)\n\n \n A VERY OLD PAPYRUS WRITTEN BY AN EGYPTIAN PRIEST TELLS OF A SERIES OF PLAGUES: RIVER TURNING TO BLOOD, CROPS CONSUMED, DARKNESS, AND THE FINAL PLAGUE: \"FORSOOTH, THE CHILDREN OF PRINCES ARE DASHED AGAINST THE WALLS. . . . THE PRISON IS RUINED. . . . HE WHO PLACES HIS BROTHER IN THE GROUND IS EVERYWHERE. . . . IT IS GROANING THAT IS THROUGHOUT THE LAND, MINGLED WITH LAMENTATIONS.\" THIS PARALLELS THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT WHICH SAYS \"THE LORD STRUCK DOWN ALL THE FIRST-BORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, FROM THE FIRST-BORN OF PHARAOH WHO SAY ON HIS THRONE TO THE FIRSTBORN OF THE CAPTIVE WHO WAS IN THE DUNGEON . . . AND THERE WAS A GREAT CRY IN EGYPT, FOR THERE WAS NO HOME WHERE SOMEONE WAS NOT DEAD (EXODUS 12:29-30). ANOTHER STORY TELLS OF DARKNESS AND SUFFERING, AND PHARAOH WENT OUT TO BATTLE, THOUGH THE ARMY NEVER RETURNED HOME AND PHARAOH LEAPT INTO THE PLACE OF THE WHIRLPOOL. THIS OBVIOUSLY MATCHES THE EXODUS STORY. \n \n GENESIS SAYS THAT JOSEPH TOLD HIS RELATIVES TO TAKE HIS BONES BACK TO CANAAN AFTER HE DIED, AND JOSHUA 24:32 SAYS THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED - JOSEPH WAS BROUGHT BACK AND BURIED AT SHECHEM. THIS TOMB HAS SINCE BEEN CONSIDERED THE TOMB OF JOSEPH. IT WAS OPENED A FEW YEARS AGO, AND INSIDE WAS A BODY THAT WAS MUMMIFIED ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIAN CUSTOM, AND IN THE TOMB WAS A SWORD WORN BY EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS. SOUNDS LIKE ONE HELL OF A COINCIDENCE IF THE JEWS WERE NEVER IN EGYPT AND THE STORY ABOUT JOSEPH BECOMING PHARAOH'S RIGHT HAND MAN IS FALSE.\n \n UPON LEAVING EGYPT, THE BIBLE SAYS THE JEWS RAN INTO THE AMALEKITES, AND PLENTY OF SOURCES POINT TO THE AMALEKITES AS HAVING ENTERED DOMINATED EGYPT RIGHT AFTER THE AFOREMENTIONED PLAGUES. AGAIN, THE EVIDENCE MATCHES THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT.\n \n THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DESTROYED CITIES IN CANAAN AROUND 1400 BC, WHICH IS WHEN THE JEWS WOULD HAVE GONE THERE. PLUS, MOST CITIES THAT SURVIVED LAY OUTSIDE THE AREA THAT THE BIBLE SAY THE JEWS INHABITED. (FOR A LOT OF THIS STUFF, IT HAS TO DO WITH DATING BOTH THE SHIFT FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE IRON AGE, AND THE DATES OF THE EGYPTIAN KINGS - BOTH OF WHICH ARE TOO LONG AND DETAILED TO INCLUDE.)\n \n AN INSCRIPTION FROM THE 9TH CENTURY BC HAS BEEN FOUND THAT REFERS BOTH TO THE \"HOUSE OF DAVID\" AND THE \"KING OF ISRAEL.\" TO REFER TO DAVID IN THIS SENSE SHOWS THAT HIS KINGSHIP WAS, IN FACT, A DYNASTY.",

   "FIRST OF ALL, THIS PERSON DOESN'T KNOW WHAT \"ILLOGICAL\" MEANS. \n\n lol...\n \n \nSECOND, WHILE JESUS WAS A COMMON NAME, THE JEWS IN ISRAEL ARE THE ONE PEOPLE ON EARTH AT THIS TIME WHO WOULD NEVER EVER EVER CLAIM THERE TO BE MORE THAN ONE GOD, BORROW MAJOR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, OR CONFUSE A HUMAN \n CREATURE WITH THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR. THIS PERSON ISN'T TOO FAMILIAR WITH 1ST CENTURY JUDAISM. \n\n You are confusing orthodoxies of the Sadducees and Pharisees with the common believers. Also, the early Christians did not believe Jesus was a \"second God\", neither do I suppose you do. They saw him as the fulfillment of Jewish prophesy and scripture, as evidenced by the ear liest writings. They viewed themselves as one of the many Jewish sects of the day- many of which, BTW, were Messianic and\n apocalyptic in the same way.\n \n \nNOR DOES HE CLAIM ANY EVIDENCE FOR HIS \"JESUS MYTH\" OTHER THAN READING CONSPIRACIES INTO THE TEXT. AND HAS THIS PERSON READ MYTHS WRITTEN AT THAT TIME SO HE KNOWS WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE?\n\n You can see the thread about Jesus for more info.\n \n \n \nSURE, THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WERE THE MESSIAH. BUT THEY DIDN'T CLAIM TO BE GOD HIMSELF - THAT IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE. PLUS NONE OF THESE OTHER MESSIAHS ROSE FROM THE DEAD. (AND IF THE CHRISTIANS MADE UP THAT JESUS IS THE MESSIAH, WHY WOULD THEY GIVE US INFO ABOUT THE FALSE MESSIAHS? WOULDN'T THEY WANT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE CLAIMING TO BE THE ONE? BUT ACTS 5:34-39 GIVES US THAT INFO). \n\n Everyone at the time knew there were \"false\" Messiahs running around- it would have been pointless to try to hide this info. \n \n There is no reasonable evidence that any person called Jesus named himself God or rose from the dead- you are using scripture to back up scripture here, a circular argument.\n \n \nAND IF THIS PERSON HAD READ THE OT, IT WOULD BE CLEAR TO HIM THAT THE OT ITSELF SAYS THE COVENANT OF LAW WILL BE REPLACED/OVERRIDDEN BY A DIFFERENT COVENANT (JEREMIAH 31 AND EZEKIEL 37 - THOUGH I DOUBT HE'D UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS). SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CLAIM O BE THE MESSIAH, DOES THAT MEAN THEY ARE ALL WRONG? \n\n No, just a social phenomenon of a sort. And yes, the OT does speak of the new covenant- a time of the Kingdom of the Jews on Earth. It doesn't speak of a long-haired Galilean born of a \"virgin\" in Nazareth who will be crucified. \n \n \nCLEARLY A FORGERY BASED ON WHAT? MOST NON-CHRISTIANS TRY TO SAY THAT JOSEPHUS NEVER SAID THIS, AND IT WAS OVERWRITTEN BY CHRISTIANS (EUSEBIUS, OR SOMEONE ELSE). BUT ON WHAT GROUNDS?\n\n Again, see the other thread for more details on this. \n \n \nNOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, WILL CONVINCE THEM - BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EVIDENCE, AND THEIR POSITION IS SAFE IN THEIR HEADS FROM THE REAL, OBJECTIVE WORLD.\n\n I have no vested interest in the historicity of Jesus either way, I was perfectly happy to view him as a secular historical figure.\n \n \nWOULDN'T IT BE KIND OF ODD THAT CHRISTIANS COULD GET THOUSANDS FOLLOWERS FROM ISRAEL AFTER IT'S HEARD THAT THEIR VERY LEADER COMES FROM A PLACE THAT DOESN'T EXIST? WOULDN'T THAT BE A PRETTY STUPID THING FOR MATTHEW TO INCLUDE? \n\n How would they know? People didn't get around as much in those days. Matthew included this passage, as I said, in his fervor to find OT support for Jesus as Jewish Messiah.\n \n \nNAZARETH WAS A SMALL TOWN THAT WASN'T LOOKED UPON VERY FAVORABLY, SO WHY WOULD IT GET MENTIONED BY JOSEPHUS? \n\n Perhaps not, but it would have been included on the maps of the day, which it isn't.\n \n \nA COUPLE OF POSSIBILITIES OF THE OT QUOTE: \"NAZARENE\" MAY HAVE BEEN A SYNONYM FOR \"DESPISED\" (SEE JOHN 1:45-46) FOR THE OT SAYS THE MESSIAH WILL BE DESPISED IN A FEW PLACES, HENCE MATTHEWS PLURAL \"PROPHETS\"; IT COULD BE A TAKE ON THE HEBREW WORD FOR \"BRANCH\" (AS USED IN ISAIAH 11:1 TO REFER TO THE MESSIAH), WHICH SOUNDS LIKE \"NAZER.\" AND SIMILARLY TO WHAT I WROTE A FEW SENTENCES ABOVE, WHY WOULD MATTHEW (WHO WROTE FOR THE JEWS) BE SO DUMB AS TO INCLUDE AN OLD TESTAMENT REFERENCE THAT HIS AUDIENCE IS CLEARLY GOING TO SEE AS RIDICULOUS OR HILARIOUS? HOW CAN HE GET SO MANY CONVERTS THAT WAY?\n\n Few people except scholars had read the Septuagint, and they did laugh at him.\n \n \nIT'S EASY TO THROW OUT A STATEMENT LIKE \"THE OT HAS BEEN BACK-CORRECTED\" AND NOT PROVIDE ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WITH SOLID EVIDENCES. \n\n Sure, true. If you want, you can start a new thread on the subject, as the subject is complex and lengthy.\n \n \nMORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT OF A FLOOD OR TOWER OF BABEL ACTUALLY POINTS TO IT AS BEING TRUE. \n\n Except that in the case of the Sumerian account, the geological evidence supports the idea of an ancient flood. Geological evidence does not support the idea of a global flood on the scale described in Biblical accounts.\n \n \nTHE THEME OF JOB \"WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE?\" IS A COMMON THEME IN ALL CULTURES, BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT ALL SUCH ACCOUNTS BE MERE STORIES AND MADE UP? LIKEWISE, WHY DO SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF LAW MEAN THAT THE OT IS FALSE? WHAT CULTURE DOESN'T HAVE CERTAIN LAWS SIMILAR TO THE LAW OF MOSES? THEY ALL DO. SO WHAT?\n\n Certainly. That's not the problem. It's just that if you are going to argue that God made a deal with your people only, and handed you the first laws, it looks bad when older laws are found which are verbatim copies of your supposed divine laws.\n \n Of course many cultures have similar myths and traditions. Most are smart enough not to contend that theirs is the only one with a direct line to the divine. This invites informed critique.\n \n \nA VERY OLD PAPYRUS WRITTEN BY AN EGYPTIAN PRIEST TELLS OF A SERIES OF PLAGUES: RIVER TURNING TO BLOOD, CROPS CONSUMED, DARKNESS, AND THE FINAL PLAGUE:\n\n Which? What is your source? \n \n \nSOUNDS LIKE ONE HELL OF A COINCIDENCE IF THE JEWS WERE NEVER IN EGYPT AND THE STORY ABOUT JOSEPH BECOMING PHARAOH'S RIGHT HAND MAN IS FALSE.\n\n One tomb is enough to convince you of 400 years of otherwise undocumented history?\n \n \nUPON LEAVING EGYPT, THE BIBLE SAYS THE JEWS RAN INTO THE AMALEKITES, AND PLENTY OF SOURCES POINT TO THE AMALEKITES AS HAVING ENTERED DOMINATED EGYPT RIGHT AFTER THE AFOREMENTIONED PLAGUES. AGAIN, THE EVIDENCE MATCHES THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT.\n \n Source?\n \n \nAN INSCRIPTION FROM THE 9TH CENTURY BC HAS BEEN FOUND THAT REFERS BOTH TO THE \"HOUSE OF DAVID\" AND THE \"KING OF ISRAEL.\" TO REFER TO DAVID IN THIS SENSE SHOWS THAT HIS KINGSHIP WAS, IN FACT, A DYNASTY.\n\n While the Tel Dan Inscription of Aramean King Hazael appears to confirm that a chieftain called David was not pure invention, it contradicts the biblical story that Jehu assassinated the tribal leaders in Jezreel. It also does not refer to the size or importance of the \"kingdom\".\n \n On a stylistic note, archimedes, it is considered rude to \"yell\" by writing in CAPITALS.",

Just called Jesus. My reasoning is the bible is too inconsistent on his name actually name. Son of Joseph and Mary is not relevant. Walking around for 3 years is not much of a ministry; I should know I'm a JW. Obviously \"Jesus\" was a nobody oh wait 'son of a carpenter' the story is a stilted glorification of how he lead a relatively inert and anemic movement, filled with flighty groupies looking for cures, that burnt out, and that is in the walls of the gospel canon. Maybe you don't see it like that, but I do. Crucified by Pilate? Inconclusive Pilate crucified many Jews.\n \n \n As far as Moses. I don't think it is in the 5 books, but what you described is in the bible. I believed it happened more than once with the Assyrians and the Babylonians. The 10 tribes and 2 tribes were two separate states of people with vaguely the same religion. You seem to have said the bible claimed they were \"one\" religion and country.\n \n Also I think maybe it is me or you. What I am saying is almost agreeing with you. You are not going to find proof of \"Jesus\" the story is clearly too mundane to be documented until after the fact which is what happend. You have laborer that gets devine revalation and starts this \"gospel\" that he is to save the Jews that falls apart, and ends up with him being Crucified by the Romans for sedition. In context his story is not unique enought to document, because he had ZERO impact on the world he was in while he was in it except to his cult that was resurrected from the dead much like their patron. You might as well have David Karresh and the Branch Davidians become the state religion of the USA in 400 years. Think of the obserdity of the concept, but that is what happend to Christianity. Infact that is such a fitting parallel it may happen :p",

   "The problem with your comparison, XQs, is that in this case we are talking about Galilee in the 1st century, a very small area with a lot of documentation about it. We know all kinds of random things about various ppl of the time and era- ppl who were on the whole doing and saying things very similar to the Jesus story. Why is the Jesus we know singularly excluded? Why are ppl who should have known him personally speaking of him as though he wasn't a walking, talking live person a few years prior? The only plausible explanation is that the character Jesus, like many mythological figures, is a composite of many historical and mythological people. The story does not seem to originate with a single historical person, preaching in Galilee around 30 CE. It just doesn't make sense.",
