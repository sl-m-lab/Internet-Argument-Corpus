   "I am fairly new to the creation/evolution debate....and I still have some questions. I would like someone to tell me what solid proof evolutionists have for their theory.\n\n Perhaps your questions stem from the fact that you don't seem to know what science is and how it operates. Isn't it strange that we never see someone ask if chemists or physicists have any \"proof\" of their theories. My son, a nuclear engineer, tells me that no one has ever asked him if he has any proof of the theories of nuclear physics, the ones used in operating nuclear power plants, or even in nuclear weapons.\n \n You see, a scientific theory is an explanation for the observed facts that has been tested. This is done by making a prediction that is necessarily true if the original hypothesis is true, and then testing to see if the prediction is true. A scientific hypothesis is usually called a theory when it has been tested many times. Evolutionary theory has been around for so long, explains the observations so well, and has been so well tested on so many occasions that it would be unreasonable not to accept the major tenets. In fact, if you read what Ripskar had to say, you will see that the examples that he gave of evolutionary debates are of debates about details of how evolution happens, not whether it happens.\n \nI agree that it's an elegant theory, but something seems lacking.\nFunny. It's elegant but you don't seem to know a scientific theory is.\n \nIs there proof in the fossil record for gradual evolution? If so, what exactly.\nGradualism is an explanation. All scientific theories are explanations for the observations. In fact, gradualism was first proposed by Darwin for what he observed during the voyage of the Beagle.\n \nDoes evolution have to be gradual?...if not, how not.\nSometimes evolution can be rapid. This is most easily observed in small isolated populations. Island populations are good examples of the rapid diversification of a single population into a variety of species.",

   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_evolution\n \nThe evolution of the horse involves the gradual development of the modern horse from the fox-sized, forest-dwelling Hyracotherium. Zoologists have been able to piece together a more complete picture of the modern horse's evolutionary lineage than that of any other animal.\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium\n \nPunctuated equilibrium (or punctuated equilibria) is a theory in evolutionary biology which states that most sexually reproducing species will show little to no evolutionary change throughout their history. When evolution does occur, it happens sporadically (by splitting) and occurs relatively quickly compared to the species' full duration on earth. Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against the theory of phyletic gradualism, which hypothesizes that most evolution occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (anagenesis).\n\n \n As stated previously the fossil record shows examples of both processes.\n The key concept is that evolution is OPPORTUNISTIC as described by Prof. Dawkins in The Selfish Gene.\n In a stable environment evolution tends to gradualistic development.\n In the aftermath of mass extinction events such as the Chicxulub Crater there are more opportunities and therefore a sudden rush of evolutionary development.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_Crater\n Current researchers are watching the development of the ecosystem on Anak Krakatau which was sterilised after Krakatoa.

But critical looks at all the best-known examples invariably show that the trends are between species. Within species there normally is no progressive modification by natural selection. Trends thus appear to reflect nonrandom interspecific survival and \"reproductive success,\" since it is the surviving species which leave new, descendant offspring in the future. pg. 64\n \n Eldredge (the evolutionist paleontologist) goes on to say...\n \n Fossil species of horses and humans show no evidence of progressive size increase during their own histories. Nor must every descendant species be larger than its ancestor. What superfeicially looks like a smooth, linear increase in size was actually an episodic culling process, apparently the result of selection acting on entire species. Evidently, nonrandom the trend also cannot be explained by pure natural selection, as no progressive adaptive change in the direction of the trend is ever seen within species -- the level at which stict natural selection operates. pg. 64\n \n The Myths of Evolution\n \n So what other fossil evidence is out there for gradualism?

   "Well how can there be any transitional fossil when so many evolutionists have said that gradualsim cannot be found in the fossil record?\n --------------------------------------\n Quotes from Steven Jay Gould:\n \n \"The fundamental reason why a lot of paleontologists don't care much for gradualism is because the fossil record doesn't show gradual change and every paleontologist has known that ever since Cuvier. If you want to get around that you have to invoke the imperfection of the fossil record. Every paleontologist knows that most species don't change. That's bothersome if you are trained to believe that evolution ought to be gradual. In fact it virually precludes your studying the very process you went into the school to study. Again, because you don't see it, that brings terrible distress.\"\n \n \"We've got a thoery that selection controls the direction of variation in raw materials only. That's what's random, and it's the deterministic processes of selection that produce change and direction. So, in fact, random factors produce change. That is not what Darwin contended, as I understand.\"\n \n \"The fossil record is full of gaps and disconinuities, but they are all attributed to the notorious imperfection of the fossil record. The fossil record is imperfect, but I think that is not an adequate explanation...one thing it does show that cannot be attributed to its imperfection is that most species don't change...they may get a little bigger or bumpier but they remain the same species and that's not due to imperfection and gaps but stasis. And yet this remarkable stasis has generally been ignored as no data. If they don't change, it's not evolution so you don't talk about it.\"\n \n Actually, lack of change IS stasis, not caused by stasis.\n \n Dr. Patterson on Gould and puncuated equilibria:\n \n \"Well, it seems to me that they have accepted that the fossil record doesn't give them the support they would value so they searched around to find another model and found one. The support they get for that model comes from geneticists...\" \n \n \"What is the evidence for continuity...you would have to say, there isn't any in the fossils of animals and man. The connection between them is in the mind.\"\n \n Richard Leakey:\n \n \"If I were going to draw a family tree for man, I would just draw a huge question mark.\"\n \n William R. Fix:\n \n \"As we have seen, there are numerous scientiists and popularizers today who have the temerity to tell us that there is 'no doubt' how man originated.

Learn what you are talking about before you speak. Let me quote for you from the caption of a picture horses' feet.\n \nThe evolution of horses as seen through their feet. The earliest horses (Hyracotherium) had four digits (toes) on the front legs and three on the rear. Modern horses (Equus) have just one digit, front and rear. The fossil record reveals a complex array of horses through time, with reduction in toe number happening progressively in stages over the past 50 million years. Horses provide a very clear example of significant evolutionary change preserved in the fossil record.\n\n Imagine that. In fact, Elgredge's objection to the standard picture of horse evolution is evident in that text. It has always been presented as a ladder like progression. His objection is not to gradual evolution but to ladder like representation of evolution. Sometimes evolution is gradual - sometimes quite rapid, taking place on only tens of thousands of years.",

And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57\n \n We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57\n \n --------------------------------------------------------\n \n I guess my question about individual adaptivity was not answered to my liking.

   "Well how can there be any transitional fossil when so many evolutionists have said that gradualsim cannot be found in the fossil record?\n\n If you mean transitional between consecutive species, these are in principle unlikely to be observed (because of the haphazard nature of fossilisation) and difficult to substantiate (how can you prove that fossil A found beneath fossil B in the strata was ancestral to it?). That doesn't mean they don't exist:\n \n \nStephen J. Gould -- widely quoted on the paucity of interspecies transitional fossils -- described the gradual evolution of one species of the snail genus Cerion into another as shown in fossils he discovered\n\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/jun05.html\n \n Forms transitional between groups, on the other hand, are abundant.\n \n \n\n Richard Leakey: \"If I were going to draw a family tree for man, I would just draw a huge question mark.\"\n\n \n And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty.\n \n \nWilliam R. Fix: \"As we have seen, there are numerous scientiists and popularizers today who have the temerity to tell us that there is 'no doubt' how man originated. If only they had the evidence...\"\n\n \n This would be the William R. Fix who wrote 'Star Maps: Astonishing New Evidence from Ancient Civilizations and Modern Scientific Research of Man's Origins and Return to the Stars', and works of similar scientific rigour. A truly authoritative source for the study of human evolution.\n \n \nGeorge Gaylord Simpson:\n\n A truly authoritative source, this time without the irony; authoritative, that is, in 1953. Creationists still cite out-of-context quotes to portray him as doubting transitional fossils. Try here:\n \n http://members.cox.net/ardipithecus/evol/lies/lie008.html\n Quote:\n \nNow we do have many examples of transitional sequences\n\n writes Simpson.\n \n \n[B]Dr. Eldredge, when asked about the fish-to-amphibian transition:\n \"That I know nothing about.\"\n\n \n Therefore it can't have happened? Any professional scientist would give a similar answer if asked about the detail of a topic outside his specialism: scientists are for the most part modest people. The fish-to-amphibian transition is very well documented in the fossil record.\n \n You do seem very fond of Niles Eldredge. Perhaps you'd like to give us some quotes from a more recent book of his, The Triumph of Evolution...And The Failure of Creationism (2000).\n \n \nL.T. Moore \n \"The more one studies paleontology, the more certain one becomes that evolution is based on faith alone.\"\n\n \n Ah, Louis Trenchard More, biographer of Newton (1935) and \"social observer\". Not, in fact, a biologist, let alone a palaeontologist.\n \n \nDr. Raup, when asked if the theory of evolution was falsifiable because no intermediate forms have been found:\n \"Well, whether it's valid or not, it's still possible to rationalize the lack of intermediates -- rationalize it by simply modifying the original Darwinian Theory.\"\n\n Setting aside the false premise, what do we infer from this?

This is the basic dogma of evolutionists (as shown in my earlier link).....is this true or not?\n\n \n Clearly, some animal species have evolved the ability to make adaptive changes (especially in colouration) within their lifetimes, in response to changing environmental conditions. It's well known that stoats switch between winter and summer coats: this seems to be triggered by changes in photoperiod. Chameleons have entered the language as a by-word for short-term individual adaptation, and other reptiles and amphibians have similar abilities; so, yes, there is such a thing as adaptation of the individual to its surroundings within its lifetime. An important rider is that these abilities are restricted to very specific responses to very specific stimuli, and that the physiological mechanisms underlying those responses are themselves evolved traits.\n \n But if you're asking if there's some generalised system whereby individual animals can tweak their physiology to suit any new circumstances, absolutely not. You seem to be hankering after a kind of Lamarckism here, and that idea's been dead a long time - Kammerer's efforts with the midwife toad notwithstanding.\n \n \nAlso do you guys admit/suggest that the same mechanism that creates traits in the short-term is the same mechanism that creates traits in the long-term?\n\n \n No. Let me reiterate: the short-term within-lifetime changes you seem so hung up on are brought about by physiological mechanisms (like the stoat's response to photoperiod) which have themselves come about by mutation and selection. I would also take issue with your phrase 'creates traits in the short-term'. The individual animal has a strictly limited repertoire of responses to a strictly limited range of environmental changes. If for some bizarre reason the snow came down blue one year, the local stoats couldn't 'create' blue coats in response: they'd still go white, in response to the shortening days. (But if the blue snow persisted for enough generations, any individuals which by chance mutation or genetic recombination inherited coats with a bluey tinge may well experience greater reproductive success and eventually give rise to a population of stoats that turned blue, not white, in winter.)",

But the ability to change in response to the environment is the adaptation, and that came about through mutation and natural selection. I understood the question to be asking if individual animals could make adaptive changes to the environment. Sure, but it isn't evolution since it isn't heritable. Genetic changes aren't in response to the environment but their spread through populations through natural selection are. That's what I meant when I said:\nIn the context of evolutionary biology, adaptation is not an ability.\nAdaptation is the result of differential reproductive success of individuals with beneficial characteristics. The \"ability\" of a population to \"adapt\" is measured by the genetic diversity in the genome.\n \n So Semi's question comes down to a failure to learn the basics.

However, that is not the case at all. Some may be well adapted to their environments, but many are not. In changing environments organisms may not be well adapted. Given time, once the environment stabilizes, organisms may once again become well adapted. However, today, so much of our environment has and is changing that we are undergoing a major extinction event. The changes have been too rapid and severe for many species.\n \nthen would you answer me why in the world is there a need for animals to wait around for thousands of years for Darwinists' silly, pathetic little fraud of a concept called \"adaptation?\"\n\n Now you are being silly. Animals don't wait around. Either they are adapted or they aren't. If they aren't, it is likely that that particular lineage will go extinct. You really have no concept of what adaptation is, do you?\n \nI'm going to bring the fairy-tale called neo-Darwinism to its knees and watch it bleed from its eyeballs on this site.\nSo far your prognosis isn't good. So far there is no indication that you understand the most basic elements of what you claim to oppose.\n \nhttp://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/natbltn/700-799/nb706.htm color changes in fish, frogs lizards\nOnce again you demonstrate your failure to educate yourself before you speak. The changes mentioned in the article are adaptions, the ability to adapt is an adaptation. The adaption is induced by the environment. The adaptation is an inherited ability that results from mechanisms of evolution.\n \n If you actually read anything that I said, I actually mentioned the anole as an example of a prediction of evolution that was supported. I am quite familiar with anole. Would you like to see some pictures I have taken of them in my back yard?\n \n Before you bring anything to its knees, please define Darwinism, neo-Darwinism, evolution, gene, genetics, adaptation, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection, founder effect, allopatric speciation, sympatric speciation.

Nearly all tool-kit genes are present in all animals, and they do much the same thing in all animals. The same gene, for example, that triggers eye development in fruit flies also triggers eye development in mice...Similarly, a gene that affects pigmentation in birds like the chicken and the bananaquit also affects pigmentation in mammals like the jaguar and you. Indeed, changes in bird-plumage color often involve the same gene that causes red hair in humans. This surprising genetic conservatism across nearly all animals is evo devo's key empirical finding: swans, swallowtails, and socialites are all built from the same genes...\n \"The real excitement about evo devo, however, has to do with its third claim. Carroll and others have taken the next, and by far the most radical, step and argue that evolution is mostly a matter of throwing these switches.\n \"Evo devo's emphasis on switch-throwing represents a profound departure from evolutionary biology's long obsession with genes. Animal evolution works not so much by changing genes, Carroll maintains, but by changing when and where a conserved set of genes is expressed. In the lingo, evolution is regulatory (involving patterns of gene expression), not structural (involving the precise proteins coded by genes). You can think of this distinction in terms of those light switches. Imagine two houses that were built from the same blueprint and that were initially identical. But now, years later, we notice that they look different at night. In one, the first floor is bright and the second floor is dim; in the other, the opposite is true. This difference could have arisen in two ways. Maybe the houses new feature different lights; the owners of the first house might, for instance, have replaced bulbs on the first floor with brighter ones; the other owners might have done the same thing on the second floor. But maybe - and this is the evo-devo picture - the owners of the first house have switched on most first-floor lights and switched off most second-floor lights; the owners of the second house might have done might have done the reverse. Evo devo tells us that animal species look different not because their structural bits and pieces have changed but because they switch on and off the same old bits and pieces in different combinations. Roughly speaking, then, penguins and people differ for the same reason your pancreas and eye differ: they're expressing different genes...\n \"Vertebrates, including human beings, carry only around twenty-five thousand genes (before the genome was decoded, scientists typically guessed that there would be around a hundred thousand); most animals carry even fewer. How does nature squeeze so many kinds of creatures out of such a modest genetic endowment? The answer, according to evo devo, is combinatoric explosion. Although thousands of genes might not sound like enough to explain the most unimaginable diversity of what are, after all, the most sophisticated machines in the known universe, the number of combinations in which these genes can be expressed (gene 1 with gene 2, but not with genes 3, 4, 5, etc.) is nearly boundless...\n \"For the first time, we have a good understanding of how particular changes in DNA cause particular changes in embryos, which, in turn, cause particular changes in species. The point is that not all significant science turns our world upside down. Despite the nearly irresistible romance of the scientific revolution, the history of evolutionary biology might look a lot more like evo devo's own history of the animal kingdom: a few radical innovations early on, followed by some intensely interesting tinkering.\"",

   "Maybe this well help you understand evo devo: (I cut this several weeks ago...and do not have a link...you could probably find it if you care to dig.)\nYes. Excellent evidence for common ancestry.\n \n The quote if from a book review in the New Yorker, TURNED ON by H. Allen Orr. He reviews a book by Sean Carroll, a professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Endless Forms Most Beautiful. He is, of course, talking about Carroll's discussion of Hox genes in the review.\n \n The phrase \"Endless forms most beautiful\" comes from Darwin himself. Most are familiar with the phrase from the last sentence of \"On the Origin of Species,\" but Darwin actually first used the phrase in the Sketch of 1942 and then in the Essay of 1844.\n \n By the way, since when is a book review considered valid science? I guess it's the best that creationism has to offer since there is no such thing as \"creation science.\"",

Except for differences in non genetic heterochromatin, chromosomes 6, 13, 19, 21, 22, and X have identical banding patterns in all four species. Chromosomes 3, 11, 14, 15, 18, 20, and Y look the same in three of the four species (those three being gorilla, chimps, and humans), and chromosomes 1, 2p, 2q, 5, 7 - 10, 12, and 16 are alike in two species.

Don Lindsay provides a diagram of the chromosome 5 inversion between chimpanzees and humans scanned from ref. 1. Note how all of the bands between the two chromosomes will line up perfectly if you flip the middle piece of either of the two chromosomes between the p14.I and q14.I marks. The similarity of the marks will include a match for position, number, and intensity (depth of staining). Similar rearrangements to this can explain all of the approximately 1000 non-heterochromatic bands observed among each of the four species for these three properties (band position, number, and intensity).\n \n Other types of rearrangements include a few translocations (parts swapped among the chromosomes), and the presence or absence of nucleolar organizers. All of these differences are described in ref. 2 and can be observed to be occurring in modern populations.\n \n The biggest single chromosomal rearrangement among the four species is the unique number of chromosomes (23 pairs) found in humans as opposed to the apes (24 pairs). Examining this difference will allow us to see some of the differences expected between common ancestry as opposed to a common designer and address the second creationist objection listed above. ",
