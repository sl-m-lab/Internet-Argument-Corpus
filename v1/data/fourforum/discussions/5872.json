   "The Quagmire Called the Iraq War (4 Letters)\n Published: July 4, 2005\n To the Editor:\n \n Re \"Dangerous Incompetence,\" by Bob Herbert (column, June 30):\n \n As the dust settles from President Bush's speech on the war in Iraq, it is obvious that his hubris has left the American people in a precarious position. We are arguably living through the most harrowing time since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\n \n What is so frightening is that President Bush has painted us into a dangerously tight corner. The obvious solution is to cut and run: set a timetable, stanch the bleeding and withdraw. But that would be more dangerous than staying a course that the defense secretary has suggested might last a decade or more. \n \n Why? Because the United States has no choice but to finish the job. Its failure to do so would be a victory for terrorists everywhere. \n \n Shaun D. Mullen -- Newark, Del., June 30, 2005\n \n To the Editor:\n \n The Bush administration doesn't know how to prosecute this war or to end it successfully. But there's another reason we are stuck in Iraq. \n \n The administration, in its way, finds the war congenial. As long as it goes on, the war drags America into lock step with President Bush. Iraq is a sort of daily 9/11 that keeps America fearful and keeps it marching, however disenchanted, to the president's beat.\n \n Whether purposely done or not, an age-old way to secure power and keep it is to keep a country fearful, aggressive, xenophobic and at war. This war of President Bush's continues to that.\n \n Stewart Dean -- Kingston, N.Y., June 30, 2005\n \n To the Editor:\n \n Thanks to Bob Herbert for reminding us how the situation in Iraq got so bad. \"Bring 'em on\" reflects how little comprehension President Bush has of how to bring democracy to the Middle East.\n \n I am still appalled and deeply embarrassed that the commander in chief can get away with such childish rhetoric. Even more embarrassing is that a number of Americans probably agreed with President Bush. \n \n With the insurgency thriving, I hope that those who have supported Mr. Bush might recognize the awful situation his administration has led us into without any notion of how to get out.\n \n \"Quagmire\" is the correct term, and until a majority of Americans begins to wake up to that reality, extrication will be impossible. \n \n We are effectively trapped in Iraq as surely as any hostage.\n \n Stefan Gutermuth -- Petaluma, Calif., June 30, 2005\n \n To the Editor:\n \n After reading Bob Herbert's columns of the last few weeks and watching Iraq unfold over the last two years, I have a question that I feel was never asked by our media and hence never answered by our government. \n \n If it required 500,000 armed forces to remove Saddam Hussein from the little country of Kuwait in 1991, why did anyone think that it would be possible to keep the peace with one-third as many troops in a country many times larger? \n \n Jonathan V. Porcelli -- Tucson, June 30, 2005\n \n http://query.nytimes.com/mem/tnt.html?emc=tnt&tntget=2005/07/04/opinion/l04herbert.html&tntemail1",

   "How would you fight terrorism then? It seems as though you feel the way to do it is to use non-action altogether so as to not provoke or direct terrorist threats.\n\n \n With regard to Iraq, terrorism is not the issue. National resistance by a minority population is a circumstance aggravated by the presence of a foreign military occupation. That aggravation has been taken as a symbolic cause by independent organizations, both political and tribal, who desire complete US disengagement from the ME, including military and economic aid to Israel's efforts against Palestine. No single ME sovereign nation or association of countries can stand against US military aggression, hence the independent organizational structure where financial and logistical support can be effected by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan and other US allies and enemies without direct involvement. \n \n Conventional military force has proven to be ineffective in disabling or destroying any cell based organization seeking to disrupt US ME political manipulation in past circumstances and the current situation. It has strengthened the resolve of those organizations, increased participation, financing and general support by affected ME nations. \n \n Solutions?\n 1. Get out of the ME, let Iraq settle their internal problems with a civil war and then turn reconstruction of Iraq over to a European consortium and write the checks.\n 2. Stay and attempt fruitless domination using conventional military forces, US or domestic, straining our already fragile fiscal circumstances and invite further strengthening of forces opposed to US ME domination, turning the US into a police state with no civil rights, sealed borders, failed economy and continual, high paranoia. \n 3. All out war, resulting in genocide of all Islamic countries, including our 'allies' and the rest of numerous other countries containing 20% of the world population.",

   "With regard to Iraq, terrorism is not the issue.\n \n \n What Saddam Hussein was doing to his people was most certainly a form of terrorism. Not to the direct effect on us as 9/11, but more people died from Saddam's terrorist acts in Iraq on the people there than died in 9/11.\n \n It's hard to justify the idea that we aren't fighting terrorism when anywhere else the things he did to the people there would most certainly be considered terrorist acts.\n \n \n1. Get out of the ME, let Iraq settle their internal problems with a civil war and then turn reconstruction of Iraq over to a European consortium and write the checks.\n\n \n If we got out right now, Iraq would be in serious trouble. As bad as when Saddam was in power, that's for sure. A European consortium would do no better--they hate Europeans as much as they hate the U.S.\n \n \n2. Stay and attempt fruitless domination using conventional military forces, US or domestic, straining our already fragile fiscal circumstances and invite further strengthening of forces opposed to US ME domination, turning the US into a police state with no civil rights, sealed borders, failed economy and continual, high paranoia. \n\n \n The administration has been giving signals for a couple of months now that they view this as not going on any more than 1 more year. The Iraq conflict has to be seen as a series of victories: a.) defeating Saddam, \n b.)the Iraqi elections, \n c.) the soon to be Iraqi constitution, and \n d.) will be our withdrawl (since Iraqis will be on their own at that point)\n A and B have been accomplised and we are fast approaching C.\n \n \n3. All out war, resulting in genocide of all Islamic countries, including our 'allies' and the rest of numerous other countries containing 20% of the world population.\n\n \n A 3rd world war is basically what you are saying here. Not going to happen. ME countries know there's no chance of winning that. If there were, Iran and Iraq and perhaps others would have set it off long ago.\n \n I do however, agree with you that it is a quagmire to some degree, and no doubt the administration thought it would be easier than it is. But war is often quagmire. One problem is that because of the way the war is reported, the U.S. people only hears about the war in terms of it's day to day problems. They don't realize that compared to enemy troop and terrorist losses, the U.S. losses are relatively small. And they don't hear the day to day accomplishments, only problems. The media has done a poor job giving a balanced reporting of the war. COnsidering that mostly only the bad things are reported and not the good things, it's a miracle the whole country isn't against the war.

He took power by killing off his opposition in a Baath coup in 1979 and made himself dictator of Iraq.\nCon Coughlin is a conservative commentator in the United Kingdom who wrote a book published in 2002 called Saddam: King of Terror.\n \n Saddam Hussein was exiled from Iraq to Egypt during the early 60s, he continued his murderous ways there by knocking off an Egyptian or two, as well as other Iraqis while sojourning in that country. It was well established that Saddam Hussein was a murderous thug. Nevertheless, our CIA really, really loved the murderous ways of Saddam Hussein and a flourishing relationship developed between the CIA and Hussein. He was also a very nice looking man in his youth, and maybe they had the hots for him, too.\n \n The United States has always considered Iraq to be a key strategic asset in the Middle East and, by golly, Saddam Hussein, for all his murderous and thuggish ways, looked like just the man to install and take care of business for the United States in that area. Frankly, if I were in intelligence and were making decisions like this in this area, I'd be danged if I'd want to pin my hopes on a murderous thug--but that's just me.\n \n So, while Saddam Hussein was ensconced in Egypt, hopefully he didn't murder too many more people, the CIA was trying to unseat Abdul Karem Qassen, another dude who had seized the reins of power in Iraq. They, the CIA, tried a number of hare-brained plots to get rid of him, I'll try to see if I can find one or two of their ridiculous plots, but failed and finally, in 1963, the CIA engineered a coup which took out Qassem. (The CIA was also behind the coup to take down the freely elected Mohammad Mossedegh in 1953, which more or less set up Iran for the stuff that happened in 1979.)\n \n Well, by golly, Qassem was down, his bullet-filled body was propped up and displayed on national TV (in Iraq) and the CIA had their man standing by in Egypt. Boy! And they knew that Saddam Hussein would not hesitate to mow down anyone who got in his way. There were a number of clashes in Iraq following Qassem's downing, Hussein sat in Egypt during his (Qassem's) taking down twiddling his thumbs, but as soon as the regime changed he stormed back to Iraq and added his own bully boy tactics to the ongoing clashes.\n \n (More to come)",

By the way, please note that I've added a couple under Ronald Wilson Reagan and that I have a question about France, December 26, 1994:\n\n \n Well, you can find the info about the France hijacking at http://www.specialoperations.com/Counterterrorism/default.html\n \n And while we're adding on attacks, I can't believe I forgot to mention the first Trade Center bombing. Or the attacks you added. Just goes to show how many there have been.\n \n The thing I'm trying to show with this information is that terrorist attacks have happened for the last 30 years and it doesn't seem to matter who is in office. Every president has had several terrorist attacks on their watch. 9/11 didn't happen because Bush was in office, it was already planned during Clinton's years. Though, if Clinton had stayed in power a few years longer (in a reality where term limits don't apply), 9/11 still would have happened, regardless. If Al Gore had won, it would have happened.\n \n \n \n \n \nIt is to be noted that Bill Clinton had people working on the Somalia, Kenya and USS Cole events at the getgo and that the identity of Osama bin Laden was disclosed as the primary hand behind all of these attacks. Bill Clinton repeatedly warned George Walker Bush and his incoming administration about the Osama bin Laden danger and the danger of terrorism but Bush, as usual, failed to give heed to someone who knew what was going on.\n\n \n Right after the Mogadishu battle in October 1993, Clinton ordered TF Ranger to discontinue operations and return home. Bin Laden has said that was really his inspiration; if a ragtag bunch of poorly armed, poorly trained street fighters had been able to drive off the world's strongest military and it's strongest troops in less than 24 hours, he knew he could defeat America. And he wasn't the primary hand in the battle there, he had a relatively minor but pretty important role in it. His men helped train Aidid's militia on how to shoot down helicopters (something they learned in Afghanistan against the Soviets).\n \n And how do you know Bush ignored the threat of terrorism? Where you there, privy to his security meetings? You do realize that much of what the president does every day is classified and we're never gonna hear about it? But it has been reported that several times Clinton had the possibility of killing or capturing Osama and didn't take it. As to how valid the claims are, again, we can't be sure due to the fact that half the story is classified.",

It appears to be largely a French national affair and it appears that the Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN) handled the affair very nicely, which occurred in the nation of Algeria, by the way.\n \n In fact, this arm of the French national police force has handled quite a number of previous terrorist events such as:\n \n In 1979 a captain and two sub-officers had been dispatched on an urgent mission to Saudi Arabia to help dislodge several hundred armed Muslim extremists who had taken over the Sacred Mosque in Mecca. Thousands of pilgrims on their annual hajj to Mecca were being held hostage in a labyrinth of underground passages beneath the Mosque.\n \n The very survival of the Saudi monarchy hung in the balance as Captain Paul Barril presented the Saudi National Guard with his plan to use paralyzing gas to flush out the insurgents from an underground area of sixty square kilometers. The GIGN advisers trained handpicked teams of Saudi soldiers in demolitions and room-clearing techniques to conduct the assault, which resulted in 2000 dead after an entire day of close quarters battle.\n \n On December 26, 1994 the GIGN again faced a potentially disastrous encounter with Muslim terrorists when Captain Denis de Favier prepared his \"super Gendarmes\" to storm an Air France passenger jet hijacked in Algeria by suicidal terrorists of that country's Armed Islamic Group (AIG).\n \n News about the hijacking, which began at midday on December 24, caught many members of the French counter-terrorist unit at home with their families for Christmas. However, the tall, angular-faced de Favier had not strayed far from Paris and his briefings, contingency planning an transport arrangements were methodically prepared by the time his men were assembling early that afternoon at their HQ outside Versailles. . . .",
