   " But their marriages (or extra-marital relationships) were not something god made 'all hell break loose' about.\n\n \n Have you ever read the Bible, preppie?\n \n From 2 Samuel 12: (the Lord speaking):\n \n Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. \n \n 11 \"This is what the LORD says: 'Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight. 12 You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.' \" \n \n 13 Then David said to Nathan, \"I have sinned against the LORD.\" \n Nathan replied, \"The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. 14 But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the LORD show utter contempt, [a] the son born to you will die.\" \n \n 15 After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill. 16 David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground. 17 The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them. \n \n 18 On the seventh day the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, \"While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.\" \n \n 19 David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. \"Is the child dead?\" he asked. \n \"Yes,\" they replied, \"he is dead.\" \n \n No go study up on Adultery in the Bible.",

The Lord tells David to go to Hebron, so he goes with his TWO WIVES and is then anointed king over the house of Judah. No fireballs, no slapped wrist, nothing.\n \n In fact David is going from strength to strength (and a lot more besides). In 2 Samuel 5, he conquers Jerusalem, where he takes more concubines and wives (vs 13). Then, a few verses latre he conquers the Phiistines, with the Lord's blessing (vs 19).\n \n 2 Samuel 8 lists his victories, with no mention of god's wrath regarding his multuple marriages, concubines etc.\n \n 2 Samuel 10 he defeats the Ammonites.\n \n It isn't until 2 Samuel 11, when he knocks up Bathsheba (the adultery you speal of) that god gets a bit tetchy. An then 2 Samuel 12 when he finally says something about it.\n \n But wait, by 2 Samuel 19 David is back in Jerusalem, king again. What a short memory your god must have. Take a look at verse 5:-\n \n 5 Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, \"Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.\n \n He's still got all those wives and concubines, but god is back on his side. No fireballs or anything.\n \n In 2 Samuel 20 vs 3 he still has 10 concubines.\n \n 2 Samuel 21, still beating Philistines.\n \n And don't let me get going about Solomon. Take a look at 1 Kings 11 (first few verses).\n \n So, don't give me any of that rubbish about god not approving of these multiple marriages. It was only the adultery that he got peeved about. And he forgot about that one pretty quickly too.\n \n Perhaps you should give your bible another looking over.",
