   "In 1920, Amendment 19 gave women the right to vote. This being the case it should be the result of the first clause of the 14th Amendment, passed in 1868, that they shall have the equal protection of the laws regarding this right, i.e.\n \n \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n but \u00a72 of the 14th Amendment says, \n \n \"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,* and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\"\n \n Considering the time when this amendment was passed, male inhabitants, 21 years and older, represented all legal voters. The 19th Amendment changed that though such that women may now vote, but if their right to vote is denied or abridged the enumeration of representatives is not required to be proportionately reduced as it is if the same right is denied male voters, thus they are not afforded the same protection under the laws as specified in the 1st clause. This seems it is also the case for voters between the ages of 18 and 21 since only male voter 21 and older are protected by the 2nd clause. Does this mean that the 14th Amendment violates itself as a result of the 19th and 26th Amendments? :)",
