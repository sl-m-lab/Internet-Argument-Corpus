   "Fellow Christians in this 'Creation v. Evolution' forum...\n \n I happen to be one of those Christians (an Evangelical Methodist, to be denominationally precise) who also stands quite squarely in the evolutionist camp. That is to say: I opt for an earth billions of years old, for macro-evolution via inter alia the mechanisms of genetic mutation, natural selection et al, and for a humankind evolved from other primates on the order of 10**6 years ago as distinct from Young-Earth Creationists' 10**3 years. At the same time, I am a \"Bible-believing\" Christian, rejecting no part of scripture, holding all to be the Word. That out of the way, let me offer the following challenge to fellow Christians who get hot 'n' bothered in this forum about (as some of my Southern church fellows say) \"evil-lution\"...\n \n Let us suppose, for the moment, that all of us evolutionists on here are in fact mistaken. Let us suppose that, say, the earth is indeed just 10**3 years old, not billions...species do not evolve in anything like a Darwinian way...that humankind in fact has an origin not connected with the origins of other primates. Thre you have it, anti-evolutionists: We're supposing that all us evolutionists are, again, mistaken.\n \n That now said and agreed to for arguments' sake, I'm left to ask: Why is it that so many conservative Christians, IN ADDITION TO holding evolutionist positions to be mistaken, hold the anti-evolutionist position to be ESSENTIAL to Christian doctrine? Example: One woman in my church holds that an anti-evolutionist position is so essential to Christian faith that a person who is an evolutionist is THEREBY not a Christian. She has in fact \"ruled\" me not Christian solely on this ground.\n \n Let it be--and we HAVE let it be, by stipulation, above--that I am mistaken, massively, in my interpretation of the early chapters of Genesis. I might be mistaken also in my interpretation of, say, James. In fact, I read James such that a Christian remains capable, potentially, of every possible sin. An elder in my church reads James differently, and holds the Christian no longer capable of certain sins. Clearly, at least one of the two of us is mistaken, and indeed seriously so, theologically. Each of us, in discussion, says the other is mistaken. But neither of us pronounces the other \"not Christian\" by virtue of such interpretive error.\n \n Examine the issue, conservative 'Creationist' Christians, and reflect...Apart from the creation-evolution debate per se, what ground, theologically, scripturally, have you for thinking that an anti-evolutionist position, beyond being (from your perspective) correct, so essential to one's being a Christian that the evolutionist must be said to be ipso facto not a Christian?\n \n I have heard blustering pronouncement that evolutionists can't be Christians. I have not once, however, heard the point argued well. I should be heartened if some Christian colleague here could present something resembling an actual argument, with premises, conclusions, and a logally valid assemblage thereof.\n \n Who knows--rise to the challenge and perhaps you can bring a straying \"evil-lutionist\" back into the fold...\n \n Bradley",

   "You ask to debate a lot of issues at once. Do you believe in a literal Adam? Do you not think that the idea is completely connected to Jesus' ministry? If it weren't for sin - Jesus would need not have come.\n\n \n I do indeed believe in a literal Adam. An Adam of flesh and bone. An Adam God made. I am he. Whoever wears the name 'montalban' is also Adam. Mel Schwartz, over on Apple Street, is Adam. Adam Smith was Adam. Nameless stockbrokers, serfs and sailors are or were Adam. Women are Adam. Over and over, Adam acquires the knowledge of good and evil. If all our DNA tracks back to a particular 'Adam' and 'Eve' somewhere--in Africa, say--then they, too, were Adam, and acquired that knowledge. We've all been sinning little mothers ever since, scripture tells us, and experience reinforces. It is to that pervasive sinning nature that Jesus's life and work are God's reply.\n \n Do I believe in a literal Eden? Yes, absolutely. I live there. As do you. Should the Garden of Eden story be found or believed to represent, additionally, some particularly referenced geographic locale, I should be delighted, and would not feel my reading diminished or countered thereby.\n \n Do I believe in a \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\"? Entirely. But that tree was not, is not, a species. Not as in {pear tree, fig tree, poplar tree, tree of the knowledge of good and evil, walnut tree...}.\n \n As you see, I read the Garden of Eden story allegorically, and believe that it fairly cries out to be read so. I also read the story 'literally,' in the sense of that word 'literally' which is employed by, inter alia, R.C. Sproul.\n \n Hope that helps clarify my position. The question you asked me is one I'm rarely asked in the EvanMeth church I attend: Most folk there think that a particular Adam (and ONLY one) is named by Genesis, that the Garden is in a in-principle locatable place (a geographically UNIQUE, and small, place), and that the tree-of-the-knowledge is some species. It doesn't occur to most that a Christian might read Genesis differently. Thus I'm not often challenged on the point, so appreciate your question.\n \n A side-note...Numerous among my church fellows cite as \"evidence\" for the 'literal' truth of Eve's creation in the 'biblical' description the \"fact\" that men and women have differing numbers of ribs. Asked in a survey why they believed in special creation and not evolution, the majority of my Sunday school class cited not scripture but \"That's the way I was taught.\"\n \n I find that revealing.\n \n Cheers!\n \n Bradley",

   "Actually, I've never heard of the 'everyone is Adam' stance.\n \n We Orthodox believe in one literal Adam, and that God is an active participant in the creation. Further, the relationship of said very real Adam is essential to Christianity, almost as much so as that of Jesus.\n \"If one is to vigorously and consistently maintains that Jesus Christ is the unique Savoir Who has brought salvation to a world in need of salvation, one obviously must know what is the nature of the need which provoked this salvation. (St. Athanasius, De Incarnatione Verbi Dei, 4) It would, indeed, seem foolish to have medical doctors trained to heal sickness if there were no such thing as sickness in the world. Likewise, a savoir who claims to save people in need of no salvation is a savoir only unto himself.\" http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/frjr_sin.htm\n This 'sickness' then is sin. It is ancestral sin, the sin committed by Adam. \"And behold, as you see, the sentence of God remains forever as an eternal chastisement...For this reason the Almighty Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, came so as to humble Himself in place of Adam.\" (St. Symeon the New Theologian \"The First-Created Man\", p44).",

   "Hello BradleyHarris:\n I firstly wish to tell you that if you are an evolutionist, you can still be a Christian, defined as a follower of Jesus Christ. Ignore those who say other wise, but you do have some big problems (or dangers as we will see shortly. For instance, see the article Is it possible to be a Christian and an evolutionist? \n \n I do indeed believe in a literal Adam. An Adam of flesh and bone. An Adam God made. I am he. Whoever wears the name 'montalban' is also Adam. We've all been sinning little mothers ever since, scripture tells us, and experience reinforces. It is to that pervasive sinning nature that Jesus's life and work are God's reply. \n \n Genesis 2:7 says that God formed man from the dust. He was named Adam; his wife, Eve, was taken from his rib. In verse 23: The man said \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called \"woman\" for she was taken out of man\".  If we keep on reading to verse 24, we are told the basis for marriage: For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. Here we are told by God that marriage is one man for one women, and thus forms Christian's argument against homosexuality and other immoral sexual behaviour. If one has rejected Genesis, he/she has no basis  of which to call the homosexual relationship wrong. \n \n Futher more, were you made from dust? I know I wasn't - Adam however, was. There is no other reasonable way to take Genesis 2:7 than is as written, i.e. literally. \n \n Do I believe in a literal Eden? Yes, absolutely. I live there. \n \n Genesis 2:10-14 describes the Garden of Eden's geographical location: A river watering the garden flowed from Eden, and from here it divided; it had four headstreams. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigrisl it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n \n This cannot be interpreted anyother way than as written. This clearly defines where it was located when God created everything in six days about six thousand years ago. Of course, the Flood would have wiped it out if it was still left by then (about 1,500 years after creation the Flood occured). This is when, Christian creationists believe that most of the fossils and landforms were formed. \n \n Do I believe in a \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\"? Entirely. But that tree was not, is not, a species. Not as in {pear tree, fig tree, poplar tree, tree of the knowledge of good and evil, walnut tree...}.\n \n Er, what do you define as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? A tree appears to indicate it is a tree and nothing else. There is no poetic language, such as similies and metaphors to suggest that it should not be taken literally. The verse before that says: \"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of theknowledge of good and evil... Within the same few verses, the Bible is refering to eating the from the other trees, which obviously implies, that the trees are trees. He warned against eating fruit from the forbidden tree. Notice how there is no poetic language here, which implies that it must be taken literally. Besides, there is no other way to take it - unless you really warp it, i.e. add junk into the Bible.\n \n As you see, I read the Garden of Eden story allegorically, and believe that it fairly cries out to be read so. I also read the story 'literally,' in the sense of that word 'literally' which is employed by, inter alia, R.C. Sproul.\n \n Well, according to the dictionary, literal means giving words their ordinary sense, i.e. not figurative. Is this how you are taking it? Doesn't look like it to me. What was the definition employed by R. C. Sproul? When you go and sit outside and watch the \"world go by\", you will see an evening which signals the end of a day and then several hours later morning, which signals the start of a new day. The Bible says the same sort of thing, evening passed, morning came - the nth day (where nth day is between 1-6 days). If God did create in billions of years, He would not have used the term \"day\". If you were to think that God created in billions of years (even when the text clearly says six days), you would have to show some consistency and say that it took Jesus 30 million years to rise from the dead! And three days ago would have to be translated as several million years. Using such a long day explanation (where 1 day = millions of years) today would be absurd, so why use it then when the Bible says six days (Earth Standard Time)? [remembering that God wrote the book as a revelation for humans] \n \n \"For in six days, God made the heavens and the Earth, the sea and all that in them, but He rested on the seventh day\" (Exodus 20:11).\n \n Asked in a survey why they believed in special creation and not evolution, the majority of my Sunday school class cited not scripture but \"That's the way I was taught.\" I find that revealing.\n \n I find that both revealing and disturbing that Christians today are moving away from the literal view of the Authorative Word of God, Genesis. \n \n The issue of what is the origin of death comes into play for compromising Christians. Literal interpretations easily account for how there can be an all loving God in the horrible world we see today:\n \n Death and suffering is the penalty for sin. When Adam rebelled against God, in effect he was saying that he wanted life without God. He wanted to decide truth for himself, indenpently of God. God had to judge adam's sin with death. He had already warned Adam that if he sinned he would \"surely die\". After Adam's Fall, he and all his descendants forfeited the right to live. After all,God is teh author of life (which we both agree on). Death is the natural penalty of choosing life without God, the giver of life. Also, because the LORD is holy and just, there had to be a penalty for rebellion. The Bible makes it clear that death is the penalty for our sin, not just the sin of Adam (because we sin in the likeness of Adam). If you accept the Bible's account of history, then our sins - not just the sins of \"the other guy\" - are responsible for all the death and suffering in the world! In other words, it is really our fault that the world is the way it is. No-one is really \"innocent\".\n \n At the same time that God judged sin with death, he withdrew some of His sustaining power. Romans 8:22 tells us that the whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain. Everything is running down because of sin. God has given us a taste of life without Him - a world full of hate, violence, death, suffering and disease. If God wthdrew all of His sustaining power, the creation would cease to exist. Colossians 1:16-17 tells us that all things are held together, right now, by the power of the Creator, the LORD Jesus Christ. However, in one sense, He is not holding it together perfectly, as He is deliberately letting things fall apart to give us a taste of what life is like without God. In other words, God gives us precisely what we asked for - life without Him (cf. Romans 1:18-32).\n \n From the Bible's perspective of history, death is an enemy, not an ally. In 1 Corinthians 15:26, the Apostle Paul describes death as the \"last enemy\". Death was not apart of God's original creation, which truely was \"very good\". Based on a straight forward reading of the Genesis account, we can conclude that we are looking at a fallen, cursed world.\n \n However, if one believes in millions of years, then this world has always been a deadly place. The question that we naturally ask is \"Who caused the cancer, disease and violence represented in the fossil record?\" Christians who believe in millions of yeras of history have a serious problem. The Bible plainly says that God is the Creator and He called everything that He had made - before, leading up to, and including adam and Eve, but before their Fall - \"very good\" (Genesis 1:31). As soon as Christians allow for death and suffering and disease before adam's sin (whch they automatically must if they believe in millions of years), then they've raised a very serious question about their Gospel message. What, then, has sin done to the world? According to Christian teaching, death is the penalty for sin and this fact is the foundation of the Gospel (1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 45). Moreover, how can all things be \"restored\" to a state with no death, pain or tears in the future (Revelation 21:4) if there never was a time free of death and suffering? The whole message of the Gospel falls apart if you have a compromised view of Creation. Added on to this, it would mean that God is a sadistic ogre who is to blame for death.\n \n This then prompts the statement, didn't Jesus come down to conquer death, and He is the Son of God, and if God had been using millions of years of suffering and death to create things, Jesus would be opposing the plan of God; and it's associated question: \"Why did Jesus die on the Cross\"? Jesus Himself refers to the book written by Moses, i.e. Genesis, in a literal interpretation way. So to does Paul, and the Apostles.\n \n The articles The big picture, Did God really take six days?, Some questions for theistic evolutionists, The Gospel - evidence for creation and Is the seventh day an eternal day? should help you to see that evolution and Christianity are not a good mix and that evolution undermines the message of the Gospels and the Bible.\n \n God Bless and have a great day.\n You brother in Christ,\n Matthew.\n \n Btw, the above articles came from the Genesis Q&A and Creation: Why it Matters Q&A so you can check out more of the articles if you want to.",

   "Thanks, NuLeader, for the ref to the Answers in Genesis page on \"Ten Dangers of Theistic Evolutionism.\" I'd been all over the AinG website, but had missed that one.\n \n One of the points made there is that Theistic Evolutionism (TE, hereinafter) makes one less alive to the sinning nature of humankind, to one's own sinning nature, and to the significance of the Fall and of sin in God's world.\n \n Personally, that isn't my experience. Indeed, in the Sunday school class I taught (before leaving the country for a while) my largely Young Earth Creationist students ragged me for a very Jamesian, and (they thought) too harsh view of our sinning nature.\n \n I see no necessary inconsistency between TE and the (quite real) unfortunate positions the webpage describes. Indeed, my reading of the page perplexes and disappoints me. It seems, over and over, simply to assert things of this form: If you're a TE, you'll believe this, or, If you're a TE, you won't have a correct view of that, or, If you're a TE, you won't have a sound grasp of such and so.\n \n To be honest, I don't think the AinG page's author has a robust grasp of what it is to be a theistic evolutionist, or of the range of possible beliefs one can have as a TE.\n \n The claim is made of a hard, radical inconsistency between evolutionism and Christian theism.
