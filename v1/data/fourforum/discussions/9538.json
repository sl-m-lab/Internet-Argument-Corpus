   "The medical establishment and evolutionary science are in bed together. Both are crooked to the core. In this post I am going to show that the darwinan medical establishment is corrupt and that they have no intention of curing disease.\n \n And I really hate to rag on the medical community because I believe many in that line of work honestly want to help people. But just like many would-be scientists are hoodwinked at the at the university level by a group of Phds who are left-wing atheists, I believe doctors, as well are hoodwinked by a group of orthodox darwinans. \n \n Doctors get brainwashed much like Hitler brainwashed his fellow Germans. The scientific and medical curriculum is skewed towards only looking at life one way. Both sides of the argument are not presented. So what happens is you have alot of people emerging from school thinking that what they've just learned is the \"truth.\" After a while, this \"truth\" becomes ingrained and they are no longer able to identify with anything that goes against this \"truth.\" This is why doctors laugh and scoff at the idea that diseases can be healed naturally -- because they've been taught otherwise.\n \n See, doctors can't help this laughing and scoffing because they've been taught that diseases -- like every other trait -- just sort of \"happen.\"....They don't occur for any good reason...it's just an unfortunate accident. The darwinian community attributes disease to mutations, which of course happen randomly...and not only do they spring up by accident, but they each have a different drug to treat them. The reality is there is just ONE disease: cellular degeneration. And what causes cellular degeneration? Ultimately, I believe virtually all diseases stem form inflammation. Inflammation can manifest itself differently in different people, and these manifestations are called \"diseases.\" The reality is though, if you're sick you're just experiencing inflammation somewhere in your body.\n \n \n First, though I want to prove to you that there is truly only ONE disease. Did you know that heart disease has been directly linked to prostate cancer? (sorry if the links don't work...they don't seem to be transferring well.)\n \n http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press/2002/September/020915.htm\n \n And of course, it only makes sense that high cholesterol has also been linked to cancer:\n \n http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=60991\n \n Did you know that diabetes is linked with getting cancer?\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/9/26/85959.shtml?s=he\n \n And did you know that depression is linked to IBS?\n \n http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112561151.html\n \n Did you know that Parkinson's disease is linked to depression?\n \n http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/538399/parkinsons_linked_to_depressive_symptoms/index.html?source=r_health\n \n Did you know that MS is linked to Diabetes?\n \n http://www.thisisms.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=275\n \n \n And I could go on forever...I'm just choosing to stop here. \n \n So now we have these, and virtually every other disease no-doubt linked. So what's the common ancestor? Inflammation. If you do just a little bit of research on each of these conditions I just listed, you will find that the root cause is inflammation. And contrary to what the medical establishment says, there is no genetic defect.\n \n So considering virtually every disease is a result of inflammation, is it any wonder that a daily baby aspirin for helps heart conditions?...and the reason this is: aspirin is an anti-inflammatory.\n \n And is it any wonder that that a daily aspirin is also recommended for epilepsy, Alzheimers disease and to ward off many cancers and stroke?\n \n http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=52304\n \n And is it any wonder that asthma is controlled by anti-inflammatory drugs, such as inhaled sterioids?\n \n What about heart disease -- is that caused by inflammation?\n \n If you listened to the medical establishment for the past 3 decades, they'll proclaimed that Heart disease was a result of atherosclerosis or deposits of choleterol in artery walls. But the reality is, heart disease is merely an inflammation of the lining of the arteries...and instead of being a bad guy, cholesterol is just the body's healing response to this inflammation. Of course the medical establishment wont officially admit this, thus millions of people cluelessly remain on cholesterol-lowering drugs...which do little more than ssuuck their money out of their wallets and open them up for more disease. If cholesterol is released by the body as a response to inflammation..how could it be inherently bad? Cholesterol is not the enemy: inflammation is. Stop the inflammation -- stop the Cholesterol.\n \n Parkinson's Disease\n \n As well, if all was on the up and up, Michael J Fox's disease, Parkinsons, would also be proclaimed as an inflammatory disease. Doctors have been known to refer to this disease as \"brain on fire.\" As well, irritable bowel syndrome is nothing but an inflammation of the GI tract.\n \n http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2001/feb2001_report_acam_1.html\n \n \n Prostate cancer is related to BPH, which is the swelling of the prostate -- brought on by inflammation. Is it no wonder that herbs such as Saw Palmetto -- which is an anti-inflammatory are used to control this?\n \n And how many diseases do you know that end in the leters \"itis? Examples: prostatitis, arthritis, bursitis, etc.......there hundreds of them....and almost all of them are chronic and have no medical cure. But these are simply inflammatory diseases that can be controlled or eliminated by controlling inflammation in the body. I know -- I've done it.\n \n And how do you control inflammation of the body?\n \n 3 words: No more sugar.\n \n Sugar fuels the fire within. Without sugar, the the body cools down, is able to repair itself, and healing is allowed to take place. And that's why natural remedies such as herbs, omega 3 oils, and sea vegetables are becoming so popular -- because by eating these healthy foods instead of junk, the body is able to cleanse and cure itself naturallly. \n \n And this is what the medical establishment does not want people to know. Instead, they'd rather persribe drugs so their wallets can continue to be filled with billions and billlions and billions of dollars. It's a scam of epic proportions. And they've scared people by labeling all these different diseases and given them all different names....each, of course, requiring different medications. Meanwhile people keep eating crappy food and they keep getting sicker --- which makes them go in for new and different health conditions. Some people are on dozens of different prescriptions!\n \n Next time you walk into your doctor's office, please notice that there's no literature about how to control inflammation naturally....instead, his walls, magazine racks and end tables are littered with advertisements for expensive drugs. It's all about the money.....and it's money that fuels corruption.\n \n Why are we not told the truth?",

There is a very diverse range of triggers that might cause inflammation, to pin everything on a high quantity of sugar in the blood is drastically simplifying things, this might be one potential cause of inflammation but it certainly isn't the only one as you're ignoring that most of the time inflammation occurs because the immune system is doing its job.",

No more sugar, and inflammation goes away?!?\n \n I see that these guys can be downright dangerous..\n\n \n Well it's a bit more than that....there's the issue of bad fats too...ie omega 6 fats. Ever notice how the Omega 3s in Salmon and flaxseed oil are pushed? ....you know why? Because Omega 3 oils, among other things, have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body.\n \n Why is it so hard to believe that if a diet that's high in sugar leads to inflammatory diseases, that a reduction or elimination of sugar would eliminate or drastically reduce those symptoms?\n \n I'm actually speaking from experience. I didn't dream this stuff up. I've lived it. I used to have a condition called chronic prostatitis...which is an inflammation of the prostate that often happens in young men. This is not a medically curable condition. Doctors often throw antibiotics at it, but most men don't respond to that. As a result there are thousands of men around the country who live in constant, chronic debilitating pain. I used to be one of them. But no longer. I learned the secret, which is to eliminate junk foods and sugars. After just a couple weeks of doing this my constant pain just seemed to evaporate. I have never looked back. \n \n Have you ever noticed how some people seem to always be hot, while some are cold? Some people are just hot natured. Many times older people are cold natured. Do you know why? It's from caloric intake. The more calories one consumes, the hotter the oven gets in your body. Calories are just measurements of heat. heat corresponds with inflammation...inflammation is the source of the problem.",

Go to a household containing people suffering from diabetes (btw. my late grandfather was one), and surprisingly, you will fid that they are also meticulously stocked with sugar (I loved it, there was always candy right in the middle of the living room).\n \n It's all about controlling blood sugar (glucose, specifically) levels, not elimination.\n \n \n Still, I'd suggest starting with something else: like looking up what inflammation is. It's the way the body responds to certain threats. And since the body functions on automatic, this can be problematic - sometimes, the inflammation causes worse damage than the threat it is supposed to counter.\n \n Eliminating junk food and lots of healthy exercise is a great way to improve one's health. But not because \"sugar causes inflammation\" or anything like that. It's because our metabolism is made for a lean diet as found in nature, and the rich bastards we are that don't really work for our food (as much as we used to, when this was still a factor in our evolution), we constantly overeat ourselves. It's like burning dirty fuel instead of refined fuel - lots more soot, and uncontrolled reactions.\n \n In the end, evolution actually enlightens us on the subject, and you try to make it into a sign of conspiracy. Unbelievable...\n\n \n \n Boy, that was a rant that said virtually nothing other than this ridiculous statement:\n \n Eliminating junk food and lots of healthy exercise is a great way to improve one's health. But not because \"sugar causes inflammation\" or anything like that.\n \n http://kid.allrecipes.com/HowTo/Your-Big-New-Threat-Inflammation/detail.aspx\n \n Inflammation is characterized by pain, redness and swelling. If it persists, it's called \"chronic\" inflammation. Besides its well-known role in arthritis, chronic inflammation is a newly recognized factor in heart disease, strokes, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and asthma. \n \n Reduce blood sugar. Foods that spike blood sugar spur inflammation. In new research at Harvard, women who ate foods with the highest glycemic load had nearly twice as much inflammation. Such foods include white potatoes, white rice, white bread, sugar and highly processed cereals. \n \n \n You people are so easy to debate. All you have to do is open your mouth and whatever falls out is wrong and can easily be refuted.\n \n http://autoimmunedisease.suite101.com/blog.cfm/reducing_chronic_inflammation\n \n Current theories suggest that chronic low-grade inflammation is the root source of most chronic disease. Dietary measures can be used to reduce and control inflammation.\n \n Chronic Inflammation\n \n Problems occur when inflammation persists. In chronic low-grade inflammation, the immune system continues to produce inflammatory chemicals. This sets the stage for persistent inflammation. Because inflammation causes swelling and compresses nerves it causes pain and eventually damages tissue. Over time, inflammation leads to chronic disease. Certain foods such as 6-omega oils found in cooking oils, certain carbohydrates particularly refined sugars and white flour, and trans fats found in crackers and bake goods also induce production of these pro-inflammatory compounds. Diets rich in these particular foods also contribute to chronic inflammation. A diet rich in fatty fish and vegetables reduces these effects because omega-3 oils produce other chemical with anti-inflammatory properties that effectively reduce inflammation.\n \n Dietary Measures to Reduce Inflammation\n \n Following a low-glycemic diet that's rich in omega-3 and monounsaturated fats and olive oil but low in omega-6 and saturated fats can reduce inflammation. The Mediterranean diet fits this profile. The best supplements for reducing inflammation include omega-3 fatty acids, curcuminoids in turmeric, garlic, ginger, pomegranate, luteolin, alpha lipoic acid, 5-Loxin, bioflavinoids, vitamin K, vitamin C, and vitamin E. Various vegetables, particularly those low in starch such as broccoli, cauliflower, and salad greens also contain anti-inflammatory compounds. Besides increasing these food sources, the Life Extension Foundation recommends avoiding eating foods cooked at high temperatures\n \n And God siad, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.

You can start right here in this thread.)\n You presented \"Butch\" as an example, but \"Butch\" needed two operations, one well after starting his \"healthy lifestyle.\" I find it truly hypocritical that you can rail against the medical community only to rely upon it when your magical solutions don't work.\n However, if we take the above at mere face value and ignore its context in relation to your other posts, what we have here is the basic approach that most people take: take care of yourself, and when something goes wrong, seek medical attention.\n \n \n \nDrugs should be used a last resort (if at all) -- especially since they don't cure anything anyway.\n\n Not even you could believe this. And that's really saying something.\n \n \nBut meanwhile the patient just gets worse and worse over time.\n\n Lance Armstrong is just having a terrible time now, isn't he? Meanwhile, Butch has needed two brain surgeries and is undergoing regular testing. It's funny that he keeps going back if he believes both that he's totally clean and that doctors can't really help him...\n \n I'll think of you in the same way I think of Kevin Trudeau: I won't wish cancer upon you, but I hope that you practice what you preach should you happen to end up with it.",

   "Evolutionists have got all their eggs in one basket....and that basket is that genes are not affected or cued by their environments. See, they had to proclaim this in order to assert that that life evolved randomly. \n \n But the platform that the neo-darwin mega-structure is built on is collapsing. I'm sure there will always be true believers, no matter what the evidence shows, but scientifically, it doesn't hold water.\n \n \n http://www.mercola.com/2003/jul/12/chiropractic_philosophy.htm\n \n \"...profound philosophical changes are in the air. Leading edge research in cellular and molecular biology is currently offering a radically new understanding of the mechanisms that \"control\" life and evolution. These new findings will inevitably integrate and unify the truths of both biomedical scientists and chiropractors\n \n Conventional medical research has emphasized that genes are the responsible elements \"controlling\" health and disease. It is implied in the Primacy of DNA dogma that genes function as self-regulatory elements. Fundamental to this assumed truth is the requirement that genes must be capable of \"controlling\" their own expression. By definition, genes must be able to switch themselves on and off, as suggested in the concept of a cancer gene \"turning itself on.\" \n \n However, the notion of the Primacy of DNA has been soundly challenged by current research, which reveals that the existence of a self-regulatory property for genes is a patently incorrect assumption. An important article by H. F. Nijhout (Metaphors and the Role of Genes in Development, BioEssays 12:441, 1990) describes how concepts concerning genetic \"controls\" and \"programs\" were originally conceived as a metaphor to help define and direct avenues of research. Widespread repetition of this compelling hypothesis over time has resulted in the \"metaphor of the model\" becoming the \"truth of the mechanism,\" despite the absence of substantiative supporting evidence. \n \n Nijhout elegantly and succinctly redefined the truth as follows, \"When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment, not a self-emergent property of the gene itself, activates expression of that gene (emphasis mine).\" Simply stated, a gene cannot turn itself on or off, it is dependent upon a signal from its environment to control its expression. Genes are indeed involved with the structure and behavior of an organism, however they are not the source of \"control.\" \n \n Gene expression is under the influence of specialized proteins referred to as regulatory proteins. Regulatory proteins bind to DNA and mask the activity of genes. In order to activate a specific gene, its regulatory proteins must be removed from the DNA strand. The binding and release of DNA regulatory proteins is controlled by \"environmental\" signals. Rather than recognizing the Primacy of DNA, it is more correct to acknowledge the Primacy of the Environment as causal in shaping biological expression. \n \n The fact that the cell's nucleus and its enclosed genes do not represent the controlling element or \"brain\" of the cell is easily verified in studies wherein the cell is structurally or functionally enucleated. Cells in such experiments continue to express complex behavioral repertoires and purposeful interactions with their environment and may survive for months despite the absence of functional genes. Consequently, genes can not be invoked to be the source of \"control\" in regulating cell behavior.\"\n \n When put into perspective, the newly emerging view of conventional biomedicine reveals a profound change in fundamental beliefs. The Primacy of DNA is giving way to the Primacy of the Environment. Essentially, conventional science has shifted the source of intelligent control from the internalized genes to the externalized environmental \"signals.\" These regulatory \"environmental\" signals appear to be, in part, related to D. D. Palmer's concept of Universal and Innate Intelligence. \n \n In addition, it has been demonstrated that in response to life experiences, the organism may actively alter \"Innate\" gene programs as a means of mechanical adaptation to perceived environmental conditions. When perception of the environment is biased by the \"educated\" brain, then \"educated\" may bother or worry Innate by selecting inappropriate gene programs and producing disease. Conventional medicine is now recognizing that \"educated\" may also induce a rewriting (mutation) of Innate programs",

   "Supersport, the nucleus is not the brain of the cell. It has many functions, including being the repository of genetic data, but it has no decision making ability.\n \n DNA is rather like a library. When some part of the cell needs information, it is stored there. And it is stored in a specific way: not as a read text, but rather as a half of the whole process needed to use it. Read up a bit on how chemicals are synthesized in the cell, and you'll see the day-to-day role of DNA.\n \n However, parts of a cell function without it. One could remove your brain, but at least for a while, your body would continue functioning, like in the case of Terry Schiavo I'm certain you are familiar with.\n \n Also note that while DNA is the central element of reproduction, there is more to it than just DNA. DNA does not contain the information needed to create a new child on its own. You need a mother's womb to continue the process, too.",

   "You people are so easy to debate. All you have to do is open your mouth and whatever falls out is wrong and can easily be refuted.\n \n <snip<Problems occur when inflammation persists. In chronic low-grade inflammation, the immune system continues to produce inflammatory chemicals. This sets the stage for persistent inflammation. Because inflammation causes swelling and compresses nerves it causes pain and eventually damages tissue. Over time, inflammation leads to chronic disease.\n\n \n Yes, inflammation can cause secondary health problems, and if what you say is true about diet encouraging inflammation, then yes, diet can indirectly contribute to those secondary health problems.\n \n However, that is not the same as diet and inflammation being the root cause of all disease. Inflammation is a response; the fact it can be modulated by diet is neither here nor there: it is triggered in many other ways, including by the diseases you mention - which is why you find inflammation mentioned alongside them. \n \n I think you've just been a bit over-keen to jump to conclusions. Diet promoting inflammation, inflammation causing some secondary diseases and being associated with others as an immune response - there's no logical step from there to where you are.\n \n \nAnd God siad, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.

Mutations are not directed by the environment, but gene expression obviously is (chemically), otherwise we would all be undifferentiated lumps of cells rather than exhibiting macro structure. Also Darwinian evolution isn't random; it's environmentally and sexually directed - only the pool of genetic variation available for selection is generated randomly.\n \n So, just to be clear: evolutionists don't say genes aren't affected or cued by the environment - although the cues are chemical, not conceptual. And they don't say life evolved randomly, they say the variant gene pool available for selection is produced by random peturbation.\n \n Hope that helps.",
