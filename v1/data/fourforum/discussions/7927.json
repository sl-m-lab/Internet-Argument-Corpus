   "Hey im new and this is actually my first post, as side from the intro one I gave. \n \n Anyways, I believe Global Warming is a crock. But I would like to say temperature readings are actually increasing in some areas! Wait a min that sounds like I was contradicting myself... Well let me elaborate. Allot of the temperature readings are taken at places like airports, which have allot of concrete and heavy machinery around. Those two factors alone cause a huge rise in temperature, which will distort these readings. In order to get accurate readings temperatures must be taken by other means, like weather balloons. \n \n Hey you guys want to know something amazing? The weather balloons that they use for this purpose show a very low rise in temperature if any.\n \n Therefore we can only conclude that the earth is not getting warmer at an alarming rate. \n \n And even if it was... So what! I mean really do you think that we are the cause of it? I doubt it. Friends, the earth is not, by any means as weak as some people would have you believe. It can take our cars and anything else we throw at it.\n \n Umm... this is interesting. My dad just came in and told me about an article that was aired on Toronto's CFRB radio station. The article said that when we go out and burn a quart of wood for a fire we actually put so much pollution into the air that a SUV would have to drive around the world a couple of times in order to even compare!!! can you imagine if there was ever a forest fire!!! man the world would pretty much just blow up! Again people, the Earth can take it. \n \n Also, here's another interesting fact, when a volcano explodes it produces more pollution then all of the cars ever produced. I mean EVER, from the days of Nicolas Cugnot in 1769 to now.\n \n Also in relation to rising water levels. Reality states that unfortunately there are rising water levels.... However, there are descending water levels! And they pretty much balance each other out. there's places like Tonga have risen 29.1% over a 65 month period, but places like Tuvalu have decreased 34.3% over a 62 month period. \n \n But you see people the problem is that environmentalist wackos would have you believe other wise. My point is, we know very little about what's going on, and our elected officials are attempting to create half fast solutions to a situation that may very well be false problem, i.e. Kyoto. (Remember im from Canada, God bless America!) These attempts are just to make them self's look appealing at election time. Why does this make them look good? Because people believe the environmentalist wackos and they're outrageous clams, so the government thinks it has to throw money at a made up disaster. \n \n Also the facts and our scientist even dissociate them self's from this man made global warming myth and look more to natural fluctuation. \n \n Therefore if you're going to point to point a finger, pointed it at Mother Nature. But on the other hand she probably knows what she's doing so why point a finger at all?\n \n lol Sorry guys i went on alittle rate didn't i. O well i tend to do that, anyways theres some good stuff in there.",

   "Those \"enviromental whackos\" may be extremist and even misguided but why trust those who have a monetary stake in disproving global warming? Can you see how this meteor theory is so difficult to substantiate as to be perfect for clouding the issue for who knows how long. Perfect if you are in the fossil fuel business. I'd bet they're begging to fund his research.\n\n \n It's a little more complicated then that. Are they really out to disprove Global warming, or are they looking for alternative reasons for possibly temperature rises? There are several theories out there, and it appears that liberals choose to accept Human interference. Why? because environmentalist have blown up this particular theory because it point figures at us, when this happens the public wants hasty action and the liberals ease their guilt by throwing money at programs such a Kyoto. \n \n That meteor theory is just one explanation. Jim's four periods of Glaciations is another. By reading and understanding these other Theories can we only get to the truth. We'll never get there by fallowing one theory favoured by politicians and making it as blind fact or by making accusations like the world is going to over heat in 10 years (Al Gore)",

However, I have long been skeptical of comparisons made on the basis of two pictures of snow covered mountains. The glacier pictures are more telling. The snow pictures could have been made in exceptional years...one with exceptionally little snow and one with exceptionally heavy snow.\n \n As to the cause, I suspect we are somewhat at fault. However, I also believe it is a naturally occuring thing that we are simply speeding up. We're due for a non Ice Age melting of the polar caps in about 50,000 years. Then we'll have about 200,000 years without ice caps and then another freezing period. All IMHO of course.",
