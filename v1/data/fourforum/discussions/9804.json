   "You can only curtail violence by addressing the cause of the violence not the manner in which it was carried out. \n \n People that are trying to implement gun control and bans are probably the most ignorant lot of political activist crazies we have here in the USA. I say ignorant not to insult people but as an accurate statement of their level of knowledge about the true nature of what they are trying to accomplish and about firearms in general. \n \n Your typical anti-gun person is passion driven, non-gun owning, well to do upper-middle class, sheltered and high strung. Soccer mom's and Metro-sexual's for the most part. Born and raised in suburbia in a sheltered community with a blind eye to the real world. Cookie cutter people with cookie cutter lives that alleviate their tremendous boredom by backing some cause or another so as to give themselves the illusion that they are doing some good in the world when in fact their lifestyle is going to cause more pain and suffering and death to the world through destruction of the environment then any gun ever could. \n \n Guns are not the problem. End of Story. Whenever there is a tragedy of some kind everyone is looking for someone or something to blame. If the perpetrator of the crime is dead... that's not enough. There has to be some justice of some kind to placate the masses. The people demand it! So where do people set their focus? Certainly not on themselves for ignoring the plight of American society and poverty and lack of funds for things like treatment for the mentally ill, better education and the like. NOOOOOO! They want to focus on something more convenient. The gun must be to blame!!! Ya.. That's it. Everyone gang up and parade the likeness of the victims behind your misdirected cause and march like lemmings over the cliff of reason into the bottomless pit of ignorant bliss. \n \n It's just like the supposed \"War on Drugs\". The Government has spent Billions on stomping out drugs of all kinds and in the end all we have is more chaos. We have jails full of drug offenders and streets full of drugs and a quirk that was once a somewhat harmless vice of society has become a full-blown epidemic. People failed to address the real issues and focused on an object.\n \n Same aspect with gun violence. Society fails to see or outright ignores the real causes. \n \n For instance, I own several Guns. I hope I never have to use them outside of target shooting and hunting but am prepared to do so if necessary. There are other people out there who don't share my sense and reason and would see the same guns as a tool to take advantage of others or cause them harm. But you don't need a gun for that. If there were no guns those same people would use other weapons, or make bombs. You could just Google up how to make a pipe bomb, make 20-30 of them and have a blast. That weapon in the same settings as the VT shooting would have probably caused more death. He could have opened a door, Tossed in a pipe bomb and closed the door... move on to the next room... rinse and repeat. Someone good with a sword could do just a much damage. A sword doesn't go BOOM so you could rack up quite a mess before anyone knew what was going on. \n \n My point is... People like the VT shooter can snap, taking away 1 tool of dealing death will only see it replaced by another. In the case of firearms you do more harm then good by taking away the most effective means of defense a person can carry. Instead of focusing on the tools why can't people focus on the root issues. Mass murderers are usually mentally deranged. Wouldn't it be a better use of the taxpayers money to work toward identifying those with severe mental issues and helping them get treated rather then just taking away one of the many possible tools they could use when they finally snap. Someone shoots a Gas Station clerk in a robbery. Instead of spending millions on enforcing new gun laws to slightly reduce the chance that that robber might have gotten the gun he used. Why not put the millions of dollars into civil action and education programs that would help that kind of person that is desperate enough to rob the store get a better life. Most do that sort of crime out of need and desperation. Some just do it for fun, those people have a warped sense of right and wrong and need help getting that straightened out though some method. \n \n You cannot have a utopia without the means to defend it. People must have the right to defend themselves and their homes. They must have the means to protect freedom from tyranny if needs be. \n \n The statement \"Guns don't Kill People, People Kill People\" says a great deal and is one of the most truthful quotes of all time. A man determined to kill another man will use a gun if he has one, if not then the next best thing, A good blade. If not that then a pointy stick. If not that then a rock. You cannot stop violence by eliminating the tools of violence. Or even reduce it for that matter. You have to address the causes where you can. Mankind is violent in nature so you will never stop all violence. By you can curtail a great deal of it by working with people and helping yourself and others lead a good life. \n \n This whole gun debate is not about the guns. It's about that people think guns cause. And in truth guns are not the cause. Owning a gun does not make me want to use it against someone. Just because I can doesn't mean I will. Address the reasons that cause people to want to use the available tools for destructive means and you can make the world a better place.",

You can punish people for doing stupid things on drugs just like drunk drivers get punished (some places anyway). \n \n I happen to think that you cannot save everyone. Drugs (starting them anyway) are a choice, like drinking and smoking. Let them be legal and then we all know who the adicts are when they show up to get their supply. Let the adicts be adicts. They will destroy their own lives and leave others unharmed (for the most part) by their actions. Eventually that element would diminish as the hardcore adicts OD and die off.

As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit.

This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.\n \n Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.\n \n \nThey will destroy their own lives and leave others unharmed (for the most part) by their actions.

   "I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit.\n\n \n Yes, absolutly right. They do. But why? \n Getting high does not constitute automatic crime as the media and polititions would have you believe. You don't just snort some coke and automatically decide to rob someone. \n \n The crime generally comes from desperation. Desperation for getting the next fix. The desperation exists because the drug of choice is very dificult to obtain due to it's cost and availability. Desperate people do desperate things. Take out the desperation and you take out the crime. \n \n Think of Cigaretes. Cigaretes are just as physically adictive as some of the harder drugs. It's been said by medical scientists that Cigaretes are as hard if not harder to kick then Heroin. I've known some people who have been on Heroin and it's a nightmare to watch. \n \n Now if Cigaretes are so hard and terrible. Why is it that we never hear of \"Cigarete related Crime\"? How come noone kills anyone else over this adiction? How come you never hear of someone robbing a store for cigarete money? \n \n Because this drug is relativly inexpensive and widly available. Getting the next fix is not a desperate thing because in a tight spot with no money for the next fix most poeple don't have to look far to \"bum\" a smoke from someone and feed the craving. The desperation disapeares at this point.\n \n Getting High is done for it's own sake. If you want to eliminate the Gun crime that permiates from drug related issues (which is substantial in the USA) you must target the desperation that causes the crime. \n \n The end result that people abhore is the pain and loss that comes from the crime. People look to place blame for their loss. They place the blame on Drugs and Guns. But those are just objects. The objects did not commit or cause the crime. It takes a person to cause a crime. They commited the crime for a reason. Most times the reason is desperation. \n \n In order to reduce the crime that we all abhore you must attack the desperation. You cannot curtail supply and demand, you cannot totally eliminate drugs, new ones will replace them. You cannot eliminate weapons like guns, new ones will replace them. You must focus on the real cause. The desparation in people that commit crimes that results from the circumstances of their lives. Address those issues by working with people and their addictions. Not squashing them under foot and sending them to jail which ruins any change of betterment for them. Take the money from the war on drugs and the money spent enforcing drug laws and put it into social action programs that will treat the people not the object. \n \n Annother option if to research the nature of adiction. If someone were to create a treatment that could instantly and compleatly cure the craving of adiction and remove the need for the next fix. The desperation would also be removed. That would at least drop the drug related crime through the floor. Instead of sending people to jail for useing hard drugs, treat them for adiction. Try to help the person be a productive member of society and not just annother life long criminal going from one desperate situation to annother. \n \n The other side of the coin is greed. Selling is profitable because it's risky. Demand is low, supply is high. Being a supplier is very risky. With so much money and risk people also get desperate in these situations. Being that people doing this are allready willing to violate the law... crime breeds out of this as well. Dealers shooting eachother over teritory and supplies. It's a risky game where the penelties are death and jail for screwing up. Desperation and the human need for self preservation here drive even more crime. \n \n And this whole thing is all because our leaders decided to treat the object and not the root causes. Because objects are easier to put in a campaign slogan and more tanjable for stiring up the masses.",

The effects of nicotine, both positive and negative, are mild in comparison to heroin and the self-administering of powerful opiates is idiotic to say the least. \n \n The effect of widely available, currently illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin would lead to more deaths due to interaction and overdose (which you do not usually get with alcohol and cigarettes) and would not logically reduce crime since violent offenders are often under the influence of illegal drugs when they commit their offenses, leading one to believe that such powerful drugs are an influence on undesirable behavior.\n \n \nGetting High is done for it's own sake.

I read something that struck me about this... I'm trying to remember. It went something like: \"Without their armies and machines they were not monsters but only little boys...\". Certainly removing the means does not solve the problem by itself but it is a justifiable goal just the same.\n \n Yes, drugs and guns, by themselves, are not to blame. It is desires of the people who use these objects that are to blame. However, the nature of our laws is not to change people, it is to change behavior.\n \n \n\n And this whole thing is all because our leaders decided to treat the object and not the root causes.

We know from the last 30 years in this country that these ideas are badly flawed and do not work. It's nothing but \"feel good\" ploitics. \n \n I believe that every law abiding American head of household should be required to own and maintain a firearm. Places in the world where this mentality exist have virtualy no violent crime at all. As well as several towns in America where this practice is a law. As far as criminals getting guns. It's gonna happen one way or the other. I'd rather have a fighting chance personally. \n \n \nWith such a high correlation, however, I would not rule out causation.

I'm not advocating that you try illegal drugs mind you but it's a bit difficult to make a determination like that without the experience to back it up. I like my take on this better. It comes from real world experience, some personal and some second hand. \n \n \nWhich is why gun control and drug laws are not as effective as they possibly could be.\n\n \n They can never be effective for one simple reason.

The laws you would put in place only serve to hurt the people who obey the laws.

They have been with us for thousands of years. We do know however that what our country is doing is not working and we also know that as laws get tougher the crime gets worse. Laws are not the answer. \n \n Also one of the things I'm trying to get at: \n \n Heroin and other very hard and very dangerous drugs should not be in stores or anything like that. Society should also stop focusing on the drug. Eliminate heroin and someone will invent something more addictive and more dangerous. Focus on the Social problems that get people into doing heroin and work with that. It's not 100% effective but it's all you can do without causing nasty side effects. \n \n As far as lighter drugs... LSD, POT, X, Magic Mushrooms, and a few other relativly harmless drugs that are made out to be killers. These should be Legal, Sold and taxed. \n \n Amsterdam legalized Pot and saw a huge drop in the use of things like heroin and cocane. Also a huge drop in violent crime.",

It takes 2 minutes tops to murder a house full of people and rob the place. And people know this. As a result they live in fear and ignorance.

   "You can only curtail violence by addressing the cause of the violence not the manner in which it was carried out. \n \n People that are trying to implement gun control and bans are probably the most ignorant lot of political activist crazies we have here in the USA. I say ignorant not to insult people but as an accurate statement of their level of knowledge about the true nature of what they are trying to accomplish and about firearms in general. \n \n Your typical anti-gun person is passion driven, non-gun owning, well to do upper-middle class, sheltered and high strung. Soccer mom's and Metro-sexual's for the most part. Born and raised in suburbia in a sheltered community with a blind eye to the real world. Cookie cutter people with cookie cutter lives that alleviate their tremendous boredom by backing some cause or another so as to give themselves the illusion that they are doing some good in the world when in fact their lifestyle is going to cause more pain and suffering and death to the world through destruction of the environment then any gun ever could.\n\n What are you basing this on? The surveys I've seen that show that women, blacks, and minority groups are more likely to support gun control. People living in poor inner city neighborhoods are more likely to support gun control. \n \n \n\n Guns are not the problem. End of Story. Whenever there is a tragedy of some kind everyone is looking for someone or something to blame. If the perpetrator of the crime is dead... that's not enough. There has to be some justice of some kind to placate the masses. The people demand it! So where do people set their focus? Certainly not on themselves for ignoring the plight of American society and poverty and lack of funds for things like treatment for the mentally ill, better education and the like. NOOOOOO! They want to focus on something more convenient. The gun must be to blame!!! Ya.. That's it. Everyone gang up and parade the likeness of the victims behind your misdirected cause and march like lemmings over the cliff of reason into the bottomless pit of ignorant bliss. \n \n It's just like the supposed \"War on Drugs\". The Government has spent Billions on stomping out drugs of all kinds and in the end all we have is more chaos. We have jails full of drug offenders and streets full of drugs and a quirk that was once a somewhat harmless vice of society has become a full-blown epidemic. People failed to address the real issues and focused on an object.\n \n Same aspect with gun violence. Society fails to see or outright ignores the real causes. \n \n For instance, I own several Guns. I hope I never have to use them outside of target shooting and hunting but am prepared to do so if necessary. There are other people out there who don't share my sense and reason and would see the same guns as a tool to take advantage of others or cause them harm. But you don't need a gun for that. If there were no guns those same people would use other weapons, or make bombs. You could just Google up how to make a pipe bomb, make 20-30 of them and have a blast. That weapon in the same settings as the VT shooting would have probably caused more death. He could have opened a door, Tossed in a pipe bomb and closed the door... move on to the next room... rinse and repeat. Someone good with a sword could do just a much damage. A sword doesn't go BOOM so you could rack up quite a mess before anyone knew what was going on. \n \n My point is... People like the VT shooter can snap, taking away 1 tool of dealing death will only see it replaced by another. In the case of firearms you do more harm then good by taking away the most effective means of defense a person can carry. Instead of focusing on the tools why can't people focus on the root issues. Mass murderers are usually mentally deranged. Wouldn't it be a better use of the taxpayers money to work toward identifying those with severe mental issues and helping them get treated rather then just taking away one of the many possible tools they could use when they finally snap. Someone shoots a Gas Station clerk in a robbery. Instead of spending millions on enforcing new gun laws to slightly reduce the chance that that robber might have gotten the gun he used. Why not put the millions of dollars into civil action and education programs that would help that kind of person that is desperate enough to rob the store get a better life. Most do that sort of crime out of need and desperation. Some just do it for fun, those people have a warped sense of right and wrong and need help getting that straightened out though some method. \n \n You cannot have a utopia without the means to defend it. People must have the right to defend themselves and their homes. They must have the means to protect freedom from tyranny if needs be. \n \n The statement \"Guns don't Kill People, People Kill People\" says a great deal and is one of the most truthful quotes of all time. A man determined to kill another man will use a gun if he has one, if not then the next best thing, A good blade. If not that then a pointy stick. If not that then a rock. You cannot stop violence by eliminating the tools of violence. Or even reduce it for that matter. You have to address the causes where you can. Mankind is violent in nature so you will never stop all violence. By you can curtail a great deal of it by working with people and helping yourself and others lead a good life. \n\n Why is it when you defend yourself the type of weapon you have does matter? You say recognize a gun as being \"the most effective means of defense a person can carry\" But when it comes to killing people all weapons are equally effective- whether it be a gun, a rock or a pointy stick. \n \n And if it's as easy to kill a person with a pointy stick as with a gun then the US Army could save a lot of money by arming its soldiers with pointy sticks.",

   "...And if it's as easy to kill a person with a pointy stick as with a gun then the US Army could save a lot of money by arming its soldiers with pointy sticks.\nThat's the way it was before the invention of gunpowder. Spears, swords, arrows, darts, pointy sticks...none can reach out and touch someone like a well aimed bullet driven by the gases of exploding powder through a rifled barrel of sufficient length, straightness and consistent caliber.\n \n Prior to this (the invention of gunpowder), I doubt there were any successful efforts to legally control the possession of pointy sticks and stuff. Oh, I'm sure the conquering armies often took the weapons of their defeated foes, but those foes made some more weapons and fought again. Swords were beat into plowshares and back into swords depending on the needs of the locals.\n \n Even long after the invention of gunpowder, the Mexicans, desirous of remaining free, beat the snot out the French infantry with hoes and a herd of cattle.

Spears, swords, arrows, darts, pointy sticks...none can reach out and touch someone like a well aimed bullet driven by the gases of exploding powder through a rifled barrel of sufficient length, straightness and consistent caliber.\n \n Prior to this (the invention of gunpowder), I doubt there were any successful efforts to legally control the possession of pointy sticks and stuff. Oh, I'm sure the conquering armies often took the weapons of their defeated foes, but those foes made some more weapons and fought again. Swords were beat into plowshares and back into swords depending on the needs of the locals.\n \n Even long after the invention of gunpowder, the Mexicans, desirous of remaining free, beat the snot out the French infantry with hoes and a herd of cattle. Sergeant York (as played by Gary Cooper) single-handedly obtained the surrender of hundreds of Germans by picking some of them off (killing them) one at a time as if he were at a turkey shoot...so his one well-aimed rifle saved a load of people by serving as his own personal killing tool...used from a relatively great distance. The \"One Shot-One Dead Terrorist\" thread that I was maligned for posting demonstrates the surgical capabilities of the modern rifle in the hands of a true sharpshooter.\n \n How dare you even suggest the army go back to pointy sticks. It's how you use the gun that counts.\n\n I began that sentence with \"And if...\" so it doesn't follow that I was suggesting that the army go back to pointy sticks.

   "What are you basing this on? The surveys I've seen that show that women, blacks, and minority groups are more likely to support gun control. People living in poor inner city neighborhoods are more likely to support gun control.\n\n \n I don't intend this as an isult of any kind to the pople you outlined but the women, blacks, and minority groups opinion you are basing you're statment on is for the most part un-educated and passion driven. If in an inner city neighborhood all you see is shooting and killing day to day it's natural to work up an irrational passion against guns. Just because a large number of people have the same opinion about a subject does not make that opinion correct in any way. Allot of people use to think the world was flat. Minorities also refuse to believe that their own comunities are the problem for the crime. They are the cause of their own issues. There is such a culture of \"Blaming the Man\" in this country that people refuse to take action and better themselves and their community. The problems of crime and gun violence are Social not physical. Guns are physical. Also I might add that such survay's also include the opinion of gang members and criminals. Those types of people LOVE gun control. Makes it safer for them to do what they do. \n \n \n \n \nWhy is it when you defend yourself the type of weapon you have does matter? You say recognize a gun as being \"the most effective means of defense a person can carry\" But when it comes to killing people all weapons are equally effective- whether it be a gun, a rock or a pointy stick.\n\n \n WOW... talk about missing the point.... \n \n Lets take a look at History for this one. \n \n The Battle of Hastings 1066 A.D. \n Norman Army: \n 6000 men at arms with the melee weapons of the time. \n \n Saxon Army: \n 4000 Men at arms with the Melee Weapon of the Time (said to be some of the best fighters in all of Europe at that time) \n \n Casualties: \n estimated 6000 dead total on both sides. \n \n So out of just 10000 men that Took the field of battle, 6000 died. \n \n 60% loss of life in battle. \n \n Many large scale mideval battles like this one show 40-60% dead.\n \n Lets look at a War with Firearms\n \n The Union armies had 2,750,000 men.\n Battle deaths: 110,070 \n \n The Confederate strength was 1,250,000.\n Battle deaths: 94,000 \n \n Total Men = 4,000,000\n Dead in Battle = 204,070\n \n 5% loss of life in battle\n \n % of battle deaths against the # of participating soldiers in modern warfare is far lower in most all cases. \n \n Food for thought.",

If we legalize drugs then the availability will go up and the price will come down, therefore crime will be reduced.\n \n There are a couple of flaws in your logic. First of all, not all of the crime caused by drug users is just theft to get there next fix. Some, more than just a little, of it is violent crime that has nothing to do with theft that is caused by various effects of various drugs (paranoia, sense of invincibility, excessive uncontrolled energy, increased violent tendencies in general). Making drugs legal would not decrease any of this.\n \n Secondly, what makes you think that if drugs were made legal that they still wouldn't be tightly controlled and prices kept high?

He has a history of first assuming a result and then creating studies using deliberately small and target skewed sampling to prove the point he wants to make. This 1998 study in particular demonstrated blatantly biased methodology. He had at his disposal several years of nationwide data, both urban and rural to choose from, and he samples only 626 events from only three cities. Now I can easily name ten incidents I know of where a homeowner brandished a firearm to run off an intruder. I can then tell you of only one of the incidents I know of where a firearm was used to take a relative's life in a home, and from my statistics I can conclude that a gun is 10 times more likely to be used in self defense than to commit a domestic homicide. My \"study\" would be as biased and worthless as Kellerman's. \n \n This 1998 study is not the only time Kellerman has engaged in questionable statistical sampling. His most famous study-- the one in which he used approximately 300 shootings to conclude that a gun in the home was 41 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder--was removed from Brady Campaign publications after it was exposed as a fraudulent study. Kellerman's research is akin to arriving at a crowded cocktail party and looking over the heads of all the guests for the few friends he recognizes huddled together in the corner. His studies do not reflect what I have experienced. The vast majority of defensive gun use does not involve a homicide. \n \n Yes, I believe I can fight fire with fire. I agree with your statement that guns will always be circulated easily. With that in mind, I would prefer to be armed and prepared to fight fire with fire than be unarmed and forced to fight fire with say, a handful of straw. I've been threatened with death more than once before, and I have resolved to be armed and prepared should anyone ever attempt to act on their threats.\n \n No knowledgeable self-defense expert will recommend using a knife to hunt down an intruder over taking a stand in an easily defended area of your house with a firearm. \n \n I disagree with a frozen in time approach to civil liberties. If this view prevailed, then my bloging would be limited to a printing press, and my political speech would be limited to the reach of my voice from the top of an overturned soapbox.\n \n Your proposal for mandatory safety training would address the extraordinarily rare occurrence of accidental firearm death, but would have no impact on the rate of intentional firearm-involved homicides. Are there any other gun control measures you would support which would address that concern?\n \n Do you agree or disagree with the statement that the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual RKBA?",

   "That should read \"21\" not \"41\" times in my previous post. Darned typewriter gremlins....\n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn.\" Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n \"Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms.\" V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n \"Pick a night and cordon off a section of South Dallas. Send hundreds of police officers--however many it would take-into the area to 'vacuum it up.' Shake down everybody on the street. Search every house and apartment. Confiscate all drugs and weapons.\" Ross Perot, The Washington Post, June 6, 1992.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent.

   "Actually, Unriggable, I didn't need to look it up. I've seen the \"43 times more likely\" claim before. It's Kellermann's as well, and it comes from an article of his published in 1986. For anyone who is interested, here is the cite for it: \n \n \"Protection or peril? An analysis of firearms related deaths in the home.\" (New Engl J Med 1986. 314: 1557-60.) Arthur Kellermann and Don Reay, authors. \n \n This is another predetermined outcome oriented study. Kellermann cherry picked 389 gun deaths for this one. His chosen time frame was 1978 to 1983, and his chosen population base was King County, Washington. There were an extremely abnormal number of firearm-involved suicides in King County during that time (suicides accounted for 333 of the 389 deaths he used, in fact) which assisted him in creating this fantasy figure. \n \n You indicate you are in favor of gun control, Unriggable, and when I asked you listed a proposed regulation for mandatory safety training you would favor. I recognize your belief that this would reduce unintentional firearm deaths. I would oppose such a law. I'll willingly talk with you about why if you want, but I don't believe accidental deaths is the primary focus of the \"gun control\" movement. In my experience in talking with supporters of gun control it is the intentional criminal misuse of firearms which is the primary evil they allege a desire to eradicate. With that in mind, let me ask you a few more questions: \n \n As a supporter of gun control, do you believe that our current regulatory scheme is sufficient? If not, then what new gun control laws would you propose, and why?\n \n I'd really like to talk about the merits of Gun Control with you, Unriggable. I believe that the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual RKBA, but I do not believe the RKBA should be absolute and unrestricted. I also believe that part of talking rationally with someone about gun control is understanding their position. This is why I ask you questions, Unriggable. But don't think I am the only one who can do so. Ask away if you want to understand where I come from on this issue. \n \n ---\n \n \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . . .\" Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87 (February 6, 1788).\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave.

That way, it would be easier to link crimes to the criminals who used the guns since there is a database. Besides, no reason for guns on the go, anybody can wait a month or so.\n\n \n Thanks for responding, Unriggable. Let me address the points you raise....\n \n I'm going to disagree with the idea that mandatory locks would deter gun thefts. Locks are designed primarily as a safety measure to prevent an unauthorized person (such as a child) from firing a gun. They are not designed to deter a thief, who once he has stolen the gun can take as long as he wants to cut the lock. Therefore, I a disagree that mandatory locks would create a theft deterrent. \n \n I also see no valid reason to force otherwise law abiding individuals to wait when purchasing a firearm. The claim that a waiting period deters crimes of sudden passion has always been a sham argument. The instant check system has been used for over a decade now, and there have been no reported increases in crimes committed with a gun purchased on the spur of the moment. Therefore, I see no justification for restricting access to a fundamental right when it serves no legitimate purpose.\n \n Now a permit/registration scheme is an interesting issue which comes with a few problems. The first problem would be the potential for massive passive resistance to a registration or permit scheme, like what we have seen in Canada. In my opinion it would be impossible to construct a permit or registration scheme that would cover the vast secondary (individual to individual \"street\" sales) market. The only way to enforce a permit or registration scheme would be to criminalize it and prosecute persons who get caught with a gun they did not register or did not obtain a permit for. This may be fine and good in the abstract, but in reality it would have no impact on fighting gun crime other than to make inadvertent criminals out of otherwise law-abiding gun owners.\n \n I say this because there will be a number of people who would be exempt from a permit or registration requirement. Convicted murderers, rapists, robbers, home burglars, child sexual offenders, or indeed any other convicted felon would be exempt. Also exempt would be convicted stalkers, persons found guilty of domestic violence, and persons previously involuntarily committed to a mental health institution for either past violence or the potential for future violence. We talk all the time about keeping guns out of these \"wrong\" hands, and these are the very people who would be immune from prosecution for refusing to submit to a mandatory permit or registration scheme. Here's why: \n \n It is a crime for these persons to possess a firearm. If the state mandates that they announce their possession of a firearm through obtaining permits or registering firearms then it forces them to incriminate themselves in violation of their 5th. Amendment right. \n \n This has been tried before. In 1968 Congress enacted a number of firearm restrictions under the title of the National Firearms Act. The NFA contained a mandatory firearm possession registration scheme; which required all persons to register possession of and be taxed on their possession of certain classes of firearms Congress determined were being used principally by persons engaged in unlawful activities. The registration scheme was enforced by two new criminal statutes: 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841 made it a crime for failure to register possession of a particular type of firearm, and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851 made it a crime to possess an unregistered firearm. SCOTUS declared that prosecutions for a violation of these registration requirements was unconstitutional because registration compelled self-incrimination--See Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968). Now we could try to avoid the constitutional challenge by calling it a \"permit\" scheme instead, but SCOTUS looks at the application of a law and not the title Congress gives it when deciding constitutionality, and a mandatory \"permit\" scheme is equivalent to a registration scheme in both its requirement of self-incrimination and its purpose of establishing a nationwide database.\n \n Therefore, I would oppose a permit/registration scheme because it would punish the innocent while ignoring the guilty. \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",

It takes about three minutes for a car to arrive at the door, barely any time for a theif or anybody to snag a bunch of items and run off with them.\n\n \n If you have a 3 minute police response time that is pretty good. The nationwide average for urban areas is 11 minutes. Of course, the response time is logged from the tame the call is dispatched, which does not come until after the operator is done, so you have to factor in 2.5 minutes for that (average 911 call from answer to dispatch is 2 minutes 27 seconds) Of course you have to keep in mind that the response tiem is based on the call, and odds are you are not going to call as the guy is breaking in...more likely your intruder will have been in the house for some time. \n \n To me that matters very little anyway because i don't live in an urban area. One time I had to call the police and it took them nearly 40 minutes to arrive. We have 5 officers that cover 778 square miles. There is almost never more than 2 officers on shift at a time, and if they happen to be on the other end of the county, you are pretty much screwed. \n \n Gun locks are designed to keep kids from playing with guns. They are pretty flimsy protection against an adult. Cable locks (the most popular) are easily cut with a pair of side cutters. That is one of their appeals...if you loose the key you can just snip the cable. Trigger locks are slighly more secure, but you can still clamp it in a vice and they pop right apart with a pipe wrench. I have done it more than once when friends have come down to hunt and realized once they got here that they left the key to their gun lock at home. The exception is the smith and wesson trigger locks. Those pop off if you hit the bottom with a rock.",

   "There are two points to address with the mandatory gun locks deterrent argument. The first is whether a mandatory law would deter home burglaries to begin with, and the second is whether they would help prevent or deter gun theft in the event of a burglary.\n \n In my opinion a mandatory trigger lock law would not deter burglaries from occurring. Guns are stolen because they are portable, concealable, and have a high street value. So are TV's, DVD players, jewelry, keys to the spare car, prescription drugs, computers, etc. Burglars know we are not locking these things up, and they know they are far more likely to find these items of value in a break-in anyway. Mandatory locks designed to prevent burglars from stealing only one of 20 or more types of coveted items does not in my opinion deter the burglary from occurring. \n \n Would a mandatory trigger lock law then help prevent gun thefts from a burglary? I don't think they would. Locks do not affect the portability of firearms-and a thief can take the gun quickly from the larceny scene to another, safer location where he can work on breaking it at leisure. \n \n On the question of gun safes, they can be broken into as well, but they are far better at preventing gun loss if a burglary occurs than trigger locks. Burglars are not typically armed with the tools necessary to defeat a gun safe. If the thief does show up with the tools to \"crack\" a gun safe, then he must be prepared to spend a great deal of time exposing himself to capture at the crime scene while \"cracking\" it. The alternative is for the thief to draw attention to himself by showing up with the necessary equipment to move and transport such a heavy and difficult to conceal object. When gun safes are defeated it typically comes in break-ins where the burglar knows the home owner will be away for several days and he can take his time drilling out the lock. \n \n On the question of police response times, I believe a three minute average is too optimistic. I have seen calls responded to that quickly, but they are a lucky few. Everything has to fall in place perfectly-an unoccupied officer has to happen to be nearby when the call comes in. If we rely on the police alone then we have to pray that when we call 911 those officers are not already several miles away at another call fighting to arrest a drunk who beat his wife. It is a very rare event for officers to arrive quickly enough at a home burglary to catch the thief \"in the act.\"\n \n ---\n And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim. Cicero , Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n Defense of habitation and justifiable self-defense overlap in the \"castle doctrine\" which states that one may, without retreating, use force, to include deadly force if necessary, to keep aggressors out of his own house. This part of the castle doctrine is one aspect of defense of habitation. . . . [T]he justification exists in the curtilage as well as the castle. Roger D. Groot, Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia 114 (3rd ed. 1994)",

It takes about three minutes for a car to arrive at the door, barely any time for a theif or anybody to snag a bunch of items and run off with them.\n\n \n Ok so let's say for a moment I am a member of the working poor with just a few items of value and I live in a poor neighborhood riddled with crime. Let's say I keep an old handgun for home protection because not only can a whole lot of violence happen to my family by a criminal in three minutes, being the high crime area I live in the cops are usually too busy anyway to arrive even close to three minutes away.\n So I would need this handgun for defense in a dangerous neighborhood and I am living paycheck to paycheck with just enough money for rent and my family to eat and you want a law that would make me buy an expensive safe for my defensive handgun or else give it up?\n \n Many gun control laws are racist or hurt the less fortunate minorities the most and they are often the ones which need guns the most for lawful self defense.\n \n By the way my brother lives in a poor neighborhood of Baltimore city and he called the cops on house theives which were actively breaking into the house accross the street. The cops arrived in three hours and didn't even get out of the car. The next day they came back for a report.\n The same brother living in the same place used to have a burglar alarm system. The thieves not only were able to break in and have plenty of time to rob his house, they stole the burglar alarm system. They sometimes arrive in three minutes for a violent crime in the act, but for theft or burglary they simply don't in most areas. A determined thief will often have plenty of time.\n \n A safe makes it harder for theives to get away with guns, but it is foolhardy to think it will stop the determined. Also it is wrong to expect all gun owners to afford a safe if there is a law passed making them have one so that only the rich or the elite can have guns.",
