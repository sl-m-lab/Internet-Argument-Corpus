   "Well, in an area frequented by tornadoes, living with a concrete shelter is a good idea, but it still isn't exactly safe. A man can live and survive in Antarctica, and may even have top of the line equipment to survive the cold and the storms. But man was obviously not meant to live there.\n \n Really, you can't blame God for natural disasters. There are so many other things to think about first. New Orleans wasn't exactly the best city to live in considering it was practically built in the sea. Now look what happened. Near the sea, floods, hurricanes ect, I wouldn't look to the sky and blame God for the destruction of my house, I would probably be kicking myself for going there in the first place.\n \n I think Simone is trying to lay the blame for natural disasters on God because she doesn't like him. On the other hand, she is actually putting the responsbility for the good things in his hands as well if she wants her arguement to make sense. Indirectly, she is making him look more powerful and look more like one to be feared instead of being blamed for the bad things happening and not praised when good things happen.\n \n Plus, the responsbility for natural disaster care and prevention does lie in part with us. Consider this. A 6 year old boy has a mother who is perfectly healthy. Out of the blue she has a heart attack and passes out. Happens all the time. The scared and crying boy immediately calls 911 and tells the police about it. The officer on the line thinks the kid is a prankster and is trying to play a trick on the cops. Therefore, the officer ignores the boy and the Mother dies.\n \n I wouldn't blame God for that. I would blame the police officer.",

I had the great fortune to be under a desk with a Muslim co-worker who was fervently praying to her god for our safety. I felt enormously safe in her company.

Natural disasters are different, and as for people being killed in them, I'm still not sure what to say.\n \n \nIt seems that, one way or the other, one would have to try to be objective. For example: if God saved one house from a tornado's path and the directed path destroyed another house, then isn't God to blame for the destruction of that other house? If God is given credit for someone's life being saved under a particular medical procedure, then shouldn't God be blamed if the same procedure does not work on someone else? I simply often see lack of consistency. One might say that \"God helps those who help themselves\" but, if people are helping themselves, then what role is God playing in helping them? \n\n \n That's where the position gets real tight for the 'blame God' person. I don't see anything wrong in thanking God for good things and not singing for joy when bad things happen. But blaming him and cursing him is stupid. \n \n Look at Job. He still worshipped God regardless that he lost his house, his family, his servants, his cattle, his sheep and practically all his wealth in one day. I think God sees everything from every angle (even time and the future) and I would trust that what he is doing will work together for good. Though I think I would be awfully devestated if I lost as much as he did.\n \n I'll answer as best as I can for myself. I would probably thank God for me and my house being unharmed, and if he did purposefully bring that tornado down on the other house for some reason unknown to me, I wouldn't dare to blame God and turn my back on him. So many things have happened in history that had been resolved by God, whether or not the reason was immediately known, that I would trust God if it were my house that was destroyed. \n \n I wouldn't say: \"You destroyed my house! I'm not going to follow you anymore or trust you! Why did you do it? Why won't you tell me why?\". If it had happened to me, I think I would gripe and complain a whole lot, but the fact would remain the God gives and takes away. I wouldn't blame him for the bad things and not follow him. I'd be asking him to give me life on a Golden Platter. \n \n It's one of the things about the life of following Christ. Some preachers act like salesmen for Jesus, but the unhappy customers consist of mostly those who thought God wanted nothing more than to fill our pockets. I know things like natural disasters may happen, and if I marry and have children, I know bad things may happen to them too. But I made a commitment to follow Christ through hardships, and to bear my burdens as he did. I will not blame God.\n \n By the way, I'm glad you mentioned that \"God helps those who help themselves.\" thing. That's actually not a verse in the Bible, though it does make some sense. \n \n If a person is willing to do what it takes to acheive an important goal (like in Where The Red Fern Grows), then they don't need to worry about God hindering them; providing they don't sin in their actions. They can also expect help and support from him, even if he doesn't do it as often as they'd like. I think that's what that expression means.",

   "Reliance on a belief. Generally, a reliance on a belief involving God is treated differently from the reliance on a belief which does not. Not only is that unfair, it is also a double standard. It is also hypocritical (since every proposition can be brought to either a reliance on the existence or non-existence of God, both of which involve a belief about God).\n \n \n Perhaps I should clarify the intention of my previous posts. I have found it common that if someone makes a proposition involving religion, that some immediately discount that proposition on the sole fact that \"that is a matter of faith.\" It is as if the sole fact that a proposition is based on faith removes it from consideration, i.e., it is absurd because it is based on faith.\n \n My point is that, at a fundamental level, every proposition relies on faith, and that if that serves as a sufficient reason to discredit propositions which involve religion, then to be consistent it must also serve as a sufficient reason to discredit propositions which do not involve religion. Thus, any proposition which relies on the existence of God is based on faith. But so is an argument which relies on the non-existence of God.\n \n Hence, I have said earlier that if reliance on faith is a sufficient reason to discredit a proposition, then we are ultimately left in a state where we are unable to communicate. The denial that there can be such thing as truth makes communication impossible.\n\n \n Is it then fair to say a belief based upon faith only requires no evidence? \n \n I disagree that every proposition relies on faith. Many require evidence based on our perception and thinking. I would say, actually, except for religious belief, every proposition requires some evidence.\n \n Not believing in God does not require faith at all. It is merely saying that there is not enough evidence to have that belief. It is not saying that there is evidence of no God.",

If we ignore this then no doubt we may have to account for ourselves in due course.\n \n We are all due to die at some stage as is the Earth itself.

Essentially, your view is that God has an ultimate plan of good that determines His involvement in human life. The actions which He takes are not specifically aimed to purposely cause harm or good to any individual but to carry out a plan that, in its ultimate form, is good for humanity or at least for certain segment of humanity. In that case, when God would keep you from getting killed by that mass murderer then He is not doing it specifically for you but because you happen to be within the master plan and if He specifically targeted you for suffering (as he did Job), then it is not purposely to do you harm but because of a master plan. He may be responsible for harm being done to you but cannot be blamed since the word \"blame\" implies not only responsibility for harm but bad or irresponsible intentions as well. \n \n If we avoid the word \"blame\" so as to avoid any conotation of bad or irresponsible intentions, then do you accept that God is responsible for many aspects of suffering of humanity as well - as he was responsible for the suffering of Job?",

   "Right, and I think the antithesis to my proposition is an assertion of faith as well, that is, it is a belief. This might get a little confusing, so let me simplify. If the proposition \"God exsists\" is a faith based assertion, then so is the proposition that \"God does not exist.\"\n \n \n Either God exists or He does not. It takes faith to believe either option. \n\n I have only partially been following this discussion and I hope that you don't mind my jumping in like this, but I would say that an important issue in this discussion is that you seem to be saying that one can only take one of two stances that are polar opposites. Namely, that either one claims that God exists or one claims that God does not exist. That leaves out all the gray area in between. For example, quite a lot of people would like to believe that God exists but are not sure - this is akin to saying \"We think that God most likely exists\". Others, such as myself on many occasions, follow science and knowledge derived directly from evidence but allow room for the possible existence of the supernatural since the knowledge from science does not disprove God's existence - it just continues to severely limit His possible role. This is akin to saying - \"We acknowledge the possibility that God might exist\". There are also quite a range of beliefs about God and the supernatural. I would think that it is only a minority of people who honestly have no doubts whatsoever about the existence of God, and an even smaller minority of people who claim absolute certainty that God does not exist. I would claim that the great majority of people are in between. If suddenly some obvious evidence of God would show itself to a large number of people, then that distribution might change.

If scientific ideas have a standard of proof to which they are held to be trusted, why can't religious assertions?\n\n They are never adequately documented because they don't tend to happen very often. But never isn't a correct word. I've seen videos where people have gotten healed from blindness or inability to walk, however even if I went through the trouble of finding the videos (I didn't see them online, I saw them on a sermon recording from a church) and uploading them, you would just say prove that the person was blind or lame. And I never asserted that they are common, prototype did assert that they still happen, but he never said they are common. \n \n As far as televangelists go, I'm sure there are many fake ones out there just scheming to get money, but there are some that are true followers of God. The one that healed my dad wasn't known to heal, but at the time he was being compelled by God and did as he was told. That is why he doesn't go and heal at hospitals, it isn't something he can just do. \n \n When it comes to healing, it isn't the person who is doing the healing, God is doing the healing through the person. All the person can do is pray and hope God will heal through them. They probably don't go to hospitals because the people there are already getting some help. They usually are found in third world countries helping people who have entire starving and/or disease ridden families. If I had God healing people through me, I'd go overseas too. Those people need it more than we do.\n \n \nGrew a new hand? Do you really think I don't believe you because I'd have to submit to some commandments? One of us is a fool and I have faith that I know which one.\n\n Commandments aren't the issue. God gave the ten commandments as a guidelines to get his people on the straight course. One of the commandments is not to kill. If a woman was about to be raped and murdered and the only way to save her was to kill the rapist, then God wouldn't see that as an evil deed. This isn't to say you can just disobey the commandments for any reason, but there are exceptions for exceptional situations. When you understand the heart of God then you will know I your heart when these situations occur. Some people don't believe simply because they want evidence to reassure them, others say to show evidence just because they know you can't and want a \"prove it\" way out. \n \n P.S.- Calling me a fool is an assault on me rather than the issue. It is a very immature way of argueing and I'd appreciate an apology, though if you don't then I will overlook it anyway.",

Namely, that either one claims that God exists or one claims that God does not exist. That leaves out all the gray area in between.

Others, such as myself on many occasions, follow science and knowledge derived directly from evidence but allow room for the possible existence of the supernatural since the knowledge from science does not disprove God's existence - it just continues to severely limit His possible role. . . .\nWhat about us folk who don't care whether God exists or not?

No offense, but calling the Bible \"documentation\" is a laughable assertion, if considering the standards by which we call something evidence, in science, or in everyday life. \n\n \n The Bible is a true and factually correct source. There's practically a whole testament documenting these things, and things like these can happen today. You should read a series of books called \"Trailblazers\". It's stories that have fictional characters that got involved with real historical people who did those things. I believe the Bible, it is not some old thrown together stories.

However, I trust the findings of science over the claims of organized religion and usually try to fit some level of belief within the unknowns of science. I would judge any claimed evidence of God with the same rigor with which I judge scientific evidence - the most important aspect of which is its verifiability. \n\n \n You seem very skeptical of everything, Another opinion. Can I ask you a question? Can you believe in the God of Christianity and also not believe in his word? Continue to skepticize, and do a little investigating into the history of the Bible itself. I think you may find it's verifiability beyond question.\n \n \nYes, the Bible has many stories of the miraculous acts of Jesus but, historically, there were many religious men during those times which had stories of miraculous acts surrounding them. There was so much variation in early Christian belief, so much that is now lost to time, and so much that was affected by politics that my main concern, where Christianity is concerned, is how to extract any grain of probable truth from all of the external influences and changes that have occurred in the last two millenia. Therefore, I do not automatically trust the Bible since I view it as being written by mere men, some of whom, maybe, were actually inspired by God. \n\n \n You obviously don't have a true belief in God. And not everything about Christianity is lost to time. You really have not considered the evidence. We have enough Greek manuscripts that we could compose thousands of New Testaments out of them. And by the standards of believing in ancient heros like Ceasar and Plato, the Bible should be extremely credible.\n \n \nI am sure that Wallninja actually believes those stories that he has heard or believes that his own experiences were divinely influenced. However, I do not trust in his ability to objectively judge. If he presented verifiable evidence that could convince an objective, intelligent and thorough skeptic, then I might also be convinced.\n\n \n A skeptic like yourself would not be convinced by evidence provided by one who could not objectively judge.

   "Prototype, if killing is completely wrong and there is no way around it then how would you explain when Elijah chopped off the heads of the worshipers of Baal? \n\n \n I look at it like this. Jesus said to love your enemies. Even if I didn't love the rapist, I most certainly wouldn't kill him. (By the way, since your scenario is impossible, we should just let it slide.) Jesus also said that any man who so much as hates his brother without a cause is a murderer. Jesus made it pretty clear to not kill. It was different in the old testament.\n \n \nOr any of the other times God directed people to kill? There is a difference between murder and justice. When God gave the Hebrews the commandments they were a roudy group of people getting out of control in the desert. God gave them commandments as a set of guidelines to get them back on track. When God commanded Ehud to kill king Eglon (in Judges 3)? Would that mean God directed him to sin? You see? If killing was always a sin then God would have directed people to be sinners all the time. \n\n \n Once again, this is how God directed them back in the Old Testament. Things changed when Jesus died. He set some new rules, including leaving punishment on other people (to the extent of murder) to himself. One of the reasons so many Christians were killed during the first few decades was because they didn't fight back. They really did try to treat their enemies like Jesus did; rather than join together to fight like the zealots did. (If all the Christians including greeks and romans joined together, they would probably be very successful)\n \n I've heard that the original word was \"Thou Shalt Do No Murder\". That may fit better for the Old Testament, but that was not torn down when Jesus taught against it. It was actually enforced because now, you're not supposed to kill at all. That's the what it was then. and this is the way it is now.",

   "You seem very skeptical of everything, Another opinion. Can I ask you a question? Can you believe in the God of Christianity and also not believe in his word? Continue to skepticize, and do a little investigating into the history of the Bible itself. I think you may find it's verifiability beyond question\n \n You obviously don't have a true belief in God. And not everything about Christianity is lost to time. You really have not considered the evidence. We have enough Greek manuscripts that we could compose thousands of New Testaments out of them. And by the standards of believing in ancient heros like Ceasar and Plato, the Bible should be extremely credible.\n \n A skeptic like yourself would not be convinced by evidence provided by one who could not objectively judge. I think you're just sitting in a spot of not believing and not totally expelling it as wrong to be safe. It isn't stupid to believe something has happened when something as factual as the Bible is there confirming it.\n\n I would be quite curious about what means are you claiming to use to verify the Bible. You seem to be assuming the factuality of the Bible without presenting any evidence for it. I have seen no such evidence for the Biblical stories. I have even read that many, if not most Christian scholars do not take many of the Biblical stories literally but often view them as stories meant to teach a lesson. As such, for those stories, the issue of evidence would be irrelevant (since they were never meant to convey true stories) and the only issue at hand would be whether or not one agrees with the lessons that the stories are trying to teach. The Bible can also be viewed as a historical document - a people's memoirs of the historical events which they experience. However, I have little trust in the objectivity of primitive peoples that attribute most historical events to the actions of God - be they earthquakes, to comets in the sky to victories at war. People, especially before the advent of Science and general literacy, would automatically attribute to supernatural influence those events which they did not understand or could not control. Therefore, I cannot believe in the supernatural aspect of those stories without evidence.\n \n As for my religious views, I very openly admit that I do not believe in God as He is described in most organized global religions. I certainly do not think that religious belief need be restricted to well established dogma. The establishment of dogma is often a direct cause of political and historical influences. Lacking evidence for religious beliefs, people have the ability to make their own inspired guesses about the supernatural. I and many others think for ourselves where religious beliefs are concerned. I acknowledge the possibility of the supernatural, at least where it cannot be disproven by science, and would like to believe that there is a God and an afterlife. I would admit that this is mostly wishful thinking and that I have no evidence for it, but I find some level of religious belief psychologically useful. If I am wrong about the beliefs and there is no supernatural, then no harm has been done. If I am wrong about my beliefs and the supernatural is much different than I imagined, then I have a strong trust that, if we are judged as humans, then we are ultimately judged by our actions in life and by our treatment of others - not by whether or not we follow a particular belief system.\n \n As for whether I would be convinced by evidence, I would be if it was properly scrutinized by objective, intelligent people who investigate all possibilities. For example, I have heard of the tantalizing stories of people who recover from near death experiences and tell about their memories of looking down on themselves on the operating table, remembering the room, what people said, etc. Unfortunately, I haven't heard of any reputable scientists investigating these claims - probably due to a sense of it being a \"taboo\" topic in science that might ruin careers of those that took it seriously. However, if such reputable scientists would investigate it and find no alternative explanations, then I would have a stronger belief in the truth of those stories. As it is, they just remain a tantalizing curiousity.",

   "I have no idea what the \"earth is flat\" part means.

If this is the case, what way is that to go through life? If that is not what you are saying, please explain.\n\n \n I'm saying that even if somebody doesn't believe something it still might be true. And can you give me even a hypothetical alternate explanation for what I saw? If there was a different expanation that could make sense I might consider it, but I can't think of any. I saw his nub close up so I know the hand wasn't there. I shook his hand later so I know it was there afterwards.\n \n \nOf course we would be skeptical. I should hope anyone would be skeptical. If I saw an elephant disappear, wouldn't it be reasonable to be skeptical, assuming this is an illusion, a magic trick, because in my understanding of reality, this sort of thing simply does not happen? It would take a great deal of proof to believe that an elephant can vanish into thin air and that a hand can grow back. Isn't that what a normal, thinking adult would require?\n\n \n Just because someone says God is involved, are you expected to leave your \"god-given\" brain at the door? How gullible do you think \"we\" are?[/QUOTE]\n \n Well what better proof is there then seeing it happen? There can be no scientific explanation for something done supernaturally, because supernatural happenings tend to break the laws of science.\n \n [QUOTE=thelmoose]Annnnd.... why do you believe that, that God doesn't want \"miracles\" to be proven? Did you base this belief on anything other than a very convenient excuse as to why no \"miracles\" ever, ever are documented in a way that would lend more proof to them. The delusions get more intricate, the more you try to examine them rationally. That is the nature of delusions, of course. Delusions get \"fixed\" and there is nothing anyone can say to persuade the deluded otherwise. If this didn't happen, then a simple logical thought or two would dispell the notion and let one realize that this thinking is simply magical. Abracadabra![/QUOTE}\n \n I believe that way because if everybody knew for sure that God existed then faith would be irrelevent. He knows his followers by their faith. I can see why you would think it is an excuse though.\n \n \nHow does an additional experience add anything to another independent experience?\n\n \n It lets me know that supernatural things do indeed happen so it wasn't just me going nuts for a moment. \n \n \nI don't know what you mean by \"reassure\". I want evidence for everything I decide to believe in my life. If it is a trivial claim, then a tiny bit of evidence is in order. But as I quoted above, an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence. \n \n I look at this as a normal way to live ones life. I see no merit in \"swallowing and following.\"\n\n \n Well that is where faith comes in. You have none. Children have blind faith, I did. As I got older I stopped believing based on blind faith, and started believing based on experiences and from having a connection with God which was started from my previous blind faith. It usually starts off as an unfounded belief, but turns into a reality as you grow in the spirit.\n \n I had said \"...others say to show evidence just because they know you can't and want a \"prove it\" way out.\" and you replied- \n \nWhat does this mean?\n\n \n It means sometimes people know something is true, but they also know it can't be proven so they say \"prove it\" as a way of winning the arguement. Like if someone kills somebody and somebody else sees it and it goes to court and the murderer says \"prove it\" because he knows the witness only has his testimony and nothing else. The murderer knows he is guilty, but he knows he can get away with it because even though it is true, it can't be proven.",

   "Outdated? He was a harvard professor. He probably had easy access to study the Bible, and he did it for years. He didn't compare it from one to another religion, he studied it very deeply.\n\n The verification of the Bible would require independent evidence. There are bits and pieces of evidence here and there that certain historic events (such as the destruction of Jerico, the existence of Jesus of Nazareth, etc.) most likely happenned but there is no independent evidence of the spiritual explanation of these events. \n \n To say that Prof. Greenleaf was able to verify the truth of the Bible by studying only the Bible is circular reasoning. I looked at a couple of the evangelical sites talking about him but, apart from a few quotes from him that he believes in the truth of the Bible, there is no corroberating evidence presented. At that early time (early 19th century), he would have had access to the ancient texts but would not have had access to the meticulous methods of historians that have emerged since, nor to the dating methods that could confirm sources, etc. What he did have access to was not useless and it could have been interesting to see what case he presented. Unfortunately, the evangelical websites which I saw did not present any case from him. Even if he did present an arguement, that would have to be compared to all of the current analysis of scholars of antiquity - none of which, to my knowledge, has claimed to be able to prove the veracity of the supernatural aspects of the Bible. I get the impression that the sole evidence that you are trying to present is \"Look... here is an intelligent man from an excellent school that believed in the truth of the Bible... that should be evidence enough...\". For anyone who has any conception of what \"evidence\" is, that statement would not be evidence enough - not by a long shot. \n \nChristianity has lasted longer than any other religion inspiring that stuff. And it has remained firm. If this doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.\n\n I can admire certain true believing Christians for their selfless actions and their inner-strength. I certainly acknowledge that many religions, Christianity included, do have the capability of inspiring their followers and have many positive psychological benefits for people. These are some of the reasons which draw me to those beliefs which I do try to hold. However, I am not the type of person that can ignore evidence or agree with illogical conclusions. Perhaps you are that type of person and, frankly, you might well be the happier for it. \n \n I generally think that people certainly have the right to live according to their beliefs. The only time that I start arguing with those beliefs is when they try to force their beliefs on others through law. Laws need to have rational supporteable reasons behind them. As far as I know, the only place where you want to impose your religious views on others is in the area of abortion-law. So, I would be willing to limit our discussions to such subjects since we did seem to go far astray from this main topic in these discussions.",

But your point was that the Bible doesn't consider abortion as murder....I want to know where you got that from if you say it doesn't talk about abortion?\n\n The bible doesn't say anything about abortion,but does show that a fetus doesn't have the same value as an actual person.Humans are valued by God because God created humans to reflect his image.God isn't a biological being so we don't reflect God's image by our biology.\n \n \nHolman Bible Dictionary\n \n IMAGE OF GOD\n \n A biblical description of the unique nature of human beings in their relationship to the Creator God.\n \n \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\" (Genesis 1:26). This passage contains a key to the understanding of humans and their nature. Scholars through the ages have sought to unravel the mystery of that statement. The psalmist asked, \"What is man?\" (Psalms 8:4). Philosophers, theologians, psychologists, and anthropologists have constantly explored that topic. All have realized that the human being \"is fearfully and wonderfully made\" (Psalms 139:14).\n \n A Special Creation According to the Scriptures, humans are not an evolutionary accident but a special creation. Human beings were purposefully produced by God to fulfill a preordained role in His world. They have peculiar qualities that somehow reflect the nature of God Himself and set them apart and above all other created beings.\n \n Image and Likeness Some Bible students have tried to make a distinction in the meaning of \"image\" and \"likeness.\" Image has been considered the essential nature of humans as God's special creation, and likeness as reflecting this image in such qualities as goodness, grace, and love. They maintain that humankind in the Fall retained the image but lost the likeness. The two words, however, seem to identify the same divine act. The repetition represents the Hebrew literary style of parallelism used for emphasis. The Hebrew selem or image refers to a hewn or carved image (1 Samuel 6:5; 2 Kings 11:18) like a statue, which bears a strong physical resemblance to the person or thing it represents. The word likeness, demuth, means a facsimile. Compare 2 Kings 16:10, \"fashion\" or \"pattern\" (NAS), \"sketch\" (NIV, REB), \"exact model\" (TEV). Neither of the words imply that persons are divine. They were endowed with some of the characteristics of God. There is a likeness but not a sameness.\n \n Persons as Body-Soul Many different views seek to explain the nature of the likeness. Genesis 2:7 says, \"the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\" In creation God endowed persons with a spiritual aspect of life. This passage says that man became a soul, not that he had a soul. A person is both body and soul, or more accurately, body-soul. The Old Testament supports this holistic view of persons who are not segmented into parts known as body, soul, and spirit. Genesis 1:20 uses the Hebrew expression, nephesh chayah, \"living soul\" for \"moving creature that has life,\" that is the animals. Compare Genesis 1:24; Genesis 9:10,Genesis 9:16; Leviticus 11:10.\n \n Early theologians were greatly influenced by Greek philosophy in their interpretation of the image of God. The Greeks separated between the material and the spiritual. They saw an individual as a spirit being living in a physical body. This Greek dualism was the background out of which the early Christian theologians drew their understanding. The church fathers believed that the image of God resided in the soul or the spirit of each person.\n \n Humankind as Persons Who are humans? The Bible portrays them as self-conscious, willful, innovative entities who, under God, preside over their environment. In other words, they are persons. God made each male and female a person in the likeness of His own personhood. Nothing else in all creation can be called a person. Personhood encompasses individuals in their entirety, body and spirit, as rational, loving, responsible, moral creatures.\n \n Reflections of Personhood A man or woman is a person, as God is a Person. Such personal uniqueness is reflected in self-awareness and God-awareness. Human individuality is implied in personhood. God said \"I am that I am\" (Exodus 3:14). Persons also are separate entities with individual personalities, sets of values, inclinations, and responsibilities. Every human being is an original.\n \n Humans created in God's image share His rational nature. People have the power to think, analyze, and reflect even upon abstract matters. They cannot be defined by or confined to material attributes. As God is spiritual (John 4:24), persons are spiritual. This spiritual kinship makes possible communication with God.\n \n The Bible teaches that human beings have purpose. They have an instinctive need to be something and to do something. They have a responsible intuition and an inner call to duty. The human race has a unique sense of \"oughtness.\" Humans are moral creatures. They can and do make moral judgments (Genesis 2:16-27). Persons have a censoring conscience which they may defy. They are choice makers; they can obey their highest instincts or follow their most morbid urges. A human is the only creature who can say no to God. Humans are autonomous persons. God endowed them with the freedom to govern their own lives.\n \n This same autonomy makes possible fellowship with God. No person could have a meaningful relationship with a robot. Real fellowship can take place only between two authentic persons. God created \"man\" in His own image because He wanted a relationship with another sovereign person.

This doesn't mean a clone of.\n\n And as humans if we do not posses sapience and sentience we would not be persons,just mere formed DNA.Here's a good little article on being created in God's image and likeness. \nWe find that both these words Image and likeness are used interchangeably in the scriptures. In Gen. 1:26 we find both words yet in vs.27 we find only Image. In Gen.5:1 the word likeness is found. Gen.9:6 uses Image alone, and then when we come to the NT. we find in 1 Cor.11:7 Image alone is used and Jms. 3:9 likeness is used.\n \n What are the features that man was created in that reflect his creator? Where do the qualities of God's image lie in man? In our soul, the immaterial part not the material part. It is expressed by the body but are not the body.\n \n God is spirit (Jn.4:24) He is invisible. When it states we were created in His image it does not mean that God is a physical being and that we are just like him. Because we are able to be seen therefore he is just like us. In the Hebrew language Image ( tselem) is related to nature, the immaterial part of man. It means we have a spiritual nature like God in a finite way. Likeness ( Demuth) does not mean in a physical sense, but similarity. We have finite qualities like God. These describe a spiritual likeness not physical that man is made in. Gen 1:24-31\"Likeness\" is a more general term, indicating resemblance in any quality, external or internal. God is a spirit (Gen 1:2), He thinks, speaks, wills, and acts. In man the image and likeness is expressed through reason, speech, will, and creative ability. The image of God consists, in the spiritual personality of man\n",

   "Okay I want to throw in my 2 cents.\n \n #1 God made a mature planet one that was self sustaining so that he would not have to tend to the mundane things such as the sun comes up and the rain falls. Every thing is about a circle and the best way to prove the exsistance of God is through just that. God says I am the begining and the end. Ever see a whole rainbow? It is a complete circle, no begining and no end. \n \n #2 God does not choose who lives or dies. Though in many cases Satin may play a role in man choosing who leaves this planet and when they do.\n \n #3 God says in the Bible I am jealous (a sin to man) I am a loving god, I am a vengeful God (another sin to man). Man was created in the image of God. Since man has all of these same emotions is it not safe to assume that God has all the same emotions we have??? Man was given the ability to make choices. Man was to endure the pleasures and pains of this planet as a test of worth. God has given us all the ability to choose... to choose to love or to hate. To love god and each other above all else is the path to heaven, and to choose to hate God and everyone and thing is the path to hell.\n \n #4 With out hardship how can you truely know happiness and with out happiness how can you truely know hardship? With out love how can you truely know hate and with out hate how can you truely know love? These are things we must all endure to find our place in the universe. With out life there can be no death and with out death there can be no life. \n \n #5 God doesn't kill babies...Satin might, but go ahead and blame God..it's easier that way..isn't it? Just don't blame the Evil doctors who violate thier oath as a doctor when the exterimante life for thier own greed. That in it's self should prove the exsistance of Satin and evil. The bible says that greed is the root of all evil. \n \n War is waged by man over greed, Murder is a crime normally of greed (sometimes indirectly) The greed to maintain one's pride the greed to hold on to someone you love but can not. Theft a crime of greed. Lies a crime of greed. Look in to yourself and you might find that the greed vailed as vainity and pride you hold in yourself is what makes you hate.\n \n I was once a non-believer myself... For years I to had doubt and thought I knew everything at times. But ask yourself this have you ever seen or felt a miricle??? If not it's probably because you don't believe and it's a cycle (anoter circle) and God will not give you one until you believe first...he is stuborn like that trust me. Just ask Jesus for what ever you want and beg him to forgive you and make you a better person and see what happens..but the thing is you have to believe it all.\n \n I thank God everyday for what he has just gave me.",
