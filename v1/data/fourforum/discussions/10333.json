   "Darwinists don't like the origin-of-life topic brought up in the context of the evo/creo debate. To this they will always proclaim that ToE does not attempt to answer the question of life's origin. Yet if you read any evolutionists' books or talk to evos on debate forums they will almost always frame the debate as ToE against special creation. At first this may sound like an ok premise, but if you think about it, it's off base and it's a diversion. Let me explain:\n \n When evolutionists like Richard Dawkins - or any of the rest of them - frame the debate, they will almost always proclaim the debate is between ToE and special creation...(ie..\"Goddidit\")....YET evos are the first to admit that ToE is not a theory that deals with origin of life. So we have a disconnect: We have theory of biological change (ToE) being pitted not against another theory of biological change, but against a supernatural creation event. This is wrong, wrong, and wrong...In my opinion, the debate should not be between RMNS vs. special creation, but RMNS against a biological alternative to how change happens: In this case, the polar opposite to RMNS is the ability of the MIND/mental processes to bring about beneficial, purposeful heritable change. \n \n But guess what.....Darwinists hate the mind. They never, but never, mention it in the context of evolution because the mind/mental processes is not only non-scientific, but is something that cannot even be defined, much less measured. The mind to evolutionists is like Kryptonite to Superman. You see, what evolutionists know is that in this day and age it's accepted and even politically correct to bash and mock YECs...and it's almost getting to that point even with God. However, it's not quite so easy to bash the brain, mind, consciousness, awareness and other mental processes, which most people in society would admit are darn-near miraculous. So instead of bashing the mind, evolutionists merely ignore it, choosing instead to bash YEC, which is not even a biological theory of change! Talk about the strawmen of strawmen! \n \n Heck, read any book: Dawkins, Gould, Mayr, Darwin, or anyone else, NONE of them talk about the mind, which is the real biological alternative to Darwinism. At most, these people will make some sort of negative comment about creationists or lamarckism. Never is the mind brought up as a possible alternative to RMNS. \n \n So Dawkins and his satellites have successfully pitted ToE against the 6-day Creation story mostly because the 6-day Creation story is (to many people) an unbelievable-sounding event....(by the way, miracles usually are unbelievable-sounding). But Dawkins dares not bring up ToE's REAL biological opponent: the mind. And in kind, evolutionists have historically refused to test mental processes in animals because they want no part of anything that would contradict their beloved materialism. If the mind indeed controls evolutionary change, then evos' assertion that mental processes are mere by-products of eons of random physical events is false and thus destroys the whole theory. Sensing/thinking/believing/knowing/being aware can, however, change the expression of DNA -- which, to the chagrin of evos, introduces free will into biology and makes us creators of our own destiny to a certain degree.\n \n Not only that, but the idea that the mind controls biology eliminates the idea that changes in biology are part of a long string of random events that turn creatures into different kinds of creatures over time. Instead, biological change has nothing to do with the build-up of organisms nor the origination of the mind.....which leads to the conclusion that the mind was not built up over time -- and thus must have been created instantly.\n \n http://www.ernestrossi.com/about_psychobiology_of_gene_expression.htm#Part%201:%20The%20Psychobiology%20of%20Gene%20Expression%20in%20Human%20Experience\n \n We now know that significant life events can turn on genes that lead to the synthesis of proteins, which, in turn, generate new neurons and connections in our brain. Our daily and hourly life experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can modulate gene expression and neurogenesis in ways that actually can change the physical structure of the brain.\n \n This new worldview of the relationships between gene expression and human experience emerging from the Human Genome Project is setting the stage for a profound expansion of our understanding of life.....\n \n ...In Chapter 2 we take our first steps in exploring the surprising and little known research on behavioral state-related gene expression: How behavioral states such as sleeping, dreaming, consciousness, vigilance, stress, emotional arousal, and depression are associated with different patterns of gene expression. We learn how a special class of genes called \"immediate early genes\" can respond to significant life events and psychosocial cues in an adaptive manner within minutes! \n \n \n anyone know how the above (underlined) happens? What starts/causes this process?\n \n http://www.bigskycichlids.com/coloration_article.htm\n \n Coloration is controlled by the endocrine and nervous system, but dietary sources of pigment also play a role in determining color in fishes. The endocrine and nervous system both influence coloration in fish. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that direct the production and storage of pigments throughout the life of a fish, and particularly as maturity is reached. Pigment production and storage often increases at the onset of maturity. Many species use color to provide camouflage and attract a mate. Fish of the family Cichlidae are particularly known for brilliant coloration of mature males. The autonomic nervous system directs rapid color changes in response to stimuli such as a predator or an aggressive tankmate. Anyone who has observed fish knows this color change can occur at a spectacular rate",

   "I will be graduating in B Science (Psychology) with honours in about 6 weeks.\n \n Cognitive psychologists talk about the mind and its processes, that's what they do. As opposed to say, individual difference psychologists who analyse things at the level of the population, or neuropsychologists who analyse things at the level of biology. There are also cognitive neuropsychologists, that look at the interaction between biological changes and mental changes.\n \n Economists might be called individual differences cognitive psychologists, in that they look at the effect of mental changes on population statistics.\n \n The vast majority of scientists in all these categories believe in evolution, and have no problem reconciling their beliefs about the mind with their beliefs about evolution.\n \n So your claim that\n \n \nDarwinists hate the mind.\n\n \n Is demonstrably false. It is \"darwinists\" that are investigating the mind, and conducting good-faith research into its processes. In contrast all you offer is specious speculation about mind-processes you imagine occur in bacteria, with no evidence to show for it.\n \n \nDarwinists hate the mind. They never, but never, mention it in the context of evolution\n\n \n Evolutionary psychologists specifically deal with the evolution of brain structures that accomodate mental processes. For example, the evolution of brain structures that allow for the development of language.\n \n \n \n \n So why are you under the illusion that darwinism and the understanding of the mind don't mix?\n \n Perhaps it is because strict biologists do not have an education in cognitive psychology - it would be outside their field of expertise to speculate on mental processes, and accordingly, they seldom make claims about these issues.\n \n \n \n And to clear something up for you. Evolution does not explain the origins of life as a whole. It explains however, the origin of specific kinds of life, by pointing to hard evidence that these kinds of life evolved from different kinds of life. It is then up to theories of abiogenesis to explain how the very first lifeforms could have developed.\n \n \n Of course, I don't expect you'll learn anything from this explanation, that would require the use of your mind, which is undoubtedly busy devising advantageous mutations for your genetics to develop.",

Since then the ToE has grown through the addition of mutations (involving numerous separate causes and processes), recombination, and genetic drift (again nuimerous processes), including endosymbiosis and other processes of lateral gene transfer.\n \n Next, biologists do not pit the ToE against special creation with respect to the origin of life. The ToE explains, and can only explain, what happens after you've got life that reproduces and has genes. I fully agree that biology needs an explanation for the origin of life, and that it is incomplete without one, and that if science is to be successful then the ToE must therefore be surpassed by a grand unifying theory of the origin and propagation of life that subsumes abiogenesis and evolution into a larger theory. I also agree that at present we have at best just a few working hypotheses and are far short of a theory of abiogenesis. Your expectation that the ToE explain the origin of life is as if you were complaining about the theory of general relativity being no good because it doesn't explain diabetes. \n \n Like the others on this thread, I am greatly amused by your response to being proven wrong (yet again) is to complain that \"who in society would have heard of those people? No one.\", meaning only that YOU haven't heard of them. Your personal ignorance is a very shaky foundation for complaining that scientists haven't done various things (when they have) and that scientific explanations don't explain various things (when they do). And then you follow that up with statements like \"Maybe you should do some research before opening your mouth\" and \"prove it scientifically. Your statement is simply a guess. You have no idea.\"\n \n I could go on, but you are doing a far better job of making yourself look ridiculous than I ever could.",

(Adapted from an example by R. E. Bellman, see below.)\n \n Another way to envisage the \"vastness\" of high-dimensional Euclidean space is to compare the size of the unit sphere with the unit cube as the dimension of the space increases: as the dimension increases, the unit sphere becomes an insignificant volume relative to that of the unit cube; thus, in some sense, nearly all of the high-dimensional space is \"far away\" from the centre, or, to put it another way, the high-dimensional unit space can be said to consist almost entirely of the \"corners\" of the hypercube, with almost no \"middle\".

For example, do finches develop stronger bills because they ate (or needed to eat) bigger seeds, or are finches able to eat hard seeds because they just happen to have stronger bills. It cannot be both. If it is my way (that finches acquire stronger beaks in response to a need) then there MUST be an intelligence within the organism that senses this need and then reacts accordingly, altering morphology. I call this the mind. But maybe it's a spiritual entity. Maybe it's something else. Who knows....who cares.....this will never be answered because life is unscientific and undefinable. \n \n The point however, is that Dawrinists' long-term assertion that finches are only able to eat hard seeds because some of them just happen to have strong beaks is laughable. Evo devo has proven this wrong, showing us that finch beaks are modified by the release of a protein during development, which ultimately proves that each organism is adaptive and that the theory of natural selection as a creative force is simply wrong.\n \n Here's how Nijhout puts it:\n \n http://www.biology.duke.edu/nijhout/polyphenism.htm\n \n It appears that in the control of polyphenic development, hormones act as stimuli that induce discrete switches in developmental pathways. There is independent regulation of the pattern of hormone secretion, of tissue receptivity to the hormone, and of the developmental response of each tissue to the hormone. Because hormone secretion is regulated by the central nervous system, this mechanism allows development to become responsive to environmental variables. Variation in tissue sensitivity to the hormones allows the developmental switch to produce alternative phenotypes in response to specific environmental signals. This is interesting from an evolutionary perspective because genetic variation in the signal and the response mechanisms provide the basis for the evolution of adaptive developmental responses to environmental contingencies",

I will presume you mean specifically Darwins finches by the way, finches is rather a broad category you realize. And I thought Darwin used those finches mainly to illustrate variability in the beak character. I realize also that more modern assessments indicate that they are not as divergent as once thought. But its not my field and I do not know all the necessary details. Clearly you do so spill the beans.\n \n On the other hand consider what Darwin himself wrote about these Finches. Read it carefully please so you understand what he was saying. \n \n \n The remaining land-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other in the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage: there are thirteen species, which Mr. Gould has divided into four subgroups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so is the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group Cactornis, lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of Cactornis, the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great cactus- trees; but all the other species of this group of finches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater number, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two exceptions) are brown. The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is shown in Fig. 1, and the smallest in Fig. 3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Fig. 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Fig. 4. The beak of Cactornis is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth subgroup, Camarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that a bird originally a buzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent. \n",

From 1972 to 2001, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus finch) changed several times in body size and two beak traits. Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape. The phenotypic states of both species at the end of the 30-year study could not have been predicted at the beginning. Continuous, long-term studies are needed to detect and interpret rare but important events and nonuniform evolutionary change\n\n \n And in 2004 we have this paper:\n \n Science 3 September 2004:\n Vol. 305. no. 5689, pp. 1462 - 1465\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1098095\n \n \n \nReports\n Bmp4 and Morphological Variation of Beaks in Darwin's Finches\n Arhat Abzhanov,1 Meredith Protas,1 B. Rosemary Grant,2 Peter R. Grant,2 Clifford J. Tabin1*\n \n Darwin's finches are a classic example of species diversification by natural selection. Their impressive variation in beak morphology is associated with the exploitation of a variety of ecological niches, but its developmental basis is unknown. We performed a comparative analysis of expression patterns of various growth factors in species comprising the genus Geospiza. We found that expression of Bmp4 in the mesenchyme of the upper beaks strongly correlated with deep and broad beak morphology. When misexpressed in chicken embryos, Bmp4 caused morphological transformations paralleling the beak morphology of the large ground finch G. magnirostris.\n\n \n I could not find anything referencing the kind of phenotypic stuff you are proposing. That is a role for MIND or such in any of this. Perhaps you have directly applicable references being expert on finches and all.\n \n And then in 1985 they published an apparently classic paper\n \n \nEcological Character Displacement in Darwin's Finches\n Abstract. Character displacement resulting from interspecific competition has\n been extremely difficult to demonstrate. The problem was addressed with a study of Darwin's ground finches (Geospiza). Beak sizes of populations of G. fortis and G fuliginosa in sympatry and allopatry were compared by a procedure that controls for any possible effects on morphology of ariation among locations infood supply. The results provide strong evidence for character displacement. Measurement of natural selection in a population of G. fortis on an island (Daphne) lacking a resident population of G. fuliginosa shows how exploitation of G. fuliginosa foods affects the differential survival of G. fortis phenotypes.\n",

   "And there is this tidbit\n \n \n \nScience 26 February 1999:\n Vol. 283. no. 5406, p. 1255\n DOI: 10.1126/science.283.540\n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Random Samples\n The Gal\u00e1pagos island birds known as Darwin's finches are famous as examples of how natural forces can drive the evolution of new species. Now Princeton University researchers have used genetic markers to describe the finches' first molecular family tree.\n \n \"This is one of the most important groups for our understanding of adaptive radiation,\" the process by which a species differentiates to fit different niches, says University of British Columbia evolutionary biologist Dolph Schulter. \"It seems incredible that we've not had a molecular phylogeny by now\" to match the phylogeny based on physical traits that was developed in the 1940s.\n \n Described by Charles Darwin 140 years ago, the 14 species of finches vary widely. Classic finch types have short, stout beaks good for breaking seeds, while warblerlike species sport long, narrow beaks for insect eating.\n \n Researchers have had little success verifying the finch family tree with allozymes or mitochondrial DNA, because the time scale of this radiation, less than 3 million years, is too short. But now evolutionary ecologist Kenneth Petren, with Peter and Rosemary Grant, have examined 16 microsatellite markers on genomic DNA drawn from the birds' blood. The markers \"show variation on exactly the correct time scale\" for distinguishing between species, says Petren. The new results, published in the 22 February Proceedings of the Royal Society B, also support the notion that the ancestor of all Darwin's finches resembled the pointy-beaked warbler finch.\n \n \n\n \n And some studies done on slightly different groups elsewhere:\n \n \nScience 9 March 2007:\n Vol. 315. no. 5817, pp. 1420 - 1423\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1138829\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n Ecological Speciation in South Atlantic Island Finches\n Peter G. Ryan,1* Paulette Bloomer,1,2 Coleen L. Moloney,1 Tyron J. Grant,2 Wayne Delport1,2\n \n Examples of sympatric speciation in nature are rare and hotly debated. We describe the parallel speciation of finches on two small islands in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean. Nesospiza buntings are a classic example of a simple adaptive radiation, with two species on each island: an abundant small-billed dietary generalist and a scarce large-billed specialist. Their morphological diversity closely matches the available spectrum of seed sizes, and genetic evidence suggests that they evolved independently on each island. Speciation is complete on the smaller island, where there is a single habitat with strongly bimodal seed size abundance, but is incomplete on the larger island, where a greater diversity of habitats has resulted in three lineages. Our study suggests that the buntings have undergone parallel ecological speciation.\n \n 1\n",

   "Look, the basic question is whether function precedes structure or the other way around. For example, do finches develop stronger bills because they ate (or needed to eat) bigger seeds, or are finches able to eat hard seeds because they just happen to have stronger bills. It cannot be both. If it is my way (that finches acquire stronger beaks in response to a need) then there MUST be an intelligence within the organism that senses this need and then reacts accordingly, altering morphology. \n\n You have correctly identified the two options. Breeding experiments and documentation in the field show that in the Geospizos finchws, beak size is inherited. Field studies show that in a single interbreeding population on one island, beak size varies. In hard years with no food, the small-billed birds were unable to access the only available food, the largest and toughest seeds. The response in the population was as follows: those birds that happened to be born with the smaller beaks died. 84% of the birds died, and only the ones that had inherited the biggest bills lived. Their children had a scatter of bill sizes, significantly bigger than before, on average, but varying around the mean. In a later year when the rains were excessive, the smallest billed descendents did best, and the pendulum of selection swung back the other way. In this case it's inheritance, genetics, and genetically predisposed survival and reproduction, and you are just denying the facts.\n \n \n In a little more detail, from http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/bea3/selection%20essay.htm (or go and read \"The Beak of the Finch\")\n \nWork done in the 1970's and '80s on the finches of Daphne Major (an island in the Galapagos archipelago) by the Princeton biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant further extended Darwin's research by studying the short-term effects of the strong selective pressure produced by a severe drought (Freeman and Herron, 78-85). In 1977, during the rainy season, the island received only 24mm of rainfall, in contrast to the usual 130mm. Plant growth and seed production plummeted to abysmal levels. This kind of drastic change in environmental conditions can often produce what's known as a \"selection event\"; a major change that greatly accelerates the pace of natural selection.\n \n The G. fortis population on the island was carefully monitored during the drought. 84% of the finch population was, unfortunately, selected against (with extreme prejudice) - the Grants were able to come to the conclusion that most, if not all, of the deceased birds had died from starvation - a classic example of what evolutionary biologists refer to as \"checks on increase\" to population size (Freeman and Herron 84). This finding raised some interesting questions. What had caused the fitness of the vast majority of the individual finches to suddenly plummet? More directly, why had so many birds starved - and what had kept that slim percentage of survivors alive?\n \n As it turned out, what the finches were eating was to blame. The drought had a drastic effect on the plant life of Daphne Major. The soft, small, easy-to-eat seeds, which were usually in abundance, suddenly weren't. However, the large, tough fruits of a plant species on the island, Tribulus cistoides, were in abundance during the drought. The Grants found that large-bodied finches, with characteristically deep beaks, were able to eat the Tribulus fruits without any problems (Freeman and Herron 84-87). They also found that of the survivors, the average body and beak size tended to be significantly larger than the average beak/body size of those finches who did not survive the drought. Beak size in G. Fortis is a heritable trait - and as such, the survivors that bred would pass on the genotype which correlates to the large-body/beak phenotype. Clearly, the finch population had changed dramatically thanks to selection - the fit, as defined by the selection event, survived, while the less fit perished.\n \n In an endnote to the 1978 study, the Grants found that the favorability of beak size was as mutable as had been suggested by the nature of the 1977 drought. Rainfall reached 1,359mm during the 1983 rainy season, yielding an overabundance of small, soft seeds. While not as severe a selection event as the drought, the Grants found that these conditions did in fact favor smaller-bodied, smaller-beaked finches - and that the finch population's characteristics changed accordingly (Freeman and Herron 85).\n",
