The dynamics and composition of the music is unrivaled by any of today's pop stars. If you have not heard them, check them out.\n \n By the way, Led Zepplin is a good band. They are one of the first bands to spawn the style of music known as heavy metal. John Bonum [sp] is a groove monster.\n \n If you like hard music also check out Slayer, Sepultura, Primus, and Pantera. They are some of the greats. However, I do like the more mellow sound and quality of music that came out of the grudge era.\n \n Also see Sublime, Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, and too many other great bands to list.\n \n It kind of makes you wonder what has happened to American Music. The bubble gum pop bands lack style, taste, and intelligence. If anything good comes out of this war, I hope it is another excellent musical era, like the late 60's and early seventies.
