   "Every day, in the United States, there are millions of adults and children who are left uninsured and unable to obtain adequate medical treatment due to the lack of insurance coverage. The very essence of the uninsured crisis in the United States boils right down to money. While many states have enacted programs to assist the underprivileged in obtaining health care, it is the middle class, many of which who are uninsured, who continue to struggle, unable to get the medical treatment needed. In looking at other prosperous countries, it is apparent the health care crisis in the U.S. can be resolved, aiding the middle class in obtaining adequate medical care, through a national healthcare plan. For some U.S. citizens, moving to Canada has become the only feasible option, especially when suffering from a life threatening disease as an uninsured American. Using the Canada Health Act as a guide, all members of society, in the U.S., will be assured of the basis and fundamental right to medical care.\n\n Canada Health Act: Why Uninsured Americans Are Moving - Associated Content - associatedcontent.com\n \n Contrary to what the ignorant fools on FauxNews blabber.",

   "Here I'll show you the folly of the original post with the facts.\n \n\n How to Move to Canada from the USA and Become a Permanent Resident\n Published June 06, 2007 by:\n SL Newman\n \n If you have taken the plunge and decided to move across the border and take up residence in Canada, you should know that just moving to Canada does not make you a permanent resident. In fact, the process of actually becoming a permanent resident is rather time consuming and complex. It is also quite rewarding as once you are approved for permanent residency, you will be afforded all the same rights as citizens of Canada with the exception of voting privileges. \n \n If you are interested in moving to Canada and becoming a permanent resident, you should be aware that there are six different categories that you can apply under for permanent residence. The six categories are: Skilled Worker Class Immigration, Business Class Immigration, Provincial Nomination, Family Class Immigration, Quebec-selected immigration and International Adoption. \n \n Under the skilled worker class, immigrants are evaluated on education level, language proficiency, work experience, age, arranged employment and adaptability. Each item is assigned a score, with the combined score from 0 to 100. The minimum score to qualify is 67. Citizenship and Immigration also looks at criminal history, the state of the Canadian labor market and other factors before making a decision.\n \n The business class is further separated out to investors, entrepreneurs and self-employed people. Investors must have business experience, a net worth of $800,000 Canadian and must invest $400,000 Canadian into the Canadian economy to qualify. Entrepreneurs also need to show business experience, either in owning a business or a share of a business. They will need to have an net worth of $300,000 Canadian and be able to manage and operate a business that creates at least one full-time job within 3 years of becoming a permanent resident. Self-employed applicants need to have experience, intention and ability to establish a business that will create employment for them as well as make a contribution to the Canadian society. Or, they must purchase and manage a farm.\n Provincial nomination is where a province nominates individuals that they wish to have immigrate and settle there. This means you will need to contact the immigration office in your target province and apply for nomination. \n \n Family class immigration allows for your close family members that are permanent residents in Canada to sponsor your immigration. \n \n Quebec selected immigration is a separate evaluation process. It is broken down into the following categories: permanent workers, businesspeople, students wanting permanent immigration, temporary workers wanting permanent immigration, families and sponsored refugees.\n \n International adoption is where Canadian permanent residents are allowed to adopt children of foreign countries.\n How to Move to Canada from the USA and Become a Permanent Resident, Page 2 of 2 - Associated Content - associatedcontent.com\n \n \n\n \n How To Become a Canadian Citizen\n Difficulty: HARD\n How to Apply for Canadian Citizenship - Step-by-Step Instructions on How to Apply for Canadian Citizenship\n \n According to the Canadian website, if you are accepted as a permanent resident in Canada, you can't become a citizen for at least 3 years. Imagine being diagnosed with cancer and going through all of the red tape and time to become a Canadian citizen (which is a requirement for getting Canadian UHC) in order to get free healthcare.

   "Personally speaking, I think they should separate health care from immigration, though I agree that immigration has greatly complicated resolving the health care crisis in the U.S. We do pay a high price.\n \n Pass single payer legislation, IMO, but not the immigration bill, I have eventually concluded. You don't turn people away from health care, but by using a national health care card that requires citizenship or legal residence, once into the health care system, your legal status in the country would be revealed.\n \n Single payer would likely add to the stoppers in a lot of illegal immigration because it would equalize the health care system, and many people now getting their health care in segregated, discriminatory settings with people shipped in to implement third world health care, and to keep the dirty little labor secrets secret, would be out in the open.\n \n Black, white, brown, yellow, and red. All getting their health care together.\n \n Kind of a lot harder to keep illegal immigration secretly going that way, and a lot of people here on visas to help keep it that way, often entire staff completely incompetent but for foreign language skills (but not English), would have to go back.\n \n With Americans hired instead. With American educations that we have invested in.\n \n So personally, I don't think they should pass an immigration bill, at all, as was debated so lengthily during Bush's second term. It was an open borders free for all. Enforce the damn border, and but for a few humanitarian exceptions, send people back to apply legally, and in freedom, in line like everyone else, from within their homelands. If they have American children, the children go back with them. They'll be blessed with dual citizenship, unlike Americans who can't easily emigrate anywhere else, including Canada.\n \n But they should send people back quickly, rather than warehousing huge populations at the taxpayer's expense.\n \n They should probably provide incentives for people to return independently -- such as some modified form of amnesty in the application process. Do that, and be honest about it on your application, and your application will be considered.\n \n But if you're caught and sent back by the American government, you will not be allowed back in. They must be very tough with employers, and they should do something about NAFTA. They need more good old fashioned man power at the border, along with a strategic sprinkling of walls (not the one they planned), and the new technologies.\n \n In health care, though, I don't know any other country in the world that gives away its universal health care to anyone who decides to slip in. They are so strict and uncompromising about that.\n \n The idea of a hospital hiring hundreds of translators or having entire staffs that can't serve English speaking populations, and because they're serving vast labor pools here illegally, is insane. That, btw, is a reason I don't care for the community clinic system that they want to expand. Besides the fact that people can't choose doctors -- because they're stuck with one clinic with no grievance process and no recourse to any other physician -- some of these clinics are there to keep the illegal labor pools going. It's a tiered, racist, segregated, unequal, crappy system. Hiring people from corrupt, feudal societies to service and keep in line other people from corrupt, feudal societies. \n \n While so many Americans don't get any health care at all.\n \n *What Americans don't see won't hurt them.*\n \n Also, lots of people in other countries who need health care bring their own translators along if you can't speak the language. I think many people could do that in the U.S. With large families here, no one can come with you to speak English?\n \n This is my personal opinion.

Also the U.K. as second choice.

As well as their health care.\n \n They are uncompromising and unapologetic and tough-minded about that point of view. As opposed to Americans, who are very foolish in this respect, and allow people to manipulate them on the basis of \"open borders\" and disingenuous, self-serving accusations of racism.

   "3,000 NHS staff get private care - Times Online\n \n \nTHE National Health Service has spent \u00a31.5m paying for hundreds of its staff to have private health treatment so they can leapfrog their own waiting lists.\n \n More than 3,000 staff, including doctors and nurses, have gone private at the taxpayers' expense in the past three years because the queues at the clinics and hospitals where they work are too long.\n \n Figures released under the Freedom of Information act show that NHS administrative staff, paramedics and ambulance drivers have also been given free private healthcare. This has covered physiotherapy, osteopathy, psychiatric care and counselling - all widely available on the NHS.\n \n \"It simply isn't fair to have one service for staff and another for everyone else,\" said Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, who obtained the figures.\n \n \"If the NHS has to circumvent their own waiting lists the system isn't working well enough. It's an admission by the NHS that their own system isn't able to respond to the mass of people desperate to get back to work.\"\n \n The number of health service employees sent to private healthcare facilities has more than doubled in the past three years.\n \n In 2006-7, 708 staff working for NHS trusts received private treatment at a cost of \u00a3279,000. Last year it increased to 1,641 at a cost of \u00a3828,413.\n \n The health department defended the practice and said sending doctors, nurses and other key staff for private treatment helped to get them back to work.\n \n \"If trusts want to get their staff back to work more quickly they can't jump NHS waiting lists, so going private is an option,\" said the spokesman.\n \n \"There is evidence that early intervention in tackling sickness absence enables staff to return to work more quickly.\n \n \"Other benefits include: reducing the risk of chronic illness that could result in ill health retirement, cost-saving on temporary staff and having a positive impact on staff health and wellbeing and, in turn, patient satisfaction.\"\n \n The East Midlands ambulance service recently set up a contract with a private occupational healthcare specialist worth \u00a3300,000 a year. It has sent its staff to the specialist for vaccines, health screening and to deal with needle injuries and blood tests.\n \n Other big spenders include the south east coast ambulance service, which has sent more than 800 staff for physiotherapy, osteopathy and counselling at a cost of more than \u00a3279,000 over three years.\n \n Humber mental health trust has spent more than \u00a347,000 on private counselling, even though it specialises in offering this service along with psychiatric help. A spokeswoman said staff would feel awkward being counselled by NHS colleagues.\n \n \"An appropriate and professional counselling and therapeutic service has to be free from any other existing pressures in respect of relationships and therefore cannot always be provided by an organisation,\" she said.\n \n \"Staff may also be referred externally due to peak of demand to meet the need in a timely manner.\"\n \n West Suffolk hospital has spent \u00a356,000 over the past three years on private treatment for staff but said it would no longer do so.\n",
