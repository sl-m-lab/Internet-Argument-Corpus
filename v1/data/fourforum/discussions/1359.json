Whether it is getting into our cars to go to work or looking at our watch to tell time. Do you not believe that forensic scientists can find bones many years old and tell us what their last meal was and basically how and what time they died? It may not work every time, but it does a majority of the time. My point is that we all depend on science and it has forced many creationists to try to interpret the Bible in order to account for it's questionable \"Facts\".

   "Monty has a problem with English meaning. Perhaps it is linked to his difficulty in telling the difference between nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Thus, \"evolution excludes God\" and \"evolution does not include God\" somehow mean the same thing to Monty. It is clear from the context of the discussion that they were not intended that way.\n \n Evolution, like all other sciences, neither includes nor excludes God. The very concept of God, since it is supernatural, is beyond the scope of science. Science is by definition naturalistic and is therefore unable to evaluate concepts of the supernatural. There is no conspiracy among scientists to exclude god from science as some creationists claim. God is simply outside the domain of science. To claim otherwise is to claim that your god can be quantified, and if your god can be quantified, he isn't very god-like.",

You've just proven my point on another subject. Christians can read the bible to mean whatever they want.\n \n \nPlease then I am curious, could you explain evolution in about 500-1000 words for me?

What is the evolution theory. How were we created?\n\n \n We weren't created, we evolved.\n \n \nSorry it is very clear man came first, then woman. \n How do you know what I do and dont' know about genetics?\n\n \n You opened your mouth that is how I know that you don't have one clue about biology and genetics.\n \n \nIsn't it possible that it is actually the Y that is the original and the X is just a Y with an added piece?\n\n \n It is easier to subtract that to add. In fact during the earily stages of a pregnancy we're all female. Explain to me why you have nipples?\n \n \nWhat church? what are you talking about? are you just claiming that all churches are some how linked?\n\n \n If I had meant all churches I would have said so.\n \n \nthat we all believe the same things? by saying THE CHURCH i will take it you are refering to the Catholic church? if that is the case then I will have to take a lot of time to educate you on what the Catholic Church really is, and how much Christians (or at least me) despise it.\n\n \n The vast majority of Christians in the world are Catholic. You are just a minor hereasy.\n \n \nNope, sorry a christian can only accept evolution if God triggered this evolving process and if evolution will accept Genisis.\n\n \n Evolution has nothing at all to do with how life got started, or even how the Earth was made.\n \n \nSo as an evolutionist does that make you religious then? evolution is an expression of a belief...\n\n \n Hardly. Evoulation is not a belief it is a fact. Belief is irrelevant.\n \n \nNo there are many original manuscripts and many translations of those manuscripts.\n\n \n Again hardly. Which manuscipts? The ones added or the ones removed. And there or no originals.\n \n \nThat's very polite of you. Good space saver.

   "Like I said Charchuk, I got no debate with you, but frankly that statement makes me sad.\n\n \n Because you can't actually offering anything which mets this?\n \n \nFirstly the whole point of Christianity is that we never know for sure until we die... the belief is called FAITH (in Jesus), without faith you cannot be saved from an eternity in hell.\n\n \n Wrong, Christianity also teaches that faith is the samething as knowledge. Several Christians on here even stated such. That faith is evidence enough.\n \n \nIf you knew anything of Christianity you wouldn't have even made that statement because PROOF will only come during the events of Revelations, and when that occures it will be to late for the lost souls.\n\n \n Oh, I know quite a bit about Christianity. More so than many Christians know about it.\n \n Actually, when they were first going to add the BoR many Christians of the time didn't wanted it added because they felt that it directly contradicted Christ's teachings. Plus, the BoR is made of a group of letters written by John of Potmost to the churches in Asia Minor about his interpreations of the Book of Daniel, world politics of the time (He thought that Nero was the anti-Christ since 666 is the symbol for Nero's name).\n \n \nI know that will probably just get a \"Deleted Preaching\" or something like that, but just thought I'd let you know you will never get verifible evidence... God won't let it happen.\n\n \n That is because you can't prove a negative.\n \n I would change god to the Big Blue Banana and it would still mean the same thing. All religious claims are equal.",

   "Science does not include God. I asked YOU to tell me how your theory works... where does God come into it! What's so hard about that? It should be easy - after-all you believe in it! I asked YOU to explain how you've fitted God into the scheme of things. I asked you to point to any site that announces this theory. I can point to Orthdox sites to ellaborate what I believe in! It's rather unfair then that I can't examine your theory.\n\n \n I don't have a theory about how God fits into the scheme of things. I have a BELIEF about how God fits into the scheme of things. If I say I believe God created the universe with the big bang, what are you going to examine? It's a belief, not something you can examine or test.\n \n \nGod is not dealt with by evolutionary theory, because most of the theorists don't believe in God. If they did, you'd be able to say something along the lines of 'evolution started at this point, but before that GOD was involved.\n\n \n How is God dealt with in any of the other scientific theories? What part does God play in the theory of relativity?\n \n \nYou'd be able to answer me too instead of resorting to your typical insulting ploys. Instead you say it is because it has NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE. Well, God must have been there somewhere in your theory, because you say that he started 'it' off! What is 'it'? That's a most unsatisfactory theory.\n\n \n It's not a theory you numbskull, it's a belief. I really do promise myself that I won't make those kind of statements about you any more. But your responses are sometimes so idiotic that I get to laughing and then spout off something before I regain control. Sorry about that.\n \n \nThe theories of evolutionaries don't include God anywhere... and neither do you, because I've asked you to show me your theory. You can't grasp this, because at heart, you too realise the two are mutually exclusive - God and naturalistic theories... that is after-all what naturalistic theories like evolution are about - 'natural' explanations not 'God' explanations.\n\n \n BINGO!!!!! LOL\n \n \nAnywhere you want to introduce God to the process, I bet I can find naturalistic explanations that have the backing of the other evolutionaries on this board\n\n \n I believe God created the universe. \n \n \nIt was your analogy!

   "I'd be very interested in your belief. I hope I haven't given anyone the impression that I want to blast there beliefs or force my beliefs on them, cause I didn't intend that, I believe God gave man a free will for a reason and it's everyones choice to exercise it.\n\n \n No you haven't given the impression that you wanted to blast someone's beliefs. I was just wondering if my beliefs were truly of any interest to you.\n \n I believe that God set up all the scientific laws and created the universe through what we now call the big bang. The universe is immense and therefore the probability there is life on other planets is good. That he is not interfering with the progress of life but is watching to see what is happening. That mankind, and maybe others on other planets, has developed to the point where God has taken a somewhat personal interest. That we have developed a primitive conscience that is evolving with time. That a personal relationship is now possible with God. That when the Bible says God breathed into them the breath of life, it may well have been something that actually happened but more likely was mankind's awareness of a developing identity with God. I do not believe there is a hell as I believe in a loving God similar to a parent that is not interested or petty enough to eternally torture his creations for minor or major infractions. That mankind is getting more God-like in the sense that he is becoming more caring about his fellow man. That occasionally someone comes along, like Jesus, Buddha, St. Frances, etc. that is closely in tune with the will of God and as human beings the God part of us reacts to that. (And that is the main reason I never became an atheist when I was struggling with my beliefs.) That the development of mankind's relations with God in the future will be mankind's greatest achievement. And I believe that the universe, and scientific knowledge has shown the amazing love that God has for his creations. I believe there is some kind of afterlife but I'm not too concerned as I place my belief in a loving God.\n \n Of course there is a lot more than that but that's the jest of it. I have used phrases like 'God is watching' in an effort to describe something that is not describable for a deity that I believe is not physical but an all-powerful force.\n \n \nI'm not really sure at what level I believe in evolution, I frankly don't know enough about the theories/facts to make an educated decision... for me it's safe not to really worry about how we were created and whether or not it was in 6 literal days or 6 billion years... frankly I don't think I'm at either of the extremes, but I'm not really sure where I stand on this particular issue...\n\n \n I can understand and appreciate that. If you are truly interested in the facts, there are several at this board that are very knowledgeable about the subject. I would point out that the theory of evolution is the backbone of biology. Like the theory of relativity is the backbone of astronomy. I have no problem with those that admit they don't know much about it or those that have ligimate questions but are willing to look at the evidence. I do care that there are those that are only interested in maintaining their dogmatic beliefs and don't care that mankind would be reverting backwards by ignoring that evidence. The first step towards understanding evolution and many of the other sciences is accepting the age of the earth. This is the best website I have every seen that was written by a Bible believing scientist who has no agenda to push. You might find it as interesting as I did.\n \n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens.html\n \n \nI don't pretend to know it all and am always looking for truth...\n\n \n IMO the philosophy of a wise person.",

This is my point, since the majorty of Christian never actually read the bible through they will believe what they are told is in it instead of what is actually in it.

It seems to celebrate the creation of God. It also sound very similar to Babylonian creation stories such as the Enuma Elish. This suggests that the Genesis writer(s), since they believe God is creator, wanted to provide an alternative mythology or creation narrative that countered those that did not acknowledge Yahweh (vs. other gods of that time). The Genesis 2 account seems more serious and more focused about what it means for man to be in God's image. \n \n I suggest we all re-read Gen. 1 & 2 and then continue on...They really aren't the same stories.\n \n In the Genesis 2 account, there is room for things to have been created with the potential to evolve and develop. That is why current theological scholarship, even those in the mainline evangelical vein, are leaning towards dialogue with science. The idea is not to assume science is anti-creation (or anti-God or anti-Christian) but rather recognize that they observe and document the visible facts of our exsitence and broaden the perspective with the metaphysics and power of God. Science does not admit to all the answers (except those on the margins). \n \n -peace",

   "scombridae1969 might I enquire as to what denomination you belong to?\n \n \"Evolution (in the Scientific Sense) is Inherently Godless...\n We saw that the NABT definition states that evolution is by definition 'unsupervised. This requirement is not a conclusion that Darwinsits reach from empirical evidence, but a philosophical assumption that reflects their starting point in metaphysical naturalism or materialism. If nature is all there is, then nature had to be able to do its own creating. That implies the existence eof a naturalistic evolutionary process capable of making very complex things from simple beginnings. The process must be unguided at first, because a mind capable of guiding evolution would itself have to evolve from non-living matter. Once human being have evolved, of course, evolution can become a guided process, through practice of eugenics and genetic engineering.\n Given these assumptions, something at least roughly like Darwinism simple has to be true, regardless of the evidence. Evolution has to start with chance or random changes, and it has to have some mindless guiding force capable of producing the wonders of complex engineering that we call organisms. That is why Richard Dawkins ahs argued in lectures that, if complex life exists on other planets, Darwinian evolution would have to be responsible for it. There is no need for evidence or observations, because the Darwinian mechanism is the only plausible candidate for the job, given the starting point in naturalism. This logic explains why Darwinists are unperturbed by all the evidentiary problems that critics... have identified. The theory has to be true regardless, because otherwise we would be without a materialist explanation for life's complexity and we would have to turn to God.\n This logic has been succinctly encapsulated in...(an essay by geneticist Richard Lewontin):\n 'We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the tolerance eof the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are force by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counterintuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door'\n \n There is no need to say more. We cans see the profound truth of Fr Seraphim's comment that \"Evolution would never have been though of by men who believe in the God whom Orthodox Christians worship.\" Once the Divine Foot is in the door, there is no reason to postulate wether legions of unobservable fossil ancestors, or a mindless material process that performs wonders of creation\"\n \n from pp60-61 of Fr Seraphim Rose \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision\".",

Many writers including myself continually mix up the terms science with scientist. I have done so here.\n \n However your final sentence is only a half-story. Science is based on theories as interpreted by scientists; who are themselves biased. Science can easily be based on belief.\n \n That is why there are 4 schools of thought that I'm aware of that deal with the ascent of man. All of them are based on 'objective' truths (evidence), but the moment a scientist looks at the evidence it has to be interpreted - for it to have any meaning, and then becomes 'subjective'.

So long as God is not mentioned all these theories are presented as valid. Your assumption about a separation between science and theology is interestingly modern.\n \n The Ancient Greeks, such as the Pythagoreans studied science in order to understand their gods. All the way down history to people like Newton who hoped to find the laws by which God set the universe in train.\n \n Your statement has been arrived at because for many scientists, there is NO God for them to study. The separation of these two thoughts is logical only when you believe that science is 'pure', 'logical' etc, and religion is about 'speculation', 'faith', 'irrational feelings'\n \n Fortunately there is a growing body of Christian scientists who are using science to look for Intelligent Design.\n \n Even agnostic/atheist scientists look for some non-natural causes -ie.

It can't.\n \n \nI have yet to see any theory of Evolution which mentions an active and participatory God.\n\n \n I have yet to see a plumbing manual which mentions an active and participatory God. Are you telling me that plumbing also \"actively excludes God?\" I never saw a computer manual which mentions an active and participatory God. Are you telling me that computer science \"actively excludes God?\"\n \n [quote]Evolution excludes God from matters to which He has already been credited - the creation of life, of all life.\n \n Barbarian observes:\n Evolutionary theory has nothing to say about the origin of life. The Cartoon Theory of Evolution is like that, but science doesn't use that one.\n \n \nIn 'theory' evolutionary theory is a separate issue,\n\n \n Since it is a theory, that's the point. Evolutionary theory is not about the origin of life. That being so, it can't address that issue at all.\n \n \nIt becomes a philosophical issue. People are merely accepting that 'evolution happened' but based on what?\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n Scientists accept it, based on:\n Anatomy\n Fossil record\n Embryology\n Genetics\n Molecular biology\n Geology\n Among others.\n \n \nDarwin's Theory caught the attention of scientists long before embryology, or a substantive fossil record etc.\n\n \n True. Darwin simply noted the evidence in existing living things, and on that evidence, prepared a theory that turned out to be correct. Subsequent evidence has confirmed his theory, although it has been revised in parts. He was wrong about acquired traits, for example, and Huxley turned out to be correct in asserting that he put too much faith in gradualism.\n \n \nThe conclusion was for the most part already reached - then the 'facts' that fit the theory were worked out later.\n\n \n Yes. One of the most important tests of a theory for it to make predictions that can be verified. So when we started to find intermediates, or when genetics explained why new traits don't disappear in a population, and so on, this was powerful evidence that Darwin was correct.\n \n \nSo long as God is not mentioned all these theories are presented as valid. Your assumption about a separation between science and theology is interestingly modern.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n It goes back to Democritus, who observed that attributing Gods to things not understood would lead to a proliferation of Gods. LaPlace, about 200 years ago, observed that God was not part of science.\n \n \nYes there have always been nut-cases.\n\n \n Democritus inferred the existance of atoms in a number of very clever experiments. Laplace was one of the great mathematicians of all times, who made important contributions in probability, astronomy, and calculus.\n \n \nHowever it is only in modern times that a need for a theory that has no God - where man is able to write his own rules is modern. (just as 'atoms' were first mentioned by the Greeks (your friend Democritus)- I hardly think that's atomic theory)\n\n \n Nevertheless, his reasoning was correct. He used a clepshydra, for example, to show that air must be made of matter, and that it must be atoms, which would have to be too small to perceive.\n \n To expect science to support your notion of God is to expect too much of science. It just can't do it. \n \n Fortunately, there are other ways to find God. Use one of them.",

   "Ah, okay. Yes some science is godless, I agree. (see below re: Intelligent Design)\n \n Maths is godless but it is different. The difference with evolution is that it actively excludes God.\n \n Also, before I go on I must point out that there is a problem of stating one's belief which another might find abhorrent. I'm not intentionally out to insult, but I must state things as true, where I believe them to be.\n \n God is not a factor in Maths because the Bible makes no claim about God and Maths - the Bible doesn't say 2 + 2 = 4 only because of the power of God.\n \n Evolution excludes God from matters to which He has already been credited - the creation of life, of all life.\n \n I think I quoted from Orthodox sources about the innate godlessness of evolution - see reference to Fr Seraphim Rose. This godlessness is not as I suggest with Maths - a mere product of the nature of Maths - but an active exclusion of God, which is evil; to actively exclude God (who is Good) is to give in to evil. \n\n \n If you were in charge would you dictate that evolution not be taught or studied? What would you do with all the evidence that points to evolution?\n \n \nI take this point. Many writers including myself continually mix up the terms science with scientist. I have done so here.\n \n However your final sentence is only a half-story. Science is based on theories as interpreted by scientists; who are themselves biased. Science can easily be based on belief.\n\n \n Scientific theories are not &#8216;interpreted&#8217; by scientist, they are tested by scientist and by anyone else that would like to learn enough to do the test. Scientist are indeed biased. However they are biased in different directions. So when they all agree that a theory is supported by evidence, where does bias come into play? Do you believe there is a grand conspiracy by the scientific community and everyone else that is able to read the data to falsify the evidence?\n \n \nThat is why there are 4 schools of thought that I'm aware of that deal with the ascent of man. All of them are based on 'objective' truths (evidence), but the moment a scientist looks at the evidence it has to be interpreted - for it to have any meaning, and then becomes 'subjective'. Scientists have their own beliefs/feelings/assumptions as to which set of evidence is correct. \n\n \n I have used an analogy of a structure to explain this point that you never responded to. So I&#8217;ll try a different analogy. In our country, and I assume in yours also, we often have murder trials. And most of the time the murderer is convicted on circumstantial evidence. No one saw the murder and no one knows exactly how the murder was committed. There may be convincing evidence that the murder was committed by striking the head with a blunt instrument. So suppose there was overwhelming evidence that John committed the crime. But the defense made the perfectly valid argument that the prosecution could not determine what weapon was used in the murder because the prosecution&#8217;s expert had said he believed it was a baseball bat but the defense had an expert that said he believed it was the handle of an axe. I don&#8217;t think anyone would agree that John should be found innocent simply because the exact murder weapon could not be determined. And that is exactly the case you are arguing. That because the exact method of man&#8217;s ascent cannot be determined at this time, then evolution should be scraped even though there is a vast body of evidence that evolution did occur. \n \n You say that the interpretation of evidence is &#8216;subjective&#8217;. So I will ask you if you believe the earth rotates around the sun and if so, do you question this based on the interpretation of the evidence being &#8216;subjective&#8217;? And if not, why not?\n \n You have stated that the Orthodox Church did not participate in the trial of Galileo which used the Bible verses regarding the stopping of sun to prove him wrong. But did something happen that the Bible was referring to? Did the earth stop rotating or is that just considered an illustration of some moral story?\n \n How old does the Orthodox Church teach the earth is or if it doesn&#8217;t teach anything about it, how old do you think the earth is?\n \n \nI am unaware of where you did. You made mention to 'loony beliefs but then said that this didn't reflect on this, but on the theory of Crick with regard to exobiogenesis. \n\n \n I don&#8217;t believe I know what the theory of Crick is.\n \n \nWhat evidence? 'Evolution happened' must be based on evidence, but when you have four conflicting theories then all you are doing is accepting that 'evolution happened' but have no real proof.

So long as God is not mentioned all these theories are presented as valid. Your assumption about a separation between science and theology is interestingly modern.\n \n The Ancient Greeks, such as the Pythagoreans studied science in order to understand their gods. All the way down history to people like Newton who hoped to find the laws by which God set the universe in train.\n \n Your statement has been arrived at because for many scientists, there is NO God for them to study. The separation of these two thoughts is logical only when you believe that science is 'pure', 'logical' etc, and religion is about 'speculation', 'faith', 'irrational feelings'\n\n \n There are library&#8217;s full of research that shows the evidence supports evolution. There has been evidence presented here on this board that shows the evidence supports evolution. However your beliefs do not allow for evolution. Therefore nothing could be presented at this time to convince you. I assume that in the future should the leaders of your church decide the evidence is just too convincing to ignore and that the Bible and your traditions need to be reinterpreted in order to allow for that, then you would change your mind. But that is speculation on my part.\n \n It is true that before current freedoms were in place and modern science was established, that almost everyone believed that God or gods influenced natural events. It is also true that many scientists are atheist. But not all scientist are atheist. And science is pure and logical although scientist are not pure and logical. However either there is a vast conspiracy to deceive the general public by all scientists or the evidence supports evolution.\n \n \nFortunately there is a growing body of Christian scientists who are using science to look for Intelligent Design.\n \n Even agnostic/atheist scientists look for some non-natural causes -ie.

That because the exact method of man's ascent cannot be determined at this time, then evolution should be scraped even though there is a vast body of evidence that evolution did occur. \n\n \n What vast evidence? There's so much that there's evidence for theory a, b, c and d. If you took someone to trial (using your analogy) and said \"We believe this man was killed, but there's only the certainty that he's dead - there's evidence he was gassed, or poisoned, or shot, or run-over or electrocuted - and although we've got experts to each put forward these theories - they say that only their theory is correct. The judge just rules 'the man is dead'. This is the same with evolution, the judge just rules 'God is dead'. He doesn't know by which path we came to being, but none of them involve God -that's enough.\n \n \nYou say that the interpretation of evidence is 'subjective'. So I will ask you if you believe the earth rotates around the sun and if so, do you question this based on the interpretation of the evidence being 'subjective'? And if not, why not? \n\n \n For now we believe it to be so. We didn't always. The fact that it does do something did not depend on us believing it to be so. Our interpretation has changed.\n \n Likewise, I once asked Crim - how do you know the sun is still there? (Assuming that it's day time). He said, you only have to see the sunlight - but the sun might have exploded. It takes time for the light to travel here, so what you experience - the sun's presence is only subjective. Each moment of each day, you won't know that the sun hasn't exploded, except by looking back and saying it didn't 7 seconds ago.\n \n \nYou have stated that the Orthodox Church did not participate in the trial of Galileo which used the Bible verses regarding the stopping of sun to prove him wrong. But did something happen that the Bible was referring to? Did the earth stop rotating or is that just considered an illustration of some moral story?\n\n \n I went further than that. I said that at a particular time within that Church they went against their own traditions.\n \n \nHow old does the Orthodox Church teach the earth is or if it doesn't teach anything about it, how old do you think the earth is? \n\n \n I have read some on the subject. All that I recall is that there is agreement that the six days creation is literal. When that six days happened, I don't know... but writers such as Fr. Seraphim Rose suggest only thousands of years ago. I personally believe Fr. Seraphim Rose.\n \nI am unaware of where you did. You made mention to 'loony beliefs but then said that this didn't reflect on this, but on the theory of Crick with regard to exobiogenesis. \n\n \n \nI don't believe I know what the theory of Crick is. \n\n \n He explained the origins of life on earth in terms of aliens building rocket ships filled with DNA/genetic materials and sending these off into space; one landed here.\n \nWhat evidence?

But that is speculation on my part.\n\n \n Yes, there's so much evidence as to support a plethora of theories. As illustrated above.\n \n There's Nazi theories on Evolution, Marxist theories on Evolution, Lesbian-Feminist theories on Evolution. All of them using science because to achieve political ends. Most scientists are more subtle, wanting to undermine Christian values, without realising it.\n \n Earlier I posted a quote from Feminists who used science to 'prove' women could not achieve orgasm through normal penetrative sex (with men). Their conclusion that any woman who claimed to have actually had an orgasm from such a manner was plainly deceiving themselves, because it went against their scientific theory. They had the facts to back themselves up - men were tricksters enslaving women.\n \n \nIt is true that before current freedoms were in place and modern science was established, that almost everyone believed that God or gods influenced natural events. It is also true that many scientists are atheist. But not all scientists are atheists. And science is pure and logical although scientists are not pure and logical. However either there is a vast conspiracy to deceive the general public by all scientists or the evidence supports evolution. \n\n Most scientists believe their own propaganda that science is pure. In a sense it is, but once a scientist starts to work on it, it becomes corrupted.\n \nFortunately there is a growing body of Christian scientists who are using science to look for Intelligent Design.\n \n Even agnostic/atheist scientists look for some non-natural causes -ie. Intelligent Design.\n Cryptography - search for meaning in apparently meaningless matter \n\n \nIntelligent Design is a code word for creationism and is being used to try and 'get around' recent court decisions regarding bringing religion into the science classroom. By definition science is the study of natural causes so looking for 'non-natural' causes is by definition not science. About the same 'scientist' that support Intelligent Design support creationism. \n\n \n Really? So you reject looking for ID (intelligent design) in the fields of forensic science, cryptography because of the 'creationist' curse?",

   "[QUOTE=Hank]I have admitted that I believe in God.\n \n Yes, I am aware of this. I do not mean to insult in the following but must state what I believe - your image of God is not the true image of God. It lessens Him, by taking away from Him His role as an active loving, creative God.\n \n \nThen as I said, there is no reason for me to waste my time presenting evidence to someone that is not interested in the evidence, but only in making sure it is interpreted to support a belief. And that is why people like me that support science don't want creationism in the science classes. It's the opposite of science. Instead of looking at the evidence and making theories that fit the evidence, creationist want to look at the belief and make theories that fit that belief, regardless of the evidence. \n\n \n Indeed. I too am not about trying to convince you. There are countless people reading our debates who are 'undecided'. By presenting a case in, I hope, a rational manner it is my wish to help encourage these people to see that there is in fact, a case.\n \n I recognise that for most of my arguments I am arguing a negative - to create doubt. The reason for this is based on a few things\n a) my lack of a general scientific education (hence I won't discuss pseudogenes - what ever they are).\n b) fighting fire with fire - many posters here are convinced that evolution is 'rational' 'reasonable' etc. My own pedantic nature calls me to question what people mean when they throw terminolgoies around. Foe many they use the wrong terms to put forward a case - their reasoning is based therefore on flawed logic. It is easier for me to convince people of this, then it is of the truth of Orthodoxy.\n \n I do believe that there is a bit of a lack of self-awareness in your argument. Many people believe that they are open minded and criticise me for being 'close minded' - that if only they could present me with enough evidence - I'd realise the truth. A process ignoring the fact that their truth is not THE truth - and that just because I don't believe it, doesn't make me close minded.\n \n If you were convicted of a murder (that you didn't commit) and your mum stood by you, year after year, no matter how much evidence was brought forth - some might just call her stubborn. I would call her 'just' and 'loving', and 'faithful'.\n \n So, no matter how much 'evidence' you bring forth I will be refuting it. Does this make me close-minded? I think not.\n \n You used an analogy of a court case - of a murder. What would you think if you were convicted of a murder (where everyone agrees it happened), but the prosecution team presented four fairly convincing, but equally, mutually exclusive theories on how you did it?\n \n I would be horrified if it happened to me. The amount of 'evidence' itself\n would suggest a fatal flaw in reasoning.\n \n \nThis is obviously false as I believe there is a God, that we are not here by accident of chance, and that we are important. And I believe the evidence proves evolution without a doubt. And there are billions of people that agree with me.\n\n \n I wouldn't say 'billions' :) But your understanding about the nature of Man, sin, etc is different from that of established (and to my mind authentic) Christian theology.\n \n \nCan you point out where this has happened?\n\n \n It happens throughout these posts. Several posters have tried to suggest that the church has been anti-progress. I'm amazed that you've not read these. Not just here, but on the Religion posts too.\n \n \nI can't speak for everyone of course but for myself and everyone I know that accepts evolution, they all started out in creationist believing background and switched because of the evidence.\n\n \n I disagree.\n \n I think as we grow up, we do start to question our beliefs. You switch on the tv and the clergy are ridiculed - some deservingly so. Tele-evangelists present only a shallow Christian message. You go to science class and they only teach one side - and it is 'fact'. Your own beliefs are assailed at every point.\n \n There's a whole teaching of relativism, that what's right for you may not be right for some - undermining the TRUTH.\n \n Even in entertainment there's godless mythologies that populate the screens.... one of my favourite shows - the various Star Trek series, is a glorification of the godless progression of man - what might be, if only we trust in science.\n \n Some return to their Church, but their Church itself has trouble helping because it's own foundations are false... that it was established by man and not by God.\n \n You question your own Church - why are there so many branches of Christianity - if there's only one truth - the very existence of your Church may serve as an argument against TRUTH.\n \n I went to a Catholic school, which should have strengthened me in that religion. I did not. Bad teachers were a start. Teachers teaching evolution was another - religious class teaching me that God is an interventionist God, biology telling me the opposite.\n \n I did not believe in evolution and was ridiculed by class and teacher because of it - in the intersts of 'education'. So much for 'open mindedness'\n \n All of these things, cultural, peer, education all whittling away at your beliefs in God. Some people begin to push God out of life completely, some only as far back as the big-bang.",

I think not.\n\n \n Most mothers would do that but I would call her biased.\n \n What makes you close-minded is that you are uneducated in the area and are not will to look at the evidence in an objective manner since you have already decided it is wrong not matter what the evidence is. That is the definition of close-minded.\n \n \nYou used an analogy of a court case - of a murder. What would you think if you were convicted of a murder (where everyone agrees it happened), but the prosecution team presented four fairly convincing, but equally, mutually exclusive theories on how you did it?\n \n I would be horrified if it happened to me. The amount of 'evidence' itself\n would suggest a fatal flaw in reasoning. \n\n \n It would suggest that only one of the theories was correct, but if the evidence convincingly showed that I had committed the murder, then regardless of &#8216;how&#8217; I committed the murder, I would still be guilty.

   "There is some evidence against it. There is some in favour of it. How you decide which is truth - (considering that as far as the Ascent of Man - you're quite happy to live with conflicting evidence) is based on your a priori beliefs about the nature of things - I do the same. Only I'm the only one admitting to this. \n\n \n \nYou keep talking about conflicting evidence. Show me this Ascent of Man you are talking about that conflicts with TOE.\n\n \n If you can't see any internal conflicts then I can't explain any better. The Theory of Evolution - which you believe is 'fact' or 'true' based on evidence that doesn't agree with each other on the most important 'how'. All it agrees with is a conclusion. So, if I were to ask you 'how' you wouldn't know. Yet you accept the findings. Happily unconcerned with the experts who all disagree with each other.\n \n For you the answer must be that TOE just 'is'. If I ask you 'how' you can't tell me with any certainty. That is not scientific. That is a philosophical stance. And in that sense, it is no more valid than mine.\n \n \nHere is your double-standard. You only accept the evidence from science that backs your opinion up. I mentioned one scientist in particular; Michael Behe who supports a different interpretation of the 'evidence'.\n\n \n \nYes Michael Behe supports intelligent design. I have read some of his works and have also read the critiques of them. To my knowledge, every single issue he has raised has been thoroughly refuted by several biologists.\n It is true that there are a very few scientist that are educated in the field that does not support evolution. That is true of every human endeavour. But suppose someone designed and built a bridge and 1000 structural engineers checked the design and every one said it would not hold the weight of a truck. If the design engineer assured you it would, would you drive the truck across that bridge?\n\n \n Yes, and Michael Behe has counter-refuted. That is my point. Who is right is based on our a priori beliefs.\n \n Your analogy with the engineers is an interesting one to use... because evolutionaries would not be so apt to agree and evolution is not as exact and measurable a science. I just find it interesting you using an exact science - as an analogy to evolution.\n \n \nThis is what I mean by no insight. If you can get your head around this, that your a priori belief allows you only to accept the interpretations that agree with you. I do the same, I acknowledge the wisdom of Creationists who are scientists...\n\n \n \nYou don?t seem to understand that my priori belief was creationism. I changed after taking a good and extensive look at the evidence. It wasn?t easy because people don?t change what they have been taught from childhood very easily. But I couldn?t just ignore all the evidence. I don?t just accept interpretations, I can look at the evidence myself. That doesn?t mean that when the subject gets very detailed that I don?t depend on the experts.\n\n \n You changed your whole opinion of God. I read the extensive tract that you gave in the religion post. Evolution fits in with your a priori concept of an unjudgemental God... one who might have started the ball-rolling, but doesn't interfere any more. Your whole system may have shifted, but it has settled. Your belief is that science is now in accordance with your religious beliefs and visa versa; when you look at the debate, this becomes your a priori reasoning.\n \n \nAnd, we are also arguing about the Orthodox interpretation of Genesis too - you argue that it isn't literal. Have you read the Orthodox Church Father's. I bet you haven't because you've already made up your mind that it's not literal. Therefore you only read the conclusions that agree with you. \n\n \n \nI have read arguments both in favor of interpreting Genesis literal and non-literal. I doubt the Orthodox have a different slant than what I have already read. But if you have something I?ll be glad to take a look.\n\n \n a) the arguments are theological\n b) I'd have to know what exactly you've read, and what exactly that states in order to know what Orthodox tracts I could recommend - not an easy task. But, by logical deduction I doubt much of what you've read is based on theology, so see a)\n \n \n Yes, pure logic tells you that weak animals/lucky animals will pass on their inheritance. You'd prefer a tautology, fine.\n I mentioned turtles ... they are picked off as they scramble to the sea. Unless you're going to propose a theory that says gulls only pick off the weak... they don't.

For those that are all about the same speed, then it would not matter which ones made it as far as speed was concerned.\n\n \n I've seen many documentaries of turtles. When I see a random group of turtles all making their way down to the sea and a gull walks amongst them picking one off, then you've either got to realise\n a) luck is a factor\n or\n b) that the gulls are doing turtles a favour by only selectively taking the weak and useless turtles.\n \n \nAccording to your ?theory?, if luck were the only survival mechanism, then there should be turtles with all different speeds that are trying to get to the sea. The evidence doesn?t indicate that.\n\n \n No. I didn't say luck was the only factor. I said luck was a factor, not factored into evolution. As is cowardice. A moment ago you hit upon it. You said that speed is not a factor. When I've observed the gulls, they kill turtles at random. That is luck. That is chance, that is what evolution is about - chance. Randomness. Luck!\n \n \nIt is abundantly clear that 'fittest' doesn't even enter into such situations.\n\n \n \nThen why are there not an equal amount of ?slow? turtles?\n\n \n Show me how 'speed' is inherited. It is a nonsense of evolution. Antelope and lions aren't progressively getting faster and faster, turtles aren't either. Why? Because\n a) there is an optimum level of performance that they can't go past\n and\n b) speed is not the only factor in survival for turtles, lion, antelope etc.\n \n \nSurvival of the Fittest is a tautology that just means those animals that survive, survive. \n\n \n \nWhat would you like to call the fact that say ?weak? lions don?t reproduce?\n\n \n How do you know? I gave the example of deer before - that two great hulky male deer could clash horns so hard that they interlock. They will die like that. Along comes the cowardly male deer that then gets to mate.\n \n As to lions... what makes you believe that the strongest lion is the most fit? What if a weak lion's genes are better suited to drought conditions? By the very fact that only the biggest lion wins (by your theory) only its genes are passed on, so unless it's got all genetic bases covered, (fitness, speed, endurance, strength, drought resistance, etc) then evolution doesn't make sense.\n \n Luck can occur - a male lion can be shot by poachers, caught in a bushfire, run down by a truck, struck by lightning, taken by a crocodile etc, and the 'weak' male lion has all the pride to itself.\n \n You believe that only the 'strong' will survive. That's not evolution. Evolution is much more about luck... see a list of the destruction of some of the biggest, strongest animals that have ever lived. From recent giants such as the Irish Elk, to more famous ones such as the T-Rex. The environment changed and all their 'suitability' went down the toilet. Some lucky animals survived - those that had the right stuff for the new environment. The T-Rex battling others to see who would mate, to pass his genes on, that went down the toilet too!\n \n And here's the rub... all your big lions doing the 'I am biggest, I will pass my genes on' comes to nothing, because in the end, a major global disaster could bring his efforts to nothing. It is luck.\n \n \nI don't know that it ever came up. Remember too, that scientific opinion at the time was vastly against Galileo - however you can easily forget that, and because you know in hindsight that Galileo was right, you can pick on the Catholic Church - and science is the winner either way. \n\n \n \nWell that is like saying that Iraq was a democracy because Saddam was voted into office.

As soon as the evidence begin to appear and as soon as scientist were able to disagree with the Church, that was corrected. Science is a self-correcting enterprise. \n\n \n And this is the first time you've admitted that the scientists were wrong! If they were self-correcting, they were still wrong with their theory about the geocentric system. But for you, and this again highlights your bias, even when they were wrong, it's because they were under pressure from the evils of the church (and yes I know you didn't use the word 'evil')\n \n Then why did the science continue? How did it survive in such a climate? Did the scientists all take their knowledge underground, or did the Church change its opinion, after enough scientists presented evidence in favour of Galileo (which would negate your conspiracy of silence argument)\n \n \nYou never answered my question as to why you believe the earth rotates around the sun. Is there some reason you haven?t?\n\n \n In my many years of adulthood I have never given it any thought. As I got tested on it in school, however, I probably studied what theory I was given.\n \n \nI know - I was implying that had you met an number your statement would not have been true... as the only Christians you seem to know are non-Orthodox.\n\n \n \nSo you are saying that if you changed the statement I made it would not be true?

Besides I wasn?t even talking about Christians, I was talking about the people I knew that believed in evolution.\n\n \n I was implying that, yes. That had you met a great many Orthodox, then your statement about knowing a lot of people who believed in evolution would have to have changed - though I know some Orthodox who believe in evolution too.",

So, if I were to ask you 'how' you wouldn't know. Yet you accept the findings. Happily unconcerned with the experts who all disagree with each other.\n\n \n I wasn&#8217;t asking for an explanation. I just don&#8217;t know what evidence you are talking about. You have talked about the four or five or whatever it was theories about the Descent of man. I haven&#8217;t seen any link or reference to anything I can read about. I&#8217;ll be glad to take a look if I knew what you were talking about. However I would probably be inclined to lean towards one of the hypothesis. But the hypothesis about the Descent of man is a small part of the overall TOE. So if you were to ask me &#8216;how&#8217;, I would say that I think it was according to one of the hypothesis but that I was open to the other hypothesis as more evidence is discovered.\n \n Christians don&#8217;t agree on how to interpret the Bible. Yet you accept that Christians are saved based on their acceptance of Jesus as the Christ. Happily unconcerned with the experts who all disagree with each other.\n \n \nFor you the answer must be that TOE just 'is'. If I ask you 'how' you can't tell me with any certainty. That is not scientific. That is a philosophical stance. And in that sense, it is no more valid than mine. \n\n \n What do you want to know? I can give you answers to general questions. Others like Barbarian can give answers on more detailed questions like your thread on the eye.\n \n Science is never &#8216;certain&#8217; if by certain you mean 100% sure that something is true. However the theories of science are based on evidence that we have at this time. \n \n \nYes, and Michael Behe has counter-refuted. That is my point. Who is right is based on our a priori beliefs.\n\n \n No, who is right is based on what a huge majority of scientist say, not a lone wolf. If 99% of evolutionary biologist were saying what Behe was saying, I would believe what he is saying.\n \n \nYour analogy with the engineers is an interesting one to use... because evolutionaries would not be so apt to agree and evolution is not as exact and measurable a science. I just find it interesting you using an exact science - as an analogy to evolution. \n\n \n You are totally wrong. Structural engineering is a long way from being an exact science. I know, as that&#8217;s my field of expertise. Structural engineers would never be able to agree on exactly what weight of truck would make the bridge fail. But they would all be able to agree on a truck that weighted so much that the bridge would definitely fail. And that is exactly the same with evolutionary science and all other science for that matter. Scientist do not agree on the exact details of how some animals or plants evolved, but the evidence is convincing that animals and plants did evolve.\n \n The same thing happens in other areas of human study. For instance look at Christianity. As a general rule, Christians agree on what is necessary for salvation, but disagree on the details of what to believe about God. But there are a small group of Christians out there that believe they are the only ones that are saved. \n \n \nYou changed your whole opinion of God. I read the extensive tract that you gave in the religion post. Evolution fits in with your a priori concept of an unjudgemental God... one who might have started the ball-rolling, but doesn't interfere any more. Your whole system may have shifted, but it has settled. Your belief is that science is now in accordance with your religious beliefs and visa versa; when you look at the debate, this becomes your a priori reasoning. \n\n \n Originally my priori belief was creationism. That belief was changed when I looked at the evidence. Now it is true that my priori reasoning is that evolution is correct based on the evidence. However just like when the evidence convinced me that creationism was not correct, if new evidence was discovered that showed evolution was not correct, it would change my reasoning. So priori reasoning does not determine how I view the evidence. However you have admitted you would not change your mind no matter what the evidence because of your priori beliefs. That&#8217;s when priori belief comes into play.\n \n \na) the arguments are theological\n b) I'd have to know what exactly you've read, and what exactly that states in order to know what Orthodox tracts I could recommend - not an easy task. But, by logical deduction I doubt much of what you've read is based on theology, so see a) \n\n \n Well all religious arguments are theological by definition. But theological arguments are not scientific arguments.\n \n \nI've seen many documentaries of turtles. When I see a random group of turtles all making their way down to the sea and a gull walks amongst them picking one off, then you've either got to realise\n a) luck is a factor\n or\n b) that the gulls are doing turtles a favour by only selectively taking the weak and useless turtles. \n\n \n Yes luck is a factor in which individual turtle makes it. But evolution does not deal with individuals. Speed is a factor in which turtles are most likely to make it to the sea. Over a large group of turtles, that means that more turtles that are fast will make it. And the likelihood that a slow or defective turtle will make it is extremely low.\n \n There are no favors in natural selection. The gulls select more slow and defective turtles because they are exposed to the gulls longer.\n \n \nNo. I didn't say luck was the only factor. I said luck was a factor, not factored into evolution. As is cowardice. A moment ago you hit upon it. You said that speed is not a factor. When I've observed the gulls, they kill turtles at random. That is luck. That is chance, that is what evolution is about - chance. Randomness. Luck! \n\n \n No I didn&#8217;t say speed was not a factor. I said speed was not a factor in all the turtles that were the same speed. But all the turtles are not the same speed. That&#8217;s a huge difference.\n \n Even though gulls kill turtles at random, the turtles that are on the beach the longest are more likely to get killed. And that&#8217;s not luck, that&#8217;s a lack of speed.\n \n \nShow me how 'speed' is inherited. It is a nonsense of evolution. Antelope and lions aren't progressively getting faster and faster, turtles aren't either. Why? Because\n a) there is an optimum level of performance that they can't go past\n and\n\n \n Speed is inherited because the slow ones are more likely to get picked off in their trip to the sea. Therefore that trait is passed on.\n \n Yes there is an optimum level of performance that they can&#8217;t go past. And evolution keeps them at that optimum level. Otherwise they would in general deviate from that optimum level.\n \n \nb) speed is not the only factor in survival for turtles, lion, antelope etc. \n\n \n \n That&#8217;s correct, speed is not the only factor in survival for animals. But it&#8217;s not just surviving, it&#8217;s surviving and reproducing. The factors that give some individuals an advantage in surviving and reproducing are those factors (characteristics) that are passed on to offspring. That&#8217;s called evolution.\n \n \nHow do you know? I gave the example of deer before - that two great hulky male deer could clash horns so hard that they interlock. They will die like that. Along comes the cowardly male deer that then gets to mate.\n\n \n Again evolution does not deal with individuals. But to reply to your question, how often does that happen? Do female deer pick their mates from rivals or do they just accept whichever male deer happens to come along. Would a cowardly male deer be the only deer that was left in the forest or would the next &#8216;brave&#8217; deer be the mate? Or would it be that male deer that develop antlers that interlock with other male deer would be naturally de-selected and bred out and the result would be the reproduction of the most fit male deer that did not develop antlers that interlock with other male deer? The scenario that you give would be the least likely to occur. Not that it would never occur in an individual, just that it would be the least likely to occur.\n \n \nAs to lions... what makes you believe that the strongest lion is the most fit? What if a weak lion's genes are better suited to drought conditions? By the very fact that only the biggest lion wins (by your theory) only its genes are passed on, so unless it's got all genetic bases covered, (fitness, speed, endurance, strength, drought resistance, etc) then evolution doesn't make sense.\n \n Luck can occur - a male lion can be shot by poachers, caught in a bushfire, run down by a truck, struck by lightning, taken by a crocodile etc, and the 'weak' male lion has all the pride to itself.\n\n \n A &#8216;weak&#8217; lion would never have the pride all to itself. There is always competition among males for prides. And natural selection does cover all the bases. I&#8217;m not sure how speed and endurance help a male lion but fitness, strength and at times drought resistance would definitely figure into natural selection for a male lion. \n \n \nYou believe that only the 'strong' will survive. That's not evolution. Evolution is much more about luck... see a list of the destruction of some of the biggest, strongest animals that have ever lived. From recent giants such as the Irish Elk, to more famous ones such as the T-Rex. The environment changed and all their 'suitability' went down the toilet. Some lucky animals survived - those that had the right stuff for the new environment. The T-Rex battling others to see who would mate, to pass his genes on, that went down the toilet too!\n\n \n I never said only the &#8216;strong&#8217; will survive. Natural selection says the &#8216;fittest&#8217; will survive and reproduce. \n \n \nAnd here's the rub... all your big lions doing the 'I am biggest, I will pass my genes on' comes to nothing, because in the end, a major global disaster could bring his efforts to nothing. It is luck. \n\n \n I never said biggest either. And when a major global disaster comes along, many animals are no longer the fittest for their environment, exactly as explained by TOE. The key word is &#8216;fittest&#8217;, not strongest, or biggest, but &#8216;fittest&#8217;. The ones that are best fit for their environment.\n \n \nAnd this is the first time you've admitted that the scientists were wrong! If they were self-correcting, they were still wrong with their theory about the geocentric system. But for you, and this again highlights your bias, even when they were wrong, it's because they were under pressure from the evils of the church (and yes I know you didn't use the word 'evil')\n\n \n Then why do you use the word evil. It&#8217;s not evil to be mistaken about something. I guess some people might make the argument that forcing someone to believe a certain way is evil. But I didn&#8217;t make that argument.\n \n I have said all along that scientist look at the evidence and when new evidence doesn&#8217;t agree with current theory, scientist revised their theories.\n \n \nThen why did the science continue? How did it survive in such a climate? Did the scientists all take their knowledge underground, or did the Church change its opinion, after enough scientists presented evidence in favour of Galileo (which would negate your conspiracy of silence argument) \n\n \n Because with advancing technology so much evidence was found that it was impossible for the church to maintain any credibility while saying the earth was the center of the universe. That also caused people to realize that the church did not have scientific answers and that scientist should be the ones that determined science. The church did not place its trust in trying to determine the truth, but instead tried to maintain the power of the church. In the end, the truth won out.\n \n It wasn&#8217;t a conspiracy of silence, it was just that new ideas had to meet the approval of the church as long as the church had power. As the church began to lose power, scientific ideas began to flourish. \n \n \nIn my many years of adulthood I have never given it any thought. As I got tested on it in school, however, I probably studied what theory I was given. \n\n \n Well that&#8217;s my question. Why do you just accept the scientific theory that the earth rotates around the sun?\n \n \nI was implying that, yes. That had you met a great many Orthodox, then your statement about knowing a lot of people who believed in evolution would have to have changed - though I know some Orthodox who believe in evolution too.\n\n \n Like I said, if you just want to show that you can make by statement incorrect by changing the statement, then yes you can. I can do the same with yours. I still don&#8217;t see the point.",

You are acting very much like Kelvin does on the gun debate... wait days without commenting on something I post, then pretend you don't know anything about it, so I have to go back and re-list it\n \n Most recently on this thread\n Post 134 \"In Seach of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\" by Poirier, F E\"\n \n The actual schools of thought being first mentioned at Post 14 of \"The Evolution Debate Broken Down\",\n and at Post 26 of \"Looking for intelligence\"\n and again at Post 30 of \"Transitional fossils\"\n \n When we first ran into each other on these debates I urged you to read what I'd already written. However, you didn't even need to do that, because what is most disgusting about your 'act' is I mentioned them to you directly at post 243 of the \"Grudgingly conceding some points\" thread, which you replied to (but didn't talk about these schools), then announced you weren't going to debate me because I didn't define 'kind'... well you did come back into the debate against me and now come up with this line!\n \n They are for your reference:\n Uniplanar school\n Presapiens School\n Polyphyletic School\n Preneanderthal School\n \n Two of the posts also deal with other evidences that are highly rubbery, which still evolutionaries like to gloss over.\n In 1870 a Darwinist named Hyatt worked on specimens of ammonites and arranged them Aegoceras (oldest)-Androgynoceras-Liparoceras (youngest)\n In 1938 L F Spath looking at the same evidence arranged them Liparoceras (oldest)-Androgynoceras-Aegoceras (youngest)\n In 1963 Blockely said that they were all a variation of Androgynoceras, and the range was explained by sexual dimorphism.\n \n Further to that I have no wish to discuss any more with you as you are quite deliberately being dishonest. I suppose were we to continue, you'd avoid the question for a number of posts then feign ignorance again, because when we first met I asked you to comment on them. I have asked you four times to.

Creationists indeed seek to exploit these weaknesses in order to argue the merits of their case ? as if divine creation were a unique solution to the problems.\"\n http://www.eridu.co.uk/Author/human_origins/human_origins.html\n \n Evolutionaries say 'evolution happened' it is the best way of accounting for the evidences.\n \n But how? How did Man come to being?\n \n The evidences are so rich we have four conflicting theories.\n Uniplanar school\n Presapiens School*\n Polyphyletic School\n Preneanderthal School**\n \n Is Neanderthal closely related to us?\n \"In the next 2 decades the great majority of scholars were at the opinion that 1) Neanderthal was a separate species, and 2) our species completely replaced it until 30,000 BP\"\n http://www.rdos.net/copies/lapedo.htm\n \n These 'scholars' the same that would tell you that Evolution had to have happened, based on the evidence, couldn't even agree on what that evidence said (except that it 'must' prove evolution - no matter which way you look at it).\n Then these experts said they were more closely related.\n \"So in 1965 Neanderthals are H. sapiens neanderthalensis and modern humans are H. sapiens sapiens. But then they could mix without problem.\"\n Ibid\n Then...\n \"From 1978 neanderthalensis is no more than a subspecies...\" (Ibid) it is now a 'race'\n \n Neanderthals has shifted place time and time again, but all the while evolutionaries will tell you with authority that the evidence backs them up.\n \n In fact, they put forward this certainty in howling at creationists...\n \"Amazingly, a century after scientists knew otherwise, most creationists still believe that Neanderthals were merely modern humans...\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_neands.html\n What did scientists 'know' over that century? Well, as I've just shown, they've known that Neanderthal was a different creature, to a closely related creature, to a creature that's so closely related, it's a sub-species of man.\n \n What other scientific theory is so widely believed, yet so undeserving of our trust?\n \n Just how uncertain are they now?\n \"One of the great controversies of archaeology surrounds the origins of Homo sapiens sapiens. One group of scholars believes that Homo erectus populations throughout the world evolved independently, first into early Homo sapiens, then into fully modern humans. Thus, the modern geographic populations (races) of the world would have been separated for a long time, perhaps a million years. Most experts take a diametrically opposite view. They hypothesize that Homo sapiens sapiens evolved in Africa sometime between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, then spread to other parts of the Old World. Under this model, modern geographic populations are less than 100,000 years old.\n 2\n These two models represent extremes, which pit advocates of anatomical continuity against those who believe there was population replacement. Each model is based on the minute study of human fossil remains, but the replacement theory also relies on studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\"\n http://www.bartleby.com/67/24.html\n \n BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE\n The Soul-Substance Theory\n The Aquatic Ape Theory\n The Ancient Astronaut Theory\n \"All three theories are thus consistent with the established principles of evolutionary theory.\"\n http://www.eridu.co.uk/Author/human_origins/human_origins.html\n see links to these theories at same which claims that these are ' controversial' but less so than Creationism. :)\n \n \n *Although I've presented these before as well...

One lineage (presapiens) evolved directly into modern H. sapiens populations and closely resembles these modern forms at an early date. The second lineage (preneanderthals) evolved into the European Neanderthal populations of the earlier Wurm glaciation and subsequently became extinct.\n http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/glossaryp.htm\n \n **Preneanderthal Hypothesis: The theory, mainly applied to Europe, that proposes two separate lineages can be found in the Middle or Late Pleistocene.

   "Some years ago the problems of definitions arose again. I watched a doco on Neanderthal Man. He was proclaimed a different 'species'.\n \n How did Neanderthal vanish? That was one of the intriguing questions that they posed to scientists.\n \n One theory was that they inter-bred with humans. The resulting off-spring lost, over time, their distinctive \"Neanderthal\" features.\n \n I was intrigued by this becuase it suggested to me that if successful inter-breeding was possible - that therefore Neanderthal was not a separate species!\n \n \n \n Another testimony to the evolution of evolution....\n \"Biologists included principles from genetics in evolutionary theory during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, although many hominid (human ancestor) fossils had been found, there was little consensus amongst the scientists who had created 29 genera and 100 species, attributed to early man! Scientists accepted the descent of man from an extinct species of primate as a historical fact, but they could derive no clear description of the sequence of events from the available mass of data. Then, Ernst Mayr applied the systematic approach of classification to the hominid fossils, grouping fossils strictly according to the features that they have in common. Mayr reduced all the hominid (human ancestor) fossil records to three species, A. africanus (including small brained australopithecines), H. erectus (including the Java and Peking hominids - the archetypal Missing Link) and H. sapiens (including Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon). This focus proved the solution to the jigsaw puzzle of hominid fossils. It was not a perfect solution, but provided the basis for a much clearer picture and rational analysis of the available data. \"\n http://www.ecotao.com/holism/huevo.htm\n \n By the movement of a pen, several 'species' of man simply vanished!\n \n Of course prior to this, when evolutionaries argued against creationists, they were certain that they were right, and that creation was bunk. Now they are still 'right' only it's a different 'right' then when they were 'right' before.",

Recognizing its limitations, the fossil record appears to be consistent with the wide range of evolutionary mechanisms already proposed. Any wholesale abandonment of present paradigms would be very premature. Many critical gaps in our knowledge remain, but as evident from this review important discoveries are continually being made that intrigue, surprise, and enrich our understanding of the evolutionary history of life. http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Miller.html\n That is to say, all of the evidences points to many different theories.\n \n Evidence can be brought up to blur the issue; that we evolved in Africa, or that we evolved elsewhere. http://www.chineseprehistory.org/beard.htm suggest man arose in China, not Africa!*\n \n \n \n \n * http://www.chineseprehistory.org//index.htm is the introduction to this site. It is evidence of the nature of evidence, wholly subjective; that Chinese nationalism is behind these particular pieces of 'scientific evidence.' This increases the over-all number of different forms of science there are.\n \n As well as Chinese nationalist science, there's\n Marxist Science (see http://www.marxist.com/Theory/study_guide2.html for how it is applied to history of materialism) (or http://www.plp.org/cd97/cd924.html about how Communist science is being taught in class-rooms).\n Nazi Science (including modern theories of 'race')\n Creation Science\n Islamic Science\n Feminist Science (http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/sci.html)\n oh, and there's\n Indian nationalist science (see http://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htm)\n Finnish nationalist science! (see http://www.hyl.edu.hel.fi/sivut/comenius/fi/finfact.html or http://www.hf-fak.uib.no/smi/paj/isotalo.html) (yes there's more than one site! :) )\n \n Why so many? Because people are people, and they bring subjective reasoning to the table. When 'evidence' is interpreted, it is interpreted by flawed and failed humans with biases just like everyone else's.\n \n See a discussion ...\n \"The controversial thread that runs through her narratives is the nature of science. Science functions within a culture. So, do the various sociocultural contexts influence science? Do capitalist societies necessarily produce capitalist science? According to the traditional 'internalist' view of science, scientists make up their minds on scientific issues primarily through reason, argument and evidence. Other factors may be involved, but they should be weeded out.\"\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/hull_sociobiology.html\n \" In Marxism, groups are more important than individuals. Capitalists view nature as competitive, whereas these Marxist critics tend to view it as being much more cooperative.\"\n Ibid.\n That therefore the science in each society is relative of these a priori beliefs.\n \n It is more difficult though, for my opposition to admit that scientists are so flawed. Why? Because they have pinned so much on science being right. Many have modified their own religious views, sometimes at great personal cost, in order to satisfy one stream of science. Some are atheistic rational-materialists, take science away from them, and they have nothing left.",

   "Man is a complex animal. With evolution being generally accepted by academia as a 'given' people have tried to explain, within the context of evolutionary theory, all manner of aspects of being human.\n \n Firstly, let's look at Feminist Evolutionary Theory...\n Gender issues have been explained by evolutionaries. Some would like to ignore this, but it is part of the way evolution has been taught - by men for men. As men's ideas about gender have changed, so have their interpretations of evolutionary evidences.\n \"Darwin postulated that females are ''coy,'' mating rarely and choosing their mates carefully, presumably betting their odds on the males with the best genes to contribute to their offspring. For their part, males are ''ardent'' and promiscuous, and fight amongst themselves for female partners. Later theories added that males are promiscuous because they have less to lose by making babies - unlike eggs, sperm are plentiful and small. Plus, females usually do most of the work to raise the offspring\" http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-02/su-sag021003.php\n \"In the mid-nineteenth century, social Darwinists invoked evolutionary biology to argue that a woman was a man whose evolution - both physical and mental - had been arrested in a primitive stage. In this same period, doctors used their authority as scientists to discourage women's attempts to gain access to higher education. Women's intellectual development, it was argued, would proceed only at great cost to reproductive development. As the brain developed, so the logic went, the ovaries shrivel. In the twentieth century, scientists have given modern dress to these prejudices. Arguments for women's different (and inferior) nature have been based on hormonal research, brain lateralization, and sociobiology.\"\n Londa Schiebinger, \"History and Philosophy\", in Sex and Scientific Inquiry, eds. Sandra Harding and Jean F. O'Barr, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 26-27.\n Quoted at: http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html\n \n Feminists claim that evolution, long the domain of men has present biased accounts of science in order to explain gender.\n \"Men's claims to \"know\" women's natures, abilities, limitations, and so forth have been a fundamental element of feminist criticisms since its genesis, primarily because it is precisely these claims which are used to justify the social and political subordination of women.\"\n Ibid.\n \n Feminist call for a re-look at evolutionary theory, in light of these gender issues. \"Yet feminist critiques of science have recast many evolutionary arguments, particularly those concerned with sex and gender, as patriarchal rather than politically neutral.\"\n http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/rpeg-cfp1.html\n \n A symposium was called for... \"The symposium will highlight Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling's feminist critiques of biology, who will lecture on Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality. In the academic world Dr. Fausto-Sterling is known as a developmental biologist who offers interesting counterpoints to the view that the role division between men and women is largely predetermined by evolution.\"\n http://www.biu.ac.il/Spokesman/News-Briefs/Jan_2001.html\n \n Anne Campbell's research interests are in sex differences in social behaviour. She has worked on sex differences in aggression from an evolutionary perspective, arguing for the importance of fear as an evolved emotional response that is sex differentiated and that serves to restrain females from engagement in risky behaviours that would compromise their reproductive success.\n http://psychology.dur.ac.uk/research/seep/\n \n \n \n \n \n \n So, there are feminist theories of evolution to explain sex and gender issues, and how we evolved into the roles we have today. They show that men have dominated evolutionary theory thinking and have brought their engendered bias to the interpretation of 'evidences'. \n \n But wait, there's more... other aspects of the human condition are also covered by diversified evolutionary theories. Ageing, being one...\n \n \"Evolutionary Theories of Aging and Longevity\" at http://longevity-science.org/Evolution.htm explores three different evolutionary theories to explain ageing and death...\n 1) the theory of programmed death suggested by August Weismann, 2) the mutation accumulation theory of aging suggested by Peter Medawar, and 3) the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggested by George Williams.\n \n \n Which evolutionary theory you decide to adhere to will be a decision in part based on your worldview. If you are a male chauvinist, then you can have a look at theories that show that women have evolved submissive, and maternalistic traits, and that man has evolved more hunter-like and aggressive traits.\n \n There's an evolutionary theory out there to suit you.",
