   "then i am not a naturalist as there is something spiritual beyond the definitions\n \n human progress is a greater self awareness, universal awareness, and the link between and among them\n \n consider that:\n \nThe modern movement emerged in the late 19th century, and was rooted in the idea that \"traditional\" forms of art, literature, social organization and daily life had become outdated, and that it was therefore essential to sweep them aside and reinvent culture. It encouraged the idea of re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was \"holding back\" progress, and replacing it with new, and therefore better, ways of reaching the same end. In essence, the Modern Movement argued that the new realities of the 20th century were permanent and imminent, and that people should adapt to their world view to accept that what was new was also good and beautiful.\n\n considering that modernism was primarily a western phenomena, it is only natural that a reaction came\n \nPostmodernism is a term applied to a wide-ranging set of developments in critical theory, philosophy, architecture, art, literature, religion, and culture, which are generally characterized as either emerging from, in reaction to, or superseding, modernism.\n \n In architecture, art, music and literature, postmodernism is a name for many stylistic reactions to, and developments from, modernism. Postmodern style is often characterized by eclecticism, digression, collage, pastiche, and irony. Some artistic movements commonly called postmodern are pop art, architectural deconstructivism, magical realism in literature, maximalism, and neo-romanticism. Postmodern theorists see postmodern art as a conflation or reversal of well-established modernist systems, such as the roles of artist versus audience, seriousness versus play, or high culture versus kitsch.\n \n In sociology, postmodernism is described as the result of economic, cultural, and demographic changes. These changes include the rise of the service economy, the importance of the mass media, and the rise of an increasingly interdependent world economy. Related terms in this context include post-industrial society, late capitalism, information age, globalization, and global village. (See also Postmodern and Media theory).\n \n As a cultural movement, postmodernism is an aspect of postmodernity, which is broadly defined as the condition of Western society after modernity. The adjective postmodern can refer to aspects of either postmodernism or postmodernity. According to postmodern theorist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, postmodernity is characterized as an \"incredulity toward metanarratives\", meaning that in the era of postmodern culture, people have rejected the grand, supposedly universal stories and paradigms such as religion, conventional philosophy, capitalism and gender that have defined culture and behavior in the past, and have instead begun to organize their cultural life around a variety of more local and subcultural ideologies, myths and stories. Furthermore, it promotes the idea that all such metanarratives and paradigms are stable only while they fit the available evidence, and can potentially be overturned when phenomena occur that the paradigm cannot account for, and a better explanatory model (itself subject to the same fate) is found. See La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Post Modern Condition: A Report on Knowledge) in 1979, and the results of acceptance of postmodernism is the view that different realms of discourse are incomensurable and incapable of judging the results of other discourse, a conclusion he drew in La Differend (1983).\n \n In philosophy, where the term is extensively used, it applies to movements that include post-structuralism, deconstruction, multiculturalism, gender studies and literary theory, sometimes called simply \"theory\". It emerged beginning in the 1950s as a critique of doctrines such as positivism and emphasizes the importance of power relationships, personalization and discourse in the \"construction\" of truth and world views. In this context it has been used by many critical theorists to assert that postmodernism is a break with the artistic and philosophical tradition of the Enlightenment, which they characterize as a quest for an ever-grander and more universal system of aesthetics, ethics, and knowledge. They present postmodernism as a radical criticism of Western philosophy. Postmodern philosophy draws on a number of approaches to criticize Western thought, including historicism, and psychoanalytic theory.\n \n The term postmodernism is also used in a broader pejorative sense to describe attitudes, sometimes part of the general culture, and sometimes specifically aimed at postmodern critical theory, perceived as relativist, nihilist, counter-Enlightenment or antimodern, particularly in relationship to critiques of rationalism, universalism, or science. It is also sometimes used to describe social changes which are held to be antithetical to traditional systems of morality, particularly by evangelical Christians.\n\n this seems more descriptive or a critcism rather than a driving theme, code to live by, or perspective to view life\n and thus multiculturalism leads to relativism and amorality\n not me at all\n i hadn't realized someone had already coined \"neomodernism\" but here it is:\n \nNeomodernism is a philosophical position based on modernism but addressing the critique of modernism by postmodernism. It is currently associated with the work of Agnes Heller and Carlos Escud\u00e9, and is strongly rooted in the criticisms which Habermas has levelled at postmodern philosophy, namely that universalism and critical thinking are the two essential elements of human rights and that human rights create a superiority of some cultures over others. That is, that equality and relativism are \"mutually contradictory\".\n ...\n Neomodernism accepts some aspects of postmodernism's critique of modernism, notably that modernism elevated the world view of dominant groups to the status of objective fact, thereby failing to express the viewpoint of \"subaltern groups\", such a women and ethnic minorities.\n \n However, neomodernism rejects postmodernism as:\n unscientific - the ability of science to generate useful knowledge cannot be waved away as \"scientism\".\n journalism - as not giving any explanation as to how or why things happen.\n local - as being unable to recognise patterns that occur across time or location.\n unverified - as lacking any validation process, and therefore proceeding by fad and hierarchy.\n\n which isn't far from my belief",
