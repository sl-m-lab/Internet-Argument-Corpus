An excerpt from this:\n \"Charter schools have fewer contractual restrictions then traditional public schools and greater flexibility in establishing school hours, work rules and assignments. They are publicly funded and are open to all city students through lotteries.\"\n This is basically what a charter school is: A publicly funded school that isn't beholden to the teachers' union, has greater academic and discipline standards, and are running rings around the traditional public schools. \n \n The full article is found at www.buffalonews.com Front page article.",

This is basicly \"private schools\" over here (we don`t really allow tuition fees, even though there are some exeptions). Personally, I think this is a pretty decent way to introduce competition on an otherwise monopolistic bussines. But it has it`s pitfalls as well and one need to be very careful when writing up the regulations for this kind of thing. \n \n \nNo, a charter school is not a private school.

The key differences, and they're big differences, are that they're not beholden to the teachers' union, and the academic and disciplinary standards are higher than in traditional public school.\n\n \n So you are saying that the successes of the charter schools in Texas is based on that they pay lower wages?

Children are the responsibility of the parents. Teaching is a proffession or occupation. Not a lifestyle. A teacher naturally has his proffesional responsibility regarding his pupils.
