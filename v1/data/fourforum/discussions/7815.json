   "IU scientist find possible missing link\n \n http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060325/LOCAL/603250494\n \n ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Indiana University scientists working in northeastern Ethiopia said today they have discovered the skull of a small human ancestor that could be a missing link between the extinct Homo erectus and modern man.\n \n \n \nThe hominid cranium -- found in two pieces and believed to be between 500,000 and 250,000 years old -- \"comes from a very significant period and is very close to the appearance of the anatomically modern human,\" said Sileshi Semaw, director of the Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project in Ethiopia.\n Archaeologists found the early human cranium five weeks ago at Gawis in Ethiopia's northeastern Afar region, Sileshi said.\n Sileshi, an Ethiopian paleoanthropologist based at Indiana University, said most fossil hominids are found in pieces but the near-complete skull -- a rare find -- provided a wealth of information.\n \"The Gawis cranium provides us with the opportunity to look at the face of one of our ancestors,\" the archaeology project said in a statement. \"Additionally, this fossil links us with the past by showing a face that is recognizably different and more primitive than ours.\"\n Homo erectus, which many believe was an ancestor of modern Homo sapiens, is thought to have died out 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.\n The cranium dates to a time about which little is known -- the transition from African Homo erectus to modern humans. The fossil record from Africa for this period is sparse and most of the specimens poorly dated, project archaeologists said.\n The face and cranium of the fossil are recognizably different from that of modern humans, but it bears unmistakable anatomical evidence that it belongs to the modern human's ancestry, Sileshi said.\n \"The form of the face and the brain are among the best means for exploring the evolutionary path of humans and the Gawis cranium preserves both areas,\" according to the statement.\n Semaw is a research associate with IU's CRAFT Research Center. The research was supported by the Stone Age Institute, an independent, nonprofit center based north of Bloomington that is an outgrowth of the CRAFT Research Center.\n The Stone Age Institute researches human origins and the development of technology.\n\n \n I am primarily interested in seeing how the creationists wriggle around this one. It would seem that if the early analysis of this is correct, the creationist argument is essentially dead once and for all.",

Herto skulls (Homo sapiens idaltu)\n \n So it seems that the gap between 500,000 years and 100,000 years is being filled.

H. heidelbergensis has been found in Africa, Spain, and Europe and is believed to be ancestral to H. neanderthalensis. Late H. heidelbergensis are very much like early Neandertal fossils. But H. heidelbergensis in Africa seems to have led to H. sapiens through the above lineage, followed by migration through the Levant into Europe.\n \n Of course, there is the very real (probable) possibility that I am jumping the gun a bit on this.

   "Here's something interesting that I found while looking for further information about the Gawis skull. Since it hasn't been published yet, there is little further except the preliminary remarks posted heres. However, I was looking at the Homo sapiens idaltu skulls (BOU-VP-16/1, BOU-VP-16/2, BOU-VP-16/5) from Herto (at Talk Origins) and noticed this interesting bit at the bottom of the page.\n \nAnswers in Genesis argues, quite reasonably, that these fossils are so similar to modern humans that they don't constitute any problem for creationists - or, at least, to their own position. Reasons To Believe, an old-earth creationist ministry founded by Hugh Ross, takes the more surprising position that these fossils are of soulless animals that merely look like humans, and has accused AIG of \"factual errors and distortions\", to which AIG has responded energetically. RTB's position seems untenable to me: it's hard to see how anyone can credibly claim that fossils so remarkably similar to modern humans are animals. RTB appears to have a strategy that by definition excludes any possibility of transitional fossils: if scientists put a fossil in anything other than Homo sapiens sapiens, it is \"not a modern human\" and hence is an animal (no matter how trivial the differences); if they do put it in H. sapiens sapiens, of course, it's also not evidence for human evolution. Heads I win, tails you lose.\nI found it funny to see the two creationist sites battling about this. They both claim to base their opinion on the Bible, one claiming that the Herto skulls are just humans and the other claiming that they are animals. The response to RTB by AIG (Wieland) reproduces the exchange of communications between AIG and RTB. I found it quite humorous.",

Are Drosophila willistoni willistoni and D. willistoni quechua the same species, even though crosses between them produce sterile male offspring? If they are, at what stage in their divergence will they become different species? If we reify the abstract concept 'species', we come down to quibbling over semantics.\n \n Creationists like the one you refer to cannot handle this idea at all. For them species are closed boxes with sharply defined walls, and any individual must be either in one box or another. Last I heard, Neandertals were conventionally regarded as a subspecies of sapiens. We can never know, sadly, whether we and they would have been interfertile (though that hasn't stopped a lot of people from speculating).\n \n As a postscript, I'd suggest that this same lack of understanding about species and speciation underlies the frequent misguided demands from creationists (notably easyrider in the Religion forum) that we 'name the Missing Link'.

   "Tribe Hominini - chimps and humans and ancestors.\nOf course, this is a rather new \"trend\" in taxonomy. In the older system the chimpanzees were in the tribe Panini. So the lumping has happened on more than one level. The trend is now to lump the Pongidae into the Hominidae and then further down the classification to lump the Panini into the Hominini.\n \n These changes are mostly driven by DNA studies that have revealed that these organisms are more closely related than previously thought. However, the classifications still haven't stabilized to the point that every one agrees. I found that it was easy to find multiple versions of primate taxonomy. Some include Pan in Hominini, others don't, making Hominini include just humans and ancestors since our split from the chimp (Pan) lineage. In that system, chimps are in the subfamily Homininae, but still in the tribe Panini.\n \n Like I said before, I hope this all settles down before I'm too old to learn something new.",
