   "Do proponents of slavery aka gun control really believe the drivel they spew? You read and hear this and think can these people reason at all? Logic is out the window for sure. Our own union thug look alike fast Eddie Rendell whipped out the favorite argument of the gun grabbers. Their twisted confusion between good and evil. Of course with the embrace of moral relativism they have not a clue as to what good or evil is. Fast Eddie was trying to make the case for a federal ban on semi-automatic firearms. \n \n \"It's nuts for ordinary citizens to go out and buy assault weapons. (note he is trying to confuse the ignorant as to what real assault weapons and the semi-automatic variety are) Assault weapons are difficult to operate, they jam easily. If you want a gun to protect your home, its the last thing you should have. ... If you have an assault weapon to protect your house, you're crazy ... they're not very effective.\" So our esteemed governor says on the one hand they are worthless for self defense and hard to operate in addition to being unreliable. On the flip side fast Eddie talked out of the other face. \"Assault weapons have only one purpose ... They fire at short range; they put out a ton of fire at one time; and they are very powerful ... There's no purpose for these guns but to kill or maim.\" All this in almost one breath even. \n \n Fast Eddie's rant goes to the very center of why the ban guns movement totally lacks common sense. It places evil above good. For the good to resist is futile as evil always triumphs. If you resist then you just anger evil. Case in point the SEALS take out 3 Somali pirates. That's bad because it just angers the survivors. Good can handle the dreaded assault weapon. Its too complicated, unreliable and not good for defense. But its to dangerous for evil to have. Loads of fire power, easy to use, purpose is to kill or maim, etc. What the gun ban group fails to recognize is self preservation over rides fear of evil. Self defense is bad because it just makes evil mad! \n \n Any way you get the idea.",

   "Allow me to dissect Rendell's statement and prove his idiocy, sentence by sentence.\n \n \n\"It's nuts for ordinary citizens to go out and buy assault weapons.\n\n \n What's really nuts is that you use the term \"ordinary citizens\" and are trying to claim that they ought not be allowed to own regular firearms. Aren't you basically admitting the fact that you want to disarm the victims, not the criminals?\n \n \nAssault weapons are difficult to operate, they jam easily.\n\n \n Difficult? Not likely. The basic operations and drills of these firearms can be taught in minutes, and muscle memory can be developed in just a few short hours. Anyone is easily capable of learning how to use a Mini-14, M1 Carbine, AK-47, AR-15, or any of these other fine firearms.\n \n While the early M16s fielded in Vietnam had a reputation for jamming, due to a lack of chromed components and improper gun powder, the modern AR-15 rifles will function properly without fear of a jam at the wrong time. Many hundreds of rounds can be run through any one of these guns without having to fear it suddenly locking up and becoming an expensive club.\n \n \nIf you want a gun to protect your home, its the last thing you should have.\n\n \n It's the last thing we should have...because we want to protect ourselves as we see fit without your approval? Or because you think something better exists?\n \n \n ... If you have an assault weapon to protect your house, you're crazy ... they're not very effective.\"\n\n \n If they're not very effective, then why are you in favor of banning them in the first place? If they jam easily and can't be operated by just anybody, doesn't that mean they're the last thing any criminal anywhere would use?\n \n \n\"Assault weapons have only one purpose ... They fire at short range;\n\n \n 300 yards, usually the maximum effective range of most of these small to medium-caliber rifles, is hardly short range. True short range goes to handguns and shotguns firing buckshot; about 25 yards.\n \n \nthey put out a ton of fire at one time;\n\n \n All civilian legal firearms put out only one shot for every pull of the trigger, it's been this way for many decades as per orders of the federal government. Are you saying that the gun manufacturers have been illegally selling machine guns to regular people and the ATF has done nothing about this?\n \n \nand they are very powerful\n\n \n If they're so powerful, then why aren't single shot rifles in .223 Remington allowed for the hunting of bears, elk, or african game? Why must we use heavy and expensive rifles in calibers like .375 H&H Magnum, .458 Lott and .700 Nitro Express to legally hunt elephants in Africa, but the inexpensive .223 rifles are forbidden if they're just as capable?\n \n \n... There's no purpose for these guns but to kill or maim.\"\n\n \n Can you point to a gun that has no killing potential at all?",
