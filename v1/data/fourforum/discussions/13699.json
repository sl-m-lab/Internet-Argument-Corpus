   "Ex-soldier faces jail for handing in gun\n \n \nA former soldier who handed a discarded shotgun in to police faces at least five years imprisonment for \"doing his duty\".\n \n Paul Clarke, 27, was found guilty of possessing a firearm at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday - after finding the gun and handing it personally to police officers on March 20 this year.\n \n The jury took 20 minutes to make its conviction, and Mr Clarke now faces a minimum of five year's imprisonment for handing in the weapon.\n \n In a statement read out in court, Mr Clarke said: \"I didn't think for one moment I would be arrested.\n \n \"I thought it was my duty to hand it in and get it off the streets.\"\n \n The court heard how Mr Clarke was on the balcony of his home in Nailsworth Crescent, Merstham, when he spotted a black bin liner at the bottom of his garden.\n \n In his statement, he said: \"I took it indoors and inside found a shorn-off shotgun and two cartridges.\n \n \"I didn't know what to do, so the next morning I rang the Chief Superintendent, Adrian Harper, and asked if I could pop in and see him.\n \n \"At the police station, I took the gun out of the bag and placed it on the table so it was pointing towards the wall.\"\n \n Mr Clarke was then arrested immediately for possession of a firearm at Reigate police station, and taken to the cells.\n \n Defending, Lionel Blackman told the jury Mr Clarke's garden backs onto a public green field, and his garden wall is significantly lower than his neighbours.\n \n He also showed jurors a leaflet printed by Surrey Police explaining to citizens what they can do at a police station, which included \"reporting found firearms\".\n \n Quizzing officer Garnett, who arrested Mr Clarke, he asked: \"Are you aware of any notice issued by Surrey Police, or any publicity given to, telling citizens that if they find a firearm the only thing they should do is not touch it, report it by telephone, and not take it into a police station?\"\n \n To which, Mr Garnett replied: \"No, I don't believe so.\"\n \n Prosecuting, Brian Stalk, explained to the jury that possession of a firearm was a \"strict liability\" charge - therefore Mr Clarke's allegedly honest intent was irrelevant.\n \n Just by having the gun in his possession he was guilty of the charge, and has no defence in law against it, he added.\n \n But despite this, Mr Blackman urged members of the jury to consider how they would respond if they found a gun.\n \n He said: \"This is a very small case with a very big principle.\n \n \"You could be walking to a railway station on the way to work and find a firearm in a bin in the park.\n \n \"Is it unreasonable to take it to the police station?\"\n \n Paul Clarke will be sentenced on December 11.\n \n Judge Christopher Critchlow said: \"This is an unusual case, but in law there is no dispute that Mr Clarke has no defence to this charge.\n \n \"The intention of anybody possessing a firearm is irrelevant.\"\n",

FOUR DAYS LATER, he turned up at the police station in illegal possession of an illegal gun. They had no option. That's the effect of mandatory sentences.\n\n \n I know nothing about the British criminal justice system. The article suggests that most of those involved felt they had no choice but to act as mindless automatons blindly enforcing a law. Notably absent from the article, however, is any discussion of the prosecutor's role in how the case went from arrest to trial. Did the prosecutor lack discretion to choose whether to prosecute the case? (Or, for that matter, if he had the power to choose whether or not to prosecute, then are there other facts in this case he considered which we don't know about?) \n \n Yes, we have in America \"three strikes laws,\" \"mandatory sentencing laws,\" and criminal statutes which impose \"strict liability\" on those who violate them. But none of these laws require an automatic machine-like process of charging in every case, still less do they require the abandonment of the presumption of innocence with \"no option but to convict.\" These laws do require the imposition of an automatic mandatory sentence, but only IF the prosecutor decides to charge the case and then only IF the evidence produced at trial provides proof beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt. \n \n In the U.S. prosecutors are vested with near-absolute discretion to choose whether to prosecute, what charges to bring if several apply, and in what order to charge those suspected of being involved in the crimes. This discretionary authority is tempered by the concept that a prosecutor is not like other lawyers-he or she is not supposed to act as an advocate for a party but as a minister of justice.\n \n Here are some quotes concerning the prosecutor's discretionary authority and the requirement to act as a minister of justice: \n \n [I]\"'t is well established that the choice of offenses for which a criminal defendant will be charged is within the discretion of the Commonwealth's Attorney.'\" Barrett v. Commonwealth, 268 Va. 170, 178, 597 S.E.2d 104, 107-08 (2004) (quoting Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 400, 410, 382 S.E.2d 279, 284 (1989)). In addition, \"the institution of criminal charges, as well as their order and timing, are matters of prosecutorial discretion.\" Bradshaw v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 484, 492, 323 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1984). \"A prosecutor has the discretion to decide under which of several applicable statutes the charges shall be instituted.\" \n In re: Robert F. Horan, 271 Va. 258, 263-264, 634 S.E.2d 675, ___ (2006)\n \n This broad discretion [afforded the Executive] rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute [Page 490] is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of particular concern. Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor's motives and decisionmaking to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government's enforcement policy. All of these are substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.\"\n Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 489-490 (1999)\n \n \n The Supreme Court of Virginia has been clear that Commonwealth's attorneys prosecuting violations of the law enjoy discretion in the selection of cases for prosecution.2 As the Court has noted a prosecutor's \"duty to administer the criminal law impartially, in the interest of justice, is essentially a judicial one.\"3 \"A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice, and not simply that of an advocate.\"4 Such responsibility obligates him to see that the party charged with an offense \"is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence.\"5\n \n The prosecuting attorney, therefore, has the authority and the responsibility not only to ensure that the criminal process is not abused,6 but also to ensure that criminal prosecutions are pursued only to seek justice.7 Consequently, the Commonwealth's attorney should use restraint in the discretionary exercise of governmental powers, such as in the selection of cases to prosecute.\n Opinion of the Attorney General 2001 Va. AG 42, 42, 01-078, ___ (2001)\n \n The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\n Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). \n \n \"There is a most important reason why the prosecutor should have, as nearly as possible, a detached and impartial view of all groups in his community. Law enforcement is not automatic. It isn't blind. One of the greatest difficulties of the position of prosecutor is that he must pick his cases, because no prosecutor can even investigate all of the cases in which he receives complaints. If the Department of Justice were to make even a pretense of reaching every probable violation of federal law, ten times its present staff will be inadequate. We know that no local police force can strictly enforce the traffic laws, or it would arrest half the driving population on [Page 728] any given morning. What every prosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.\n \n \"If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his case, it follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than cases that need to be prosecuted. With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in this realm - in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.\" \n Robert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, Address Delivered at the Second Annual Conference of United States Attorneys, April 1, 1940.\n \n (As an aside, note that Robert H. Jackson was at the time of this speech the Attorney General of the United States. The following year he was appointed to SCOTUS and, in 1945-46, he served as the Chief United States prosecutor before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremburg. I lifted the quote from Scalia's dissent in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, at pp. 727-728 (1988).)",

What if you see a little kid pick it up and playing with it, thinking it's a toy, and they accidentally shoot themselves in the head?\n \n \n \n Since when do soldiers qualify as \"trained killers\"? Some respect you have there for our servicemen. You're probably one of the people that refer to the armed forces in a disparaging manner and call them baby murderers.\n\n \n That's quite a blast of inanity going on there.

The first part is an evidence test&#8212;and can be summarized as being a case review to consider whether or not the evidence provides a &#8220;realistic prospect of conviction.&#8221; I think we can all agree the case which started this thread meet this part of the test.\n \n The second test is a public interest test:\n \n &#8220;If the case does pass the evidential test, Crown Prosecutors must then decide whether a prosecution is needed in the public interest. They must balance factors for and against prosecution carefully and fairly. Some factors may increase the need to prosecute but others may suggest that another course of action would be better. A prosecution will usually take place however, unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. The CPS will only start or continue a prosecution if a case has passed both tests.&#8221; (bold emphasis added)\n \n The web site further states:\n \n &#8220;The principles we follow and our commitment to high standards of service are further outlined in the following:\n &#8226; Our decisions will be independent of bias or discrimination but we will always consider the interests of others. We will act with integrity and objectivity and will exercise sound judgement with confidence. \n &#8226; In our dealings with each other and the public we will be open and honest. We will show sensitivity and understanding to victims and witnesses and treat all defendants fairly. \n &#8226; We are accountable to Parliament and to the public; we will work together with our colleagues to maintain public trust and to provide an efficient criminal justice system. In explaining our decisions we will be courteous and helpful. \n &#8226; In order to achieve these high standards, we will report on our performance and respond to criticism positively. &#8220; (bold emphasis added)\n \n Obviously there is some public criticism of how and why this case came to trial and conviction. Does anyone know whether or not the CPS has publically answered this criticism. For example, there may be other facts we don&#8217;t know about which influenced the decision to prosecute.
