Have you ever read Dickens?\n\n \n Dickens was a writer of fiction, and he wrote fiction set in what is now history. The idea that factory owners today, in the western world, would transform their modern manufacturing facilities into 1850s standard sweatshops is simply idiotic. Nor could they find anyone to employ in the western world, at the low wages required for a business to profit from heavy manual labour.\n \n To condemn the working conditions of the 1850s because they are not as good as today's is similarly idiotic. Why do you think people were willing to work in such poor conditions in the 1850s, were they all too stupid to continue in their previous lifestyles? Or were even the harsh conditions of 150 years ago still superior to what was previously available to them?\n \n The same stupid logic today tries to prevent international corporations from offering jobs to people in the 3rd world. You can deride Nike's \"sweatshops\" all you want, but the reason people work there is because their living conditions are superior to those otherwise available to them.\n \n \nUnbrideled capitalism is bad for people who fall through the cracks.\n\n \n And you know this how? The poor of capitalist nations are vastly better off than the poor in pre-capitalist nations. \n \n \nYour mean society would have homeless, abject poverty, and people dying because they couldn't make it without help. \n\n \n Help does not equal government. The fact is you have no idea how such a society would look, it is beyond your ability to imagine it, and mine. You have no idea what institutions and cultures would emerge in the absence of government, but you act as if they would remain the same. The world is a dynamic place.\n \n \nIf you had your way there would only be two kinds of people the rich and the serfs.\n\n \n A serf, to my knowledge, was someone of a different legal class, they were legally prohibited from owning land. It was the introduction of \"unbridled capitalism\" which eliminated serfdom and replaced a system of legal classes and government regulation with one of market competition.\n \n It is in fact you who wishes to reinstitute government control over who can work where, who can sell what, who gets to be in a position of privilege and who will remain poor.\n \n \nHave you ever been homeless, hungry, not knowing where your next meal is going to come from?\n\n \n I'm fortunate enough to live in a country with a relatively high degree of market freedom, the prosperity such freedom generates means that it is almost impossible I should be unable to find work (even if not the exact kind of job I want), and even if I were unemployed and homeless I could live like a king on the garbage restaurants throw out and on the coins passersby threw at me, in comparison to the poor of nations where the government runs things.\n \n \n What I see as your problem is that you confuse what despots talk about, \"workers' rights\", \"the common man\", \"the poor\", \"minorities\", with reality. No amount of good intentions or ideology can change reality. And no matter how many industries you nationalise \"for the workers and the environment\", however noble your intentions, isn't going to change the reality that they both are going to end up worse off. To understand what changes will affect who in what way, you must understand economic science, and you don't appear to have even attempted that at all, believing instead that if you have a government with enough power and good enough intentions that it can ignore economics and manufacture its own reality. Those who point to science, and tell you it won't work, you don't have to employ anything so vulgar as reason with them, just label them heartless and evil.\n \n What's perhaps more ludicrous though is that you have the idea you can give a government unlimited power, the power to determine what people say, what they learn, ultimately what they think, and once you've created this monster, that you can somehow control it and force it to serve you. As if the problem with George Bush is just George Bush, and that all the things you see as evil in him weren't facilitated by every expansion of government power that has gone before him. And that when it does do wrong, you can make it better by giving it more power.",

Schools would have programs lauding the virtues of working in the mines with \"Elmo the Happy Mine Worker\" as their special friend. We can increase happiness by lowering standards of happiness!!! \n \n Health care? Yeperoo! We can start with compulsory blood donation and enforced healthy diet of gubment provided food. If we trust ye to make your own decision, you might clog your own arteries you silly thing! Of course, we will have to do something about those pesky fast food restaurants that are polluting our systems and contributing so much to our health care costs. Once the restaurants are closed down we will have more workers for the mines and industrial output will soar!!! \n \n Be careful what ye wish for. The more ye let gubment erect bars around ye, the more ye resemble the rabbit to the Gubment's snake. If ye fear business, ye should be positively terrified by gubment. Gubment, unlike business, can hold a proverbial gun to your head and force you to conform. Business, by contrast is far less intrusive or controlling. There is nothing that Ronald McDonald can do to force ye to buy one of his hamburgers. Gubment has a funny way of forcing ye to conform. I prefer the McDonald model to the Matthew model.\n\n \n You forgot. The gubment wants to keep you alive longer, so male homosexuality would have to be eliminated since gays don't live as long as straights. Lesbianism would be permitted because they live longer. emoticon_rolleyes",
