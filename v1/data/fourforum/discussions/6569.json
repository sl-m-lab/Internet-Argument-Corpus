   "Your \"sweeping generalisations\" might alarm that minority of Christians who care to interest themselves in the role played by Calvinism in the rise of capitalism.\n\n \n An even smaller minority might consider the converse role; but it is my conviction that this is the more important.\n \n \nI think inquiries which are focused on the socio-economic aspects of Christianity (a symbiosis), are not welcomed much by religious enthusiasts because such inquiries afford little scope for citing \"testimony\" in answer to awkward questions. \n\n \n Indeed, such inquiries relegate 'testimony' to the sidelines. But before our christian friends protest, they should ask themselves how seriously they would have taken an Aztec priest's testimony on the value of blood sacrifices to Quetzalcoatl. What a religion's practitioners believe to be its benefits to society may not be the actual benefits.\n \n \nEven if I'm wrong in my suppositions, it would be necessary to hi-jack this thread in order to discuss how Puritan morality - which celebrated thrift, the virtues of work and self-sufficiency, asceticism, and the value of rational calculation - was adopted as a \"natural ethic\" by the commercial adventurers who laid the foundations of modern capitalism.\n\n \n You're right.

   "Hey all,\n \n Sorry about the delay in posting, I ended up going away over the weekend so didn't get a chance.\n \n Uh, where to start? Well I guess it's best to look at the Church's official views on matters and discuss them. As there are three 'codes' that LaVey wrote I will break it down to a post on each.\n \n \n\n 1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!\n 2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!\n 3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!\n 4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates!\n 5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!\n 6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!\n 7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his \"divine spiritual and intellectual development,\" has become the most vicious animal of all!\n 8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!\n 9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!\n\n Points 1 to 3 and 7 and 8 are a reaction against the concept of 'sin' and the repression of our natural instincts. The idea of 'sin' restricts and constrains: if one performs and act which harms nobody and brings gratification, then why feel enforced shame for the act? Sexual urges are natural and entirely healthy, no matter whom you feel them for. It is merely a form of oppression, to make the masses feel guilty about their natural desires, or to demonise a group such as homosexuals. Equally if the act is actually destructive, then the concept of repentance means that the person then has their guilt artificially relieved, nothing is learned in the process and they are likely to commit the act again. \n \n Of course the inherent contradiction in this is that we have essentially rules telling you not to follow rules! That is why I don't see any aspect of the doctrine to be a hard and fast rule, in fact there is quite a lot I don't agree with. To blindly follow these rules goes against the very spirit of them, everything requires criticism and analysis, everything is open to interpretation. That is why I see them as LaVey's guidelines, but not necessarily directly applicable to everyone else and as such not for literal adherence.\n \n Points 4 to 6 are concerned with the concept of 'do as you would have others do to you', rejecting it in favour of 'do as others do to you'. The philosophy is pessimistic about the nature of humanity, we naturally oppress each other or act as what LaVey calls 'psychic vampires', those who feed off the charity of others for nothing in return. I agree with this to an extent, I agree that people who give little to society should receive the same. I think we are increasingly keen on helping the undeserved, and that many of our policies should be tightened up. Yet to take this concept to far leaves a society only concerned with supporting the upper classes, I believe society has a responsibility to ensure the welfare of all citizens.\n \n The final point is a reminder about how the Church oppresses. By creating a group, usually a minority, to demonise it unifies the masses in blind hatred. This group has been women, scientists, Jews and (as it is at the moment) homosexuals. Without these objects of oppression, this perceived threat, it would not be able to keep its followers in line. By making them look without for an object of hate it blinds them to the folly within.\n \n Well, that took longer than I expected, and now have to do some work! I'll follow up soon with the next set of 'rules'",

   "\n 1. Stupidity\n 2. Pretentiousness\n 3. Solipsism\n 4. Self-deceit\n 5. Herd Conformity\n 6. Lack of Perspective\n 7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies\n 8. Counterproductive Pride\n 9. Lack of Aesthetics\nThe 'sins' then. Of course I consider the very concept of 'sin' to be against the philosophy. But I guess 'The Nine Satanic Elements of Human Nature that Should be Discouraged' didn't have the same ring. \n \n Stupidity is something that I despise, yet you can see it everywhere. Society functions on stupidity, the repression of any who try to be individual, the hatred of those who think or act differently. Stupidity has its place, like anything else, but it is something to be avoided.\n \n Pretentiousness, Self-deceit, Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies and Counterproductive Pride are all really part of being true to yourself. Satanism believes in self-analysis as the best way to learn, and intellectually develop. Anything that hampers such development must be avoided.\n \n Solipsism- Personally, whilst I don't believe in the philosophy I don't have a problem with it. But it is the projection of the self unto others that is the problem, Satanic philosophy rejects the projection of your own psyche onto another. It rejects 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you' in favour of 'do unto others as they do unto you'.\n \n Herd Conformity is what society in general, and the Xtian church in specific thrives on. It is self-oppressive, intellectually restricting and cowardly. The fear of going against the crowd has supported every tyrant the world has ever seen, it has allowed them to demonise and oppress minorities and control and brainwash the majorities. Life should always be questioned, not blindly adhered to.\n \n Aesthetics? Yes, we like to dress up! But seriously, aesthetics is important in everyone's life. Beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder (or Beholder to us ex-D&Ders!), we should always be true to what we consider beautiful, not what society or FHM magazine tells us to. I don't think lack of it is really quite enough to be considered a 'sin', but it is important none the less.",

   "\n 1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.\n 2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.\n 3. When in another's lair, show him respect or else do not go there.\n 4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.\n 5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.\n 6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.\n 7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.\n 8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.\n 9. Do not harm little children.\n 10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.\n 11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.\n The 'rules' are the aspects I have the most problem with. Firstly they sound like they were written by the aforementioned D&D fan with too much time on his hands! 'Lairs', 'mating signals' and 'destruction' really! I've also already mentioned my problem with the very concept of 'rules' in a system which rejects them.\n \n Mostly this talks of individualism, not forcing your own beliefs and values on others. I support this concept totally, I don't preach and I have a big problem with those who do. I'd quibble slightly with the phrase 'unless you are asked', without people volunteering opinion nobody would know how anybody else feels and fora like this would be pretty redundant.\n \n Some of the rest of it, such as 9 and 10 and to a lesser extent 5 and 6 seem to be a reaction to the Christian stereotypes of Satanists. Satanists are in no way interested in sacrifice of animals or children, in fact they are often revered as being closer to the primal animal than we are with our sociological trappings. Despite what Bassman thinks. \n \n Hmm magic in 7 then. Well the short of it is I don't believe in it at all. The closest I'm prepared to admit is the idea of meditation to focus the mind, I think that giving into primal passions and focussing, in a group or individually, can be constructive. As to actual magic, well I'm far too sceptical for that.\n \n Number 11 is one that often causes the biggest problems. Generally it is not regarded to mean literal or physical destruction, but instead non-passive reactions to those who inflict themselves upon others.\n \n So that's what I think of Satanic philosophy, the aspects that I support and would highlight are:\n \n 1. Satan as a symbol of resistance to the ingrained idea of an Xtian God, along with the oppressive concepts of sin, hell, heaven and any enforced belief system.\n 2. Humanity as inherently animalistic, and the repression of these instincts is self-destructive. Embracing these urges as healthy and to be encouraged.\n 3. Respect for life.\n 4. Libertarianism.\n 5. Kindness for the deserving, no mercy for the undeserving. \n 6. Rejection of mindless conformity, highlighting of the need for everything to be questioned and scrutinised.\n 7. Intelligence. This is closely connected to the above, but is worth mentioning on it's own. It is the most important aspect of ourselves and should be used and appreciated. It should also not be assumed that everyone has it.\n 8. The use of meditation (or magic if you will) to focus the mind towards an important goal or task.\n 9. Self-awareness and appraisal. The ultimate goal of all of the above. Satanism constantly talks of being true to the self, learning from mistakes, indulging in your innate nature and above all intelligence.\n \n Destroy away!",
