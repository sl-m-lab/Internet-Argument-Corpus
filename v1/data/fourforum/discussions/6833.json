Not to mention the teachers today are more concerned with their tenure than they are about teaching.\n\n \n \n I have many friends who are teachers. To start tenure is only a higher education establishment. Teachers for younger students, high school and below, don't have the option of tenure, so right there you are off the mark.\n \n Secondly, most teachers do their best to teach kids given the tools they have to teach. Low budgets for the schools is one issue. Second is that the system of checks and balances is off. Kids are making it through the system who can't even read. Teachers do what they can, but many times they are forced to pass these kids due to goofy rules that shouldn't exist in the first place.\n \n Education is society's place to provide it. It is the parents role to make sure their kids get what is provided. and it is the student's role to learn it well. We need all of those factors to make this work.\n \n Ultimately, as Hiliary has said, it does take a village to raise kids. There are many things that \"raise\" kids and those things come from society, parents, neighbors, etc.....",

So it stands to reason that if a school is not performing up to minimal standards, then the parents have every right to seek alternatives to the public schools.\n\n \n But this does not really answer my question. Granted, parents ought to know their children best and know what their children needs (even though this is far from an universal rule). In most cases they also have their childrens best interests in mind when making choices. But how does that translate into being fit to judge wether a school has \"failed to carry out their part of the contract\"?",

Under a voucher system, the money which would otherwise be spent in a poor public school goes with the student to whichever school can hold up its end of the bargain to provide an education.

   " Class stratification will occur between those who value an education and those who don't, and the present public school approach of teaching to the lowest common denominator is the problem rather than the solution.\n\n \n What happens when 50% of proud parents discover the fact that their children are the lowest common denominator and rejected by private schools? A Class B voucher system? Are you familiar with the structure of private schooling? If so then you understand they do come in several flavors, from those who produce academically inclined graduates down through what amounts to very expensive, private detention centers. Few depend on parental moral support, they're strict, discipline oriented and judge children for what they are, not what parents think they are. How would that level of education be maintained with an influx of millions of students without class stratification between inner-city and geographically desirable locations? There are many areas, for obvious reasons, where capitalization for private schools would be difficult to raise even with government voucher cash flow. \n \n The voucher system has a strong appearance of lower and middle-class citizens trying to act like those wealthy folks who currently provide the bulk of funding for public education, available to all children, now, without discrimination of any type. That also provides civil order, which would undoubtedly be severely disrupted when 50% of Americans discovered their common denominator children couldn't attend 'good schools'.",
