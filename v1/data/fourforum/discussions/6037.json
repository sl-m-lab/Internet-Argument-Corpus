   "A really good and in depth read. Some of the points will be shocking to some pro Iraq war supporters. Like the fact that the Kurds are really really wanting to separate from Iraq, that the Dawa, and SCIRI parties really are much more friendly to Iran and more religous then some believe. Other shocks will be the fact that of the Iraqi army the only really effective troops are Kurdish Peshmerga's.\n \n \n http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18150\n \n \nOn June 4, Jalal Talabani, president of Iraq, attended the inauguration of the Kurdistan National Assembly in Erbil, northern Iraq. Talabani, a Kurd, is not only the first-ever democratically elected head of state in Iraq, but in a country that traces its history back to the Garden of Eden, he is, as one friend observed, \"the first freely chosen leader of this land since Adam was here alone.\" While Kurds are enormously proud of his accomplishment, the flag of Iraq-the country Talabani heads-was noticeably absent from the inauguration ceremony, nor can it be found anyplace in Erbil, a city of one million that is the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan Region.\n \n snip\n \n A few months after the Iraqi elections, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld flew to Baghdad to warn the new Shiite-led government not to purge Sunni Arabs from the police and military. He got a promise, but the government has no intention of keeping on people associated with Saddam's regime. Too many of them have the blood of Shiites or Kurds on their hands, and neither group is in a forgiving mood. But the Americans, with little comprehension of Iraq's recent history, seem not to understand. Recently, the Kurds identified the retired Iraqi officer who personally carried out the 1983 execution of more than five thousand members of the tribe of the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani. The killer's son holds a senior security position in Iraq, appointed by the American occupation authorities.\n \n snip\n \n There Iranian-style religious police enforce a conservative Islamic code, including dress codes and bans on alcohol and other non-Islamic behavior. In most cases, the religious authorities govern-and legislate-without authority from Baghdad, and certainly without any reference to the freedoms incorporated in Iraq's American-written interim constitution-the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL). \n \n Dawa and SCIRI are not just promoting an Iranian-style political system -they are also directly promoting Iran- ian interests. Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, the SCIRI leader, has advocated paying Iran billions in reparations for damage done in the Iran-Iraq war, even as the Bush administration has been working to win forgiveness for Iraq's Saddam-era debt. Iraq's Shiite oil minister is promoting construction of an export pipeline for petroleum from Basra to the Iranian port city of Abadan, creating an economic and strategic link between the two historic adversaries that would have been unthinkable until now. Iraq's Shiite government has acknowledged Iraq's responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war, and apologized. It is an acknowledgment probably justified by the historical record, but one that has infuriated Iraq's Sunni Arabs.\n \n \n snip\n \n On February 15, 1991, the first President Bush called on the Iraqi people and military to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The Shiites made the mistake of believing he meant it. Three days after the first Gulf War ended, on March 2, 1991, a Shiite rebellion began in Basra and quickly spread to the southern reaches of Baghdad. Then Saddam counterattacked with great ferocity. Three hundred thousand Shiites ultimately died. Not only did the elder President Bush not help, his administration refused even to hear the pleas of the more and more desperate Shiites. While the elder Bush's behavior may have many explanations, no Shiite I know of sees it as anything other than a calculated plan to have them slaughtered. By contrast, Iran, which backed SCIRI and Dawa and equipped the Badr Brigade, has long been seen as a reliable friend.\n \n \n snip\n \n The assembly also banned the entry of non-Kurdish Iraqi military forces into Kurdistan without its approval. Kurdish leaders are mindful that their people are even more militant in their demands. Two million Kurds voted in a January referendum on independence held simultaneously with the national ballot, with 98 percent choosing the independence option. \n \n \n snip\n \n Iraq's Shiites endured decades of brutal repression, to which the United States was mostly indifferent. Iran, by contrast, was a good friend and committed supporter of the Shiites. By bringing freedom to Iraq, the Bush administration has allowed Iraq's Shiites to vote for pro-Iranian religious parties that seek to create-and are creating -an Islamic state. This is not ideal but it is the result of a democratic process.\n \n The Bush administration should, however, draw the line at allowing a Shiite theocracy to establish control over all of Iraq. This requires a drastic change of strategy. Building powerful national institutions in Iraq serves the interest of one group-today it is the Shiites-at the expense of the others, and inevitably produces conflict and instability. Instead, the administration should concentrate on political arrangements that match the reality in Iraq. This means a loose confederation in which each of Iraq's communities governs itself, and is capable of defending itself. It may not be possible to accomplish this in a constitution, since the very process of writing a constitution forces these communities to confront issues-religion, women's rights, ownership of oil, regional militaries- that are hard to resolve ideologically. \n \n \n",

   "While Iraqi Kurdish autonomy has been virtually guaranteed by the US throughout the occupation, I'm unable to locate any comments on US reaction to what will inevitably be some alignment between Turkish Kurds (12-million, the largest Kurd population in the world and in rebellion), Iraqi Kurds (4-million) and Iranian Kurds (5-million).\n \n Turkey, with good reason, is upset and views 20-million aligned Kurds, who are not secular minded, as a threat. US administration, for some reason unknown to we mere mortals, is not responding to Turkish demands for clarification on the Kurd issue. While there is US administration bitterness that Turkey's drifting from US approved secularism toward Islamization, are we (US) trying to sweep another one under the rug? \n \n Maybe Iran, through affiliation with Sistiani publicly stating the US must completely leave Iraq after ratification of a constitution, might become what Syria thought was their destiny, leader of a unified ME?",
