   "The word philosophy has meant different things at different times, often reflecting the culture of the day. Usually we understand the word to mean the love of wisdom. In this sense, as it was apparently used by Socrates, it has the built-in idea of someone who is seeking wisdom, not someone who has found it. Thus we would only call someone a geologist say, if he or she actually had some knowledge of earth science; but when we call someone a philosopher, we refer to someone who is searching for wisdom without necessarily finding it.\n \n On the debit side, philosophers have the reputation of living in \"ivory towers\" where they pretend to work by getting intellectual impostures taken seriously - i.e. making futile abstract inquiries seem like significant contributions to knowledge. Philosophy is supposed to consist of mostly irrelevant theorising, and to be full of idle speculations that are useless to the practical business of living. \n \n The philosophy of science might be defined as the investigation of questions that arise from exploring the meaning of science and the nature of scientific practice. But philosophy itself is neither a science nor a pseudo-science. \n \n James.",

In attempting to knock a few erudite dung beetles off there heaps of philosophy I seek no glory for myself. I merely strike out at the root of poor argumentation. It would rather seem that it is ye who insists on flashing your 200 level philosophy course credentials with every post. I make no academic pretension, I merely lift the curtain and point out that the veil of high language hides a vacuous argument. Ye seem to be under the impression that ye may simply assert any philosophical position backed up by nothing more than a few $10 words and a festoonery of quotes from dead Greeks and obscure socialist thinkers. Ye substitute a quote from scripture with a quote from Cicero. In this, ye are no more effective than the Christian ye deride. A complex argument poorly made can be struck down with a simple riposte. Ye have an astonishing ability to write but ye have not infused your writing with any form of irrefutable logic. If ye add some concrete argumentation ye will be a formidable one indeed. As of now, ye are simply a sea gull. Ye drop into a room, make a lot of noise, #### all over everything then are astonished when a simple BB pellet fells ye. Don't blame David's simplicity when ye argue like Goliath. Sarcasm makes a wonderful sling stone. If ye do not change your tactics, why would ye have me change mine?",
