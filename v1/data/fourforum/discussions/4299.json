   "London: Support for Terrorists? \n After Nick Sturdy put on the air the interview with Chechen militant commander Shamil Basaev he became a real celebrity. Sooner or later it happens to all able journalists. Still, the sooner the better. And it is much better if somebody lends you a helping hand for it.\n Well, Nick must be not that easy, I'm sure. I wonder why he didn't show up much earlier. He even happens to have some sources in MI6, as I know. I heard it was a kind of his relative or so who works there. D'you remember the stink about the list of British intelligence agents in Internet? I remember there was a guy Sturdy by name. Maybe he was his relative, maybe not. Anyway, it doesn't matter.\n The main thing in this story is that Nick Sturdy had to fly to get the tape with the interview not to the Middle East but to faraway Azerbaijan, which is bordering Iran (as I learnt from various reliable sources). And he surely met there not with the Al'-Dzhazira representatives but with certain Elikhanov - a man representing the rebels' leader Aslan Maskhadov. That was exactly he who gave the tape to Nick. Anyway, Nick was quite a success. He even might include this episode of his life into his memoirs one day. Such a detective story a la James Bond 007. \n Meanwhile, there is something else to think about - that is the time chosen for the interview broadcast. That is before the meeting of George Bush and Vladimir Putin in the end of February. I think, in this way all possible was done to spoil the warm and friendly atmosphere at the meeting of the two presidents. Isn't London too jealous about the rapprochement of Washington and Moscow? Such a strong and authoritative ally in the Arab world like Russia would be very useful in our anti-terrorist coalition. \n Why should London act as a mouthpiece of terrorists?",
