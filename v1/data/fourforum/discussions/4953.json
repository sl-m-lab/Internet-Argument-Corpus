Also, never once did Jesus EVER mention anything pro or con in respect to homosexuality. \n Sure, there's a condemnation by Paul in Romans, but first one must look at the original texts of that letter and understand exactly what word was actually used. Once one has done that, research the actual meaning of the word used and how modern translations are lacking in context. \n \n Sorry, but I really don't see the problem with someone being truly Christian and homosexual. If one is truly Christian, then that person would have already come to tearms with the societal stigma. \n True Christians don't look to exclude anyone from truly following the word of God or the teachings of Christ. True Christians would know that unless a person wishes to follow Jesus' teachings, any attempt to force anyone else to do so (by way of shaming someone, enacting governmental laws forcing one view of religious idealism/dogma, or whatever other tacticts are being untilized by so called \"cafeteria-Christians\") would be against what Jesus ever wanted. \n \n If you are truly Christian, I bid you peace in your personal search for answers to your questions, but I suggest that you simply be at peace for now. Realize that such answers just might not be needed to be answered for now.",

The Old Testament mandates that people commit cold-blooded murder, among other atrocities. Any references to homosexuality in the Old Testament are, as far as I'm concerned, as meaningless as those mandates to murder. I am also aware that people who do follow the Old Testament argue that those references to homosexuality are mistranslations anyhow. I do not know of any references to homosexuality in the New Testament; people have linked me to passages talking specifically of promiscuity, though that has nothing to do with homosexuality. Still, I do not follow even the New Testament, for I understand that to have been written by some man who was not Jesus, and men are certainly falliable. I relate only to the words of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament, and if the words of Jesus ended up telling me to hurt another without reason, I would disobey those words. I would not follow those words without inserting my own judgement of them, but so far my judgement has invalidated none of his morals.",

Gay sex in the context of a committed relationship is hardly extra-marrital. \n As jyoshu has said, even without governmental recognition of a marriage, a couple is still married as long as it's an emotional commitment. Therefore, a gay couple who has made such an emotional commitment is simply expressing physical intimacy, not adultery. \n So, even attempting to compare heterosexual adulterous affairs with commited homosexuals relationships is just plain disingenuous.",

Some you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you wre made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\"\n\n \n The NIV contains the phrase: \"homosexual offenders.\" Suppose for the moment that Paul had written \"heterosexual offenders\" or \"heterosexual sexual offenders.\" We would not interpret this today as a general condemnation of heterosexuality; only of those heterosexuals who commit sexual offences. Perhaps the appropriate interpretation of this verse is that it does not condemn homosexuals. Rather it condemns homosexuals who engage in sexual offences. \n The original Greek text describes the two behaviors as \"malakoi\" (some sources quote \"malakee,\") and \"arsenokoitai.\" Although these is often translated by modern Bibles as \"homosexual,\" we can be fairly certain that this is not the meaning that Paul wanted to convey. If he had, he would have used the Greek word \"paiderasste.\" That was the standard term at the time for male homosexuals. We can conclude that he probably meant something different from persons who engaged in male-male adult sexual behavior. \n \"Malakoi\" is translated in both Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 as \"soft\" (KJV) or as \"fine\" (NIV) in references to clothing. It could also mean \"loose\" or \"pliable,\" as in the phrase \"loose morals,\" implying \"unethical behavior.\" In the early Christian church, the words were interpreted by some as referring to persons who are pliable, easily influenced, without courage or stability. Non-Biblical writings of the era used the world to refer to lazy men, men who cannot handle hard work, and cowards. [John] Wesley's Bible Notes defines \"Malakoi\" as those \"Who live in an easy, indolent way; taking up no cross, enduring no hardship.\" 6 One knowledgeable but anonymous reviewer of our web site said that the word translated here as \"effeminate\" really \"means men not working or advancing ideas so as to concern themselves with love only. Not working for the good of the whole....Our present culture has all sorts of connotations associated with the word 'effeminate' that simply don't apply\" to Paul's era. It would seem that the word \"effeminate\" can only be regarded as a mistranslation. \n \"Arsenokoitai\" is made up of two parts: \"arsen\" means \"man\"; \"koitai\" means \"beds.\" The Septuagint (an ancient, pre-Christian translation of the Old Testament into Greek) translated the Hebrew \"quadesh\" in I Kings 14:24, 15:12 and 22:46 as \"arsenokoitai.\" They were referring to \"male temple prostitutes\" - people who engaged in ritual sex in Pagan temples. 4 Some leaders in the early Christian church also thought that it meant temple prostitutes. Some authorities believe that it simply means male prostitutes with female customers - a practice which appears to have been a common practice in the Roman empire. One source refers to other writings which contained the word \"arsenokoitai:\" (Sibylline Oracles 2.70-77, Acts of John; Theophilus of Antioch Ad Autolycum). They suggest that the term refers \"to some kind of economic exploitation by means of sex (but no necessarily homosexual sex).\" 2 Probably \"pimp\" or \"man living off of the avails of prostitution\" would be the closest English translations. It is worth noting that \"Much Greek homosexual erotic literature has survived, none of it contains the word aresenokoitai.\" 5 \n Still others thought that it meant \"masturbators.\" At the time of Martin Luther, the latter meaning was universally used. But by the 20th century, masturbation had become a more generally accepted behavior. So, new translations abandoned references to masturbators and switched the attack to homosexuals. The last religious writing in English that interpreted 1 Corinthians 6:9 as referring to masturbation is believed to be the [Roman] Catholic Encyclopedia of 1967. \n Many would consider catamites, (a boy or young male who engaged in sexual activities with men) to be a likely valid translation for the first behavior. Such boys were often slaves, kept by rich men as sex partners. The second term might then refer to the men who engaged in sex with the catamites. That is, they are abusive pedophiles. The New American Bible 3 contains a footnote which reads: \n \"The Greek word translated as 'boy prostitutes' [in 1 Cor. 6:9] designated catamites, i.e. boys or young men who were kept for purposes of prostitution, a practice not uncommon in the Greco-Roman world....The term translated 'practicing homosexuals' refers to adult males who indulged in homosexual practices with such boys.\" \n Harper's Bible Commentary (1998) comments that the passage refers to \"both the effeminate male prostitute and his partner who hires him to satisfy sexual needs. The two terms used here for homosexuality... specify a special form of pederasty that was generally disapproved of in Greco-Roman and Jewish Literature.\" \n Many religious liberals might agree that the center portion of 6:9 might be accurately translated as: \"male child abusers and the boys that they sexually abuse.\" i.e. the two behaviors probably relate to that portion of pedophiles who are child rapists, and the male children that they victimize. The verse would then refer to the crime of child sexual abuse and has no relation to homosexuality in the normal sense of the term: i.e. consensual sexual relations between adults of the same gender.\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibc1.htm",

(27) And the men, instead of having NORMAL sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this SIN, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved.\"\n\n \n Again in 1 Timothy 1:10, Paul does not use the standard word for homosexuality at the time, in his original Greek text. So it is more than likely he was not talking about the immorality of homosexuality itself. He was speaking about specific acts of prostitution and exploitation, which are wrong...\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibc7.htm\n \n Romans 1:24-26..\n \n Verses are unrelated to homosexuality: The complete passage describes how the ex-Christians engaged in orgiastic, presumably heterosexual sexual activities. This type of behavior was common among Pagan fertility religions in Rome during Paul's time. Paul writes that, later, God \"gave them over\" to something new: homosexual behavior. This implies that throughout their lifetime they had had a heterosexual orientation and had engaged only in heterosexual sex. God influenced them so that they engaged in homosexual sex. This was, for them, an unnatural activity. They were criticized because they were engaged in sexual activity which was unnatural for them. For a person with a heterosexual orientation, homosexual behavior is \"shameful,\" \"unnatural,\" \"indecent,\" and a \"perversion.\" The passage in Romans is not a condemnation of homosexual behavior. Rather, it disapproves of sexual behavior that is against a person's basic nature (i.e. homosexual behaviors by people whose orientation is heterosexual). Presumably this would condemn heterosexual behavior by gays and lesbians -- activity which is equally against their nature. 2 \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibc5.htm\n \n \nGod also disliked Homosexuality then,in the Levitical time period, as he does now the verse is Lev. 18:22 \"Do not practice homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman. It is a detestable SIN.\"\n\n \n What Bible says don't practice homosexuality? Gay Christians don't have sex with another man as with a woman. If you believe this refers to them, you also must believe they should be murdered. Or are you allowed a different interpretation only in that particular case? I am only asking, I don't mean to come off as sarcastic.\n \n \nHow is a Homosexual Christian able to justify his/her actions? That is all I was inquiring about.\n\n \n Perhaps their interpretation, context, and general sense of spirituality is different, than those who believe their actions are immoral and condemned by God. I don't understand how anyone could believe in a God who is so superficial that he negatively judges people by their personal sexual actions which harm no one. That greatest, most awesome, God, would have to spend a lot of his time like a lowly peeping tom, looking in our bedrooms.",

   "Here we go...alright...we've gotten way off topic. I asked for your ways of justification and the best answer I get is that I interpreted scripture wrong or I have simply been brainwashed into believing it is in the Bible. Well first I want to clear something up:\n \n Jesus Loves every single individual to ever exist that is why he cam to pay the ultimate price through crucifixion on Calvary Hill. He loves you yesterday, today, and tomorrow. The only way to be away from God forever is two ways, one to blaspheme his Holy Spirit Blatantly saying you never want anything to do with God again and never want to feel his presence, or by your choice of being Cold, which are pretty similar routes both resulting from YOUR CHOICE to be away from God. Regardless Jesus loves you whether your a mass murderer, or whatever. \n \n Now for the scriptures that I'm obviously misinterpreting:\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 \"Don't you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitues, or PRACTICE HOMOSEXUALITY , or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people-none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God. Some you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you wre made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\"\n\n \n Yes, you are misinterpreting these. Firstly, there was NO word in the original texts of the Bible for \"homosexuality\". The word itself was not coined until the beinning of the last century. So, one MUST look at the translations and understand what the original context was. \n Here's an exerpt from Whosoever.org: \n \n\n I CORINTHIANS 6:9-10 \n \n It is amazing the number of times that you will see the word \"sodomite\" or \"homosexual\" or \"pervert\" in different translations concerning this text. It is amazing because no one knows exactly what the words of the original text mean! The layperson, unfortunately, has no way of knowing that interpreters are guessing as to the exact meaning of these words. Pastors and laypersons often have to rely upon the authority of those who have written lexicons (dictionaries explaining the meaning of words) of Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic words. The authors of scriptural lexicons search for the meaning of the word within the scriptures themselves and also go outside of scripture and research literature written around the same time the scriptures were written. If the interpreter is already prejudiced against homosexuality they can translate these words as condemning homosexual sex even based upon little usage of that word in the Scriptures and little if any contemporaneous usage of that word. \n \n The truth is that the word some translators \"transform\" into \"sodomite/homosexual/pervert\" in I Corinthians 6:9-10 is actually TWO words. Some translators combine them because they \"think\" they go together but they DO NOT KNOW. This uncertainty is reflected in the fact that other translators keep the words separate and translate them \"effeminate\" and \"abusers of themselves with mankind\". \n \n The two words in the original Greek are \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\". Malakoi is a very common Greek word. It literally means \"soft\". It is used in Matthew 11:7-18 and Luke 7:24-25 in reference to soft clothing. Scholars have to look at material outside of the Bible in order to try and figure out just what this means. The early church Fathers used the word to mean someone who was \"weak\" or \"soft\" in their morals and from the time of the reformation to the 20th century it was usually interpreted as masturbation. In Greek this word never is applied to gay people or homosexual acts in general. \"No new textual data effected the twentieth-century change in translation of this word: only a shift in popular morality. Since few people any longer regard masturbation as the sort of activity which would preclude entrance to heaven, the condemnation has simply been transferred to a group still so widely despised that their exclusion does not trouble translators or theologians.\" (See Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 105-107) \"Arsenokoitai\" is discussed in the next section as it is found here and in I Timothy 1:8-11. \n \n Note: Greek contained no word which compares to the English noun \"homosexual\" meaning someone of homosexual orientation. In fact the word \"homosexual\" (meaning someone of homosexual orientation) was not even coined until the late 1800'S by German psychologists, and introduced into English only at the beginning of the 1900's. (See Christianity, Social Tolerance, and homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 42) However, during scriptural times there were a number of Greek words to describe homosexual sex acts and the two words \"malakois\" and \"arsenokoitai\" do not appear among them (on \"arsenokoitai\" see Boswell, pp 345-346.)\n \n \n \n \n \n1 Timothy 1:10 \"The law is for people who are sexually immoral, or who PRACTICE HOMOSEXUALITY, or are slave traders, liars, promise breakers, or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome teaching that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God.\"\n\n \n I really have to laugh at the repetitiveness of which the phrase \"practice homosexuality\" shows up in your specific translation. What version is that, the \"God Hates Fa*s\" Bible? \n Here's some more reading from Whosoever.org: \n \n1 Tim 1:9 again refers to malakoi arsenokoitai which has been variously translated as homosexuals, sexual perverts etc. Again, the original meaning of the text as been lost.[1]\n \n Dr. Rembert Truluck writes of arsenokoitai: \n \n The word translated as \"homosexual\" or \"sexual pervert\" or some other similar term is Greek arsenokoites, which was formed from two words meaning \"male\" and \"bed.\" This word is not found anywhere else in the Bible and has not been found anywhere in the contemporary Greek of Paul's time. We do not know what it means. The word is obscure and uncertain. It probably refers to male prostitutes with female customers, which was a common practice in the Roman world, as revealed in the excavations at Pompeii and other sites. \n \n When early Greek speaking Christian preachers condemned homosexuality, they did not use this word. John Chrysostom (A.D. 345-407) preached in Greek against homosexuality, but he never used this word for homosexuals, and when he preached on 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10, he did not mention homosexuals. See the full discussion of this in John Boswell's book: Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality - Appendix 1, \"Lexicography and Saint Paul,\" pages 335-353. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I TIMOTHY 1: 8-11 \n \n The word \"arsenokoitai\" (sometimes translated \"abusers of themselves with mankind\") literally means male-bed. \"Bed\" is a euphemism for copulating. This word is extremely rare in Greek. Paul was apparently the first author to use this word. The word taken literally (male-copulator) is very ambiguous. Take, for example, the word \"lady-killer.\" Does it mean \"a lady who kills\" or \"someone who kills ladies\"? In our language it means the latter, but even then it is not clear because we do not mean that someone literally kills ladies but that their charm \"kills\" them. So taking the word \"arsenokoitai\" or \"male-copulator,\" does it mean \"a male who copulates men\"; does it mean \"a man who copulates with women\"; does it mean \"a man who is copulated?\" \n \n The Bible does not clarify. These are the only two passages in the whole Bible where this word is used... Apparently there is no known contemporaneous literature in which this word is used. However, relatively close to the time Paul wrote it was used to refer to a male copulator connected with temple prostitution. It probably had this meaning until the late fourth century after which it came to mean a lot of different things, including homosexual activity. (See The Bible and Homosexuality, Michael England and Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 42) \n \n Even IF the words \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\" COULD be connected with a male homosexual sex acts it STILL would not tell us WHAT KIND OF HOMOSEXUAL SEX ACT IS BEING CONDEMNED. They could refer to sex practices connected with the worship of idols, pederasty or some other sexual act which is exploitive. \n \n It is clear that the translation of these two words as \"sodomite\", \"pervert\" or \"homosexual\" has very little, if any, sound basis and is a result of homophobia.\n\n \n \n \nAs in regards for not understanding Romans, well let's see if you read the chapter Paul is explaining to the church of how God gave the people over back in the days of Adam to Noah and how they angered God by not worshiping him, etc. Romans 1:24 \"...As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.\" Then in verse 26 it states \"Even the women turned againts the NATURAL way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. (27) And the men, instead of having NORMAL sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this SIN, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved.\"\n\n \n Yup, more:\n \n \nRomans 1:26 and 27, at first glance, appears to condemn gay and lesbian activity. Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.\n \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.[1] \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.\n\n \n \n \nGod also disliked Homosexuality then,in the Levitical time period, as he does now the verse is Lev. 18:22 \"Do not practice homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman. It is a detestable SIN.\"\n\n \n Yup, it's official, you've got some strange translation there. \n \n Here, try reading this: (yup, you guessed it, once again, from Whosoever.org)\n \n \nLeviticus 18:22 states: \"Thou shall not lie with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination.\" The term abomination (to'ebah) is a religious term, usually reserved for use against idolatry; it does not mean a moral evil. The verse seems to refer to temple prostitution, which was a common practice in the rest of the Middle East at that time. Qadesh referred to male religious prostitutes. (See the discussion of Deuteronomy)\n \n Leviticus 20:13 states: \"If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they should surely be put to death....\". The passage is surrounded by prohibitions against incest, bestiality, adultery and intercourse during a woman's period. But this verse is the only one in the series which uses the religious term abomination; it seems also to be directed against temple prostitution.\n \n These passages are part of the Jewish Holiness Code which also: \n \n permits polygamy \n prohibits sexual intercourse when a woman has her period, \n bans tattoos \n prohibits eating rare meat \n bans wearing clothes that are made from a blend of textiles \n prohibits cross-breeding livestock \n bans sowing a field with mixed seed \n prohibits eating pigs, rabbits, or some forms of seafood \n requires Saturday to be reserved as the Sabbath \n Churches have abandoned the Holiness Code; it is no longer binding on modern-day Christians. They can wear tattoos, eat shrimp, wear polyester-cotton blends and engage in temple prostitution without violating this particular section of the Bible. Although this code is obsolete for Christians, many clergy still focus on those passages which deal with homosexuality.[1] \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n It is likely that the prohibition thou shall not lie with a male as with a woman came about for one of the following reasons: \n \n Only sexual acts which could lead to procreation were valued as the tribes needed to grow in numbers in order to survive. \n Male homosexual sex may have been connected in the Hebrew mind with idolatry. Notice that Lev. 18:2 deals with idolatry. In fact many of the prohibitions in the Holiness Code were probably connected with idolatrous practices, see 19:26-29. \n Women were second class citizens in the Hebrew culture and were generally treated as property. If a man was penetrated in sexual intercourse he was being treated like a woman and so was degraded in the Hebrew mind. The offense was not that this was a homosexual act, the offense was that a MAN was treated like a WOMAN. If this line of thinking is correct it would serve to explain why there is no prohibition against female homosexual acts in the Old Testament. Women could not be degraded by such an act as they were already not held in high esteem. there is a theory that the Hebrew people believed in a perfect order of creation and anything that violated that order was considered unclean or an abomination. A probable example would be that fish were considered the perfect sea animal, hence anything in the sea that did not have scales and fins was unclean. (Lev. 11:9-10) Cattle were the perfect cud chewing animal, hence anything that chewed cud, but didn't have hooves was unclean. (Lev. 11:6). If this theory is correct then the prohibition against male sex acts would be violating the role of the perfect ideal human: man. It would seem to mix the sex role of the imperfect woman with the ideal role of the man. \n Even if the reader disagrees with the theories stated above they should take note that these verses are a part of the Hebrew scriptures often called the 'Holiness Code'. This 'code' is no longer followed by the Christian church. \n In Leviticus 18:19 (which is just a few verses before the prohibition 'thou shall not lie with a man as with a woman') having sexual relations with a woman during her period is forbidden yet this is not proclaimed as a binding rule for today. \n \n Also, 18:8 and 18:18 show that this code allows for polygamy yet this is now considered immoral. \n \n 19:28 prohibits tattoos yet they are not proclaimed as sinful by the Christian church. \n \n 19:19 forbids crossbreeding of livestock yet the church allows, farmers who do this very thing to worship in church. \n \n 19:19 forbids sowing a field with mixed feed, yet farmers are not condemned who plant hay and alfalfa. \n \n 11:7 forbids the eating of pigs, yet people unashamedly have a side of bacon with their eggs! \n \n 11:6 forbids the eating of rabbits (hares) because they don't have cloven hooves but they chew cud, yet some Christians love to eat rabbit. \n \n 11:9-10 forbids the eating of any seafood that doesn't have fins and scales, yet shrimp and lobster lovers are not told to repent by Christians, nor is Red Lobster picketed! \n \n 23:3 instructs that the seventh day of the week is to be the Sabbath, not Sunday, yet the Christian church disregards this. \n \n Deut 22 states that a woman is not telling the truth if she says she was raped but no one heard her scream.\n \n It is clear that the Christian church does not abide by the Holiness Code. It was a set of regulations which governed the Hebrew tribes but is not considered binding on the Christian church because there is now a NEW COVENANT IN JESUS CHRIST! The following verses talk about this New Covenant: \n \n Colossians 2:16-17 \"Therefore let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is Christ.\" \n \n Hebrews 8:18 \"For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law made nothing perfect.\" \n \n Hebrews 8:13 \"In that Christ says 'a new covenant,' Christ has made the first obsolete.\" \n \n Hebrews 9:9-10 The Old Covenant \"was symbolic...concerned only with foods and drink, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.\" \n \n There are those who recognize that Christians are under a New Covenant and yet state that the Old Covenant was divided into three parts, civil, ceremonial and moral. They then insist that the moral part of the Old Covenant remain in force. This distinction can nowhere be found in the Old Covenant itself. In fact, many guidelines clearly have both a civil/ceremonial use AND a moral one (See Leviticus 19:13). Who, then, has the authority to decide \"this is morality, but this is civil procedure and this is ceremonial...\"? \n \n Since the Christian church does not follow the Holiness Code it has no right to arbitrarily pick Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13-14 as still binding just because it seems to support a particular prejudice.\n\n \n \nMaybe, I'm misguided. This is the truth I know, and these are the scriptures I live by, so that is why I posed my original question with the most respect as to:\n \n How is a Homosexual Christian able to justify his/her actions? That is all I was inquiring about.\n\n \n \n As I have said, I do not need to \"justify\" my actions. Not to you or to anyone. I am living my truth. I have nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hide. God loves me for living honestly and with love. \n As for you, it's really your problem, not mine. \n \n With the most respect and love in Christ....[/QUOTE]",

   "Let me go ahead and warn you now--the way some here interpret the Bible is that anywhere it mentions gay sex, they either always say it really doesn't and chalk it up to translation issues (a cop-out, often) or compare it to parts of the law that most don't use anymore like pork eating.

If you had any intellectual curiosity or took your theology seriously, there are plenty of books on the subject.\n\n \n LOLL!!! You're absolutely making this up as you go along aren't you? There are many, many church resolutions and decrees going back all the way to the Council of Nicea and before. \n \n Tell you what, let me help you out on this. Early councils and decrees by the Church petaining to homosexuality:\n \n The first statement of a Church council on homosexual practices was issued by the Council of Elvira (305-306). The decree excludes from communion, even in articulo mortis (at the moment of death), the stupratores puerorum (corrupters of boys). The decree of the Council of Ancyra, held in Asia Minor in 314, strongly influenced the Church of the West, and it was often cited as authoritative in later enactments against homosexual practices. Canon 17 speaks about those \"who . . . commit [acts of] defilement with animals or males.\" The Council of Ancyra established for these crimes a series of punishments according to the age and state of life the infractor: \"Those who have committed such crimes before age twenty, after fifteen years of penance, will be readmitted to the communion of prayer. Then, after remaining five years in that communion, let them receive the sacraments of oblation. However, let their lives be analyzed to establish how long a period of penance they should sustain in order to obtain mercy. For if they unrestrainedly gave themselves over to these crimes, let them devote more time to doing penance. However, those aged twenty and over and married who fall into these crimes, let them do penance for twenty-five years and [then] be received in the communion of prayer; and, remaining in it for five years, let them finally receive the sacraments of oblation. Moreover, if those who are married and over fifty years of age commit these crimes, let them obtain the grace of communion only at the end of their lives.\"\n \n In the opening speech of the XVI Council of Toledo in 693, Egica, the Gothic King of Spain, exhorts the clergy to fight against homosexual practices: \"See that you determine to extirpate that obscene crime committed by those who lie with males, whose fearful conduct defiles the charm of honest living and provokes from heaven the wrath of the Supreme Judge.\"\n \n The most complete set of norms against homosexual practices in the medieval era is contained in the canons approved at the Council of Naplouse, assembled on January 23, 1120 under the direction of Garmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Baldwin, King of the same city. On that occasion, a sermon was preached about the evils that had befallen the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Earthquakes, plagues, and attacks by the Saracens were judged as a punishment from Heaven for the sins of the people. As a consequence, the Council issued twenty-five canons against the sins of the flesh, four of which related to homosexual practices. Death at the stake was decreed for those convicted of those specific crimes. \n \n The Third Lateran Council (1179) establishes: \"Anyone caught in the practice of the sin against nature, on account of which the wrath of God was unleashed upon the children of disobedience (Eph. 5:6), if he is a cleric, let him be demoted from his state and kept in reclusion in a monastery to do penance; if he is a layman, let him be excommunicated and kept rigorously distant from the communion of the faithful.\"\n \n OH but, this is sort of close to being around that 1000 years ago when supposedly the church had no problem with homosexuality, at least according to BobNelson2 . . . Hmm, odd that there seems to be plenty to indicate the Chruch opposed homosexuality.\n \n Wait! There's more . . .\n \n Nevertheless, with the Renaissance this vice surfaced again. Homosexuality was a matter of grave concern to Saint Pius V. As well-known historian von Pastor narrates, \"In the first year of his pontificate, the Pope had two preponderant concerns: zeal for the Inquisition and the struggle against 'this horrendous sin whereby the justice of God caused the cities contaminated by it to be consumed in flames.' On April 1, 1566, he ordered that sodomites be turned over to the secular arm. . . . The various imprisonments of sodomites . . . impressed Rome and frightened especially well-established people, for it was known that the Pope wanted his laws enforced even against the powerful. Indeed, to punish for vices against nature, the torment of the stake was applied throughout the pontificate of Saint Pius V. . . . An earlier papal Brief mandated that clerics who were guilty of that crime be stripped of all their posts, dignities, and income, and, after degradation, be handed over to the secular arm.\" The Holy Inquisitor promulgated two Constitutions in which he castigates and punishes the sin against nature. (http://www.tanbooks.com/doct/church_sodomy.htm)\n \n Heck, there's so much I could paste a lot more. Anyone who actually thinks the stance against homosexuality today is worse than 1000 years ago (or \"diametrically opposed to the one they had 1000 years ago) hasn't done much reading himself. If anything, the Church has softened up on it.",

   "Well...ha...honestly. Some of you on here have proven yourselves to be so intelligent in other topics and areas on these forums, yet you resort to harsh, hostile responses claiming I am truly ignorant. Anyways, here's another scripture, Jesus is confronted by the Pharisees concerning marriage and divorce:\n \n Matthew 19:4-6 \"Haven't you read the Scriptures?\" Jesus replied. \"They record that from the beginning 'God made them male and female.' And he said, 'This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.' Sincey they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together.\"\n \n Here God/Jesus defines marriage as between man and women, and since you are living in sexually immorality if you aren't married while having sexual relations, then this is just another angle that affirms the fact that YOU CAN NOT JUSTIFY HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE BIBLE. I'm not condemning you, I'm simply worried that you are missing a big piece of the puzzle, which may or may not keep you from growing closer in your relationship with Christ and receiving his rewards, blessings, and Ultimate Goal (HEAVEN). \n \n I admit you have some fancy spin about Greek/Hebrew/Latin interpretations and how Christians throughout the ages have been out to \"get\" the homosexuals in the world. \n \n Justine Credible for you using one excuse how the word homosexual didn't exist is pretty 4th grade of you.

Normally I would let something go like this, but God is really convicting me to keep on with this debate. Naturally I'm lazy, which I've said before. I'm not trying to brag nor boast, but I have read the whole Bible and all throughout it you'll find scripture concerning marriage being between man and a woman and homosexuality being wrong.\n \n I'm sorry, it's honestly not in my nature to be confrontational or argumentative unless I truly feel it to be necessary. However, I can't just let this one go bye, please at least just contemplate it and pray to God for those who have claimed Jesus as their Savior and are homosexuals. I would rather be safe than sorry. I hate cheesey cliche's but honestly. I'm glad you have found Jesus and serve him, but there were even things in my life that took me like 5 years to realize that they were wrong and I quit trying to justify them before I surrendered it to God.\n \n With Love and Prayers....",

That person would have to believe that Christ wants them to be dominated and shamed and labelled immoral over an innate part of who they are, simply because they are different. This would be an impediment to having a closer relationship with Christ, or an impediment to having one that isn't abusive. You asked earlier on, about how gays can be Christains. If they believe about Christ what you believe, you probably have a point. Gay Christians may have to believe Christ loves them for who they are, and didn't choose to be, in order to have that close, good, relationship with Christ. \n \n And I still don't buy the it's just the actions, not the innate sexuality, thing. Without the sexuality, the actions wouldn't just occur for no reason. The actions are an expression of the sexual identity. If you tell someone it is immoral to act on their sexuality, you believe that person's sexuality is immoral. The message is one's innate sexuality is immoral and sinful, and that teaches a person shame about this important part of who they are as human beings. \n \n Those who wrote the Bible, did not have the sophisticated understandings of sexuality and gender in their time, like we have thousands of years later. Those writers were influenced by their education and culture.

   "You know, you see one thing where I just don't. Yes, I see an example of marriage, but not defined. You see God's condemnation of all homosexuality where I see condemnation of one not having respect for their own self or body. (ie, prostitution and idol worship). \n Not once is a committed, loving, long-term homosexual relationship ever mentioned. All examples are of temple prostitutes, male/male rape, adultery and chattlization of women. \n Unfortunately there are examples of other same gender relationships which are conveniently ommited from the Bible. They are contained in books which, because of politics were left out. The Book of Mary, the Book of Ruth and others. \n Have you ever once asked why there are no books written by women, or from the prespective of women included in the compilation called the Bible? \n \n Because of these blantent ommitions I no longer have faith in the men who compiled this book. They were human beings, ruled by politics and money. \n No, I only follow what my heart and my soul tells me. I do not ask another human to interpret God for me, as all too many men are too easily lead astray by other men. *note, \"men\" here, I am refering to humans.\n \n \nYOU CAN NOT JUSTIFY HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE BIBLE\n\n \n No, you're right, you cannot justify homosexuality, nor can you justify heterosexuality. But I can justify love. \n I am not even attempting to justify anyone who disrespects themself so much as to go against his/her own nature. No matter what that nature actually is. I do not condone sex without love, I do not condone self-abuse in any form. But I am not abusing myself to share my love with another human being who in turn gives me love back. \n \n I know I have been gifted with blessings from none other than God himself, but only after I stopped living a lie. Only once I began to live honestly and without fear was I granted peace, support and the company of a life partner. \n I am very much at peace with God and man. If the laws of man do not respect me and others like me, for who we are...human beings who love, then it is my responsibility as another human to work for that respect/recognition of our human-ness. \n \n No, I do not feel my statement of the fact that the word \"homosexual\" itself did not exist in the time of the writting of the books of the Bible, to have been so elementary. If you actually read what I had posted, there was an explanation attached to my pointing that fact out. \n The words which have been translated to mean \"homosexal\" were infact words which have several other meanings. Least of which, and probably most unlikely would be \"homosexual\" in the way we see that word today. \n \n One must understand that one of the words which were actually used in fact translates to mean, weak or feminine. The fact that women were seen as property, chattle...less worthy to men than a dog, meant that if a male put himself in the position of a female they were disrespecting themselves and lowering their selfworth.\n Since we already know that temple prostitution was also seen as disrespectful to one's own self, we must conclude that the lesson is to have more respect for one's own body. \n When I read that and later reflected upon it, it was like a revelation to me. It was an \"OH, NOW I GET IT\" moment. It's a theme repeated often throughout the Bible. \n \n You say you surrendered your conflicts to God, but what you don't admit was that these were your conflicts, not anyone elses. God did not answer all the questions of the world to you all at once. Because we are not meant to know them all in this life. I know my spiritual conflicts have been quenched and that is all I can ask for. \n \n I appreciate your respect, and I do respect you as well. I believe you did not come here to condem but to learn. All I can do in return is to try to give you what you seek from what I have. My experiences, my knowledge, my faith. \n I don't expect you to accept it as your own, just to respect it as mine.",

But in fact the Catholic church is more tolerant now than it's probably ever been. You don't get to now act like you were arguing something different all along . . .\n \n But go ahead and post vague pictures or anonymous isolated rites to supposed same-sex unions in the Church from moments of history if you really think it stands up to the weight of official decree after decree of the RCC's stand against gay sex which reflects the fact they knew all along it was wrong.\n \n \nNow, to my point. I find it strange that you are willing to dig up academic sources that support your position (well, undermine in a way, since the record is repleat with horrendous cruelty) but you're unwilling to read anything that demonstrates the inconsistency of the Church's position\n \n \n The history, the FULL history, shows that there is no \"absolute truth\" in the Church's treatment of homosexuals, there is no consistency, there is no single tradition, and that there is nothing stopping the Church from re-examining its position in light of new evidence other than embarrassment and prejudice.\n\n \n Bob, everyone knows you were just arguing with VOR just to be argumentative, and weren't trying to make some point about 'absolute truth' or \"inconsistencies.\" But since you've decided to bring up absolute truth, you are obviously wrong since they were certainly consistent all along in their belief that gay sex was a very immoral act. If that's not consistency, I don't know what is.\n \n \nI am so going to enjoy never hearing \"love the sinner...\" again. Ahhhhh...\n\n \n I never said I agreed with the way the RCC treated gay people. If they HAD loved the sinner and not the sin, their history of mistreatment toward gay people would have gone much differently. But so far, you don't seem to be able to understand the difference between the sinner and the sin.",

I don't know why I'm trying to get you to see that the Catholic Church has had periods of something other than inexcusably evil teaching and practices against gay people. Fine, if you won't read anything else, and you won't investigate anything else, and if you won't even consider the opinions of serious scholars just because you're uncomfortable with the implications of their studies, then I give up. You're right. The Catholic Church has had a consistently inhumane, abominable record vis-a-vis gay people, the Jews, Gypsies, Muslims, etc. There is no other way to look at the Church other than as one of the most horrendous, misguided, truly evil organizations in the history of humanity and the sooner it is bannished from the earth, the better.\n \n Let's just toss the baby out with the bathwater.\n \n [QUOTE=jyoshu]Bob, everyone knows you were just arguing with VOR just to be argumentative, and weren't trying to make some point about 'absolute truth' or \"inconsistencies.\" \n \n Argue with VOR? Are you nuts? He won't hold onto a topic long enough to even bother engaging him. He hasn't had a substantive exchanged with anyone on this board. The only reason I bother with any of this **** is because I think there is some value, indeed great value, in trying to understand the development of this culture's heritage, including its theological heritage. The requires one look at ALL the record. Looking at ALL the record reveals that cultures change and that there can be just and \"Christian\" ways of dealing with each other based on the commonly-held good characteristics of honesty and charity.\n \n But, hey, if you want to stick to Levitical Law and centuries of misunderstanding and purposeful manipulation, go for it. All that will do is drive the Church into further irrelevance.\n \n \nBut since you've decided to bring up absolute truth, you are obviously wrong since they were certainly consistent all along in their belief that gay sex was a very immoral act.

There is a mountain of difference between the stand that gay sex is immoral, and mistreatment of gay people.

That essential straight sexuality must involve these things? I can see many ways they are different, especially in terms of potential harms. These things are quite different than being gay as well. These things alone, don't make a logical reason to disagree with someone's gay or straight, sexuality and the acting on it. They are just a diversionary tactic, to draw attention away from the fact that you don't have an argument against someone being gay and acting on it. Other than, that's what the elites tell you to think. \n \n \nSee, for the church it's about a moral standard--there's no difference in their eyes between those examples and someone acting on their sexual desires with someone of the same gender.\n\n \n Then they are not very sophisticated.\n \n \nLike I said, if that's true then why should the church not let a man marry 5 wives, or have sex with his sister?\n\n \n Well, actually, you didn't use the classic diversion of polygamy until now.\n \n \nYou are basically arguing for no boundaries whatsoever. Do you really think the church can do that? It's not going to happen.\n\n \n No, that's not what I am arguing for. You kind of contradict yourself, because you suggested earlier I was using harm as the determining boundary. The determination of harm comes as the result of thinking, not letting a self- appointed authority or elite, the fellow human leaders of your church, do all your thinking for you.\n \n \nAnd I don't think you are giving them nearly enough credit.\n\n \n They exist in a reality that is that different from everyone else's?",

   "I have been married for 40 years, have 4 grown children 10 grand children........You see unlike you I know why God put me on this earth........Its called procreation.........\n\n \n The premise that gay couples don't merit treatment as married couples because of the disconnect between homosexuality and procreation cuts across many arguments against same-sex marriage. It is argued that gay marriage would be \"unnatural\" because it cannot produce children, the ostensibly natural end of marriage. It is argued that gay marriage would undermine the institution of marriage because it is a legal and moral institution designed to promote and protect procreation and the raising of children. Finally, it is argued that gay marriage would desecrate the godly mandate that heterosexual couples have to mate and propagate the species. Is any of this true, and if so, does it matter? \n \n To begin with, is it valid to assume that the \"natural\" end of marriage (or sex in general) is procreation, and that therefore non-procreative gay couples cannot reasonably be allowed to marry? I think not. There are two ways this premise can be refuted: by showing what its logical conclusions would be if actively employed, and by taking apart its philosophical basis. \n \n First, if we were to take this premise seriously, there would have to be a radical change in the laws surrounding marriages. For one thing, no infertile couples would be allowed to marry. This would include both younger people who are infertile due to health issues as well as older people who are infertile due to the progress of old age. But who would agree to that? \n \n It is worth noting that the opprobrium heaped upon gays who want to marry is not directed upon elderly people who want to marry, thus proving that that opprobrium cannot possibly stem from people's disapproval of a couple that won't be having children. In contrast, consider people's reactions when someone gets married for reasons other that love, like citizenship, money, or social status. This strongly suggest that society regards love as the basis for marrying, not producing children. \n \n Even worse, if we were to seriously enforce the idea that marriage exists for the sake of having and raising children, wouldn't we prohibit couples from remaining childless voluntarily? Even if we didn't outlaw both contraception and abortion, we would have to take steps to ensure that all married couples not be childless: if they won't produce their own kids, they would have to adopt some of the many orphaned and abandon children currently without stable homes and families. Because we don't see anyone arguing for such outrageous measures, we must conclude that opponents of same-sex marriage don't take that principle as seriously as they seem; and because such measures are so outrageous, we have good reason not to take it seriously. \n \n But even if we ignore those conclusions, the premise itself has a number of flaws. It contains the idea that there is an essential disconnect between homosexuality and children, something it shares with the argument that the institution of marriage exists to promote and protect not only procreation but also the raising of offspring. This idea is, however, quite mistaken. Gay couples are not universally childless. \n \n Some have children because one or both partners were earlier involved in a heterosexual relationship that produced offspring. Some gay male couples have children because they have made arrangements with someone else to act as a surrogate mother. Some lesbian couples have children because they used artificial insemination. Finally, some gay couples have children because they have adopted. Whatever the reason, more and more gay couples are not childless - and if marriage, whether in \"nature\" or as a legal institution, exists to promote and protect both procreation and the raising of children, then why can't it do so for gay couples as well as straight couples? \n \n Another serious flaw in the premise that the \"natural\" end of marriage is procreation is that it makes a fetish out of biological functions. Since when do people tailor their activities based solely or even primarily upon what they imagine the biological ends to be? Who gets married solely to have children and not to pursue a meaningful and intimate relationship with someone they love? Who eats food solely in order to ingest nutrition and not to enjoy the social and psychological experiences that accompany a good meal? \n \n Finally, it is argued that the existence of gay marriages would constitute a desecration of a sacred institution created by God for the purpose procreation. This might be true if churches that regarded homosexuality as an abomination were forced to perform and recognize same-sex marriages - this would be just as bad as if churches were required to hire priests and ministers from different faiths. But no one is suggesting that this occur. \n \n Civil marriages, established and regulated by secular laws in a pluralistic society, cannot be restricted by how some religions conceive of marriage from within the theological boundaries of their faith. Marriage between members of different religions cannot be legally proscribed simply because some churches consider it sacrilege. Marriage between members of different races cannot be legally proscribed simply because some groups regard miscegenation as contrary to God's will. So why should marriage between members of the same sex be any different? \n \n Marriage within a religion might be conceived as having been authored by God, but that is not and cannot be the starting basis for civil society. In civil society, marriage is authored by secular laws voted upon by representatives of the people and as interpreted by the courts. Thus, we are the authors of civil marriage - religion no longer plays any essential role. I have personally married people in ceremonies where religion has been completely non-existent. \n \n Marriage does not exist in order to further any mandates from anyone's gods. Marriage does not exist simply in order to encourage and protect procreation. Marriage does not exist because it is a \"natural\" function. No, marriage exists because society finds that it is valuable and worthy to encourage and protect committed, intimate relationships that are pursued over an extended period of time. \n \n As an institution, marriage helps provide legal protection and stability to human relationships that might not otherwise survive problems and pressures under more informal terms. Financial and social benefits are thus conferred upon marital relationships because their long-term stability furthers general social stability. We haven, then, both essentialist and pragmatic reasons for the existence of marriage, all of which apply to gay marriages just as well as they apply to traditional marriages between members of the opposite sex.",

Surely you aren't so short-sighted to realize that your comments take us to unrealistic and impossible changes.\n \n You don't seem to understand something: most people in the church LIKE the fact that the Church provides moral guidance. They don't want it another way. Did you see ANY of the news footage of thousands of people outside the Vatican as a Pope was chosen? They LIKE having \"elites\" (your word) giving them guidance. Not everybody in the world wants to be a rebel. As far as the church is concerned, that doesn't mean they are \"robots under the control of the mothership\" (the \"Elites.\") There's nothing wrong with looking to something for guidance--just like you probably do when you get opinions from a friend or family member on decisions or something. Surely you do that from tiem to time and don't live in a vacuum. \n \n \nAre you saying that being straight and being into incest and underage sex are the same thing.\n \n \n Of course not; I'm simply pointing out that straight people are expected by society to 'keep it in their pants' all the time, unlike what you seemed to think. Really, it's not that horrific of a thing to actually do something besides having sex--it's only probably an awful thing to people who make sex WAY too much of a priority in their life in the first place. To them I say: 'get a life.'\n \n \nWell, actually, you didn't use the classic diversion of polygamy until now.\n\n \n It's actually a very good way to analogize same-sex relationships; that's why it comes up a lot.\n \n \nNo, that's not what I am arguing for. \n\n \n Then what ARE you arguing for? You seem to want to gut the RCC of it's leadership, from what I can tell, and you have a real problem with people agreeing with it's leadership, and you assume agreement with their views is \"letting the elites tell them what to think.\" How arrogant to think that just because they don't agree with YOUR view, that they aren't thinking for themselves. Do you actually think people NEED the church to tell them that gay relations are wrong??? Do you not realize that there are plenty of people who aren't religious at all who know this?\n \n \nYou kind of contradict yourself, because you suggested earlier I was using harm as the determining boundary. The determination of harm comes as the result of thinking, not letting a self- appointed authority or elite, the fellow human leaders of your church, do all your thinking for you.\n\n \n You ARE aguing for 'harm' to be the only determinant for morality--a typical liberal mindset. I'd hate to think that mere 'harm', as difficult as that is to measure sometimes with people, was that standard I used. \n \n You see, it's not the \"elites\" that decide what my standard is. You have to understand that people have their own religious experiences and views; they aren't robots, no matter how much you think they are. I know LOTS of Christians who don't agree with everything the church tells them. But fortunately, most still know good and well that gay sex is wrong.",

That is how we realize what is moral, just, and good, by asking those questions.\n \n \nDid you see ANY of the news footage of thousands of people outside the Vatican as a Pope was chosen? They LIKE having \"elites\" (your word) giving them guidance. Not everybody in the world wants to be a rebel.\n\n \n Jesus said he came to set a man against his family. Where do you think the word Protestant comes from? It comes from the word, \"protest\"!\n \n \nAs far as the church is concerned, that doesn't mean they are \"robots under the control of the mothership\" (the \"Elites.\") There's nothing wrong with looking to something for guidance--just like you probably do when you get opinions from a friend or family member on decisions or something. Surely you do that from tiem to time and don't live in a vacuum.\n\n \n No, there is nothing wrong with looking for guidance. That doesn't mean you stand idly by like a coward and close your mind to injustices and atrocities. Sometimes that guidance can be wrong. I did not mean to suggest it always is. I'm sorry if I gave that impression. It works best when allowing people to be convinced of it, through good arguments, which engages people's logical thought processes, their intellect. \n \n \nOf course not; I'm simply pointing out that straight people are expected by society to 'keep it in their pants' all the time, unlike what you seemed to think.\n\n \n No, straight people are not expected to keep it in their pants, and I still don't see what it has to do with your classic diversions. However, you don't seem to care if an argument has any logic to it. \n \n \nReally, it's not that horrific of a thing to actually do something besides having sex--it's only probably an awful thing to people who make sex WAY too much of a priority in their life in the first place. To them I say: 'get a life.'\n\n \n Sexuality is important to most people. Otherwise you wouldn't be here arguing against gay sexuality. It wouldn't matter to you. I didn't say it was the only thing in life. Although, sometimes one may get that impression, given how heterosexuality is in so many books, movies, TV, so much music, magazines, and used to sell everything in the marketplace. Straight people are merely accustomed to having acceptance of their sexuality. It is obviously important to them, as it is demonstrated everywhere, everyday. They just don't have to talk about it in the context of their rights and their equality, because they take those things for granted. Yes, I am a gay man who enjoys sex. It has no affect on you, so why don't you get a life, and stop opposing my rights based on something you suggest isn't even that important?\n \n \nIt's actually a very good way to analogize same-sex relationships; that's why it comes up a lot.\n\n \n No, it is fallacious. Why do you think it is a good analogy?\n \n \nThen what ARE you arguing for? You seem to want to gut the RCC of it's leadership, from what I can tell, and you have a real problem with people agreeing with it's leadership,\n\n \n When it's leadership is wrong, based on a two-way thought process between leadership and everyone else. \n \n \nand you assume agreement with their views is \"letting the elites tell them what to think.\" How arrogant to think that just because they don't agree with YOUR view, that they aren't thinking for themselves. Do you actually think people NEED the church to tell them that gay relations are wrong??? Do you not realize that there are plenty of people who aren't religious at all who know this?\n\n \n People \"know\" that gay relationships are wrong through fallacious reasoning, or through no thinking at all.\n \n \nYou ARE aguing for 'harm' to be the only determinant for morality--a typical liberal mindset. I'd hate to think that mere 'harm', as difficult as that is to measure sometimes with people, was that standard I used.\n\n \n Harming people without a good reason is immoral, and cowardly. From what we know about sexuality today, teaching gay people shame about their sexuality is harmful, and that gay people's sexuality is not harmful. You have to question and take into account new information and new ways of thought as they becomes available. Otherwise, we would still believe the Earth is flat, and we should be burning certain people for disagreeing with us, slavery is acceptable, certain races are inferior, women have only certain roles set out for them by men, and on and on. I'd also hate to think a book thousands of years old, and your religious doctrine was your only source of information on any subject. \n \n \nYou see, it's not the \"elites\" that decide what my standard is. You have to understand that people have their own religious experiences and views; they aren't robots, no matter how much you think they are. I know LOTS of Christians who don't agree with everything the church tells them. But fortunately, most still know good and well that gay sex is wrong.\n\n \n Based on what reasons?",

You have no idea the consequences set to befall you and your partners for the obscene and lucrative vileness you have committed in the eyes of God.\n\n \n \n Until God comes down here, in person and takes over the government of THIS COUNTRY, guess what? NO RELIGION WILL DICTATE OUR LAWS! \n \n I've said this before, but obviously it needs repeating:\n \n Keep your religion out of MY bedroom, keep your religion out of MY government, MY schools, MY state legislature, MY Senate floor, MY LIFE! \n \n \n But wait I forgot Du thinks God is a sedictive bastard, and Im the idiocy of a thousand fools.\n\n \n Well first off, it's \"sadisitic\" not, sedictive. What you just said was kind of a combination of seductive and addictive, but it's still a word that doesn't exist.\n So, yeah, maybe Duo had a point there.\n \n \n \n So it seems you men win the argument by default by the reasoning there is no God and there is no judgement, and no way am I going to listen to a bible thumping conservantive ignoramous with the brain the size of a pea.\n\n \n As far as the LAWS OF THIS LAND, there is NO GOD! \n Yes, there is a \"creator\" mentioned, but not once named. There is also a little thing called \"Freedom of Religion\" which means if I don't follow your specific dogma, you don't get to make up laws which do not reflect MY beliefs!\n \n \n WE KNOW EVERYTHING. So therefore you win. Have fun.\n\n \n Um, having an identy crisis there? I really don't think this is the place to work out your mental heath issues. I suggest you seek professional help.",

He also fulfilled the scriptures that the prophets foretold of His birth, death and resurrection.\n Therefore, we are not under the curse of law where death rules over those who do not obey the law, but under grace, where those that disobey can live through Christ, who has taken away that sin and placed it upon Himself.\n Whoever does anything contrary to the law still sins, but we have Christ who will instantly, without griping or complaining, stand in for us.\n Also, whoever throws at us the law and demands that we stick to it because we are sinful, also takes that same spanking. Who is willing to do that other than those that have forgotten Christ? By the same token, those who continue in sin, deem it necessary to crucify Christ all over again.",

That makes no sense. \n \n Here is the rest of the story explained by scholars...\n Genesis 18:20 to 19:29--The Sodom Story\n \n \n \n Some consider the sin of Sodom to be same-gender sex, although we are not told in Genesis what Sodom's sins were, only that they were so great that God determined to destroy the city. On the evening before its destruction he sent two angels, in disguise as men, to the city to lead Lot and his family out early the next day. Hospitable Lot invited them to spend the night at his house. During the evening the men of the city surrounded the house and demanded of Lot that he bring the two men out so that they could [19:5]\n \n King James Version: \"know them.\"\n \n Revised Standard Version: \"know them.\"\n \n New International Version: \"have sex with them.\"\n \n When Lot refused to bring his guests out, the men of the city were about to break his door down when the angels struck them all blind and the mob dispersed. The next day Lot and his family were led out of Sodom, and the city was destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven.\n \n \n \n The Hebrew verb used here, \"yadha,\" \"to know,\" is used 943 times in the OT and only ten times clearly to mean \"have sex,\" then it always means heterosexual sex. The word normally used for homosexual sex is \"shakhabh.\" Many scholars believe that in Gen. 19:5 yadha means \"know\" in the sense of \"get acquainted with\" (the city's men may have wondered if these were enemy spies or they might have sensed the city's impending doom and been concerned with what these strangers were doing there) and have several arguments for this, including Sodom's being used as an example of great sin numerous times in the Old and New Testaments with nothing ever said about same-sex sex, and the context of Jesus' references to Sodom (Luke 10:10-13) which seems to imply lack of hospitality as the sin.\n \n \n \n Other scholars think it was the common practice of showing dominance over and humiliating outsiders by forcing them to take the part of a (an inferior) woman in a same-gender rape.\n \n \n \n Others think it means \"have sex,\" and point to Lot's offering his two virgin daughters to the crowd if sex is what they want, if they will just leave his guests alone. If this is the right interpretation, it is clearly about violent, criminal, gang rape, something always condemnable.\n \n \n \n Another thought is expressed by Religion Professor David L. Bartlett: \"This story is certainly an unlikely starting point for a `biblical' understanding of sexual ethics. While the attempted homosexual rape by the men of Sodom is explicitly condemned, the offer by Lot to hand his two virgin daughters over to the violent and lecherous inhabitants of Sodom is related without a word of judgment.\"B-2\n \n \n \n Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, \"The notorious story of Sodom and Gomorrah--often cited in connection with homosexuality--is actually irrelevant to the topic.\"B-3\n \n \n \n There is nothing in this story applicable to our consideration of homosexuality.\n http://www.godmademegay.com/Letter.htm",

That's you picking and choosing the sources and views you happen to want. The reality is that by far most people in the world are not gay and are attracted and build relationships with opposite-gender partners. The reality is that gay people are not that common--some estimates put them at 1% of the population, and I've never seen any figure for it higher than 7% (which is a stretch). It happens to be that some in our society claim to have same-sex attractions. But by far most people have normal everyday opposite-sex attractions. There's no \"scale.\" There may be a scale for those other than us 90%+ who are attracted to opposite-sex people, who knows.

   "Um . . . no. That's you picking and choosing the sources and views you happen to want. The reality is that by far most people in the world are not gay and are attracted and build relationships with opposite-gender partners. The reality is that gay people are not that common--some estimates put them at 1% of the population, and I've never seen any figure for it higher than 7% (which is a stretch). It happens to be that some in our society claim to have same-sex attractions. But by far most people have normal everyday opposite-sex attractions. There's no \"scale.\" There may be a scale for those other than us 90%+ who are attracted to opposite-sex people, who knows. But if there were a 'scale,' or graph, it would look more like a long plateau of a line with a quick drop-off at the end that includes anything not heterosexual.\n\n \n I don't know what to make of posts like this.

   "HOw can you be a christian and still be gay or lesbian is beyond me!\n\n We are commanded by God to love UNCONDITIONALLY, one God and our fellow man/woman. We (gays) often hear from people within the church that they love us, but not our sin. That clears their minds sufficiently to believe that they are doing as God commanded, but when we are made to feel unwelcome in your churches, when we are treated with disdain, that is not unconditional love. That is VERY conditional love!\n \n I must emphasize here that I believe with all my heart that the Bible is God's Holy, Divinely-inspired, inerrant Word. It is the foundation of our faith and we must strive to understand it in its fullest, so that we may live the life that God would have us to live, to bring honour and glory to Him!\n \n There was a time when I thought it was blasphemous to question the \"truths\" of the Church, but II Tim 3:16 tells us that \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, REPROOF and instruction in righteousness.\" This tells me that God WANTS us to examine the Scriptures with an open mind, a mind that will question, a mind that will seek the answers of what it really means to live a holy life. We have an OBLIGATION to challenge what we have been taught when it doesn't fit with other parts of Scripture.\n \n Well prejudice against anyone is contrary to Christ's example of inclusiveness, acceptance and love for all, so to me, there is no corroberation for an attitude of prejudice. I'm not suggesting for a minute that Jesus was tolerant of sin. He was not! I am not! But when you investigate further, you will find that homosexuality is not about sin. Homosexuality is merely an orientation, and orientation carries no implication of morality or immorality. It is simply the direction in which a person's tendencies lie. There is no action associated with orientation, whereas morality is a matter of actions or thoughts.\n \n It is important to make this distinction, since the Bible only addresses immoral behavaviour, not sexual orientation. In each case where homosexuality is mentioned, in reality, correct interpretation of Scripture is not referring to homosexual orientation, but to immoral homosexual acts - in most cases, perpetrated by heterosexuals! If you can grasp this vital difference, please read these articles with an open heart, and may God richly bless you for stepping out in faith, and in the cause of love.\n \n I know that it's a radical concept to even consider that what we have been taught so strictly, for so long, by people we respect, could be wrong, but it has happened before, and it will probably happen again.\n \n Thank God we have the example of the apostles Peter and Paul, clarifying the wrong teachings of the early Church. Yes, wrong teachings have been around since the beginning. Thank God that He gave Martin Luther the courage to challenge the Roman Catholic Church's teachings about selling indulgances (i.e. buying our own salvation). Thank God that He has given YOU the desire to question the validity of some of the teachings that have been accepted for so many years.\n \n There are explanations for each scripture verse which SEEMS to condemn homosexuals. You will find that in actual fact, they do NOT! (See \"The Clobber Verses Explained\" article.)\n \n If you wish to email a \"straight\" pastor with questions, please read (my very dear friend) Rev. Bruce Lowe's article, A Letter To Louise - A Biblical Affirmation of Homosexuality, and then contact him. He will be delighted to respond to any questions you may have.\n \n Once again, thank you for taking the time to research this subject beyond the traditional beliefs, and may God richly bless you for reaching out to us this way, in TRUE love!\n \n The apostle Paul said it this way:\n \n \"If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.\" 1 Cor 13:1-2\n \n And Jesus said, \n \n \"All people will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.\"\n John 13:35.\n \n Love is not just words that you love us but hate our sin. Love is action. Please truly love your gay children, brothers, sisters, friends, parents, neighbours (and those who are sitting secretly in the pews of your churces) with Christ's love by reading the following.

   "Why did God burn up Sodom and Gamorrah??? Because they were doing it with the same sex!!!!!!!!!\n\n Covered this too...YAAAWWN!\n Here we go!!!\n Genesis 18:20 to 19:29--The Sodom Story\n \n Some consider the sin of Sodom to be same-gender sex, although we are not told in Genesis what Sodom's sins were, only that they were so great that God determined to destroy the city. On the evening before its destruction he sent two angels, in disguise as men, to the city to lead Lot and his family out early the next day. Hospitable Lot invited them to spend the night at his house. During the evening the men of the city surrounded the house and demanded of Lot that he bring the two men out so that they could [19:5]\n \n King James Version: \"know them.\"\n \n Revised Standard Version: \"know them.\"\n \n New International Version: \"have sex with them.\"\n \n When Lot refused to bring his guests out, the men of the city were about to break his door down when the angels struck them all blind and the mob dispersed. The next day Lot and his family were led out of Sodom, and the city was destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven.\n \n The Hebrew verb used here, \"yadha,\" \"to know,\" is used 943 times in the OT and only ten times clearly to mean \"have sex,\" then it always means heterosexual sex. The word normally used for homosexual sex is \"shakhabh.\" Many scholars believe that in Gen. 19:5 yadha means \"know\" in the sense of \"get acquainted with\" (the city's men may have wondered if these were enemy spies or they might have sensed the city's impending doom and been concerned with what these strangers were doing there) and have several arguments for this, including Sodom's being used as an example of great sin numerous times in the Old and New Testaments with nothing ever said about same-sex sex, and the context of Jesus' references to Sodom (Luke 10:10-13) which seems to imply lack of hospitality as the sin.\n \n Other scholars think it was the common practice of showing dominance over and humiliating outsiders by forcing them to take the part of a (an inferior) woman in a same-gender rape.\n \n Others think it means \"have sex,\" and point to Lot's offering his two virgin daughters to the crowd if sex is what they want, if they will just leave his guests alone. If this is the right interpretation, it is clearly about violent, criminal, gang rape, something always condemnable.\n \n Another thought is expressed by Religion Professor David L. Bartlett: \"This story is certainly an unlikely starting point for a `biblical' understanding of sexual ethics. While the attempted homosexual rape by the men of Sodom is explicitly condemned, the offer by Lot to hand his two virgin daughters over to the violent and lecherous inhabitants of Sodom is related without a word of judgment.\"B-2\n \n Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, \"The notorious story of Sodom and Gomorrah--often cited in connection with homosexuality--is actually irrelevant to the topic.\"B-3\n \n There is nothing in this story applicable to our consideration of homosexuality.",

   "Why did God burn up Sodom and Gamorrah??? Because they were doing it with the same sex!!!!!!!!!\n\n \n Have you ever actually read that story? Hmmm...\n \n If you had you might try reading what come directly before it! God had already made up his mind to destroy the two cities. Not for homosexual acts, no, for inhospitability, gambling and adultery. \n Do you know what it's called when a man leaves his wife...for anyone? It's called ADULTERY...not homosexuality, not idolitry...ADULTERY.\n Do you know what it's called when a bunch of men want to \"know\" angels? CURIOSITY! \n Duh.\n I really hate to tell you, but the Biblical usage of the word \"know\" has not only the meaning so commonly thought of in terms of the Bible, but it means to \"meet\", \"understand\", \"be aware of purpose...\" it has many more than one meaning. \n \n Let's look at things this way.\n We know that according to the Catholic Church, Angels have no specific gender. \n We know that the \"men of Sodom\" wanted to \"know\" the angels.\n Isn't it just as likely that these men wanted to \"know\" if they were actually angels by seeing for themselves if these visitors to Lot's house were who they claimed to be by seeing whether or not they had genitalia? \n \n Remember, God had his mind made up about the two cities. He only agree to allow the angels to go because they pleaded that there must be at least one redeamable soul there. So, they were sent to find that one person. Failing their mission, God continued on his predetermined path. \n It really made no difference to God what the town's people had done at Lot's house. The fact still remained that the Angels failed.

   "God would not already make up his mind to destroy someone because he would always give them a chance first.\n\n \n \n http://whosoever.org/bible/index.html\n As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick.\n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.\n \n [1] \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually condemns inhospitality and idolatry, not homosexuality. Read the Scriptural cross-references: Deuteronomy 29:23, Isaiah 1:9, Jeremiah 23:14, Lamentations 4:6, Ezekiel 16:49-50, Amos 4:11, Zephaniah 2:9, Matthew 10:15 / Luke 10:12, Luke 17:29, Romans 9:29, Jude v.7, Revelation 11:8 \n \n NOWHERE in the Scriptures does it say that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexual sex. Even if the specific point of the story was concerning a sexual matter, rather than hospitality, the issue is rape not homosexuality. Jesus claimed the issue was simply one of showing hospitality to strangers (Luke 10:12). How ironic that those who discriminate against homosexuals seem to be the true practitioners of the sin of Sodom.\n\n \n Let's look at those suggested reference passages: \n \n http://bible.gospelcom.net/\n \nDeuteronomy 29:23 \n 23 The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur-nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in fierce anger.\n\n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&chapter=1&version=31\n \nIsaiah 1\n 1 The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.\n \n A Rebellious Nation \n 2 Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! \n For the LORD has spoken: \n \"I reared children and brought them up, \n but they have rebelled against me. \n 3 The ox knows his master, \n the donkey his owner's manger, \n but Israel does not know, \n my people do not understand.\" \n \n 4 Ah, sinful nation, \n a people loaded with guilt, \n a brood of evildoers, \n children given to corruption! \n They have forsaken the LORD; \n they have spurned the Holy One of Israel \n and turned their backs on him. \n \n 5 Why should you be beaten anymore? \n Why do you persist in rebellion? \n Your whole head is injured, \n your whole heart afflicted. \n \n 6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head \n there is no soundness- \n only wounds and welts \n and open sores, \n not cleansed or bandaged \n or soothed with oil. \n \n 7 Your country is desolate, \n your cities burned with fire; \n your fields are being stripped by foreigners \n right before you, \n laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. \n \n 8 The Daughter of Zion is left \n like a shelter in a vineyard, \n like a hut in a field of melons, \n like a city under siege. \n \n 9 Unless the LORD Almighty \n had left us some survivors, \n we would have become like Sodom, \n we would have been like Gomorrah. \n \n 10 Hear the word of the LORD, \n you rulers of Sodom; \n listen to the law of our God, \n you people of Gomorrah! \n \n 11 \"The multitude of your sacrifices- \n what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \n \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, \n of rams and the fat of fattened animals; \n I have no pleasure \n in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. \n \n 12 When you come to appear before me, \n who has asked this of you, \n this trampling of my courts? \n \n 13 Stop bringing meaningless offerings! \n Your incense is detestable to me. \n New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- \n I cannot bear your evil assemblies. \n \n 14 Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts \n my soul hates. \n They have become a burden to me; \n I am weary of bearing them. \n \n 15 When you spread out your hands in prayer, \n I will hide my eyes from you; \n even if you offer many prayers, \n I will not listen. \n Your hands are full of blood; \n \n 16 wash and make yourselves clean. \n Take your evil deeds \n out of my sight! \n Stop doing wrong, \n \n 17 learn to do right! \n Seek justice, \n encourage the oppressed. [a] \n Defend the cause of the fatherless, \n plead the case of the widow. \n \n 18 \"Come now, let us reason together,\" \n says the LORD. \n \"Though your sins are like scarlet, \n they shall be as white as snow; \n though they are red as crimson, \n they shall be like wool. \n \n 19 If you are willing and obedient, \n you will eat the best from the land; \n \n 20 but if you resist and rebel, \n you will be devoured by the sword.\" \n For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. \n \n 21 See how the faithful city \n has become a harlot! \n She once was full of justice; \n righteousness used to dwell in her- \n but now murderers! \n \n 22 Your silver has become dross, \n your choice wine is diluted with water. \n \n 23 Your rulers are rebels, \n companions of thieves; \n they all love bribes \n and chase after gifts. \n They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; \n the widow's case does not come before them. \n \n 24 Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, \n the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \n \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes \n and avenge myself on my enemies. \n \n 25 I will turn my hand against you; \n I will thoroughly purge away your dross \n and remove all your impurities. \n \n 26 I will restore your judges as in days of old, \n your counselors as at the beginning. \n Afterward you will be called \n the City of Righteousness, \n the Faithful City.\" \n \n 27 Zion will be redeemed with justice, \n her penitent ones with righteousness. \n \n 28 But rebels and sinners will both be broken, \n and those who forsake the LORD will perish. \n \n 29 \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks \n in which you have delighted; \n you will be disgraced because of the gardens \n that you have chosen. \n \n 30 You will be like an oak with fading leaves, \n like a garden without water. \n \n 31 The mighty man will become tinder \n and his work a spark; \n both will burn together, \n with no one to quench the fire.\"\n\n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023:14;&version=31;\n \n \nJeremiah 23:14 (New International Version)\n New International Version (NIV)\n Copyright \u00a9 1973, 1978, 1984 by International Bible Society\n \n \n \n 14 And among the prophets of Jerusalem \n I have seen something horrible: \n They commit adultery and live a lie. \n They strengthen the hands of evildoers, \n so that no one turns from his wickedness. \n They are all like Sodom to me; \n the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.\"\n\n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations%204:6;&version=9;\n \n \nLamentations 4:6 (King James Version)\n King James Version (KJV)\n Public Domain \n \n 6For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.\n\n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2016:49-50;&version=9;\n \n \nEzekiel 16:49-50 (King James Version)\n King James Version (KJV)\n Public Domain \n \n 49Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. \n \n 50And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.\n\n \n \n Just a few simply because to go through all of them and explain the context of each passage would take up an entire thread all to itself.",
