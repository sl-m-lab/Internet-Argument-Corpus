   "I study childcare and maternal instinct is real but sometimes it needs a little help that is why we have baby books etc. A womens body knows what it's baby needs (milk, love etc) if you're baby is crying you pick it up, if it is hungry you feed it and naturally your breast will produce the milk if you breast feed, if you're baby cries usually your breast will leak because it senses that the baby may need food. Also if you breastfeed your breats produces a liquid that quenches the babies thirst and then produces the thicker milk to feed the baby. We can also tell when there is something our children aren't telling us etc. If we do not have maternal instinct then how can we do all this?",

   "We probably need to define what a maternal instinct actually involves. \n \n I would have thought a crying baby is going to get some kind of response from any person, be they male or female. Of course, my instinctive response is to remove myself from the situation, but that might be because it's not my child or because I have never been a parent.\n \n I imagine it would be virtually impossible to distinguish between learnt and instinctive behaviour unless you completely isolated someone from society. Even then you will have individuality issues that might cloud the result. I believe all the \"maternal instincts\" described above, can be attributed to any humans normal problem resolution thought processes, if not what they have experienced or witnessed first hand. I personally don't think that this type of learning can be termed a \"natural intuitive behaviour\" since it is derived from others.",
