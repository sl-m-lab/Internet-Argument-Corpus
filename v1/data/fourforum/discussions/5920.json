   "Read this in Roll Call:\n \n \nMembers Push Journalist Shield\n Recent Cases Give Momentum to Bipartisan Legislation \n \n July 5, 2005\n \n By Emily Pierce\n \n With several journalists facing federal subpoenas and possible jail time over their refusal to name confidential sources, a House bill aimed at allowing reporters to protect their sources in most circumstances appears to be gaining some steam, though a similar Senate measure could be in trouble. \n \n \"From colleagues to leadership, there's been more interest,\" said Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), the primary author of the \"shield\" measure. \"I have sensed an upsurge in awareness that we have a problem.\" \n \n Pence said he's optimistic that his talks with House Judiciary Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) will result in the panel holding a hearing on the measure in the near future. \n \n But Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) tried unsuccessfully on Thursday to get Senate approval for a non-binding resolution decrying the potential imprisonment of two reporters who have so far refused to identify their sources to a federal prosecutor investigating the possibly illegal leak of a CIA operative's name. \n \n Several Republican Senators refused to allow the resolution to pass by unanimous consent, said Lautenberg's spokesman, Alex Formuzis. \n \n \"We don't know who they are or why they did it,\" Formuzis said of the Republican \"holds.\" Lautenberg is one of 10 co-sponsors of a bill sponsored by Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) that is identical to the Pence measure. \n \n Pence said he expects some resistance to the notion that reporters should be able to protect their sources, particularly from Members who served as federal prosecutors in the past. Still, he said he hopes that he will be able to make small changes to the legislation that might satisfy detractors. \n \n \"In order for legislation to be taken up and considered, it must be a bipartisan consensus bill with no opposition or very, very narrow opposition,\" said Sensenbrenner spokesman Jeff Lundgreen. \n \n Sensenbrenner, along with the Justice Department, would like the bill to clarify that it would not apply in cases in which classified government information has been leaked illegally, according to Pence and his chief Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Rick Boucher (Va.). \n \n \"The under-the-radar activity on this bill has been very intense,\" said Pence. \n \n He added that increased interest in his bill came last month from the revelation that former FBI official Mark Felt is \"Deep Throat,\" the source who helped Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein unravel the Watergate scandal. \n \n \"We harnessed the energy behind the Deep Throat revelation,\" said Pence. Indeed, he attracted nine new co-sponsors after Deep Throat was unmasked. \n \n But Pence expects even more co-sponsors to sign on now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the two reporters in the CIA leak case must submit to questioning. Continued refusals could cause a federal judge to send them to jail this week. \n \n In addition, four more reporters were subpoenaed last week to provide source information in a civil case being brought by Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos National Laboratory employee who claims illegal government leaks identified him as a suspected spy and ruined his reputation. \n \n Because of those recent cases, Pence said that now is the time to give the journalist-source relationship the same protection that exists for doctors and patients as well as lawyers and clients. \n \n \"This is not about protecting reporters. This is about protecting the public's right to know,\" he said. \n \n Pence said the current legal atmosphere that reporters face may make some government whistle-blowers less likely to come forward, because they fear journalists will be compelled to name them in court. \n \n \"The Founding Fathers distrusted government power, and they knew that the only check on government power is a free and independent press,\" said Pence. \n \n Pence and Boucher already have 40 co-sponsors who run the ideological spectrum, from conservatives like Pence and Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to moderates like Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.) and Rep. Stephanie Herseth (D-S.D.) and partisan stalwarts like Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rahm Emanuel (Ill.). \n \n House Majority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) is also a co-sponsor of the bill, perhaps increasing its chances of passing the House this session. \n \n Meanwhile, Lugar will likely let the House move on the bill first, according to his spokesman, Andy Fisher. Still, Lugar is actively drumming up support in the Senate for his bill, Fisher added. \n \n \"There are a lot of possibilities for it to pass this session,\" said Fisher. \n \n The bills would forbid federal prosecutors and courts from compelling news outlets and journalists to testify or produce documents unless the government has exhausted all other avenues to obtain such information. The measure also would bar courts from forcing journalists to reveal anonymous sources or any information that would lead to the discovery of a source's identity. \n \n The measure sets out different thresholds for civil and criminal cases, but in all cases, reporters could not be forced to testify unless lawyers had corroborative information from a non-journalist. \n \n The measure would not retroactively affect reporters in the CIA leak case or the Wen Ho Lee case. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have \"shield laws\" giving reporters some protection from prosecutorial inquiries.\n \n\n \n What do you all think?",

   "I am definately opposed to journalists having a blanket protection for their sources. It allows them to publish anything they desire with no consequences and no responsibility. The threat of having to reveal confidential sources to a court is sufficient to keep reporters (at least partially) honest.\n \n As I understand it, the only way to get a journalist to reveal his source is when there is a criminal or civil investigation, and the reporter is witholding information from the court (confidential source) that can help to resolve the case. At that point, the journalist has the option of revealing their source in the interests of justice, or face a perjury conviction.\n \n Note that if the journalist doesn't reveal their source, that piece cannot be used as evidence in a trial. So if a journalist publishes an anonymous source confessing to a murder, then someone else is tried for that murder, the journalist's work cannot be used as evidence in the accused's defense (unless the journalist reveals his source).\n \n I'd support a judge's decision to limit the exposure of the journalist's source if the journalist can provide a compelling reason why the source should be kept secret (dissemination of information important to the public is a good reason), but a blanket ability for journalists to protect their sources is a bad idea.\n \n And of course we all know that the First Amendment doesn't convey any absolute rights, they always must be balanced against public and national interest.",

I want simple protections for the organization, much like the sacred doctor-client and lawyer-client privileges, and view any attempts to weaken that type of relationship as an assault on your and my rights. \n \n Looking for a fool-proof structure while allowing it to weaken and wither is counter-productive, IMO.\n \n Equally important is to understand that news organizations are not a monolithic institution, but rather fierce competitors. \n \n On a tangent, yesterday I heard of Iraq's version of reality television.

   "Wanted to update this thread with an editorial from the NY Times on the topic. \n \n \nTime for a Federal Shield Law\n \n July 21, 2005\n \n It was immensely encouraging to see Republican and Democratic lawmakers testify together yesterday about the need for the federal government to follow the lead of 49 states and guarantee that journalists are allowed the right to protect the names of confidential sources in most circumstances. Two Republicans, Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, and Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, spoke eloquently about the role of a free press in a democracy. They have also shown that drafting a responsible shield law is not as hard as some critics say. Just this week, they amended bills pending in both houses of Congress to address the government's concern that the rights of reporters should not override the security of the nation when it faces an imminent threat.\n \n But the day's testimony was also disturbing. Witnesses spoke of the dozens of subpoenas that have been issued to journalists in recent times and the half-dozen or more reporters who have been found to be in contempt of court for doing their jobs - some journalists, like Judith Miller of The Times, have actually been jailed. As Mr. Dodd pointed out, the idea that jailing reporters will inhibit journalism is not a theoretical worry. Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., testified yesterday that since his decision to turn over notes in the Valerie Wilson case to the federal prosecutor, Time reporters had shown him mail \"from valuable sources who insisted that they no longer trusted the magazine.\" The Cleveland Plain Dealer has announced it will not publish two investigative reports because they are based on leaked documents and the paper fears the possibility of subpoenas. Its editor said, \"Jail is too high a price to pay.\" We regret that decision, but it should at least ring alarm bells for Congress.\n \n The amendments added this week to bills before the Senate and the House would provide for the forced disclosure of confidential sources \"to prevent imminent and actual harm to the national security.\" It is a narrow exception that journalists should support, because as William Safire, the retired Times columnist, testified yesterday, \"We are not seeking an absolute privilege.\" We second Mr. Safire's caution that an imminent threat means an actual and urgent threat, not a potential threat.\n \n Mr. Safire and the other witnesses deftly refuted the arguments that have been used to cloud the debate. There is no case on record, for example, of a newspaper's claiming the right to protect a violent criminal. Nor is there any reason to believe that a journalistic privilege would hamper prosecutions any more than the privileges already granted to doctors, psychiatrists, lawyers and spouses. There is no case on record where prosecutions have not been brought or have failed because of shield laws in states where such laws - including many providing absolute protection - have been on the books for decades.\n \n We wish the Justice Department had shown enough interest to send a witness to this important hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee. But there should be no doubts left about bipartisan support for a federal shield law, or about the practicality of drafting one that protects both a vital institution of democracy and national security. Congress, which has managed to consider pork-barrel spending and corporate giveaways, should be able to find the time to pass such a vital law in this session.\n\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/opinion/21thu2.html?\n \n Looks like Blunt's bill has taken a bit of an interesting turn. What do you all think of the developments?",

   "That sounds like a fabrication to me. We have all kinds of protections for whistle blowers and if they are personally involved they can turn states witness. Maybe what they are really talking about is a mole, or should I say rat.\n\n \n A couple of interesting insights into how much anonymous sources play into daily reporting in your newspapers:\n \n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/07/24/EDGSJDRPR91.DTL\n \n \nHardly a day goes by that a story doesn't rely in some way on sources who can't, won't or shouldn't come forward and be named. Some of these people never appear in print. Instead, they provide story tips, point reporters to key information in out-of-the-way filing cabinets or help them to figure out where the skeletons are buried. Others show up in direct and indirect quotes with attribution such as \"according to a source\" or \"one unnamed official said. \"\n \n These people, whose motives vary, may not bring down world leaders or change the course of a war, but they're essential to helping this and other newspapers pierce the corporate veil in search of corruption and peer closely into the workings of government to ensure the public's business is done.\n \n Think Enron. Think BALCO. Think just about every politician who feeds at the public trough until someone blows the whistle.\n \n Without unnamed sources and the ability to protect them, a newspaper is hobbled, challenged to counterbalance the self-preserving spin that inevitably comes from officialdom.\n\n \n http://www.centredaily.com/mld/centredaily/news/opinion/12213800.htm\n \n \nit's also certainly true that the practice of protecting sources is overused and abused. But what is truer than all of the above is that Judith Miller's and Matt Cooper's stories are not really about journalism or special privileges for media. Rather, their stories are about the public's right to know and to have access to information in order to govern themselves.\n \n Smaller community newspapers might get by without anonymous sources because, indeed, the stakes are not so high on most daily beats. But in the power axis of the world, where lives and fortunes and political futures are the reporter's ransom, confidentiality is critical.\n \n Without reporters who will protect those who tell dangerous secrets, the same people who applaud Miller's incarceration will know only what the government wants them to know. I'd rather risk the occasional anonymous scoundrel - or suffer the institutional humiliation of a bad actor posing as a journalist - than leave fate to the whims of men and women enjoying the hubristic intoxication of power and their own manufactured myths.\n",
