Tongues will cluck. Some will be upset or even outraged.\n \n This is will not alter fans attendance or TV watching one bit. A few early polls have already said that. \n \n This situation occurs because this is a huge business not a game. They are already thinking of making no retroactive punishments for those caught. The punishments will be decided on a \"case by case basis\" with apparently some subjectivity involved. Banning Roger Clemens for 2 years? Not on your life. I suspect there will be a few perfunctory slaps on the wrist. It remains to be seen whether this will substantially alter business as usual in MLB.",

Even though I know it's just supply and demand that keeps jacking up their salaries, I think it is outrageous that they are so highly paid.\n\n Baseball is -- or maybe was -- my favorite sport, yet I agree with jt here. Even when I loved baseball, I couldn't believe people were getting paid such ridiculously large sums of money to play with a ball. There are countless people doing work infinitely more important that these people (regardless of how talented, hard-working, juiced, or any combination of these they are) who will never see the amount of money that some of these guys get for standing around in the outfield for an inning.\n \n I hate pulling the \"back in the old days\" trick -- especially because I'm not old enough to have been around in the old days, but I used to be such a huge fan that I knew all of the history -- but... back in the old days, baseball wasn't such a cat-and-mouse game. Nowadays, teams have specialty pinch hitters, specialty left-handed relief pitchers, etc. Hell, they've even got specialty pinch runners. It's not even uncommon that a pitcher will come in, throw one pitch, and then hit the showers.\n \n Baseball used to be exactly what the old rule book said: \"a game between two teams of nine [players].\" Now for just one side in any given game, there are twenty players, a manager, thirty-eight coaches, and seventeen syringes all playing a part.\n \n The problem really is that it has become a business. Today's \"baseball\" couldn't be any less about the game of baseball. And because the fans don't care, nobody will be doing anything to change it.",

As to others, who knows? \n \n Lots of users of all types of drugs do not use them \"before the big game\", McGuire may be the exception.\n\n But you seem to think that alcohol is the \"biggest drug of all\" in the game. I highly doubt that you are correct. Maybe in the stands, but not on the field. These athletes are using steroids to enhance their performance, hence the term \"perfomance enhancing drugs\". Alcohol would not be considered a performance enhancing drug by the vast majority of people, especially major league baseball players who understand that strength, agility, and motor coordination are essential to the game. \n \n \nDo you support the prohibition of drugs OTHER THAN alcohol?\n \n If so, please explain your double standard.\n\n It depends on the drug. Should steroids be legal? Sure. Should any sports organization be able to ban them from use by players and institute random or mandatory testing...absolutely. The vast majority of people who use steroids are athletes looking for an edge. Why not fight the problem where it exists, instead of calling for a \"prohibition\" of a certain drug that is sure to have the same effect that prohibition of alcohol had? \n \n Our country is far too hung up about drugs. I think that we should learn to take each individual drug on a case by case basis.
