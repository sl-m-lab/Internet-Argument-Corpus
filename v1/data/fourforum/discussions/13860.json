   "  Burglary victims attacked in their own home once every 30 minutes \n A householder is attacked by a violent burglar every 30 minutes. \n\n The householder is getting awfully darn tired of it too, and ask if the burglar could pick on someone else for a change. emoticon_smile Alright, so maybe this isn&#8217;t really funny. \n \n   Burglary victims attacked in their own home once every 30 minutes \n The shocking statistic exposes for the first time the epidemic of terrifying intruder confrontations taking place in Britain. \n \n It will intensify demands for householders to be given greater protection if they use force to protect themselves and their family against a burglar. \n\n \n   Defenseless British citizens are attacked in their own homes by violent burglars every 30 Minutes \n According to the BCS, householders came face-to-face with burglars in 20 per cent of domestic burglaries last year. . . Of the burglaries in which the victim came face-to-face with the intruder, violence was either used or threatened in 59 per cent of crimes. . . It was actually used in 40 per cent of cases. . . Tories estimated that householders came face-to-face with burglars in 57,000 &#8211; 20 per cent &#8211; of burglaries. . . Of these, 23,000 resulted in the burglar using violence against the householder.\n \n However, the gun ban laws didn&#8217;t stop criminals from acquiring and misusing guns. Instead, British criminals buy their guns the black market, or simply manufacture their own illegal guns.....\n\n Gun control is NOT Crime Control! It only makes for peaceful compliant victims of these violent predators!",

Official statisticians say this is misleading because the method of collecting data was changed in 2002.\n ....\n \n They omitted Home Office warnings that the figures for the periods before and after 2002 were not comparable because of a change in the way violent crime was recorded. ......\n \n The effect was to force up recorded violence by an estimated 35 per cent in the first year.\n \n This came to light after the Milton Keynes MP Mark Lancaster put out a statement saying there were 6,015 \"violent attacks\" in the town last year, reflecting a 236 per cent increase over the past decade. The figures were given to Mr Lancaster by Conservative Central Office.\n \n This infuriated the local police chief, who told the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper that the statistics are &#8220;extremely misleading&#8221;.\n \n Nikki Ross, the local commander, said that the figure includes &#8220;everything from public order offences, to harassment, to allowing a dog to be out of control in a public place&#8221;.\n \n &#8220;The actual number of people who were victims of serious violence was 81,&#8221; she said. \"\n \n \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7013303.ece\n \n \n 6015 Tory \"violent attacks\", becomes 81 actual ones once reality is factored in.",

   "Show me comparable figures for the US, and include ALL violent crime rather than picking one isolated stat. I'll take a slight increased risk of being attacked at home if it means a large drop in the risk of being gunned down in the street. Even if the claimed figures are correct, it represents a rate of less than 4 in 10 000 people every year. That's one in every 50 people in the entire course of their lifetime. And that's before we get on to what is considered violent crime. Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law. Is that worth shooting someone over? Despite the illustration of the article, I think you'll find virtually none of the burglars was carrying a gun, and if any householders were killed it is a tiny number.\n\n Here Jo. I won't hide anything. We have a serious problem of firearm homicides, mainly from drug dealers and Inner City gangs bravado.\n \n   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S. \nBritain's violent crime record is worse than any other country in the European union, it has been revealed.\n \n Official crime figures show the UK also has a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and even South Africa - widely considered one of the world's most dangerous countries. \n \n (The accompanying table says)The UK's violent crime rate is 2034 per 100,000.\n \n \n \n Our FBI collects our crime stats and here is the summary page for Violent Crime.   There were an estimated 454.5 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008. \n \n Here is a table listing violent crime by rate, numbers and category.  Crime in the United States by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008\n\n Our high from 89 to 2008 was 1992 = 757.7 with our absolute lowest ever recorded in 2004 = 463.2\n\n \n Now back to the UK.\n Much has been correctly made of Home Office fudging statistics but more in an attempt to cover up the problem, not to make it sound worse. And as for warning and cautions. A 2006 article.   Three Strikes and You're ... in Like Flint \n Now Britain, far from adopting zero-tolerance, looks like it's adopting a policy of not prosecuting many serious crimes at all. This is the subject of an official Home Office directive to all British police forces. British police have now been told that instead of arresting a range of serious criminals, they can be let off with a caution.\n \n The Home Office says offenses that may now be dealt with by a caution include burglary of a shop or office, threatening to kill, actual bodily harm, and possession of Class A drugs such as heroin or cocaine if police decide a caution would be the best approach.\n \n Other crimes including common assault, threatening behavior, sex with an underage girl or boy, and car theft should normally be dealt with by a caution, if the offenders admit their guilt but have no criminal record.\n \n London and British crime rates have been increasing for years. Recently total crime rates for London have been estimated at about seven times those of New York for a slightly smaller population and some authorities suggest these figures have been minimized. England and Wales are now accounted by some estimates as the most dangerous places for crime in the developed world. \n\n \n   3m crimes a year 'left out of official figures' \n Farrell and Pease estimate that 3 million crimes have been left out of the BCS as a result. The most recently published BCS report said there were 6.8 million \"household\" crimes, including burglary and thefts, and a further 4.1 million \"personal\" crimes, such as assault and robbery.\n \n The pamphlet, published today by the right-of-centre thinktank Civitas, also claims that violent crime increases by 82% if the cap on repeat victimisation is lifted, rising from 2.4 million offences to 4.4 million.\n\n As I said.

The perp showed the skills of a martial artist and no doubt his legs were shackled too or he ate a lot of pepper spray and perhaps a stun gun afterwards.\n \n The Texas concealed carry law is a benefit to officers and one would have been using justifieable deadly force in accordance with the law for the officer and their own defense.\n \n This is a good lesson in survival as well as a demonstration of empowering the people to quell criminal behavior and uphold the law.",

It is the most burgled country in Europe, has the highest level of assaults and above average rates of car theft, robbery and pickpocketing. Only Ireland has a worse record.\n \n Risks of being assaulted were highest in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark and lowest in Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Spain and France. \n \n \n 20 Jan 2008   Violent youth crime up a third \n The number of under-18s convicted or cautioned over violent offences rose from 17,590 to 24,102 - an increase of 37 per cent.\n \n Total offences climbed steadily from 184,474 in 2003 to 222,750 in 2006, the last year for which figures are available - a rise of 21 per cent. But the increase in violent offending was steeper, while robberies rose even more dramatically, up 43 per cent over the three years. Convictions of under-18s for carrying knives and other weapons doubled in a decade, from 1,909 in 1997 to 4,181 in 2006.\n \n More than half of young offenders were let off with cautions, whereby they admitted their offence but were spared a court appearance and were not punished. \n\n \n But wait. Here it what Jo found unacceptable because it came from the Daily Mail yet again! 02 Jul 2009   UK most violent in Europe \n A shocking 2,034 per 100,000 people suffer violent crime in the UK, compared to 466 in America and 1,609 in troublespot South Africa.\n\n And yet again. 02 Jul 2009   UK is violent crime capital of Europe -- The United Kingdom is the violent crime capital of Europe and has one of the highest rates of violence in the world, worse even than America, according to new research. \nThe total number of violent offences recorded compared to population is higher than any other country in Europe, as well as America, Canada, Australia and South Africa. \n \n It means there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the UK, making it the most violent place in Europe.\n \n Austria is second, with a rate of 1,677 per 100,000 people, followed by Sweden, Belgium, Finland and Holland.\n \n By comparison, America has an estimated rate of 466 violent crimes per 100,000 population. \n \n And again!   UK 'has worst violent crime rate in Europe' -- Britain has a higher violent crime rate than the US and any country in Europe, according to the Conservative Party. \n \n How does he do it? He got all of these papers to print what Jo calls a lie! He is totally amazing, no? \n \n Likely you still want us to discount all of this too. I don't know. you tell me! emoticon_smile",

   "What the hell are you talking about?\n\n \n Not well adjusted to satire Jo? I hoped you would refute that and admit that Catholics were to be denied arms. \n \n \nChicago-Kent Law Review\n \n But once, during the frenzy of Exclusion, parliamentary critics of the government called for arming Protestants, not as a right, but to protect the nation against Catholics. In the spring of 1679 an M.P. wanted a law empowering the people to arm against a king who wished to introduce popery.[56] Although no one spoke of a right of the individual to arm, members of the Commons did want to arm the people for the practical purpose of preserving the nation from Catholicism. Nothing came of this proposal nor of an address to the king in December 1680 which asked for approval of an association bill.[57] The proposed bill was modeled on the Act of Association of [Page 37] 1581, which authorized the upper classes to unite for defense of themselves and the nation were Queen Elizabeth I to be murdered.[58]\n \n The idea, then, of giving individual Protestants the right to provide and keep arms must have been a response to immediate experience. It almost certainly came from members who may have remembered the moves toward arming the populace taken a decade before, and who had received rough treatment at the hands of a zealous militia operating under the command of the king during the two previous reigns. These had already expressed outrage in debate (as we saw), and it is a near certainty that some among them translated their anger into a right of Protestants to provide and keep arms and into the demand that confiscated weapons should be returned. Their actions well illustrate the historicity of interest in specific rights; one historian has put it this way: \"A right presupposes a claim; if the claim is not made, the question of a right does not arise.\"[59] In other words, claims to specific rights emerged out of practical political disputes, not abstract theoretical discussions. At this stage in the drafting process of Article VII, members claimed this right as necessary for the public safety and placed no qualifications on it. This right was drafted, apparently, with hotheaded speed out of deep rage over the treatment that some had endured. It was not a carefully thought-out article, as the ready acceptance several days later of the Lords' significant amendments indicates.\n \n What did the committee mean by the word \"Arms\" (or \"Armes\") that Protestants should \"provide and keep\"? According to the Oxford English Dictionary, in the seventeenth century the word meant, among other less pertinent things, \"instruments of offence used in war\"; \"Firearms: those for which gun powder is used, such as guns and pistols as opposed to swords, spears or bows\"; \"defensive or offensive outfit for war.\"[60] We may assume that the word was chosen advisedly; obviously, another word could have been employed. If it is objected that the term was hastily selected, even as the article was hastily drafted, and no particular significance should be given it, it may be rejoined that the committee took two weeks to amend that article and during that time made a number of changes, but not to the [Page 38] word \"Arms.\"\n",

   "Here is another teaser Jo, perhaps you might read the entire article? As always, gun control is always about people control and has nothing to do with 'crime control'.\n \n \nThe first restriction on gun possession was religion3/4subjects must be Protestants. Now, anyone familiar with the history of sixteenth and seventeenth century England would expect that members of the Convention would limit such an extraordinary right as that of subjects to have arms for their defense to Protestants. The limitation reflected the fear and loathing of Roman Catholics that had grown and intensified in English society ever since the sixteenth century Protestant Reformation. By the late seventeenth century, anti-Catholic prejudice was deeply embedded in English culture. In one Convention debate, Henry Pollexfen expressed the feeling of the Assembly when he declared, \"Popery is the fear of the nation.\"[84]\n \n This prejudice had been nourished by a yearly church service of thanksgiving for the timely discovery and foiling of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 and sharpened by the Popish Plot of 1678-1683, said to be aimed at elevating a Catholic to the English throne. To rescue England from a succession of popish kings, a virtual certainty with the birth of King James II's son in June 1688, was one reason for the [Page 44] Revolution of 1688-89. English Protestants were outraged that King Charles II and, even more, the Catholic King James II, had tried to disarm the militia in Ireland, Scotland, and to a lesser extent in England at the same time that they had disarmed Protestant gentlemen.[85] James II had also appointed Catholic officers to his army and armed his Catholic subjects.[86] As members of the rights committee testified in debate, several of them had had their arms confiscated and/or their houses searched. Their outrage was palpable, as we saw. Language that evoked memory of these incidents was insisted upon by the lords, who added the words \"at the same time when Papists were both armed and Employed contrary to Law.\" The majority of English people despised and distrusted Catholics. The point is that restricting the right to have arms to Protestants was a reflection of Early Modern English prejudice against Catholics. The second and third qualifiers were \"suitable to their [Subjects'] condition,\" and \"as allowed by Law.\" Malcolm confessed that she found it difficult to explain these amendments, because they made \"the assertion of a guaranteed right for Protestants to have arms seems empty rhetoric.\"[87] She resolved her dilemma by recalling that \"legislative reforms proposed by the Convention, such as a modification of the Militia Act, had been left to future parliaments. This meant,\" she reasoned, \"[that] the arms article declared a right that current law negated, with the understanding that future legislation would eliminate the discrepancy.\"[88] There is no evidence in either the debates of 1689 or the later legislative record that it was agreed in 1689 that \"future legislation would eliminate the discrepancy.\" In my view the qualifiers conveyed precisely what members of the Convention intended\n \n",

   "Geesh Penfold. So we know what we are talking about.\n \n On the Technical data tab.   Violence against the person \n In order to address the wide range of seriousness, police recorded violence against the person is separated into two subcategories: most serious violence against the person (including homicide, attempted murder and more serious wounding)\n \n other violence against the person (including less serious wounding, threat or conspiracy to murder, harassment and assault without injury)\n \n All categories also include attempts and threats to commit those offences (apart from attempted murder and threat/conspiracy to murder which are themselves separate categories) that may not involve injury.\n The British Crime Survey (BCS) covers wounding, assault with minor injury and assault with no injury\n \n BCS wounding includes offences that correspond to police recorded more serious wounding and part of less serious wounding\n \n BCS assault with minor injury broadly corresponds to the remaining part of police recorded less serious wounding\n \n BCS assault with no injury corresponds to police recorded assault without injury\n \n Sexual offences\n Police recorded sexual offences cover different types of unlawful sexual activity, including rape and sexual assault. Some of the offences do not necessarily involve violence: unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 16 or with a mental disorder, for example. As with violence against the person, the range of seriousness is addressed by creating two subcategories:\n most serious sexual crime (including rapes, sexual assaults, and sexual activity with children)\n \n other sexual offences (including soliciting, exploitation of prostitution, and other unlawful sexual activity between consenting adults)\n \n Because ofXthe small numbers of sexual offences picked up by face-to-face BCS interviews, results are too unreliable to report.\n \n Robbery\n As with violence against the person, police recorded robberies cover a wide range of seriousness from armed bank robberies to muggings for mobile phones or small amounts of money.\n \n The BCS covers robberies against adults living in private households. However, as one of the rarer crimes, the number of robbery victims interviewed is too low to provide robust estimates for individual years; police statistics provide a better measure of trends. Any BCS figures relating to robbery in this chapter should be treated with cautionXbecause ofXthe low number of victims.\n \n BCS violence type\n Violent crime as measured by the BCS can alternatively be divided into four types, broadly based on the relationship between the victim and offender:\n domestic violence - assaults and woundings that involve partners, ex-partners, other relatives or other household members\n \n stranger violence - assaults and woundings in which the victim did not have any information about the offender(s), or did not know and had never seen the offender(s) before\n \n acquaintance violence - assaults and woundings in which the victim knew one or more of the offenders, at least by sight\n \n mugging - robbery, attempted robbery, and snatch theft from the person (snatch theft is not included in the overall violence measure)\n \n Trends in police recorded violent crime can be very difficult to interpret, as they have been distorted by a number of factors. It is important to consider the following issues when interpreting trends: \n police recorded crime data are subject to changes in the levels of public reporting of incidents \n local policing activity and priorities affect the levels of reported and recorded violent crime \n police recorded crime data are subject to changes in police recording practices, including those relating to national counting rules and crime recording standards\n \n The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), introduced in April 2002, again resulted in increased recording of violent and sexual crimes particularly for less serious offences, as well as for some other offences. There was an estimated NCRS effect of 23 per cent on violence against the person offences in the first 12 months of implementation. \n",

   "The 1996 legislation concerned handguns, and there hasn't been a shooting of the sort seen at Dunblane (which prompted the legislation) since then.\n\n Yeah I understand why you might want to spin it this way, but that was not the intended purpose. Here is another prospective. \n \n Award winning anti-gun English Journalist Ian Bell came to fame after Scotland's Dunblane school shooting and all of his hard hitting articles and he was sometimes credited with the gun bans in England. The full article is linked in which, 11 years after, he admits the obvious. \n \n   Dunblane made us all think about gun control &#8230; so what went wrong? By Ian Bell \n (English gun ban) The most troubling questions came, instead, from those who answered my simplicities with one of their own. They didn't oppose a ban, as such. They merely wanted to know why I was so sure that legislation would work.\n \n That seemed obvious. It even seemed faintly stupid to think otherwise. No guns, no gun-killings. Remove the threat: wasn't that one of the jobs of government?\n \n Sceptics were more subtle than I allowed. What they meant was that it is easy to impose laws on the law-abiding. Criminals, by definition, don't take much interest in well-meaning legislation. If they chose to arm themselves while the rest of society was, in effect, disarming, outraged newspaper commentators and their quick fixes might merely make matters worse.\n &#8230;..\n I read of three London teenagers murdered in the space of 11 days. I read of firearms \"incidents\" spreading like an epidemic across our cities. I read of Tony Blair holding a Downing Street summit on a crisis that seems - call me naive - a greater threat to many communities than any terrorism.\n \n What I say then becomes obvious: my idea didn't work. In fact, I begin to thread certain fears together, like links in a chain. Here's one: if even London teenagers can provide themselves with the means to kill 15-year-old Billy Cox in his bedroom, guns have become commonplace, so commonplace that every would-be terrorist worth his salt must be armed to the teeth. Bans have failed utterly. A weapons fetish escalates for a fairly obvious reason. Many things may have changed since my working-class youth, but I am certain that one piece of logic persists. If he is armed, you had better be armed too. Knives become swords, swords become pistols. \n\n August 24, 2007   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n &#8220;Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,&#8221; a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n",

Less than ZERO!\n \nHardly, seeing as we had pretty tight control on guns before then. The rise in illegal guns didn't happen because of the measures put in place in 1997.\n\n However it is plain to see that it did not stop nor control it in any way. Drug dealers money is the problem. If they can get authorities to look the other way to allow the import of drugs, importing one more illegal product is no harder for them to accomplish. I blame them.  \n \n Australia is also an Island nation and has the same problem after their bans.\n \n Here is an English study about this problem, done 10 years after your ban.   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n Australian study done by the Australian FBI, also 10 years after their bans. \n  Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n\n My only point about gun control is that Gun control is NOT Crime control! They are criminals. That is just what they do. \n \n Gun control only effects the law abiding, and the benefits of such laws are minimal at best, if they produce anything positive at all!\n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n",

You made it clear for handguns but said something to the effect \"it would be a good start\". You attempt to defend any law that makes guns illegal or restricted in any way. That is your attempt to \"take the high road\" with deniable plausability which gives you the chance to claim that it wasn't your doing (even though you agreed with it or you wouldn't have went to the trouble to try to defend unconstitutional laws) so it wasn't your stance. The old, don't blame me, blame the law I had nothing to do with even though you support it.\n \n Yeah, I know what \"regulations\" you favor and you would shun your own neighbors if they didn't agree with you. I have been seeing your favored regulations for quite a while now as do others and that is why you get held up on these boards for your contrary belief in any regulation that is opposed to the 2A statement of shall not be infringed. Heck, with you 4th Amendment protections do not exist if a firearm is involved as you were told in Tudesco, it was an illegal search on public property on public property even though he was under duress he knew the gun laws and limits of school authority better than the school...no wonder they felt it necessary to say he had been in trouble before to demonize him some more. My thoughts are he was probably right in those instances too :) emoticon_xhoho I got a new 4A case fresh out of Amarillo, Texas that essentially goes a step farther than Gant which I mentioned in the Tudesco affair.",

   "Their View: Mexican gun control: The bitter irony - Las Cruces Sun-News\n \n Tough gun laws in Mexico? Ironic.\n \n \nThere is more than one irony here, in spite of extremely rigid and restrictive gun control laws, often the wrong people in Mexico still have the guns. Now, unregistered gun ownership has hugely increased among the Mexican cartels and gangs. The average citizen is unarmed and often helpless in regard to self defense. \n \n Our U.S. Constitution was framed by individuals who believed that armed citizens could protect themselves from tyranny. This was based upon the early Revolutionary War experience fought by American patriots. Thus given the differences in culture and history between the countries of Mexico and the United States, the divergence of gun ownership laws have clearly resulted in failure for our neighbors in the south. \n \n Is this a commentary against gun control and registration in the U.S.? You can arrive at your own conclusions. Should we look at the failure of the Mexican gun ownership policy model and go back and read the Second Amendment, which allows Americans to bear arms for self defense? Again, you may draw your own conclusions. \n \n Howard O. Ness lives in Las Cruces and is a retired federal employee who conducted several foreign missions during his career.\n\n \n All former tyrants have always supported gun control!",

   "Well I see that during this spat over registration my name has been brought back into the discussion. So here is my two cents....\n \n \n I only mentioned my support for mandatory theft/loss reporting and background checks for all transfers of ownership. Neither require registration to implement. \n\n \n I disagree. I still do not think a law requiring mandatory background checks is enforceable without a registration requirement. \n \n \n All sales(including secondary) in CA must go through a FFL IIRC. \n All buyers must submit to a NICS check. \n There is an exception for relative to relative transfers. \n I would see this as the law of the land.\n Post McDonald, of course. \n\n \n I must confess my ignorance. When I read this I did not remember whether California had attempted this mandatory background check requirement without also requiring mandatory registration. So I checked and rediscovered (from the California AG's website) that California has created a mandatory registration scheme as a part of its mandatory dealer background checks law.\n \n From Frequently Asked Questions - Public - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General: \n \n What is the process for purchasing a firearm in California? \n All firearms purchases and transfers, including private party transactions and sales at gun shows, must be made through a licensed dealer under the Dealer Record of Sale (DROS) process. California imposes a 10-day waiting period before a firearm can be released to a buyer or transferee. A person must be at least 18 years of age to purchase a rifle or shotgun. To buy a handgun, a person must be at least 21 years of age, and either 1) possess an HSC plus successfully complete a safety demonstration with the handgun being purchased or 2) qualify for an HSC exemption.\n As part of the DROS process, the buyer must present \"clear evidence of identity and age\" which is defined as a valid, non-expired California Driver's License or Identification Card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles. A military identification accompanied by permanent duty station orders indicating a posting in California is also acceptable.\n If the buyer is not a U.S. Citizen, then he or she is required to demonstrate that he or she is legally within the United States by providing to the firearms dealer with documentation that contains his/her Alien Registration Number or I-94 Number.\n Purchasers of handguns are also required to provide proof of California residency, such as a utility bill, residential lease, property deed, or government-issued identification (other than a drivers license or other DMV-issued identification). \n I want to sell a gun to another person, i.e., a private party transfer. Am I required to conduct the transaction through a licensed California firearms dealer? \n Yes. Firearm sales must be conducted through a fully licensed California firearms dealer. Failure to do so is a violation of California law. The buyer (and seller, in the event that the; buyer is denied), must meet the normal firearm purchase and delivery requirements. \"Antique firearms,\" as defined in Section 921(a)(16) of Title 18 of the United States Code, and curio or relic rifles/shotguns, defined in Section 178.11 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations that are over 50 years old, are exempt from this requirement.\n Firearms dealers are required to process private party transfers upon request. Firearms dealers may charge a fee not to exceed $10 per firearm for conducting a private party transfer. Example: \n For a private party transfer involving one or more handguns, the total allowable fees, including the DROS, safety, and dealer transfer fees, are not to exceed $35.00 for the first handgun and $31.00 for each additional handgun involved in the same transaction. \n For private party transfers involving one or more long guns, or a private party transfer involving one handgun, the total allowable fees, including the DROS, safety, and dealer transfer fees, are not to exceed $35.00. The dealer may charge an additional dealer-service fee of$10.00 per each additional firearm transferred.\n Is the dealer required to give me a copy of the DROS information when I purchase a firearm? \n Upon request, the dealer must give you a copy of the DROS application. In private party transactions, the seller is also entitled to a copy of the DROS application upon request.\n \n I checked further, and the scheme appears to be this: All sales, including secondary sales, must involve a licensed FFL dealer (who can charge a nominal fee to the parties for secondary citizen to citizen transfers). For all sales, including secondary sales, the dealer is required to fill out and send in a DROS Form to the California Department of Justice. See below (from Frequently Asked Questions - Firearms Dealer - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General):\n \n How is DROS information submitted? \n The dealer collects the DROS information and documentation from the purchaser and submits it to the DOJ through MCI utilizing a Point of Sale Device (PSD). When the DROS is accepted, a unique DROS number is assigned to the transaction and the required 10-day waiting period begins. \n \n There is an exception for submitting the form by paper if the dealer is unable to access the website. As implied, every sale requires the dealer to then hold the firearm (including secondary sales) for 10 days after submitting the DROS form. Once the DROS form is reviewed and sale approved then the purchaser may get his firearm.\n \n To see what information the California DOJ collects for every transfer, click this link: Firearms Dealer Notices, Formes, and Information - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General and on that page click the link for \"DROS Worksheet\" to see a blank copy of the DROS registration form.\n \n I did discover DROS/dealer background check exceptions for some inter-family firearms transfers (again from Frequently Asked Questions - Public - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General):\n \n Can I give a firearm to my adult child? Can he/she give it back to me later? \n Yes, as long as the adult child receiving the firearm is not in a prohibited category [PDF 10 kb / 1 pg] and the firearm is a legal firearm to possess, the transfer of a firearm between a parent and child or a grandparent and grandchild is exempt from the dealer transfer requirement. However, if the firearm is a handgun, you must submit a Report of Operation of Law or Intra-Familial Handgun Transaction [PDF 481 kb / 2 pg] and $19 fee to the DOJ within 30 days. Assault weapons may not be transferred in this fashion. See Penal Code section 12285, subdivision (b). \n Can I give a firearm to my spouse or registered domestic partner? Can he/she give it back to me later? \n Yes, as long as the person receiving the firearm is not in a prohibited category [PDF 10 kb / 1 pg] and the firearm is not an assault weapon, the transfer of a firearm between a husband and wife or registered domestic partners is exempt from the requirement to use a licensed dealer to perform the transfer. However, if the firearm is a handgun, the recipient must submit an Report of Operation of Law or Intra-Familial Handgun Transaction [PDF 481 kb / 2 pg] and $19 fee to the DOJ within 30 days. \n \n Additionally, there are registration requirements for new residents who happen to own firearms (from Frequently Asked Questions - Public - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General):\n \n I am moving into California and I own several handguns. What are the new-resident registration requirements? \n You are considered to be a personal handgun importer as defined by California law. You may bring all of your otherwise California-legal firearms with you, but you must report all of your handguns to the DOJ within 60 days as required utilizing the New Resident Handgun Ownership Report. [PDF 518 kb / 2 pg] You are not required to report rifles or shotguns. You may not bring ammunition feeding devices with a capacity greater than ten rounds, machineguns, or assault weapons into California.\n How do I know if my firearms need to be registered? \n There is no firearm registration requirement in California except for assault weapon owners and personal handgun importers. However, you may submit a Firearm Ownership Record to the DOJ for any firearm you own. Having a Firearm Ownership Record on file with the DOJ may help in the return of your firearm if it is lost or stolen. With very few and specific exceptions, all firearm transactions must be conducted through a firearms dealer.\n \n California clearly believed the law requiring background checks for all secondary sales could not be enforced without mandatory firearms registration, for that is exactly what this DROS scheme creates. I can find no limitation on the database listed on the website, and it appears that these DROS submissions are forever maintained in a registration database (from Frequently Asked Questions - Public - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General):\n \n Can I get a list of the firearms for which I am listed as the purchaser, transferee, or owner? Yes. To obtain a list of firearms listed in your name, complete and submit an Automated Firearms System Records Request [PDF 21 kb / 1 pg] form to the Automated Firearms Unit, P.O. Box 820200, Sacramento, CA 94203-0200. The letter must be signed, notarized, and include a photocopy of your photo ID card (ie., driver's license or DMV ID).\n \n Indeed, without the ability to maintain and search this database of all lawful transfers it would be difficult if not impossible for a law enforcement officer to know whether someone he found with a gun had lawfully obtained the gun in the first place. It also appears that a DOJ official could search this database at any time by name, by firearm types and or/serial number to instantly learn who lawfully owns which firearms at that time (the only exception is non-assault rifle long guns so long as they remain within the family-although to get into the family they must be DROS registered; and non-assault rifle long guns brought into the state by new residents-until they are later transferred and captured in the database). I see no limitations on the use of this database listed on the AG's website. Does anyone know whether any limitations exist?\n \n Now as I have said, I do not think mandatory background checks for all secondary sales could be enforced without mandatory registration. As I have also said, I do not favor mandatory registration, but I do not believe mandatory registration to be unconstitutional. Feel free to agree or disagree....",

   "Yes. My reading of this indicates that DOJ keeps a registration database of all handguns, and the DROS submission gives it the ability to also keep a running total of how many long guns a person owns or should own (excepting the DROS exempt family transfers and long guns brought into the state and still held by new residents). Is there a limitation on the DOJ&#8217;s retention of the DROS sale records for long guns? I can&#8217;t find one.\n \n So back to the question of enforceability with California as an example. This DROS process seems inconsistent to me, and I just want to think out loud about it for a moment. Feel free to give me your opinion on this Sinjin&#8230;.\n \n California has made it mandatory (with limited exceptions) that all secondary market transfers happen by using FFL dealers as middlemen who shall conduct background checks. Now making it a crime to transfer a gun without using this process is one thing&#8212;enforcing that crime is another. If two people transfer a gun privately without using the DROS process then clearly no one will ever know until that contraband firearm is discovered by law enforcement months or years later. So assume for a moment that an officer encounters me with a gun I got on the secondary market which he wants to check. For enforcement purposes how will the officer know I went through the proper purchasing process to get that gun? Here is how I see it: \n \n For California handguns it is easy&#8212;he can check the serial number and the DOJ DROS/family transfer database will show whether or not I was the last authorized purchaser/receiver of the gun. But if it is a long gun all he can learn from that database is how many I am currently supposed to own&#8212;could be one, two or twenty, for example (assuming the DOJ can keep the DROS long gun transfer records). He would then have to follow up with every DROS submission ever made under my name for long guns, and then go to the gun store(s) to try and identify which one (if any) involved the gun he found in my possession. The DROS form the dealers maintain will not list my particular gun. However, the dealer should also have a federal form 4473 for the secondary transfer which will list the gun by make/model/serial number. This is, in effect, one step removed from mandatory registration&#8212;where the true &#8220;registration&#8221; information is dispersed, held only by the dealers, and is unknown to the government unless and until a legitimate need exists to check a particular firearm encountered on the street. \n \n Clearly California considers this scheme for long guns adequate to be able to enforce the mandatory dealer-involved background check law. \n \n Here are my questions: If this long gun process is believed to be adequate to enforce the background check law, then wouldn&#8217;t the same process be adequate for handguns as well? Why then require the full registration of handguns? Or, if the full registration of handguns is necessary to enforce the law, then why were long guns left out? Were handguns singled out in the law for full registration because they are the red headed stepchildren of the firearm world and disliked by those in power, or was the original law written to require full registration of all gun transfers but then scaled back to exempt long guns as a compromise to get the law passed? And if so then how long will it be before the next call comes to close the &#8220;long gun DROS registration loophole&#8221; and require the full registration of their secondary market transfers.\n \n Here is another thought: If compliance with the background checks is the goal, and the dealer is required to give the purchaser a copy of the DROS form, then why not just require each person to keep a copy of his DROS transaction form to show as proof of lawful purchase? Would there then be any need for a centralized database at all? Would this be a way to enforce the mandatory background check law without centralized government registration? \n \n Of course all this is just speculation because I don&#8217;t know how or why the law was passed. All I know is I live out on the right coast and I still don&#8217;t understand why this DROS system is needed. I also don&#8217;t know whether any study exists of how effective it has been. Has anyone attempted to measure the effectiveness of this scheme yet?",

Thanks again.\n\n \n I don&#8217;t know, and the AG&#8217;s website does not list whether or not the database only links the firearm serial number to DROS transaction number without registering names. However, looking again at the AG&#8217;s website I doubt the registration stops there. I believe it includes names and has them linked to firearms.\n \n The DROS form itself which is submitted by the dealer to the &#8220;Automated Firearms Unit&#8221; (AFU) lists the name, identifiers, and address of the purchaser in addition to either the exact number of long guns or the make/model/serial number of handguns. I can find no limitation on the AFU&#8217;s retention of the form or the information contained on it. IMO, without keeping the names associated with the transfer it would be impossible for law enforcement to know whether I had ever lawfully obtained a long gun outside of family transfers by going through the DROS process. So it only makes sense for the AFU to keep a registration database by name, which could be searched to know what guns I am supposed to have (exact total for long guns, and exact info for each handgun)\n \n Additionally, the law requires a person to send identical information (personal name, address, other identifiers and make/model/serial number) for two situations other than secondary market sales: 1. Family handgun transfers, and 2. New residents bringing handguns into the state. These situations are outside the DROS process, and can be searched, if at all, only by retaining names and linking them to firearms in the AFU database. See: http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/oplaw.pdf and http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/ab991frm.pdf for the forms the AFU requires in these two circumstances. \n \n Finally, it appears the AFU offers a service whereby a person can have the unit search the database by name to give that person an updated list of every firearm he/she is supposed to own as far as the government is concerned. Given the constraints of lack of specific registration of long guns such a search on behalf of a citizen request should provide a list giving the exact details for each handgun and a list of exactly how many long guns are supposed to be owned. This can only be searched in the database if it retains the names of those registered while linking them to which firearms are registered. Indeed, the form itself only requires a person to provide their name to have the search run, so the &#8220;AFU&#8221; search must be performed by typing in a name and having the database list every firearm lawfully associated in the database to that name. See: http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/AFSPrivateCitizen.pdf for the form used to request a list of firearms the state knows about. \n \n This, to me, is registration.\n \n But back to my comment earlier about not knowing how we could effectively have a mandatory background check for all secondary market transfers without registration. I&#8217;m rethinking that position around this question: Why does California need to have a registration database? If California required background checks with dealers as middlemen for secondary sales, then why not just require the dealer to provide a document (not unlike a Bill of Sale) to the purchaser listing the guns he bought along with the authentication that the background check was performed, and then require the purchaser to produce that document as proof of lawful ownership if he is ever questioned about the gun? A copy of the same document could be given to the person selling the gun so he could show, if questioned, exactly when and how he lawfully transferred the gun. Wouldn&#8217;t this system satisfy the background check without requiring state registration? Or, to put it another way: Does the California system serve a necessary law enforcement function, or is its primary usefulness limited to satisfying the curiosity of an idle (or in the worst case vindictive) state employee?\n \n I have not yet worked my way through the constitutionality thought process for my hypothetical scheme, but it seems on the surface less of an issue than California&#8217;s current system. For example, the new resident and family transfer requirements cannot be enforced against felons, because you cannot require them to pay $19 and incriminate themselves by confessing to the &#8220;AFU&#8221; they just took possession of a handgun and/or brought handguns into the state. And aren&#8217;t these persons the ones the registration process is supposed to deter? \n \n Oh, and I&#8217;m glad you liked the Pirate Coast. I thought you would like that one&#8230;.",

There is a word for these people, now what was that? Hummmm\n \n The eTrace Fraud Exposed\n \n \nAre you aware that the BATFE has for several years been aggressively offering eTrace to local law enforcement agencies? They have the agency sign a memorandum of agreement and then the agency can run traces on any firearm they wish. The catch is that the agency has to agree to run a trace on ALL CRIME GUNS. The MOU defines a CRIME GUN as:\n \n \"The parties agree that a 'crime gun' is defined as \"any firearm that is illegally possessed, used in a crime, taken into police custody, or suspected by law enforcement officials of having been used in a crime.\"\n \n The key word in this definition is \"taken into police custody.\" I have been a law enforcement officer for over thirty years and held positions up to the rank of Detective Commander. Only a very small portion of firearms that are taken into custody could possibly be considered a \"crime gun.\" TV and movies aside, we run into very few \"smoking gun\" cases where we have a firearm left at the scene a crime, and it is a rare instance that knowing who was the first lawful purchaser of a firearm would serve any investigatory purpose. We take hundreds of firearms into custody as found property, safe-keeping, recovered-stolen or in possession of individuals who have been arrested. In all those cases, including arrests, it is of very little consequence who bought the gun from Acme Sporting Goods ten years ago.\n \n If you expand the term \"taken into police custody\" to include any firearm that an LEO has temporary custody, such on a traffic stop of an otherwise lawful firearms owner, you could literally be running traces on hundreds of guns for no legitimate purpose. For larger department it could run into the thousands.\n \n I first heard of this program in a meeting with the local U.S. Attorney and BATFE. I asked them if we could have the software and only trace firearms when we needed to know their origin. I was told that they wanted a trace done on ALL firearms and that if we only wanted to do a few, we could do it the \"old\" way by making a request to the local field office. In other words, we want all the gun traced that we can. When I told them that was a waste of valuable police resources, they changed the subject.\n \n As far as I am concerned, eTrace is a fraud perpetrated by the BATFE to swindle Congress and the public out of funding for a program which serves very little legitimate purposes. (SNIP)  In all those cases, including arrests, it is of very little consequence who bought the gun from Acme Sporting Goods ten years ago.\n \n An \"unintended consequence\" of having law enforcement trace all the guns they come in contact with is that a good number of these firearms end up traced back to local FFLs. As you know, when an FFL has a certain number of \"CRIME GUNS\" traced back to them, they can be put on some sort of probation and are subject to increased record keeping and sharing requirements. This is grossly unfair to the dealers as the majority of firearms traced have been purchased legally and have not been used to commit a crime.\n Police Commander (Retired)\n \n Have officials 'willfully conspired' to cover up ATF record errors?\n \n \nWhat happens when Person A buys a machine gun from Person B, and 7 or 15 years later, Person A's wife goes blooey and burns the house down; or the house got hit by lightning and burned; or some other [U]event beyond Person A's control that results in his Form 4 being destroyed[/B]. Person A, who has always been law-abiding, no criminal record, and so forth, asks ATF for a duplicate Form 4, explaining the circumstances. ATF dutifully checks . . . and finds the machine gun is still registered to Person B, who is now deceased, and the heirs were never into guns, knew he sold some off, but have no specific recollection of the types of guns and/or to whom they were sold, after all it happened years ago.\n \n What happens? ATF doesn't need to prove the machine gun isn't registered to convict Person B of illegally possessing it, because Person B has no Form 4, [U]no affirmative defense[/U.\n \n Think about how this could happen with other NFA firearms. The above isn't the only scenario, but it is a realistic one that could and would have real consequences. Do you think ATF would take Person A's word for it that Person B lawfully transferred the machine gun to him? Maybe, if ATF Counsel would go along with it. What are the chances of that?\n \n Probably not good. As the Motion in Limine documents, ATF, the Treasury Department Inspector General, and the Department of Justice Inspector General have willfully conspired to cover up evidence that ATF has lost NFA paperwork. Who is going to take the blame for that? Not them, so far, as history has shown. As more documents from this latest FOIA are placed in the Public Domain, the hundreds of examples of ATF losing NFA paperwork will be impossible to overlook, particularly in the next major case involving the accuracy and completeness of the NFRTR.\n At the risk of being accused of understatement, that's a serious indictment. Individuals should be held accountable. Especially since it's not like we haven't seen ATF attempt to destroy a family business over unintentional paperwork violations--and destroy men's lives over \"undocumented transfers\". And it's not like we haven't seen employees from ATF itself come forward and plead for a house-cleaning.\n \n",

   "If the DROS system allows for instantaneous retrieval of a gun owner's personal information with a weapon's make, model and serial number then I am not in support of the system and think it should be challenged as unConstitutional.\n \n Clear enough?\n\n \n Takes awhile to wake up and face reality but proof is it can be done :)\n The basic tenants are that the gun must be connected to the crime, have mens rae, motive and other incriminating evidence to postitively tie him to the crime. In court, if the prosecutor can't 'get it into the 4 corners' he is ******* into the wind. Judges , good ones, straighten this prosecutor complex out with reference to \"you can't catch them all\". Also jurisdiction and title must be proven over the accused rights.\n \n You are learning that illegal infringements on any right has to meet a burden of proof which, in this case(s) is actually malicious prosecution at best. The message we are supposed to accept is \"guns are bad\" when a logical person following constitutional law will see the farce for what it is. State law is pre-emptive over local law. Federal law is pre-emptive over State law. Registration is constitutionally repugnant and in People v. Zirillo it was held that \"a right freely stated in the Constitution cannot be made subject to the will of the sheriff which is common place in kalifornia and a few other States.\n \n Registration, fees for license and stuff like that are clearly unconstitutional. We have covered this before; you cannot charge a fee or a license to exercise a right freely stated in the constitution. It is an individual right and not to be infringed nor broken into in any way. It is not like Sotomeyor's claim that she didn't know of any prior cases dealing with the individual right to keep and bear arms but the SCOTUS has ruled 14 times on the subject not counting Heller. Jurisprudence ignorance is an unforgivable mistake!\n \n I am pretty positive that the State can require an FFL to do paperwork for their records in State that are subject to FOI requests. The 4473 form also has a time limit on it before the process info has to be destroyed. Abuse of the system having to prove you have your paper or DROS which can be easily lost or misplaced is insane. The State paper work is surely no better than the feddies trying to maintain tax payer i.d. for compliance with the $200 tax certificate. Their confession is found in my earlier post. Gun registration is a bad idea whose time has come to the brink of being organized criminal activity in itself.",

   "FYI to all, I searched my federal case database for examples of how lower federal courts are interpreting Heller. I found a case applying Heller to the firearm prohibitions found in 18 U.S.C. 922 (which Sinjin has cited, and which everyone who has bought a gun from a FFL dealer is familiar from having to fill out the transaction forms answering &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; to the prohibition questions). First, here is what Heller said about the limited RKBA:\n \n Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. See, e.g., Sheldon, in 5 Blume 346; Rawle 123; Pomeroy 152-153; Abbott333. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. See, e.g., State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann., at 489-490; Nunn v. State, 1 Ga., at 251; see generally 2 Kent *340, n. 2; The American Students' Blackstone 84, n. 11 (G. Chase ed. 1884). Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of [Slip Op. 55] arms.26\n \n We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those &#8220;in common use at the time.&#8221; 307 U.S., at 179. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of &#8220;dangerous and unusual weapons.&#8221; See 4 Blackstone 148-149 (1769); 3 B. Wilson, Works of the Honourable James Wilson 79 (1804); J. Dunlap, The New-York Justice 8 (1815); C. Humphreys, A Compendium of the Common Law in Force in Kentucky 482 (1822); 1 W. Russell, A Treatise on Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 271-272 (1831); H. Stephen, Summary of the Criminal Law 48 (1840); E. Lewis, An Abridgment of the Criminal Law of the United States 64 (1847); F. Wharton, A Treatise on the Criminal Law of the United States 726 (1852). See also State v. Langford, 10 N. C. 381, 383-384 (1824); O'Neill v. State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849); English v. State, 35Tex. 473, 476 (1871); State v. Lanier, 71 N. C. 288, 289 (1874).\n District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 54-55 (2008)\n \n Here is the case I found at the district court level in the 4th. Circuit: United States v. Holbrook, 613 F. Supp. 2d 745, 776 (W.D. Va. 2009).\n \n Mrs. Holbrook was challenging her conviction for possessing a firearm after having been previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g). After Heller she filed a motion to vacate her conviction and sentence, and she made this claim:\n \n (claim 10--Bryan)Based on District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008), it is unconstitutional to prohibit Holbrook from possessing a firearm in her own home when she is neither a felon or deemed mentally ill.  Holbrook, 613 F. Supp. 2d at p. 760.\n \n The pertinent part of the judge&#8217;s ruling was:\n \n In June 2008, the Supreme Court struck down the District of Columbia's ban on certain handgun possession as violative of the Second Amendment. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008). The Court ruled that &#8220;the District's ban on handgun possession in the home . . . [and] its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense&#8221; impermissibly burdened the defendant's personal right under the Second Amendment to bear arms. Id. at 2821-22. The Court expressly noted that the right to bear arms is &#8220;not unlimited&#8221; and that nothing in [the Heller] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n \n Id. at 2816-17. These &#8220;presumptively lawful regulatory measures&#8221; were identified &#8220;only as examples,&#8221; not as an exhaustive list. Id. at 2817 n. 26.\n \n In reliance on Heller, Holbrook filed an addendum to her \u00a7 2255 motion on July 18, 2008, stating that it was &#8220;unconstitutional to prohibit [her] from possessing a firearm within her own home when she is neither a felon or deemed mentally ill.&#8221; (Claim 10). The claim is unsupported. The Court in Heller expressly stated, in overturning the D.C. firearms ban, that other prohibitions on firearm possession by certain persons or in certain places remain &#8220;presumptively lawful.&#8221; Id. at 2817 n. 26. Thus, the Heller opinion itself does not &#8220;cast doubt&#8221; on the limitation on firearm possession set forth in \u00a7 922(g)(9), and Holbrook makes no other argument that her convictions are violative of the Second Amendment. I will deny Claim 10 accordingly.\n Id. at 776. \n \n (My bold emphasis to highlight how this judge interprets Heller&#8217;s application to 18 U.S.C. 922)\n \n This is obviously just one district court judge&#8217;s opinion, and the interpretation of Heller will take years to flesh out. My database is limited only to all SCOTUS cases and all cases from the 4th. Circuit. I&#8217;d welcome any other case examples to consider if anyone can find one in another circuit&#8230;.",

   "Identify Prohibited Persons\n \n The Gun Control Act (GCA) makes it unlawful for certain categories of persons to ship, transport, receive, or possess firearms. 18 USC 922(g). Transfers of firearms to any such prohibited persons are also unlawful. 18 USC 922(d).\n \n These categories include any person:\n \n Under indictment or information in any court for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; \n \n convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; \n \n who is a fugitive from justice; \n \n who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance; \n \n who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution; \n \n who is an illegal alien; \n \n who has been discharged from the military under dishonorable conditions; \n \n who has renounced his or her United States citizenship; \n \n who is subject to a court order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of the intimate partner; or \n \n who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (enacted by the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208, effective September 30, 1996). 18 USC 922(g) and (n).\n\n \n \n If you are 50 as you once told Sarge, you would have been 8 years old when the '68 GCA was passed. I doubt you even have knowledge of the bill sponsor, history nor the SOURCE used to create the bill? \n \n \nFirst ruling you'd like to discuss?\n\n \n None of those are \"rulings\". You insist on pawing your way through in a muddle as usual? \n \n Here is the answer to one of your taunts in a previous post:\n Officer's Facebook post draws gun rights fire | Politics and Law - CNET News\n \n \nEven though police may not like it, openly carrying unloaded handguns is legal in California, with a few exceptions such as when the firearm is within 1,000 feet of a school or in a government building. Carrying a concealed weapon, however, does require a permit from the local sheriff, which is not always forthcoming; a federal lawsuit<link included at source< filed last year in Sacramento seeks to change that.\n\n \n Bryan, it is a shame the NRA retained the same lawyer responsible for inclusion or retention of the language in Heller. Now he gets 10 minutes of oral arguement time in McDonald. I may well consider what I will do with my lifetime membership...",

   "Officer's Facebook post draws gun rights fire | Politics and Law - CNET News\n \n \nRod Tuason has become the latest person to learn that it's not very wise to post threats, especially ones involving killing someone, on a Facebook page believed to be private.\n \n Tuason is an East Palo Alto police detective who allegedly posted a note on Facebook threatening to kill anyone he found openly carrying a handgun, even if that person was carrying it legally. The alleged note has led to an outcry from Second Amendment advocacy groups, the creation of an anti-Tuason Facebook group, and an internal police investigation.\n \n Under California law, it's generally legal for residents to carry handguns openly, as long as they're unloaded. But Tuason allegedly posted that if he had seen someone exercising their right to bear arms, he would have \"pulled the AR out and prone them all out! And if one of them made a furtive movement ... 2 weeks off!!!\"\n \n That appears to be a reference to two weeks of desk duty following an investigation of an officer for discharging a weapon. \n\n \n Rather frightening that a recognized and decorated police officer would, even jokingly, comment that he'd willingly carry out cold blooded murder against people doing something that's perfectly legal. It's reasons like this people are so unwilling to trust the police for anything.",
