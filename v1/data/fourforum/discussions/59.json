   ".22lr won't penetrate a Kevlar vest, but a .22mag will, as will the new .17hmr. They just have too much velocity compared to surface area and the Kevlar can't dissipate the energy and prevent it from exiting.\n \n Anyone have info on trauma plates and what they can withstand as far as calibers? I know mainly our Mil and SWAT teams use them due to movement restrictions.\n \n To me, armor piercing bullets would be classified as bullets meant specifically to penetrate steel/aluminum plating with tungsten or steel cores. Most legislation though is way too loose on their text specifications and would easily allow the banning of hunting firearms and cartridges. My personal opinion is they should be legal for citizens to own so long as they can own a firearm (not a felon, etc). The 2nd Amendment isn't there to protect hunting and target shooting.",
