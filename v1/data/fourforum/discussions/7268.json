Second, the overall incidence of abortion, according to contemporary observers, began to rise sharply in the 1840s and remained at high levels through the 1870s; abortion was no longer a marginal practice whose incidence probably approximated that of illegitimacy, but rather a widespread social phenomenon during the period.\n \n \n http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=104424487",
