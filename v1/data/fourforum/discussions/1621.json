You mean hiring cheap labor? Hiring people back at half their previous salary? Hiring of Green Card holders, perhaps? Hiring of offshore consulting firms? Or is it hiring in the Service Sector, so people won't have to wait too long for their next cup of coffee to stay awak? - treat2\n \n \n Unemployment is only 5.8%, not 7%. - Broker\n \n ****Oh. You mean about 6% instead of 7%. Yeah. that 1 percent makes a big difference. BTW. Don't suppose you know that the actual number of American Citizen's that are unemployed is higher than the Unemployment Figures account for, because: 1) unemployement bennys run out after a time,\n 2) lots of American's can't file for unemplyment because doing so requires that people work for a certain length of time during a calander year, for \n a company. I think it's safe to say we can put that 1 Percent back in there and call it a 7% to 10% Unemployment Rate. - treat2 \n \n Um... because Bush has been out of the country for a long time?

Not only doesn't anyone agree with you, but the economy has steadily deteriorated, even after the tax cuts..- treat2\n \n \n (****Treat2 wonders if Broker has thought about the number that is now exceeding 1/2 Trillion Dollar regarding the National Debt, that represents Bush's and the Republican's Spend and Spend handling \n of the Economy. - treat2 )\n \n \n Kennedy and Reagan pushed huge tax cuts and both times it resulted in massive econonomic growth. - Broker\n \n ****Surely, if Bush had another term, he could reach the 3 Trillion Dollar National Debt that Reagan and his Republicans put on us. That massive growth must have been one of those tumors up Reagan's as.shole, because\n no such thing happened under either of Reagan.'s Terms. In fact, Reagan's\n tax cuts did nothing but raise our taxes, or do you live on the street in a non-exestent State, instead of a home, and pay Local and State Taxes?- treat2\n \n \n The same thing is going to happen with Bush. Every economist I have heard speaking on this credits tax cuts. So... - Broker\n \n ****Treat2 can confirm that. The National Debt will rise, just as under Reagan, and for every Dollar that Bush gives back, we will pay 2 Dollars out\n for our Local and State Taxes, and be worse of than before, just as happened with Reagan. (But, then you would say that's not Reagan's fault, as you write your checks out to the State and the Local Governments.) \n \n \n 8.2% GDP growth. -Broker\n \n **** \"growth\" is supposed to mean growth, NOT cutting the staff down to a skeleton size, having workers work even more hours, hire cheap labor, and outsource work to foreign countries. In this case, it is not growth we are seeing, but an indecator that enough American's have been put out of work so that Company's can make a profilt. That is not the definition of growth, by and standard, nor a jobs that don't pay enough ofr people to live on, nor meet the Standard iof LIving requirements in the U.S. - treat2\n \n \n 350,000 jobs in the past few months. - Broker\n \n ****Jobs in the Service and Retail Sectors, which BTW are highly ciclical and \n certainly no longer exist, as the Unemployment Rate is rising, or had you forgotten about that? - treat2\n \n Home ownership at all time highs. - Broker\n \n ****Foreclosures are contining to increase, due to the number of people out of worrk, and the average debt that Americans are carrying on their credit cards, 2nd mortgages, and personal loans. - treat2.\n \n \n Housing starts the highest in 20 years. - Broker\n \n ****Which signifies nothing but the low interest rates that were required, due to the weak economy we are in, and that more immigrants are moving into the U.S and need a place to live. It's not a direct or meaningful measurement of anything, except that Developers are hedging their bets that \n they will be able to sell houses sometime in the future,.However, it is not an indicator of what is going on now. - treat2 \n \n (Treat2 wonders if Broker knows that houses have to be built because of the amount of immigration, but that houses are not being SOLD now, nor have they been for over FOUR Years, even with the low interest rates on 30 year Mortgages. Could that low interest rate on the 30 have anything to do with housing starts, rather than a booming economy with lots of houses being BOUGHT. A Real Estate Developer would have to be an idiot to wait for the future to start building houses. The housing start figure has not created jobs in the industries associated with housing in the Manufacturing Sector. In fact, the Manufacturing Sector is probably the weakest Sector in our entire Economy. - treat2)\n \n Worker productivity at the highest rate in 20 years. - Broker\n \n ****Treat2 realizes that Broker has either run out of things to say and is repeating himself for no reason, or that Broker is one of the average Americans that is having to work more hours during the last 20 years, than any Americans have had to work in the past. Broker needs some sleep and \n to stop watching the propoganda Channels that are filling people's ignorant brains with misleading ideas and conclusions.)\n \n \n 50% gains on the NASDAQ, 25% gains on the Dow. - Broker\n \n ****Having programmed written a Real-Time Front-End Trading computer system for Brokers, I will assume that my reply to the reasons for corporate profits, as well as, the explanation for GDP \"growth\", earlier in this post are imlicitly understood to be the reason for the figures \n shown here, as well. - treat2\n \n \n\n \n ALL comments are below each section in the editted reply above this sentence.",

   "He's right on that.\n\n \n Okay for you and EF this is just one of many links I could have posted.\n \n From the Christian Science Monitor, not exactly a Democratic publication.\n \n Behind the shift are several factors, notably the Republican Party's changing strategy and the lapsing of self-imposed fiscal restraints in Congress since Mr. Bush took office.\n \n \"The Republican party is simply not interested in small government now,\" says Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \"They're worse than the Democrats they replaced.\"\n \n http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1208/p01s02-uspo.html\n \n So if we want to look at specific numbers for some years we can do that.\n \n \nAnd when the Republicans took Congress they controlled Clinton, not the other way around. The budget was not balanced under the Democrats, the economy did not surge under the Democrats. If you look at a chart you will see the clear trend.\n\n \n We&#8217;ve had this debate before so I&#8217;ll just copy and past my previous reply which neither of you responded to. You just moved your comments to another thread as if no one had questioned any of your comments.\n \n The first two years of the Clinton administration not a single republican voted for the budget either year but all said we would be in a deep recession by the end of the year. That included Phil Graham who has a Ph.D. in economics. Do you need me to provide some quotes? Then when the Republicans got control of congress in 1996, on a platform of a balanced budget amendment I might add, they sent to Clinton a budget that had too much spending. He refused to sign it while Newt bragged that he&#8217;d like to see Clinton shut the government down, which he did and the American people blamed the congress. Of course then the congress gave in and sent Clinton what he wanted and the economy kept right on cruising. Next year same thing with the same results. After that the congress just kept their mouth shut and gave Clinton what he wanted because the economy and the deficit were doing great. If you need backup data for what I have stated, I&#8217;ll be glad to provide it.\n \n Since 1980 when Reagan took office, every year a Republican has been president, the deficits have went out of site. Every year a Democrat has been president, the deficits have gone down. And that has been whether there has been a Democratic congress or a Republican congress. In the final analysis, the president proposes a budget and then has the power to veto any budget congress sends that he doesn&#8217;t like. As long as excuses are made for those that are the real budget busters, it will just keep right on happening.\n \n \nAdd up the cost of all the amendments proposed and that were voted down for this year. They should all be on the Congressional web site.\n\n \n What you propose sure seems like a lot of work. I&#8217;m sure you got that number from somewhere. Could you just provide a link to where you got that trillion dollar figure? That&#8217;s half our current budget so it sure sounds like someone did some fudging with the numbers. Unless you are saying that for instance the Democrats proposed $400 billion for some function of government and the Republicans passed a $390 billion amount so you say they saved $400 billion. But surely you wouldn&#8217;t be deceitful like that.\n \n The bottom line is you have a Republican president and both houses of congress. The only thing that has changed over the past 10 years is that Bush became president. At that point, the spending started on a tear and the deficit went to pot.",

The bottom line is that the budget for the first two terms of Clinton&#8217;s administration was exactly what he wanted as no Republican voted for the budget. The next two years were mostly what Clinton wanted because he vetoed what the Republicans wanted until they agreed. After that the Republicans mostly didn&#8217;t fight him because the economy was doing so good and the deficits were disappearing which proved he was correct.

As an independent voter, all I want is a balanced budget, I don&#8217;t care who does it. You can blame Clinton for some things and I will agree with you. But the economy was almost all his doing. It is evidenced by the comments made by the Republican leaders saying the economy would be in ruins if they passed his budget during the first two years and even afterwards. And also as evidenced by the fact that the deficit started dropping the year after he passed tax increases with no votes from any Republican. The fact that spending rose less under the first two years when there was a Democratic President and congress can not be just explained away. And why would he have given in on the budget when the American public was blaming congress for the shut-down according to every poll taken by both sides? It is obvious that Clinton was running the show.\n \n The facts are that when Reagan cut taxes, revenues went down and stayed down until taxes were increased. And the deficit was large. Clinton raised taxes again to stop the bleeding with no help from the Republicans and the deficit dropped and the economy got better. When Republicans took control of congress, spending actually went up. And when Bush took over as president, revenues dropped because of the tax cut, the surplus went to a deficit, and spending went out of sight.

I was looking at 1999 as the last year of the Clinton administration and should have been looking at 2000. The four quarters of 2000 were 1.0, 6.4, -0.5, and 2.1.

Those quarters were spread out over their administrations and were larger than 0.5 by a considerable amount.\n \n But there is one huge difference between the Republican administrations and the Democratic administrations, especially this administration. The Republicans pumped in huge amounts of cash into the economy through huge tax cuts, which created huge deficits. The Clinton administration had better growth numbers and turned the deficits into surpluses while doing it. If you can&#8217;t get good growth numbers while borrowing money left and right, then you ought to be stung up by your toenails. The real accomplishment is to do it without deficits. It&#8217;s like making $50k a year, borrowing $20k that year, and then saying hey I had a $70k year which was great. But you really only had a $30k year because you&#8217;ve got to use $20k to pay back the debt. But Bush doesn&#8217;t have to worry about that.

   "The job numbers for last month came out yesterday--110,000 new jobs created, I think.\n \n Also, I heard some economists this morning saying that they expected the final growth report for last quarter to be adjusted upwhere at 4.5%-5%.\n\n \n So how many jobs did Bush PREDICT the tax cuts would create? \n \n \"The January 2004 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor reports 112,000 new jobs were created in January, bringing the number of jobs created since the tax cuts went into effect in June 2003 to 296,000 jobs. That's 1.846 million jobs shy of the total 2.142 million new jobs the administration projected the economy would generate by January 2004 if the tax cuts passed. The wage growth in January was minimal, continuing the trends of late 2003.\"\n \n \"Although the administration claims the tax cuts are working, the actual job growth we've seen is far less than was expected with no tax cuts,\" said EPI president Lawrence Mishel. \"Creating 112,000 jobs this month is not satisfactory performance, as we need at least 150,000 new jobs each month to absorb new workers.\"\n \n http://www.uswa.org/uswa/program/content/939.php\n \n \"Greatest sustained job loss since the Great Depression \n Since the recession began 34 months ago in March 2001, 2.4 million jobs have disappeared, a 1.8% contraction. The Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting monthly jobs data in 1939 (at the end of the Great Depression). In every previous episode of recession and job decline since 1939, the number of jobs had fully recovered to above the pre-recession peak within 31 months of the start of the recession. Today's labor market would have an additional 3.88 million jobs if jobs had grown by the 0.7% rate that occurred in the early 1990s recession and so-called \"jobless recovery,\" the worst record prior to this current period. The picture is bleaker for private-sector jobs, which have dropped by 2.9 million since March 2001, a 2.5% contraction.\"\n \n \"Since the official end of the recession in November 2001, total jobs have shrunk by 0.7 million (an 0.5% contraction) and private-sector jobs have dropped by 0.9 million (or 0.8%).\"\n \n http://www.jobwatch.org/",

Tax increases will only sink an economy that is just recovering. \n \n I would be perfectly satisfied as would the deficit if we would privatize social security and eliminate a large chunk of government. I believe I gave some rationale in the thread on social security. \n \n Big government is not the answer. Giving money to people (congress) who we know will not spend efficiently is not the answer. We must cut government down to size. I think another 4 years of Bush is the only reasonable answer. I will not trust kerry with such a task. He will increase my taxes, the taxes of the working man, and increase the size of government and then claim that we are better off under government control.\n \n Horse Hockey!",

   "I am not particularly interested in the number but in the need. The things you are talking about are necessary things.\n\n \n Those things are needed? So regardless of what it cost, you want to spend it and not worry about how it&#8217;s going to be paid for.\n \n \nTaxes do not actually increase revenue enough to account for the deficit.\n\n \n What?\n \n \nTax increases will only sink an economy that is just recovering. \n\n \n I believe you have repeated that several times. Yet you have never explained how tax increases during the Clinton administration created the best economy the US ever had. Would you explain that?\n \n \nI would be perfectly satisfied as would the deficit if we would privatize social security and eliminate a large chunk of government. I believe I gave some rationale in the thread on social security. \n\n \n Privatizing social security would make the deficit worse if you are talking about taking it out of the budget. It is a trust fund that is separate kept separate from the general fund on paper and the surplus makes the deficit look better than it really is. Are you proposing that the social security surplus be used to pay the debt for other programs?\n \n \nBig government is not the answer. Giving money to people (congress) who we know will not spend efficiently is not the answer. We must cut government down to size.\n\n \n Well you don&#8217;t seem to have any problem spending money on going to mars and give free drugs to senior citizens. How is that cutting the government down to size?\n \n I am not talking about giving money to congress, I talking about being responsible for our debt.\n \n \n I think another 4 years of Bush is the only reasonable answer.\n\n \n If he does the next 4 years what he has done the past almost 4 years, the deficit will be at least a trillion dollars. You would assume that he had some accountability to the public since he will be running for office again. What will he do as a lame duck president with no incentive to control anything? And you think that is the only reasonable answer? That&#8217;s mind-boggling.\n \n Not only that, but he is being dis-honest by not putting in the cost of the war in the budget.\n \n \nI will not trust kerry with such a task.\n\n \n You mean a democrat who has been the only responsible party on fiscal discipline for the past 25 years?\n \n \nHe will increase my taxes, the taxes of the working man, and increase the size of government and then claim that we are better off under government control.\n\n \n Increase the size of government? This from someone who thinks the person that has increased the size of government more than any other president in the past 50 years is the only reasonable answer?\n \n What tax cut are you talking about? A tax cut that causes a deficit is not a tax cut, it&#8217;s a tax that is passed on your children.",
