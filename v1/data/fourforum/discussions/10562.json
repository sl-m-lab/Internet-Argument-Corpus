   "I sang Karaoke in Nashville last night. A girl got up and sang Money Money Money by ABBA. I didn't think anything about it but responded with Dancing Queen. For her next turn, she did Fernando. I followed with Super Trouper. By then, we knew something was going on. She ran to the stage to finish Super Trouper with me. The rest of the night, we sang song after song by ABBA. It turned out, she is in an ABBA tribute band as the Frida girl. We had a blast!",

One guy in the audience was dressed up like Gene Simmonds (Halloween) and came up and sang with the band. The whole night was fun.",
