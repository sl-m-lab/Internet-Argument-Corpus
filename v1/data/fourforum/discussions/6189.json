   "One of the things I try to show people is that abortion and personhood has no one right answer. Religious groups find themselves in the debate almost everywhere and in many cases; it is religious groups that are major advocates or opponents for abortion. Looking around, I have seen that many religious arguments are diffused through different threads and that there is a lack of views from many groups. I think it might be beneficial to all if these arguments are together on one thread as a reference point. I hope persons of the different faiths of the world would post the viewpoint of their religious practice. I would post some views from the HINDU perspective. (Not all Hindus may have the views below and may even have more information to share.)\n \n Hinduism: \n \n Some may say that collectively, Hindus are divided on the abortion issue. Some aspects of scriptures are against abortion (based on personhood). Examples against abortion:\n 1) Bhagwat Purana : In this text, Sage Kapil relates to his mother the various stages of development. His description, especially what happens in the seventh month of pregnancy clearly shows an unborn child as a being.\n 2) In many Puranas, the tale of Prahalad is related and how as a child in his mother's womb, he can be considered to be a distinct being.\n 3) The basic principle of Ahimsa.\n \n But there are some arguments that may support abortion as well. I was told that there are quite a few but I know of only one at the moment:\n \n In many Puranas, the tale of Aditi who wanted a child to slay Indra, a presiding deity is related. While the child was still in the foetus state, Indra entered Aditi's womb and killed the unborn child.\n \n Looking forward to finding learning about the views of other religions.",

It is sad that many \"Christians\" treat the Bible like a buffet and pick and choose what to believe and practice.
