   "Rahm&#39;s top cop, Gerry McCarthy, under fire for racist rant in Chicago (VIDEO) | Washington Times Communities\n \n \nCHICAGO, June 27, 2011 - Are Sarah Palin, the NRA, and racism to blame for the spread of illegal guns and violent crime in Chicago? Gerry McCarthy, Chicago's new top cop, seems to thinks so.\n \n A just released video shows Rahm Emanuel's newly appointed police chief making inflammatory remarks earlier this month at controversial pastor Fr. Pfleger's St. Sabina Church, an African American parish on Chicago's beleaguered south side. The remarks are drawing fire:\n \n \"I'm going to take a risk here and I'm gonna give you something and this is definitely the right audience. Let's see if we can make a connection here. Slavery. Segregation. Black codes. Jim Crow. What, what did they all have in common? Government-sponsored racism.\"\n \n Government-sponsored racism? That's the root cause of the spread of illegal guns and violent crime?\n \n Chicago has had its fair share of race and racism ranters: Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Fr. Pfleger, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and former Black Panther Defense Minister-turned-Congressman Bobby Rush to name a few. However, a Chicago police chief using race-baiting tactics to garner support in the African American community? That has to be a first.\n \n However, it is not government-sponsored racism alone that is responsible for Chicago's rising death toll. According to McCarthy, the National Rifle Association is also to blame:\n \n \"The NRA does not like me and I'm OK with that. We've got to get the gun debate back to center with the recognition of who's paying the price for the gun manufacturers being rich and living in gated communities.\"\n \n Does McCarthy's argument hold water? The U.S. Supreme Court just struck down Chicago's 28 year-old hand gun ban as unconstitutional last year. If liberal gun control theory holds true, shouldn't there have been a dramatic decline in crime rates these past 28 years? No. Because criminals don't respect laws. They circumvent them.\n \n McCarthy had room for one more political potshot at St. Sabina parish: Gov. Sarah Palin. During his speech, he said he was returning from a shooting investigation one night and happened to catch an episode of \"Sarah Palin's Alaska.\"\n \n \"She (Sarah Palin) was caribou hunting, and talking about the right to bear arms,\" he said. \"Why wasn't she at the crime scene with me?\" joked McCarthy.\n \n That's quite a stretch even for Rahm Emanuel's police chief.\n \n McCarthy's reckless statements have ignited passions on both sides of the ideological aisle as well as among many in the African American community. \"The crime issue has nothing to do with racism,\" Shawn Gowder, Sergeant of Arms for the African American Police League. \"It has everything to do with our ability to protect ourselves.\n \n Gowder has it right.\n \n According to January - May 2011 Chicago Police Department crime statistics, 56.1% of Chicago murders were gang-related. In 29.6% of these murder cases, the offender was an acquaintance, intimate partner or relative of the victim, while in 38.6% the relationship was not established. In 81.8% of cases, the assailant had a prior CPD record. 65.9% of offenders were African American, 38.1% were Hispanic, and 2.3% were white. Finally, 75.5% of victims were African American, 19.4% were Hispanic, and 3.6% were white. The weapon of choice (82.9%) was a firearm.\n \n But what does all this really reveal about crime in Chicago? It reveals crime is most prevalent in communities torn apart by gang violence, broken families, and depressed economics. It also reveals the abject failure of the liberal approach to crime: Guns are not the root cause of crime; they are the symptom. Ultimately, crime is a failure of personal responsibility.\n \n McCarthy's sick liberal sensitivity training has taught him well, i.e., criminals are not responsible for their own actions. They are at the mercy of forces beyond their control. Poor economics. Racism. Guns. Sarah Palin. Various GOP office holders. Liberals always have some tired excuse for bad behavior.\n \n Everyone starts out in a different position in life: black, white, Hispanic, male, female, rich, poor, middle class, or working class, diseased or healthy. There are no guarantees of wealth or happiness. In the end, we are responsible for our own actions, or we should be.\n \n Instead of making more excuses, McCarthy should have spoken about the effect broken homes have on the African American community. He should have talked about gang violence, single moms, and deadbeat dads. He should have urged St. Sabina parish to stand up and take responsibility for its own community.\n \n So why didn't he? Because McCarthy was only at St. Sabina to tout the Democrat party line. A party line that uses class warfare and race-baiting code words like \"government-sponsored racism\" to engender political support.\n \n Chicago doesn't need its police chief flashing the race card. In any other town, McCarthy would have been placed on temporary unpaid leave, reprimanded, discharged or all of the above for his reckless remarks on race. But this is Chicago.\n \n Ultimately, for the Democrat machine and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, it's not really about helping crime-ridden communities. It's about controlling people and their votes; winning elections and amassing power. Economically-depressed people are easier to control. Desperate people are more willing to surrender their freedom.\n \n In Chicago, that's what government-sponsored racism really means. I wonder how St. Sabina's parishioners would have reacted to that.\n\n \n I wonder if Gerry McCarthy has any relation to Carolyn McCarthy.",

   "Top Chicago Cop Targets Palin - Investors.com\n \n \nChicago's new police superintendent blames Alaska's ex-governor for inner-city gun violence and crime, and says gun-rights advocates are racist. Disarming victims doesn't prevent crime, sir.\n \n Speaking to the choir, literally, about gun control, Garry McCarthy, former police chief of Newark, N.J., told an audience at St. Sabina Church in the Windy City about leaving a homicide scene in Newark, returning home and flipping on the TV to find an episode of \"Sarah Palin's Alaska.\"\n \n \"She was caribou hunting and talking about the right to bear arms,\" McCarthy said. \"Why wasn't she at the crime scene with me?\"\n \n We know. We don't see the connection between hunting and gang violence either, but gun-control advocates do.\n \n Sarah Palin was not at that crime scene because she had nothing to do with the crime. As a defender of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms, she is like the vast majority of law-abiding gun-owning Americans who never fire or even point their gun in anger, unless someone's trying to break into their house.\n \n McCarthy rambled on. He equated private gun ownership with what he called \"government-sponsored racism\" and the right to bear arms with slavery, segregation and Jim Crow laws. \"Federal laws that facilitate the flow of illegal firearms into our urban centers across the country, that are killing our black and brown children,\" he said.\n \n St. Sabina is the church of Father Michael Pfleger, known nationally for his mocking of Hillary Clinton's opposing Barack Obama in 2008 for the Democratic presidential nomination. That too, he hinted, had a tinge of racism. McCarthy was appointed by new Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, formerly President Obama's White House chief of staff.\n \n McCarthy is a student of neither history nor facts. It was laws that banned gun ownership in major urban centers such as Chicago and the District of Columbia that placed black, brown and, for that matter, white children in danger by forcibly disarming them in the face of an onslaught by thugs.\n \n That is, until Supreme Court decisions in Heller v. District of Columbia and McDonald v. City of Chicago.\n \n Otis McDonald, a 76-year-old African-American Army veteran who lives in a high-crime area of Chicago, thought the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution he fought to protect gives him the right to bear arms to protect himself and his wife as he once protected his country. Superintendent McCarthy doesn't.\n \n McDonald was a community activist who had been threatened for his efforts to rid his neighborhood of drug dealers and other criminals. \"This lawsuit, I hope, will allow me to bring my handgun into the city legally,\" he said. \"I only want a handgun in my house for my protection.\" The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with him and in both decisions said the right to keep and bear arms was an individual right that could not be infringed.\n \n In his separate concurring opinion in the case, Justice Clarence Thomas listed efforts before the Civil War to deny slaves and free blacks the right to bear arms. He made the point that an opponent of the 14th Amendment warned that to \"make a colored man a citizen of the United States\" would guarantee to him, inter alia, \"a defined status ... a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms.\"\n \n So, Mr. McCarthy, the real racists were those who feared black men with guns and therefore opposed the 14th Amendment, and not those, like Sarah Palin, who believe in Otis McDonald's constitutional right to self-defense for himself and his family.\n \n You should sit down and talk with Mr. McDonald, Superintendent McCarthy. And you can invite Gov. Palin to come with you.\n",
