If he has already been sentenced, that would seem to suggest that he wa tried by our puppet government.",

We are supposed to be the good guys, and here we are advocating the trial and imprisonment of people without the benifit of a constitutional government, and the American public is not throwing its hands up in outrage. Not surprising I suppose, givent he apathetic ignorance that Americans seem to prefer living under, but diheartening none the less,.",
