   "One example of culling that I agree with is when States have lotteries to allow a certain number of animals such as moose, elk and bears to be taken based on their respective populations. These lotteries prevent them from being over hunted and also allow annual adjustments to be made so over population doesn't put undue pressure on the local ecosystem. There's no worse feeling than to be out snowshoeing in the woods up North in the winter and coming across dead Deer that died of starvation.\n \n What I don't agree with is applying this practice to animals which aren't hunted for food such as elephants or other African or Australian Wildlife that is in many cases walking a fine line between extinction and over population based on the fickle practices of Man. The bottom line is, if we would stop encroaching on their habitats, and cutting down their forests, and allow Nature to take care of itself as it always has then this would be a non issue.",

   "Culling is understood by some to mean killing for the benefit of the survivors (within a species). In regard to game animals, I believe it has been proven by those interested enough to thoroughly study the species involved, that culling strengthens the remaining population most effectively when the weak or sickly animals are targeted for death. It makes no sense to kill the fittest buck.\n \n Culling by hunting can be adjusted by varying bag limits and lengths of seasons. Hubby hunts ducks quite a lot and I am a cold-hearted huntress on occasion. The freezer stock varies each year based on the limits set by the Game and Fish Department and the number of trips he makes to the killing fields within a season. Despite the millions of ducks killed each year, the populations of various species seem to be stabilized because the limits are both species and gender specific. A Black Duck hen is all you can take on a single trip, he says. In some years they have been taken off the list of legal game. Based on the success of the various game programs that have been administered by the Game and Fish people, I would definitely vote to continue culling of game animals.\n \n I've not heard of the term culling being applied to insect control, but it seems to offer a similar opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of culling gone wild. We have successfully eliminated the Boll Weevil from the Cotton Belt and brought much joy and profitability back to cotton farming. These pests had virtually destroyed the incentive to make it big as a planter when they were finally, but relatively recently obliterated. I don't know that the species has disappeared entirely (extinct) but it has been virtually eliminated in many states. Whether they had a natural predator other than birds I do not know, but even the birds were ineffective in keeping them down. I'm wondering if any whole species of birds has disappeared due to the demise of the weevils.\n \n Humans have made several mistakes in attempting to control pests. I believe there is an island where cats were introduced to devour the rodents. Now there are no rodents...and no birds. We used DDT to kill insects and almost killed off the eagles by contaminating the fish they ate, making their eggshells too thin to survive incubation.\n \n http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/17312/story.htm\n \n Overfishing is causing rapid proliferation of squid in Australia.

I was being a bit facetious.\n \n While the culling of humans may be recorded and may have helped the survivors improve their own chances of survival, I do not think that just any old argument related to the culling of game animals can be extended to justify the culling of humans. \n \n While it could be argued that the overall health of a group of slaves may be enhanced by culling the population...just as it would help to cull a population of white tailed deer...there is no cause to believe it proper to do so. Since slavery is created by the choice of man and the presense of deer for hunting was given as a part of nature, these are two entirely different matters. An argument in favor of culling deer ( for their own good ) cannot be extended to justify the culling of human slaves ( even if for their own good ).\n \n Even though the sanctity of human life is related to religion and the belief that we are higher than the animals, it does not take a religious person to realize that the killing of humans by other humans for purposes of population control is morally wrong. I would guess that the probability that someone would support culling of humans will vary directly with one's closeness to atheism. The less religious will accept culling of humans while the deeply religious will not.\n \n We humans can control enough things to keep starvation from happening (so why don't we do it?) while animals cannot. We could send enough food to Darfur to feed the starving masses (so why don't we?) but we do not. There is a great quantity of food thrown away daily. The trouble is that when we send aid to troubled countries, those in power take it all to feed their soldiers or to stuff their own pockets and they leave the starving to die, just as they would have done had we not sent the aid.",

I was asking about the concept of culling in general, hence the philisophy posting and general neutralness. \n \n \nWhile it could be argued that the overall health of a group of slaves may be enhanced by culling the population...just as it would help to cull a population of white tailed deer...there is no cause to believe it proper to do so. Since slavery is created by the choice of man and the presense of deer for hunting was given as a part of nature, these are two entirely different matters. An argument in favor of culling deer ( for their own good ) cannot be extended to justify the culling of human slaves ( even if for their own good ).\n\n However, culling of animals isn't necessisarily done for consumption but to prevent other effects. Consumption is merely a benefit and enticement to get people to join in.\n 'You mean I get's to eat em? Sure I'm in!'\n Similar enticements could be used to cull humans. \n 'You mean I get's to keep their stuffs? Sure I'm in!'\n \n The posting on alleged slave culling was on instance. I would attribute other instances of mass murder and ethnic cleansing to 'culling' concepts also.\n \n \nEven though the sanctity of human life is related to religion and the belief that we are higher than the animals, it does not take a religious person to realize that the killing of humans by other humans for purposes of population control is morally wrong. I would guess that the probability that someone would support culling of humans will vary directly with one's closeness to atheism. The less religious will accept culling of humans while the deeply religious will not.\n\n Morality is flexible though. It could be argued in some extreme settings that culling would be morally correct.\n The only thing I can think of is that our culture teaches empathy with other humans as a means to co-exist.\n \n \nWe humans can control enough things to keep starvation from happening (so why don't we do it?) while animals cannot. We could send enough food to Darfur to feed the starving masses (so why don't we?) but we do not. There is a great quantity of food thrown away daily. The trouble is that when we send aid to troubled countries, those in power take it all to feed their soldiers or to stuff their own pockets and they leave the starving to die, just as they would have done had we not sent the aid.\n\n \n I started an argument that I lost track of with Jyoshu in religion.\n The efforts to keep other humans alive in some areas is often a waste of limited and ever dwindling resources. It's a stop-gap effort at best and can create dependency and other undesirable situations.\n As oil to transport is said to get scarcer, as food prices get higher (Haiti is undergoing food riots as we speak) as ecological erosion of crop and grazing areas increases...will we continue with these notions?\n \n Will we continue sit back and lament the 'genocidal' wars in other regions because we have plenty now?\n What would happen if the situation were reversed.\n As scientist call for sea levels to rise in a century, possibly billions will be forced to migrate to other areas in search of resources and a place to live.\n What will be the response to that?\n As the desire to consume food as industrial fuel increases, will there be enough to really feed 'useless eaters' (as the Nazi's called them).\n Will the morality pendulum swing back towards wars of slaughter and casual indifference to the starving?\n \n If we do control enough things to keep people from starving (I don't believe we do) then by not doing so, we already show a casual indifference to our fellow man.\n This is supported as I stated by scientific research.\n It's also reflected in how upset we get when people closer to the 'Us' group are harmed but we are callous to the deaths of those people in the 'Them' groupings.\n \n From my experience (and others differ I'm sure) many people who jump on the 'stop genocide' bandwagons really don't have a grasp of the situation and what's going on. They see no underlying cause and effect to deal with...or, if they do, ignore it. I often wonder how many know how desolate the Darfur region is. And, no, you can't magically fix it with 'uber western know how and technology'. One recent report talked about additional drilling for water wells...that would also be fought over as they wouldn't be enough to meet the needs of the people there.\n \n It's much easier and more self-centered (an aspect of empathy, relating everything to oneself) to see the bodies, the suffering, the ill-understood casualties and think it's wrong. How can we see such as necessecary? Could I easily shrug off the deaths of my family they ask? Would any form of sacrifice be acceptable to continue the human race, or even seek to make it easier for all who survive.\n \n I'm almost reminded of the novel, Nature's End (by the alien guy...Strieber(?) IIRC).\n \n Of course, I'm also reminded of the movie Southland Tales (starring the Rock)...when at the end, one character is faced with wiping out existance unless he (they) did an action that resulted in their death...\n ~'it all came down to my friend and he was a pimp. And pimps don't kill themselves...'\n End existance, roll credits...\n \n \n In the end, I doubt it has nothing at all about religious concepts of sanctity of human life and whether atheists would be more inclined to commit such actions. Historically, religious people are pretty cutthroat as anyone else when it comes down to it. And like in the past, religions (including Christianity) will justify nearly anything...and have a handy religious passage to back it up.\n \"and the Lord said unto the Israelites when the came to the promised land...go slaughter everyone!\" (paraphrased but I can find the passages if needed for exact wordings).",

   "Just as I was reopening this thread to read your response, I was thinking I should have sprinked smilies in it. ;)\n\n \n Come. Let us forgive each other for being seemingly presumptuous.\n \n \n\n I never stated anything other than 'species' when opening the thread or posting. I was asking about the concept of culling in general, hence the philisophy posting and general neutralness. \nWhen describing the playing field, you said:\n \n The process of culling is often used in an effort to preserve a species from hardship or extinction in an area that can not support their numbers for any number of reasons\n \n I am curious as to who here supports this act and who opposes it.\n \n My personal opinion is that it is needed and if done properly, keeps the species in question healthy and strong and prevents 'spill over' problems that may occur when the species in question seeks resources outside of it's natural habitat to survive.\n \n Any other opinion pro or con?\n \n If the argument is to be made that culling being good for one species means culling would be good for all species, it's been perfectly set up. I personally would exclude humans from the list of species to consider for culling. I suppose that is based on my respect for fellow men that is related to religious training, not inherent compassion. Had I less religious training I would likely be more receptive to the idea that somewhere, some healthy group of humans should decide what unhealthy group of humans should die for the cause of improving the overall human existence. (Naturally, those healthy humans making the decisions would be on the dull side of the sword.)\n \n \n \n\n However, culling of animals isn't necessisarily done for consumption but to prevent other effects. Consumption is merely a benefit and enticement to get people to join in.\n 'You mean I get's to eat em? Sure I'm in!'\n Similar enticements could be used to cull humans. \n 'You mean I get's to keep their stuffs? Sure I'm in!'\nThose enticements already exist. The spoils of war have historically been dispersed to the victors. (We're just now retreiving some of the art that the Germans stole....there's no telling where all the gold teeth went.) However, I don't imagine that many wars of agression have been fought with the idea of benefitting a portion of the attacked population by killing off others.\n \n Besides, your idea of humans culling humans involves groups from within a single species. We're all the same species. Just different races.\n \n \n \n\n The posting on alleged slave culling was on instance. I would attribute other instances of mass murder and ethnic cleansing to 'culling' concepts also.\nThat it may have benefitted those in control of the culling does not justify it. It was murder. Selective breeding and slaughter of weaklings are practices to be used by animal breeders, not guardians of humans.\n \n \n\n Morality is flexible though. It could be argued in some extreme settings that culling would be morally correct.\nPlease feel free to present one possibility for discussion. We're speaking of humans here.\n \n \n\n The only thing I can think of is that our culture teaches empathy with other humans as a means to co-exist.\nI think empathy comes from being taught by those around you in your formative years. If they have none, neither will you. Grow up amongst wolves, you will act like one. The overall bias toward empathy likely comes from the religious side of life and is concurred with out of common sense by the non-religious.\n \n \n \n\n I started an argument that I lost track of with Jyoshu in religion.\n The efforts to keep other humans alive in some areas is often a waste of limited and ever dwindling resources. It's a stop-gap effort at best and can create dependency and other undesirable situations.\nThat's pretty much how I feel about all the welfare give-aways to people who are NOT starving.\n \n \n\n As oil to transport is said to get scarcer, as food prices get higher (Haiti is undergoing food riots as we speak) as ecological erosion of crop and grazing areas increases...will we continue with these notions?\n \n Will we continue sit back and lament the 'genocidal' wars in other regions because we have plenty now?\nThat is a complicated issue. Sovereignty of borders makes it difficult to respond instantly to stop violence. Enforcers are generally not invited in because the one doing the killing is the government of the country in which it's happening. It's not completely apathetic to leave China alone in her slaughter of her own citizens. As a matter of fact, there may very little apathy attached to a reluctance to intervene.\n \n \n\n What would happen if the situation were reversed.\n As scientist call for sea levels to rise in a century, possibly billions will be forced to migrate to other areas in search of resources and a place to live.\n What will be the response to that?\nThose people will be assimilated into societies all over the world.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n As the desire to consume food as industrial fuel increases, will there be enough to really feed 'useless eaters' (as the Nazi's called them).\n\n \n Not to say that there will ALWAYS be enough food...but, yes, there will be enough food to feed the worker bees. We could stop making plastic toys and save enough petroleum to allow biogas. That's not what we need though. Another topic altogether is the alternate energy problem that keeps us trying to drive down the price of gasoline by burning corn. I believe this nation alone could grow enough food to feed ourselves and many others without them having to grow or catch anything.\n \n \n\n Will the morality pendulum swing back towards wars of slaughter and casual indifference to the starving?\nNo. The churches will take over feeding the poor, using the contributions from all those who think the poor should be fed. The government will continue to grow and consume vast amounts of money so that the government employees can afford to buy food on the black market.\n \n \n \n\n If we do control enough things to keep people from starving (I don't believe we do) then by not doing so, we already show a casual indifference to our fellow man.\nReasons for not having done so are listed above. We are not free to jump into other country's businesses and feed people that their government wants to die. In governments that do accept food aid, be it money or actual food, somehow through the corrupt distribution process the actual victims of stavation receive a fraction of the intended help.\n \n \n\n This is supported as I stated by scientific research.\nWHAT is supported by scientific research?\n \n \n\n It's also reflected in how upset we get when people closer to the 'Us' group are harmed but we are callous to the deaths of those people in the 'Them' groupings.\n...and when it gets to be your immediate family...it's REALLY getting serious.\n \n \n \n\n From my experience (and others differ I'm sure) many people who jump on the 'stop genocide' bandwagons really don't have a grasp of the situation and what's going on.

There is little other action that many people can take.\n \n It is seemingly ridiculous to say that we cannot get them water to drink, food to eat or shelter from the elements. The long history of their plight and the to-be-expected mindsets of those who have not been rescued both contribute exponentially to the difficulty of the problem...but it can be done.\n \n Prerequisite to providing them with water, food and shelter comes stopping the violence being generated by those currently in control of water, food and shelter.\n \n \n \n\n It's much easier and more self-centered (an aspect of empathy, relating everything to oneself) to see the bodies, the suffering, the ill-understood casualties and think it's wrong. How can we see such as necessecary? Could I easily shrug off the deaths of my family they ask? Would any form of sacrifice be acceptable to continue the human race, or even seek to make it easier for all who survive.\nI disagree that empathy is driven by self-centeredness. It is driven by similarity of experience. \n \n My son has seen the skulls piled high in Cambodia...indisputable evidence of genocide. For the survivors in Cambodia, life goes on as it did before. I suspect the same is true in China where 30 million or so have been killed (culled, if you will).\n \n \n\n I'm almost reminded of the novel, Nature's End (by the alien guy...Strieber(?) IIRC).\n \n Of course, I'm also reminded of the movie Southland Tales (starring the Rock)...when at the end, one character is faced with wiping out existance unless he (they) did an action that resulted in their death...\n ~'it all came down to my friend and he was a pimp.

You've gone and opened another can of worms. Let's not get into scripture to support reasons to kill people. \n \n I believe there are several good reasons for killing other groups of people.

   "Come. Let us forgive each other for being seemingly presumptuous.\n\n ;)\n \n You make many good points and I hope to have enough time to address some, and hopefully enough later if I don't get to all of them.\n \n \n \nIf the argument is to be made that culling being good for one species means culling would be good for all species, it's been perfectly set up. I personally would exclude humans from the list of species to consider for culling. I suppose that is based on my respect for fellow men that is related to religious training, not inherent compassion. Had I less religious training I would likely be more receptive to the idea that somewhere, some healthy group of humans should decide what unhealthy group of humans should die for the cause of improving the overall human existence. (Naturally, those healthy humans making the decisions would be on the dull side of the sword.)\n\n True, if may not be good for all species. Thus, the expansion to see if there are opinions on it's use against humans.\n For my take, culling is not politically driven nor racially driven but with a take to reducing a species numbers down to levels that it's ecosystem can safely manage without forcing conflict over necessities of life.\n \n I look at this mostly from the POV of the doom-sayers who stress continued ecological imbalance where some areas of the earth will see more droughts, some more flooding and habitable areas decline.\n \n \nThose enticements already exist. The spoils of war have historically been dispersed to the victors. (We're just now retreiving some of the art that the Germans stole....there's no telling where all the gold teeth went.) However, I don't imagine that many wars of agression have been fought with the idea of benefitting a portion of the attacked population by killing off others.\n\n There are historic raider societies. The Vikings for example.\n And, historically, in war (until fairly recently) the loosers were simply put to the sword enmass. \n \n \nBesides, your idea of humans culling humans involves groups from within a single species. We're all the same species. Just different races.\n\n That is one of the unfortunate aspects of humans. Our divisions into Us vs Them groupings. Typically based on trivial aspects like coloring.\n However, for my over all discussion, this would hopefully be bypassed and we can look inside on a 'racial group' say caucasion vs caucasion culling.\n Although, I think human psychology will be unbending and we'd still seek distinctions there.\n \n \nThat it may have benefitted those in control of the culling does not justify it. It was murder. Selective breeding and slaughter of weaklings are practices to be used by animal breeders, not guardians of humans.\n\n Yes, a very Nazish attitude being discussed but, I'd ask why not?\n Why are they to be used by humans vs other species but not amongst our own? Simple philosophy debate. \n \n \nPlease feel free to present one possibility for discussion. We're speaking of humans here.\n\n Survival. On a microcosm, we could look at the fundamentals of how someone is selected to survive and others are selected to perish.\n The Law of the Sea has lots being drawn to see who is murdered to be consumed by the others to ensure survival.\n In other settings, groups would have to decide how dwindling resources are distributed. The Martin Sheen (or was it Charlie) movie, Life Boat from the 1970's dealt with who would be allowed to survive in a crowded life boat and who would be tossed overboard. \n When it comes to feeding these starving peoples of the world with our resources, how do we go about seeing who get's what resources or who'll be ignored?\n \n \nI think empathy comes from being taught by those around you in your formative years. If they have none, neither will you. Grow up amongst wolves, you will act like one. The overall bias toward empathy likely comes from the religious side of life and is concurred with out of common sense by the non-religious.\n\n Irreligious people have empathy too. I do believe the inate empathy is enhanced from teaching one 'how would you feel if this happened to you?' (the golden rule lesson) Thus, it's self centered as it requires you to consider everything as it relates to you. That's not wrong as humans are self centered people.\n As to religion, Christianity is a self centered religion and while one may focus on others, everything relates to you and how you feel, what you desire. \n \n \nThat's pretty much how I feel about all the welfare give-aways to people who are NOT starving.\n\n I would have to agree with you. I think that if someone can work, they should. I even expand this to starvation. If it's their own desire not to work or contribute something if they can, they should be allowed to starve themselves to death.\n \n \nThat is a complicated issue. Sovereignty of borders makes it difficult to respond instantly to stop violence. Enforcers are generally not invited in because the one doing the killing is the government of the country in which it's happening. It's not completely apathetic to leave China alone in her slaughter of her own citizens. As a matter of fact, there may very little apathy attached to a reluctance to intervene.\n\n So, we say they have the government they deserve? And let everyone in it suffer because of a few tyrant types control the power?\n Real-politics are more important than helping people?\n Seems to me that you're placing more concern with your own well being than in expending some power and removing a desructive force that's killing others.\n \n \nThose people will be assimilated into societies all over the world.\n\n I firmly believe the opposite simply because people are not assimilated in the numbers being described nor in the exasperated conditions described.\n Refugees are nearly always not assimilated and are looked on with some animosity.\n Have you seen what the globe would look like with a 3' rise in water levels? Paid attention to the predictions of what will happen with changes to the environment in regards to agriculture?\n Migrate several hundred million refugees from the affected areas to new lands that can't support their numbers.\n If the US has some complaining over ~12 million illegals, could we handle 5x the numbers? 10x?\n \n When an area can't support the numbers present, conflict breaks out along what ever Us vs Them lines that can be found. And when they aren't apparent, they're made up. \n \n \nNot to say that there will ALWAYS be enough food...but, yes, there will be enough food to feed the worker bees. We could stop making plastic toys and save enough petroleum to allow biogas. That's not what we need though. Another topic altogether is the alternate energy problem that keeps us trying to drive down the price of gasoline by burning corn. I believe this nation alone could grow enough food to feed ourselves and many others without them having to grow or catch anything.\n\n So, we stop making luxury items and resort to simple sustanance survival?\n I do think discussion on the energy issue would be interesting. \n I think, as it stands, the US could easily support itself. However, as numbers grow, housing is needed. That either builds ontop of each other, causing over crowded cities to develop or we sprawl out and end up living on farm lands with vast suburbs.\n In the future, if arable land sites decline, this notion of being a bread-basket may not exist.\n Look at the Ukraine. It used to be Europes bread-basket until the Soviets flumuxed it all up. IIRC, it's now starting to get back to the way it used to be.\n What would happen if another great depression era dust bowl were to happen? In the US? The world?\n \n \nNo. The churches will take over feeding the poor, using the contributions from all those who think the poor should be fed. The government will continue to grow and consume vast amounts of money so that the government employees can afford to buy food on the black market.\n\n I think it's wishful thinking that the churches will step in as they used to.\n Especially on the level being discussed.\n Hopefully I'm wrong.\n \n \nReasons for not having done so are listed above. We are not free to jump into other country's businesses and feed people that their government wants to die. In governments that do accept food aid, be it money or actual food, somehow through the corrupt distribution process the actual victims of stavation receive a fraction of the intended help.\n\n So, we allow others to cull themselves? Because of this sovereign nation thing.\n \n \nWHAT is supported by scientific research?\n\n Over population and voracious consumption of resources to the point that there's little left leads to 'barbarity.' Wars, petty conflict, abandonment of ones children. When times are hard. Most living things become hard. And the self is focused on more and more to the detriment of cooperation.\n This happens in animals and humans alike.\n \n \n...and when it gets to be your immediate family...it's REALLY getting serious.\n\n Exactly.\n And for this discussion, they're the last step before self.\n Who would you kill so your family survives?\n \n \nSometimes those who jump on the \"stop genocide\" bandwagon do so the only way they know how...to call for it to stop...to express condemnation...to plea with those doing the killing. There is little other action that many people can take.\n\n While that could be true, most I witness who jump on bandwagons are ignorant people who simply want to do what's pushed off as 'popular'. \n Telling people that killing is wrong is more appealing to others than saying; \"Look, all 100 of us will die if we share what''s left equally. 80 will barely live until next harvest and 50 will live easily. I think it's time to draw lots...all we need to do is form a system that is fair for all involved.\"\n And that's better than saying; \"Pssst, you look like a swell fellow to me, you love your family like I do. Those Jones's are ignorant shirkers and aren't pulling their own weight and thos Fergusons are fat consumers that eat too much, if we go on like this, we all die. I say wipe them out. Are you in it with me?\"\n \n \nIt is seemingly ridiculous to say that we cannot get them water to drink, food to eat or shelter from the elements. The long history of their plight and the to-be-expected mindsets of those who have not been rescued both contribute exponentially to the difficulty of the problem...but it can be done.\n\n NO, it can't be done. \n \n \nPrerequisite to providing them with water, food and shelter comes stopping the violence being generated by those currently in control of water, food and shelter.\n\n Also having such resources to give and the ability to transport them there is a major prerequisit.\n \n \n \nMy son has seen the skulls piled high in Cambodia...indisputable evidence of genocide. For the survivors in Cambodia, life goes on as it did before. I suspect the same is true in China where 30 million or so have been killed (culled, if you will).\n\n Was Cambodia genocide or simply mass murder on a truely grand scale? \n Russia and China both culled numbers of their populations to expand their world power and to industrialize. \n \n \nI've not read either of those.\n\n Nature's End: Indian Guru gains popularity in an over crowded and pollution ridden world with an idea of half the people committing suicide via a sort of lot system. Reporter finds the real motive. With 1/2 of the world's population dead, there will be a problem disposing of the bodies which will result in disease and mass burnings, the burnings will (somehow) be the straw that breaks the camels back and cause a total ecocaust resulting in everyone dying.\n \n [quoteAre you saying you would not fall on a grenade to save others in your platoon?[/quote]\n ####ING A.\n And I wouldn't do it in most circumstances to save my own families lives.\n Why?\n Because I know how grenades work.\n The odds of people being killed are slim in most circumstances and tossing yourself onto one increasing the odds to near 100% chance of you dying.\n It's an idiotic thing done by ignorant people.\n \n But, to get to the jist of your meaning, yes, I would like to think that I would sacrifice myself for family and in some circumstances maybe others. But desire and actually doing it is the fine line that's seldom crossed.\n You have to hype someone up a lot to get them to do something suicidal.\n \n \nNow you've done it. You've gone and opened another can of worms. Let's not get into scripture to support reasons to kill people. \n\n :p\n Didn't want to but it was done to refute your notions.\n Religions can often be bent to serve noble and sinister purposes and often, some that are an unfortunate blend of the two. \n \n \n \n Honestly, I think many would agree that the best course of action would to get people to stop breeding recklessly and to have children they can love and care for. And in the rare situations where some are born who don't have such, allow easy adoptions by those who are willing.\n Part of that 'caring for orphans and widows' idea most religions and welfare programs espouse.\n \n But, really, who'd follow that advice?\n \n \nI believe there are several good reasons for killing other groups of people. The fact that half of them are starving is not one of them.\n\n Would allowing them to starve be a better idea then?\n Let the chips fall where they may?",

   "The process of culling is often used in an effort to preserve a species from hardship or extinction in an area that can not support their numbers for any number of reasons\n \n I am curious as to who here supports this act and who opposes it.\n \n My personal opinion is that it is needed and if done properly, keeps the species in question healthy and strong and prevents 'spill over' problems that may occur when the species in question seeks resources outside of it's natural habitat to survive.\n \n Any other opinion pro or con?\n\n \n I support culling of organisms that produce largely detrimental effects such as mosquitoes which carry potentially fatal pathogens and these are often bombarded with poesticides with good reason. I also support the culling of some grazing animals because clearly if their natural predators (ie: bears, cougars) are eliminated by man then they may breed to the point where their population cannot be sustained. Obviously, this is a problem people caused in the first place.... By this same logic I've used I've seen people support the culling of humans. I'm not sure I agree, but I do understand the logic.",

   "\n Even though the sanctity of human life is related to religion and the belief that we are higher than the animals, it does not take a religious person to realize that the killing of humans by other humans for purposes of population control is morally wrong. I would guess that the probability that someone would support culling of humans will vary directly with one's closeness to atheism. The less religious will accept culling of humans while the deeply religious will not.\n\n I'm sorry, I didn't know that certain moral principles were absolute and objective. Apparently humans have an inherent right to life because you say so.\n \n\n We humans can control enough things to keep starvation from happening (so why don't we do it?) while animals cannot. We could send enough food to Darfur to feed the starving masses (so why don't we?) but we do not. There is a great quantity of food thrown away daily. The trouble is that when we send aid to troubled countries, those in power take it all to feed their soldiers or to stuff their own pockets and they leave the starving to die, just as they would have done had we not sent the aid.\n\n Some animals do have survival mechanisms to deal with very low food quanities. Many types of wild dogs will only feed their pups and let themselves starve so to give their offspring a chance. I see your point, though. It's hard to get people to have compassion about someone half way across the world...or even the bum downtown when they are locked away comfortably in their own homes. I may even fit that description unfortunately. My philosophy, I don't care how 'naive' is that every cent counts and you have to be think about what you buy. If you care enough you can join the Peace Corps. I am considering that option if I fail at college. If you really believe that humans have the inherent right to live which as my sarcasm stated, you have not explained a basis for believing that, then I think this is something up your alley.",

According to my dictionary, inherent is correct.\n \n inherent: adj: belonging by nature or settled habit. The very fact that you are alive gives you just as much right as anything else to remain so. You may not have the ability to remain alive in the face of an overpowering carnivore, but your right to live remains with you until you die. It is given you by nature and often denied by nature. Nature requires only that you die...someday.\n \n It being universal just implies that it is not limited to certain groups.",
