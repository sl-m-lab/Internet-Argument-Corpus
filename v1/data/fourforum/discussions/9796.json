I was thinking the same thing.:) Especially with this quote from the article: \"[We had] many sleepless nights in our house.\"  Don't know about you guys, but this gives me disturbing images.\n \n \n\n I love it though how the loser in the article somehow thinks that his offense gives him the right to dictate to other people what they can and cannot read.\n \n Useless tosser.\n\n \n Agreed. If he's that worried about it, maybe he sould be a better parent and pay attention to what his kids are getting from the library, etc.\n \n I also wonder what his reaction would be if an atheist family sued the city because the library contained copies of the Bible (or bible-related material), claiming that their kid read it and was \"greatly disturbed\" and there were \"many sleepless nights in the house\".",
