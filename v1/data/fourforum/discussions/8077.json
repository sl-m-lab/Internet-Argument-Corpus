   "Catechism may disclose the beliefs that one espouses within a certain religion but I think it is even more telling to know why these beliefs are held by examining the history of how these beliefs were codified, the number of people who were slaughtered in order to make sure that certain beliefs prevailed, that sort of thing. \n \n I think it is always essential to reflect upon the number of people who were murdered in order to bring about belief in such things as the Trinity, Salvation of Souls, Virgin Birth, Resurrection, all that stuff.",

   "I also think it is important to reflect on this. When we profess a religion, it is important to know that in the past there were people who also professed it but where incapable of following its commandments, and so in some cases caused severe and awful sufferings. However, the fact that there are many (including several ministers of the faith) that cannot live by the ideal doesn't mean that the ideal itself is wrong, it is in fact a reason for those of us who believe to try harder.\n \n This is why H.H. John Paul II apologised to the world for the crimes of the Church in the past.\n \n So, to say I believe in \"the Trinity, Salvation of Souls, Virgin Birth, Resurrection, all that stuff\" isn't hypocritical in itself, because the truths these ideas present have nothing to do with what any particular sinners did in the past. The ideas behind these dogmas are independent now from those who wrote them down. If someone said to you \"it's not okay to murder\", and then went off and slaughtered 10 people, would you stop believing the truth behind the statement because of the person who said it, or would it reaffirm your conviction it?\n \n What is hypocritical (and a show of ignorance) is to say that the leadership of the Church has never done bad things. But the IDEALS represented in the Church (not individual people, but the Church as a whole) are still worth fighting for.\n \n Don't you think this is reasonable?",

On the other hand, I felt terribly sorry that a severely fragile old man was obliged to get down on his knees so many times to beg for forgiveness and understanding.",

   "I also think it is very sad that such a grandiose man as was Pope JP had to kneel before the world adn beg. However, this is exacty what Christianity is about<b></b>: willingly bowing the head and humbling oneself in front of others, and attempt to serve them and do them good. Pope JP did what he did freely and willingly, he so graphically humbled himself in the name of al of those of us that make up this Church. So, I kneel with him, and I beg for forgiveness, for it is not only clergy that do bad things and give the Church such a bad name sometimes. What is important is that the ideal lives on, after 2000 years of history and sin.\n \n I commend Pope JP, and I pray that God has brought him to His side, for he was indeed one of the greatest figures of modern times, who showed the world how grand it can be for such a small man to bow before the world and then come out as the better person.
