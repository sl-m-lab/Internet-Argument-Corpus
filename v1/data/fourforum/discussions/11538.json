   "A Massachusetts pro-family advocate finds it \"very distressing\" that two pro-family groups in the state are choosing not to join in an effort to challenge the Legislature's repeal of a 1913 law that barred out-of-state homosexual couples from getting married in the Bay State.\n \n MassResistance is seeking to collect enough signatures for a referendum petition that would allow Massachusetts residents to vote on the Legislature's decision to repeal the \"1913 law.\" However, two conservative groups -- Massachusetts Family Institute (MFI) and Catholic Citizenship -- say they will not join in the referendum effort. MFI says it wants to focus instead on promoting \"positive pro-family legislation,\" and argues the \"repeal will have a greater impact outside the state than at home.\"\n \n MassResistance director Brian Camenker labels as \"horrible\" MFI's reasons for not taking part in the referendum effort. \"This is the sad, sorry state of conservative pro-family movement in America,\" he laments. \"There are too many groups that are afraid of having the liberal press call them names or afraid of being called 'extremist,' or afraid of taking on the homosexual movement. They want it easy -- and it's just not going to be easy unfortunately.\"http://onenewsnow.com/Politics/Default.aspx?id=227768\n \n 1) It looks like at least SOME \"family\" groups are starting to see the light. Or maybe that's wishful thinking...\n \n 2) I'm amused at how the \"MassResistance\" essentially turns on its own, and blames the gays all in one breath.\n Essentially accusing the other family groups of cowardice. Being afraid of \"name-calling\", when I would hope the truth would be more along the lines of realizing that there are OTHER REAL FAMILY endeavors they can work on.",

'nuff said.\n \n Incidentally, MassResistance is categorized as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.",
