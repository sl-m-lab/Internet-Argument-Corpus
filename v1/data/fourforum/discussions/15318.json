   "Fascinating topic but I doubt you're going to find too many pride'rs that are going to want to talk about this.\n\n I've noticed. To be honest I haven't seen such a mum about any other so called controversial subject in the full range of issues I consider. It's analogous to what it would be like if taxes were an issue but as soon as anyone mentioned something related.. like tariffs everyone shuts up :p\n \n \nOne thing I find interesting is that the only group that says consent is the only standard are those about gay marriage. So that simplification of standards is indicative of political/ideological thinking. Your post helps demonstrate the problem with making consent the sole standard.\n\n ..... (hehe) Well they aren't the only group. Objectivist (like me) also hold individual volition as the only objective standard of social morality. (social morality being your rights and what laws should be based on as opposed to personal virtue etc.)\n \n I haven't heard of too many objectivist besides myself applying the standard to sexual deviants but in a very real way objectivist are the owners of that standard as we are the ones with a fully vetted philosophical basis for the idea as well as in theory applying it to everything.\n \n I don't want to offend any homosexual movement people here but it seems like they extracted a small chunk of core enlightenment age philosophy and decided to apply it towards the sole and singular goal of refuting naturalistic or theological standards on the particular type of behavior they were interested in.\n \n I am pretty much sure however that the consent standard if accepted does apply to these other deviations (namely bestiality and incest) just as surely as it is claimed to for homosexuality.\n \n However, in case it isn't clear already; I don't think I have demonstrated or could if asked demonstrate a problem with the consent standard even in sexual deviation. I started this thread in hopes of tasking some more minds on exploring the subject. I im in a discussion with papillon about this in another thread but it is kind of off topic there.\n \n Just to get the party started, I support the idea that these deviations are unnatural in that they do not fulfill the biological function of sex per se. However as anyone even heterosexuals might tell you, sex occurs for far more than making kids. A biologist might tell you social sex is more prominent in intelligent mammals than any other group, and among the intelligent mammals again apes seem to be leaders.\n \n \nNot so far off the ' sexual deviant scale' that Xcaliber and Pappillion seemed to be offended by.\n\n Not familiar with it.\n \n \nThe fact is that sexual morality is whatever you want it to be .\n\n Then, as with all subjective matters; there doesn't seem to be much point arguing over it does there?\n \n \nAs long as it is ' consensual' there is an argument to make it legal and when it becomes legal there is an argument that any criticism of it becomes 'discrimination'.\n\n One thing at a time eh?\n \n \nNot only that but the issue of 'consent' is not universally agreed .\n One persons view of an appropriate age of consent is another persons pedophilia,for example.\n\n I get that, however since the law as already kind of defined the age of legal liability for us that might be a different discussion.\n \n Pappalion in the other thread was making a case against incest, it was almost entirely based on pedophilia. Many of the articles we investigated made special note of the trauma that can be incurred by forced sexual harassment (no surprise there), but specifically that if people are the same age, even if young it seems to downplay the danger of 'forced' extremely.\n \n I would make an argument that before sexual maturity you can pretty much condemn all sexual behavior because you know for certain that the person can't possibly be getting anything out of it and it might be painful. i.e. they wouldn't do it without physical or social pressure.\n \n Of course we know that the age of 18 is actually arbitrary and not set in stone. People losing their virginity close to then is not frowned about very badly it seems. (like 17) given that it was with someone about their age.",

   "As for underage children having sex with other young children the same age being preferable to having sex with adults..why?\n\n The literature I have read simply seems to indicate that statistically little to no psychological harm comes from equal relationships even for very young ages. Given the 'power' difference that can exist between children of different age that is a completely different nature than the difference in experience you see in age differences in adults it seems big age differences are at much greater risk to cause trauma.\n \n \nRegarding bestiality.\n I am not sure how an animal could consent to sex so surely consent cannot be an issue.\n\n Well I'm afraid you would have to get into the gritty little details. I think that animals can certainly give consent as far as consent has meaning for whatever level of consciousness they possess. It is a double standard to constant tout the intelligence and 'person-hood' of animals proudly noting how well they understand us sometimes and how loyal they can be; and then turn around and say they are incapable of understanding and accepting sex. Sex is something all higher animals utilize to manage genes effectively, and many animals besides us attach social significance to the act. I would go so far as to say that any animal which can be tamed (or is naturally tame like domesticated animals) have already demonstrated the necessary social initiative to give consent.\n \n All that being said, they are animals and I don't really think their consent matters. Now apparently their consent does matter to bestiality people who (no surprise) are most extreme in their projection of human qualities onto animals. As you note below we kill them at will. Although some bestiality people would get very mad at me saying so they are closer to living sex toys than the kind of relationship that can exist between humans. That is why I categorized it with masturbation, I am not considering the consent of the animal. Yet again I insist they can give it.\n \n \nA more valid arguement in my opinion would be to balance the welfare of the animal with what gained by the person.ie a lady having sex with a donkey would not be as harmful to the creature as a man having sex with a chicken...and disregarding the yuk factor, how is sex with an animal more cruel that some farming methods?\n\n According to bestials it is the opposite of cruel. They have their own camps and consider someone who rapes or kills animals as just as bad as people who rape humans. I don't, you raise a creature to steal it's eggs and kill it, why pretend you think it has any rights?\n \n The offensive part of animal cruelty can only be the supposed facts it reveals about the abuser.\n \n \nRegarding incest.\n The easy breakup of marriage and the amount of single mothers ( in the UK anyway) leads to far more half brothers and sisters in the same locality.\n This would be a more fertile ground for 'acceptable' incest and not fathers( or mothers) coercing minors into sexual acts..\n\n Perhaps, but as I keep reminding pappalion you can't make public policy based on what you think the ratios of good to bad will be. You condemn the bad and accept the good, you don't confuse the two.\n \n \nTo the extent that 'enlightenment' thinking could be used to justify pretty much anything, yes. That's the problem with depending solely on consent as a standard. Consent can be coerced, or it can come about our of ignorance. \n \n Then there is the problem of age-of-consent. The issue there is that it's very subjective: there are plenty of 17 year olds more emotionally mature than 18 year olds, yet the 18 year old gets to qualify for age-of-consent.

Note I said \"other\" and not just gay hook-ups. If people want to deny gays or any other group equal treatment, the onus is on them to demonstrate why the constitution doesn't apply. Constitutionally, I myself am libertarian in this way.\n\n Coerced consent is a contradiction in terms, there can be consent that is unhealthy and self-destructive or there can be the false claim of consent due to coercion.\n \n I for one wouldn't give a dime to anyone just because they found a wife or husband or what not.\n \n \nAn animal can't give consent.\n\n What in the world makes you think that?\n \n Can they exist as equals with a human being? No of course not, that doesn't mean interaction and communication can't take place; or that animals are too stupid to understand the concept of a relationship sexual or otherwise. The very fact that we have domesticated animals proves that their social framework is not incompatible with ours.\n \n You may as well be claiming a dog can't give consent to fetch a bone because a human threw it.\n \n \nIncest is looked down upon because of the problems to the offspring. That said, in many states it isn't illegal. \n\n Problems that can be predicted and children that can be kept from existing.\n \n \nI don't find polygamy immoral in the least if it is between consenting adults. \n\n Double thumbs up, but why?

   "Yet if you torture an animal, you're breaking the law\n\n I will respond to the torture phrase below, but as for breaking the law; since bestiality is already illegal pretty much everywhere (I know there are a few exceptions) that would kind of make the subject moot if we accepted as a premise that the law is absolutely right about sex all the time.\n \n \nand I think most would consider bestiality to be a form of torture to an animal. \n\n Why?\n \n \nBy the way, I'm talking about humans putting things into animals, not the other way around.\n\n Stonewall, the other way around is bestiality too. It's just more clear that the animal has given consent.\n \n \nAnimal research is a different subject... greater good, blah blah, and all that.\n\n Oh boy, I really do hate that term. Greater good that is. Regardless of the fact that very little animal research is so noble as this why is it evil if you're after pleasure but not evil if you are after a cure to cancer?\n \n \nHow is a sheep going to say 'no'? How is it going to report the rape? \n\n For most four legged animals females 'say no' by walking away. It would of course not report the rape. It however (as I said before) is not human and probably can't work up the mental power to imagine rape. As a domesticated animal it's used to humans and vets doing all sorts of things to it. If it isn't going to run away when somebody grabs it and shaves off all it's hair why would it do so for something significantly more pleasurable if not less violent.\n \n \nIf you can get the animal to \"fetch your bone,\" then by all means go ahead.\n\n Meaning if you can get the animal to agree go ahead.\n \n \nI don't think that is the case very often, though.\n\n I of course can't give you the exact numbers, but if you would do some research (I mean deeper than just reading the wiki article) I think you would find it's a lot easier to get an animal to agree than a human (well a woman anyway :p).\n \n I think the vast majority of sex with animals is if not fully consensual, consensual for the human and indifferent for the animal.\n \n \nAnd again, I'm talking humans 'doing' the animals, and I'm talking about actual penetration, not getting a dog to lick some peanut butter. \n\n Ok, I still don't see what makes you think it's at all unlikely. The only difference between a dog 'doing' a woman and a man 'doing' a dog is that in almost all animals(humans included) the male 'equipment' makes it the males role to be the initiator.\n \n That means in humans you see rape committed almost entirely by men. That doesn't mean however that every sexual encounter started by males (almost all of them) are rape.\n \n I totally agree it's easier to tell that the animal is consenting when it's a male and obviously taking the... required steps under it's own power. A female animal in one of these cases may seem much more like the passive bystander than a male would but that in no way indicates rape. As I said females have muscles and whatever brains the species possess too. What exactly do you think compels a female animal to stay there and take it? I would apply the same standard of rape that exists between humans between animals, i.e. it's not rape unless someone is physically forcing the encounter. i.e. the reason the animal is not leaving is it's being held there.\n \n All that being said (as if you could really doubt it) you will find testimony that sometimes female animals do initiate sexual encounters once they learn it can happen.\n \n \n(And I don't really know much about it, but I'm sure bestiality can probably lead to some nasty diseases).\n\n Not really, but that may be because it happens so rarely. In fact differences in immune system make diseases that effect two different species much more rare than a disease that effects one species. You are of course correct that diseases can be transferred though. I haven't heard of anything like the danger of HIV though, so at least for now it's probably safer to be promiscuous with animals than people.\n \n That's hardly a moral angle on it though.\n \n \nAnd I'm not sure if it was what you were implying, but abortion should be a last option kinda thing, and shouldn't make incest justifiable.\n\n I was talking about contraception and biomedical prediction about recessive traits. I agree that reducing the risk of genetically damaged offspring does not justify incest because the risk never made it unjustifiable.\n \n The risk exists in more than just incest, unless you want to start applying eugenic principles to the general populous there is no precedent for denying sex because your kids won't be wonderful.\n \n \nI'm dealing with them one at a time because they are completely different issues.\n\n In other words you don't have a moral standard for sexual behavior.\n \n \nAlso, note that having multiple sexual partners is not generally looked at with disgust (especially for guys who have sex with multiple women). \n\n lol, I know. Again I am including all deviations not just those that are looked on with disgust by most. The basis and the only behavior I am not calling a deviation is monogamous heterosexual sex. The reason that is not a deviation is because it is the only thing that has been consistently accepted in all human societies and even encouraged.\n \n Enough people find polygamy 'bad' that I might get someone to attack it. Remember just like all the other sexual behavior polygamy has extremes.\n \n It's technically polygamy to cheat on your spouse, that's considered bad but for another reason.\n \n Then there is the pseudo polygamy of changing sex partners very often, or technically having many but only being with one at a time.\n \n Then there is true polygamy where you are having sex with more than one person at the same time. At the extreme end of it are a group of people who seek this out as an ideal and make no secret of the fact.\n \n \nIt is the marriage aspect that is the problem, probably for legal reasons. I believe that the government should get out of the marriage business completely, and this wouldn't be a problem.\n\n You got my whole hearted agreement there. The gay marriage issue is only an issue because the government is recognizing heterosexual relationships in a special unjustified way.\n \n \nHomosexuality is completely different from these other issues. There is no chance of having children.\n\n There is no chance of having children in bestiality. I don't think it is a completly different issue because I have said I am comparing the span of the entire category 'sexual behavior' and any moral standards or other interesting distinctions between elements.\n \n \nThere is no dispute of consent when you are talking about two adults\n\n Two adult humans you mean. I will agree it's easier to tell because people can speak :p, that doesn't mean you can't tell otherwise.\n \n \n(and I am against gay pedophilia just as I am straight pedophilia). There also aren't the legal issues that come with multiple marriages (polygamy).\n\n So homosexuality is not like incest because there can be no kids (+)\n Homosexuality is not like bestiality because you can be certain of consent (+)\n Homosexuality is not like polygamy because there are no legal issues (?)\n \n I am not sure on that last one, gay marriage is a legal issue whether it should be or not.\n \n I agree on the two points before, but they are not absolute and homosexuality and heterosexuality share more things with other deviations than they differ from them. In my OP I tried to group things with similarities and differences in mind.\n \n \nThen you must agree with women having sex with animals then.Fair enough.\n\n It seems he has, but then I am a little confused at the principle behind any condemnation then.\n \n By the position you mentioned he has to agree animals can give consent, he also has to agree that bestiality is not necessarily torture. Which means unless he is talking about possible problems and not a concrete absolute problem he needs to somehow prove that male animals have mental powers to give consent and not be tortured that females don't.\n \n \nA man having sex with a horse would not hurt the horse a bit \n\n Or consider this, a horse having true sex with a woman could kill her. So the situation of male animal on woman isn't always safe either.\n \n \nhow would that be torture..would the horse feel used, would it suffer mental trauma?\n\n I think it is absurd to think so. You've first got to assume these animals have the mental faculty to think so deeply.\n \n I think animals can feel hate and resentment towards specific humans, but I think you actually need to hurt them for their simple minds to register an insult. Deep metaphysical contemplation about the unnatural nature of something or social condemnation.. or about all of the things that typically cause sexual based trauma in people I think are off the radar even for the most crazy animal intelligence advocates.\n \n By the time you make them capable of this they are basically mental equals with the person. So here is an interesting question, legend myth and fiction are full of cases where a human somehow ends of with the body of an animal. Would sex between this human with animal body and a human with human body be wrong? I know it's pure hypothetical but an interesting hypothetical in my opinion.\n \n \nDamaging or hurting an animal for pleasure would always be wrong but I am not condoning this.\n\n I disagree. Steak is very delicious. I could be a vegetarian but for the pleasure and nutrition... but mostly pleasure, I eat meat.\n \n I always find it a bit silly when people try to excuse carnivores in general with 'they only kill what they have to'.\n \n \nAnimal research is not a different subject, it is humans using animals for their own gain and pleasure even if it is indirect ie research for cosmetics.\n Maybe a better comparison would be animals used for entertainment..circuses etc\n\n It is a better comparison than you think because if you when to a zoo or a circus I bet you the animal handlers would insist that the animals like it there. A bestial who has sex with their pet without some contraption or their own muscles to force them to has a better argument that the animal wants to be there than zoos or circuses who need cages and chains to keep their animals there.\n \n \nYou may find bestiality distasteful as do most people but for the purpose of this debate it need not be ' torture'.\n\n That torture was mentioned reminds me of the extreme anti-homosexuals I have occasionally encountered who somehow manage to inject the rape of little boys into every discussion on homosexuality. As if the evil of one type of act translates to everything in the deviation. It's like arguing against heterosexuality because there sex slaves.",

   "I will respond to the torture phrase below, but as for breaking the law; since bestiality is already illegal pretty much everywhere (I know there are a few exceptions) that would kind of make the subject moot if we accepted as a premise that the law is absolutely right about sex all the time.\n \n \n Why?\n \n \n Stonewall, the other way around is bestiality too. It's just more clear that the animal has given consent.\n \n \n Oh boy, I really do hate that term. Greater good that is. Regardless of the fact that very little animal research is so noble as this why is it evil if you're after pleasure but not evil if you are after a cure to cancer?\n \n \n For most four legged animals females 'say no' by walking away. It would of course not report the rape. It however (as I said before) is not human and probably can't work up the mental power to imagine rape. As a domesticated animal it's used to humans and vets doing all sorts of things to it. If it isn't going to run away when somebody grabs it and shaves off all it's hair why would it do so for something significantly more pleasurable if not less violent.\n \n \n Meaning if you can get the animal to agree go ahead.\n \n \n I of course can't give you the exact numbers, but if you would do some research (I mean deeper than just reading the wiki article) I think you would find it's a lot easier to get an animal to agree than a human (well a woman anyway :p).\n \n I think the vast majority of sex with animals is if not fully consensual, consensual for the human and indifferent for the animal.\n \n \n Ok, I still don't see what makes you think it's at all unlikely. The only difference between a dog 'doing' a woman and a man 'doing' a dog is that in almost all animals(humans included) the male 'equipment' makes it the males role to be the initiator.\n \n That means in humans you see rape committed almost entirely by men. That doesn't mean however that every sexual encounter started by males (almost all of them) are rape.\n \n I totally agree it's easier to tell that the animal is consenting when it's a male and obviously taking the... required steps under it's own power. A female animal in one of these cases may seem much more like the passive bystander than a male would but that in no way indicates rape. As I said females have muscles and whatever brains the species possess too. What exactly do you think compels a female animal to stay there and take it?

   "I'm not going to go piece by piece here, so I'll just hit the few points I think I should make. \n \n If a person is severely mentally handicapped, should it be legal to just have your way with them if you are careful? (Since they would be indifferent to the act, it wouldn't hurt them, and they don't have the capacity to feel mental trauma?) Would it be moral to sexually assault a person if they are asleep or under the influence of some drug if they won't remember it and it won't hurt them? I think the obvious answer in these situations is 'no', and I think that taking advantage of a person or animal sexually is wrong.\n \n The idea that an animal can give consent, while at the same time saying they aren't mentally capable of understanding what is going on (they are indifferent, won't suffer trauma, etc) is inconsistent. An animal (especially a smaller animal) can not give consent, can't say no, can't no what is about to happen, can't report abuse, etc. Plus, we don't know if they feel trauma from the events or not. \n \n I don't think animal research in the form of cosmetics or other non medical/scientific things is justified.

If animals can help save/extend human lives (by way of food, medical research, etc.) then I think it is justified.

An exception to the 'animal putting things' in rulish thing stonewall came up with.\n \n Bestial people certainly do... other things with horses that tend to be safer.\n \n \n..I meant to write 'damaging or hurting an animal for sexual pleasure would always be wrong but I am not condoning this' but utterly failed! My apologies..\n\n Even in that case I would say that it would be worrisome to think that the human was doing it as an outlet for his association of pain and damage with sex. For example if he killed the chicken first then 'did' it, that would be causing no extraneous pain to the chicken but it seems a little absurd to consider that better than sex first. \n \n \nI think people have a ( arguably) natural disgust to bestiality and so associate it with torture or rape, just as those extreme anti gay people that you mention.\n\n Exactly, it's the 'nasty' emotion as I call it that I want to isolate from really good reasons to condemn something.\n \n \nIf a person is severely mentally handicapped, should it be legal to just have your way with them if you are careful? (Since they would be indifferent to the act, it wouldn't hurt them, and they don't have the capacity to feel mental trauma?) Would it be moral to sexually assault a person if they are asleep or under the influence of some drug if they won't remember it and it won't hurt them?\n\n They're people and they have a right not just to control sexual behavior but all their behavior.\n \n \nI think the obvious answer in these situations is 'no', and I think that taking advantage of a person or animal sexually is wrong.\n\n I have heard this one before. I call it the 'equality' standard. It basically states that sexual relations are only moral if both partners are 'equal'.\n \n Since animals cannot be equal to humans sex with them is equivalent to taking advantage of them. I agree it is taking advantage of them but that doesn't mean doing so is wrong. Using an entire species for food and milk is also taking advantage of them.\n \n I think this is a result of people trying to treat animal human sex the same way they treat human human sex. The argument then boils down to pointing out that the animal is not a human and cannot respond with the same understanding that human could. It just doesn't matter though they aren't human. The examples you thought of don't translate to this because you are talking about humans who for some reason are deprived of the level of understanding they should have.\n \n \nThe idea that an animal can give consent, while at the same time saying they aren't mentally capable of understanding what is going on (they are indifferent, won't suffer trauma, etc) is inconsistent.\n\n It might appear that way at first glance but it is not.\n \n When I say mentally incapable of understanding what is going on I am talking about the complexities that go into the human's desire. I am saying they don't have any concept of what sex can mean to a human being.\n \n What they are capable of fully understanding is sex for pleasure and for reinforcing relationships. The (to them) incomprehensible metaphysical connections that might exist in the humans mind are beyond them and frankly that is just fine.\n \n Because of the later though they would be incapable of sustaining trauma that human might.\n \n They are capable of sustaining trauma and permanent mental damage if they are hurt but they must see themselves as being hurt for that to happen.\n \n To a human whose taken advantage of they are able to perceive that fact, they are able to feel social condemnation, they are capable of feeling serious guilt for their behavior.\n \n Trauma related to sex in humans is almost always directly related to guilt. even when it's irrational such as the case of rape.\n \n What I am saying an animal can't understand is just how much more intelligent a human is (even if they react to evidence by being very trusting). The only thing they would really grasp from a human wanting to have sex with them is that a human wants to have sex with them. They would want to for pleasure and because to them it builds social bonds. Building social bonds is important for pack or herd animals and almost all our domesticated animals are such which it is supposed why they even have social frameworks we can insert ourselves into.\n \n For humans sex could mean more because relationships mean more, but the key thing is that relationships with animals, the normal pet ones included; are always on the level of the animal. The animal cannot respond as a human but humans posses all the required emotions and reasoning (by far) to respond as an animal.\n \n Observe how someone communicates with their dog, they do not just speak to it in normal language and expect it to understand. They use body language, few words, and tone of voice. They do not expect that the dog is equal to them but that doesn't mean they find no value in the things they can both understand. Like playing or loyalty or sharing food....... or sex.\n \n Sex like eating or finding food is something common to many many many species. It is only our consciousness that has produced the full meaning of sex to us. So long as we still possess the root of that meaning in a simple enough form for an animal to interface with it the sexual relationship can be equal, on the level of the animal.\n \n \nAn animal (especially a smaller animal) can not give consent\n\n If you are talking about animals which are anatomically unable to have any safe sexual relations with a person or is for any reason unable to understand socialization in a way compatible with humans then yes.\n \n \ncan't say no, can't no what is about to happen, can't report abuse, etc. Plus,\n\n A lizard could say no. They simply act aggressive when something bugs them.\n \n \nwe don't know if they feel trauma from the events or not. \n\n Not all animals are the same you know. We certainly know some animals can feel trauma. We know this from their behavior afterward, unusual fears or reactions to certain people or things.\n \n \nWith medical research, it is a necessary evil to help further medical technology and save human lives.\n\n I don't believe in necessary evils.\n \n \nWe are human, and I feel like we have a commitment to the good of our own species. If animals can help save/extend human lives (by way of food, medical research, etc.) then I think it is justified.\n\n You know we raise and breed animals for the best tasting meat right? Isn't that just for pleasure?\n \n \nSex with animals gives no benefits other than short-lived pleasure,\n\n The same could be said for 'friendships' with animals but uncounted numbers of people still have pets and profess to get something out of the fact long after technology has made them useless to us.\n \n \nand it comes at the cost of the animal.\n\n That depends on the species involved. The kind of combinations that bestiality people go for are not dangerous to either party.\n \n Plus if you kill a chicken with your ____ or with a knife you still got a body you can cook.\n \n \nThe reason I am more indifferent toward animals having sex with people (as opposed to people having sex with animals) is because in that situation, it is the animal who is choosing to do it. They can stop if they want, but if they are forced to do something like that, then that is wrong, too. It's the person who is generally in danger in these situations, and if he/she is willing to put himself in that situation, then so be it. \n\n People know which situations are safe and which aren't even if they ignore their best judgement sometimes. So I was right that it was the clarity of consent that triggered this differentiation but I haven't heard a response to my comments on that view.\n \n Shouldn't you also be indifferent to consensual sex even if the animal is female?",

   "But I don't think the rights of humans and the rights of animals are equal... I just don't think people should pork their pork.\n\n A lot of people think the rights of men and women are equal but still don't think people should 'pork' their own gender.\n \n \nI'd say that's a good rule of thumb. \n\n I don't. Not only does it not have much to do with the consent standard, it is very subjective because what should be equal and how to judge that are completly arbitrary.\n \n \nIn order to survive, people and animals have to consume organic matter. There really isn't a way to avoid \"taking advantage\" in that regard.\n\n We used to just kill em. Then we captured them so we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of hunting.\n \n Why avoid taking advantage? No one is trying to avoid taking advantage of pets because no one would seriously argue a pet would be better off as a wild animal.\n \n \nHow would having sex with an animal be any different than having sex with a person who is \"deprived of the level of understanding they should have?\" In both cases, you could say it doesn't harm or affect the 'victim.'\n \n I said already it's not about harm or affect it's about consent. A person under drugs can't give consent. If someone told another before they went under that someone could use their body that would be different. You would have to be more specific about what severely handicapped meant. If you are claiming that retarded people should be excluded from sex because they aren't mentally equal with others I would find that absurd. I suspect what you had in your mind was someone using their superior intelligence to trick a mentally ill person or a mentally ill person who is so out of it they can't even communicate.\n \n First and foremost it would be different because people have rights and animals don't.\n \n Secondly if you want to consider the consent of the animal they can understand sex as well as their species is capable and it is no deprivation to have sex with a creature with a different/wider understanding.\n \n It seems to me no matter how mentally damaged a human is if they can give consent they can understand sex to some degree.\n \n People with full mental faculties decide to have sex for the simplest of reasons. Very often purely for pleasure. That's a motivation you can be certain almost all higher animals share. If you find a person who can't understand and desire pleasure why would they give consent unless they were tricked?\n \nAnd if you don't like the example of a handicapped person, the argument is similar to an adult having sex with a (willing) child. \n\n A child is still a human and is still subject to the social condemnation and other factors that could cause trauma.\n \n In societies other than ours the legal age of adulthood coincided much more closely with puberty than 18 and there was a reason for that. They were a little more objective and saw sexual maturity as the natural start of condoned sexual behavior.\n \n Before sexual maturity true consent can't really be given. Bestiality people condemn pedophilia in bestiality as well.\n \n \nAlso, if you don't think comparing animal-human sex and human-human sex can be treated the same way, why bring it up in regards to homosexuality?\n\n I think they can be treated in the same way as far as the principle for moral import. I don't think it's valid to essentially dismiss bestiality because animals aren't human, i.e. start out with the premise that unless your having sex with an intellectual equal you are necessarily raping and traumatizing them.\n \n It's kind of a begging the question fallacy. It is equivalent to arguing against homosexuality on the grounds that your sex partner isn't the opposite gender.\n \n I am saying as you define moral sex as existing only between individuals who understand it the same way, you have changed the standard by changing the premise.\n \n You changed my original statement somewhat, I did not use the word compare I used the word treat. I know there are differences, there must be or else we wouldn't have two different words. By using the word treat I mean not that they are not comparable or that the standard of consent could not be applied to both, I meant you can't expect an animal to be a human to fit a template of human-human sex, just like you can't expect man-man sex to fit a template of man-woman sex.\n \n \nWe should gather some scientists and have them \n test farm animals for signs of post-rape trauma.\n\n Lol, sure; as an interesting study for animal psychologist I think that would be very interesting.\n \n You would of course have to then rape some farm animals first. You couldn't just find any animal who has had sex with a person and claim they were raped.\n \n Let me repeat that I wouldn't have any moral objection if someone really did do that study.\n \nYou're an objectivist, so would it even be considered evil to harm animals as long as it helps you?\n\n You seem to have heard what is at best a misconception but at worst an intentional and desperate strawman about objectivist. The existence of benefit does not morally validate behavior in the slightest.\n \n That being said I don't believe it is evil to harm animals at all. Life is the ultimate value and the willingness to kill animals is to resign oneself to their complete lack of rights. I do believe there are some border cases for the necessary properties to have rights... dolphins for instance.\n \n \nNo... humans have to eat organic matter to survive. \"Breeding\" animals doesn't particularly affect the animals in any way, and was done for a long, long time unintentionally through artificial selection.\n\n It's done intentionally now. Note you can't select for flavour unintentionally because you have to kill the animal before you can taste it, therefore you have to consciously observe that animals from a certain ancestor taste better and promote their genes through relatives. There is no evidence that we are improving the nutritional content while doing so. Aren't we take advantage of the species just for the purpose of culinary pleasure?\n \n \nI don't see how a cow's deliciousness hurts its quality of life.\n\n I would like to respond to this twice.\n \n 1. I don't see how having sex with a cow or a bull hurts it's quality of life. In fact since it would be absurd to assert that their nerve clusters stop working just because a human shows up the zoos have a point that it is probably improving their quality of life.\n \n 2. It's not the selection that's hurting it, it's the slaughter houses. Are you saying 'well since we are already killing them wholesale making them taste better isn't any worse'? Well I am saying 'well since we are already killing them wholesale, pretty much nothing is worse; but especially not giving them pleasurable experiences every once in a while'.\n \n \nHow has technology made pets useless to us? Has technology made human friends useless? Pets (cats, dogs) generally get something out of the relationship too. It's not just one sided.\n\n I meant practical uses.\n \n That people and animals get something out of relationships with each other was exactly my point. You were speaking about sex with animals in contrast to experimenting on them, saying basically that experimenting was justified because it produced practical benefits like saving people's lives while sex was not because (I assume) it didn't do the same, it just produced momentary pleasure.\n \n My response was to point out that pretty much all pets have no practical purpose and are kept around for the general pleasure of having a creature to take care of and and who trusts you I guess. \n \n Keeping animals for pleasure then is already common. Nobody is trying to justify this practice against practical gain.\n \n You mentioned that 'friendships' between pets and owners is not all one sided, again what makes you think the benefit, even if it is just short-lived pleasure of sex is different?",

   "I've noticed. To be honest I haven't seen such a mum about any other so called controversial subject in the full range of issues I consider. It's analogous to what it would be like if taxes were an issue but as soon as anyone mentioned something related.. like tariffs everyone shuts up :p\n \n \n ..... (hehe) Well they aren't the only group. Objectivist (like me) also hold individual volition as the only objective standard of social morality. (social morality being your rights and what laws should be based on as opposed to personal virtue etc.)\n \n I haven't heard of too many objectivist besides myself applying the standard to sexual deviants but in a very real way objectivist are the owners of that standard as we are the ones with a fully vetted philosophical basis for the idea as well as in theory applying it to everything.\n \n I don't want to offend any homosexual movement people here but it seems like they extracted a small chunk of core enlightenment age philosophy and decided to apply it towards the sole and singular goal of refuting naturalistic or theological standards on the particular type of behavior they were interested in.\n \n I am pretty much sure however that the consent standard if accepted does apply to these other deviations (namely bestiality and incest) just as surely as it is claimed to for homosexuality.\n \n However, in case it isn't clear already; I don't think I have demonstrated or could if asked demonstrate a problem with the consent standard even in sexual deviation. I started this thread in hopes of tasking some more minds on exploring the subject. I im in a discussion with papillon about this in another thread but it is kind of off topic there.\n \n Just to get the party started, I support the idea that these deviations are unnatural in that they do not fulfill the biological function of sex per se. However as anyone even heterosexuals might tell you, sex occurs for far more than making kids. A biologist might tell you social sex is more prominent in intelligent mammals than any other group, and among the intelligent mammals again apes seem to be leaders.\n \n \n Not familiar with it.\n \n \n Then, as with all subjective matters; there doesn't seem to be much point arguing over it does there?\n \n \n One thing at a time eh?\n \n \n I get that, however since the law as already kind of defined the age of legal liability for us that might be a different discussion.\n \n Pappalion in the other thread was making a case against incest, it was almost entirely based on pedophilia. Many of the articles we investigated made special note of the trauma that can be incurred by forced sexual harassment (no surprise there), but specifically that if people are the same age, even if young it seems to downplay the danger of 'forced' extremely.\n \n I would make an argument that before sexual maturity you can pretty much condemn all sexual behavior because you know for certain that the person can't possibly be getting anything out of it and it might be painful. i.e. they wouldn't do it without physical or social pressure.\n \n Of course we know that the age of 18 is actually arbitrary and not set in stone. People losing their virginity close to then is not frowned about very badly it seems. (like 17) given that it was with someone about their age.\n\n \n This will kind of blanket various posts, some coming later, but thought I will respond at least close to where my name pops up.\n \n In the stricktest sense of the words you would be correct coming from a heterosexual perspective that all three are not typical sexual behavior. The words though are not used to express simply a sense that one action is less common than another. They are understood as one is less common than the other and the less common one is bad because it is not what has been established as the normal activity for that group. Basically what is being said is I am straight and your not and there are more of me than you so your an abnormal sexual deviant. It becomes difficult to get past what comes across as insulting to the scientific merits of the statement.\n \n Concent is not a simple yes or no. Along with that yes or no is the implied understanding that the person has the capacity to comprehend the ramifications of consent (whether they really understand is generally a little more grey and is seperate). A 5 year old can say yes and even go along with intercourse, but we would never believe they had the capicity to understand what they were doing therefore they are not permitted to give consent for anything they do. As they get older the line begins to move and get a little blurred. Some states have emancipation at 15 or 16. Some contracts are enforceable when signed by a minor without parantal concent and with it a child as young as 14 can be legally married. \n \n An animal humping your leg seems like a pretty sure sign of a willingness to explore something different, but there is no way the animal can understand all that such an action encomapsses. I know later Freedom will make the argument that man can relate at the animals level even if the animal cannot at the human level. I disagree that the human can mimic that well nor do I think it likely that A) very many would bother and B) that they could turn it on and off at will. Their would always be some aspect of the human part involved. My primary reason though would be safety their exists a line of what we do out of need and what we do out of desire that gets crossed. Disease jumping species is a concern relating to safety as well as the reaction of an animal that does not wish to engage in relations with a human. We may lock animals up in puppy mills or slaughter them for food, but puppy mills most would agree reflect poorly on us as a species and are mostly illegal. We have need to eat and while we might be able to survive on vegetables alone it is not how we are designed. There is a need to eat in order to survive there is no need to have sex with animals that keeps us alive. \n \n Is there really a difference between a minor and animal in this sense? Both lack the understanding to be held accountable for their choices, both are dependent on thier parents/owners for shelter and food, niether are permitted to under their own care, but the minor at least has some recourse in the event of abuse. They can tell someone in hopes of getting the abuse to cease, others are aware of the signs of abuse and look for them, they are taught what behavior is permissable and what is not. An animal can only endur perhaps run away, but will be caught and returned are put to sleep if it cannot be given to someone else. Since it is not a person it has no almost no rights and is given little consideration by comparison to its treatment. Permitting beatsility only serves to weaken the necessary self control that people need to form a stable society. If we all just did as we please whenever and however we would have total anarchy. We would live in a place where law did not exist and be subject to the whims of those able to dominate. This is of course an extreme scenario, but don't forget it is how we started and we would all agree that we have progressed from that point to something better. I don't see any benefit that is gained by permitting it.\n \n Polygamy or oddly what never seems to be considered Polyantry as long as is between consenting adults and under similiar obligations and protections as marriage I don't see a basis for it being illegal, I could but I don't think it would be representitive of the typical situation.\n \n Incest tricky incest. I was waiting for relationships between relatives by marriage or adoption where there gentic issue is made meaningless. It also would have led to the cases where relatives stumbled into each other unknowingly entering into a relationship and discovering later of the connection. Those are really the only instances where I think you may have a claim that it is unjust. \n \n Why are the incest laws different than gun laws, building codes or labor laws? They all like almost all laws are for the protection of the population. They have been enacted in response to a demonstratable need. They are not without some lattitude in their interpretation nor do they impose a complete prohibition. \n \n The articles you refer to stated that when the age difference was within 5 years and was mutual and done in an experimental or playfully curious limited fashion, like playing doctor there was little to suggest that any type of measurable negative effects were carried on. Not that there weren't but typically not. That is a very different scenario that what you imply. Also of the two cases examples one the woman was mentally impaired and was it 2 of 3 or 3 of 4 children were born impaired. It was only the fact they shared a room and during the passing of their mother that they became a couple. The other one was a woman who was caught by her fiancee cheating on him with her father and was angry at the fiancee. I won't go into the number of social shortcomings she possessed, but it is really hard to suggest that it was everything else in her life and incest had nothing to do with it. Research study upon research study shows repeatedly that incest has various degrees of emotional and mental effects that can result. \n \n As I said before consent is not just yes or no. There is the implied understanding that the benefit is worth any repercussions. By choosing that an act has enough moral value to do or not do there now exist a measurable event that others will compare to their own moral standard. I don't suggest that they should or have that right, just that the possibility exists. I think the question comes to understanding what motivates people to determine the morality of anothers actions even when those actions have no effect on the person judging. For your question I don't think there is a single black or white answer or if there is relies on the circumstances which really isn't a single answer.",

I disagree that the human can mimic that well nor do I think it likely that A) very many would bother and B) that they could turn it on and off at will.\n\n You misunderstood then, I was not talking about consciously imitating or mimicking animal relations. That the animal is domesticated and agreed is already proof that the necessary communicative interface has been established. Dog's for instance are an extreme example of social compatibility with humans and it doesn't really matter whether the dog genome moved towards humans or it was that way by coincidence. The point is that dogs communicate to people and people communicate to dogs and people and dogs both do this pretty much automatically. That is why it is safe to leave a dog with your kids but not a wolf.\n \n Notice how it is not impossible to communicate with a wolf, or any other undomesticated animal (with a social structure); but you need to actively mimic their behavior to do it. Animals experts the 'whisperers' train and study to do this.\n \n It is not necessary for domesticated animals or any animal which already shows the ability to understand humans.\n \n \n \nTheir would always be some aspect of the human part involved.\n\n Yea, the human.... Once again when I said 'on animals level' I was talking about their level of relations, not reorienting a persons mind to the same as an animals.\n \n Playing is a totally normal human behavior and no one would claim that when somebody plays with their dog in the park they are abandoning their human nature and mimicking animal behavior. They don't need to because the 'dog playing' and 'people playing' are already compatible.\n \n\n My primary reason though would be safety their exists a line of what we do out of need and what we do out of desire that gets crossed. Disease jumping species is a concern relating to safety as well as the reaction of an animal that does not wish to engage in relations with a human.\n\n Let people know the risks, that's all you can do. Unless you want to start handing out animal condoms :p\n \n \nWe may lock animals up in puppy mills or slaughter them for food, but puppy mills most would agree reflect poorly on us as a species and are mostly illegal. We have need to eat and while we might be able to survive on vegetables alone it is not how we are designed. There is a need to eat in order to survive there is no need to have sex with animals that keeps us alive. \n\n There is no needs to have sex with humans on contraception, or with humans who are biologically incapable of producing young (homosexuals and sterile people). There is no need to keep pets or play with them in the park. There is no need for porn or gay pride parades or riding horses.\n \n You talk about need as if harming animals were a 'necessary evil' that should be limited as far as possible, but then you want to apply it for the most part not to harming animals but to having sexual relations with them.\n \n The truth is that bestiality doesn't need to be harmful, typically isn't even in it's underground state; and even when it is harmful no different from the slaughter of countless animals. It's all fine and good to say we need meat to survive but the truth is we also desire the best tasting meat too and we take steps to get it. Hardly indicative of behavior about a necessary evil.\n \n \nIs there really a difference between a minor and animal in this sense? Both lack the understanding to be held accountable for their choices, both are dependent on thier parents/owners for shelter and food, niether are permitted to under their own care, but the minor at least has some recourse in the event of abuse. They can tell someone in hopes of getting the abuse to cease, others are aware of the signs of abuse and look for them, they are taught what behavior is permissable and what is not. An animal can only endur perhaps run away, but will be caught and returned are put to sleep if it cannot be given to someone else. Since it is not a person it has no almost no rights and is given little consideration by comparison to its treatment. \n\n Yes, as I said before and as you have mentioned here animals have no rights.\n \n It is precisely the animals lack of intelligence that makes the kind of psychological damage possible to children impossible on the complex thoughts you would need to think. Yes they get their food from their owners and their shelter and pretty much everything that sustains them. They aren't however at risk of contemplating how vulnerable they are to their owners nor resenting their lack of freedom because of it. If they were human their existance in practical slavery no matter how pleasant would be reason enough to react badly but they don't. To them they are in a pack or a herd of family or what not. The leaders of the group of very resourceful when it comes to food and shelter but aren't they supposed to be?\n \n A human child is still a human, and their level of perceptions even at very young ages are vastly greater than an animal and greater still they will become. They can feel all the social condemnation, all the guilt, they can feel they were taken advantage of; but most importantly they have the rights that made it wrong.\n \n I like this point though, I have noted the odd perversion that people have of calling themselves 'pet parents' and treating their pet increasingly like a child. While it may fulfill that psychological role in their life the label fits no better than 'husband' or 'wife'. I think the fact that so many think of animals like children is a strong factor in the anti-bestiality emotion, to them it seems like pedophilia. They are just as nutty though as the wackos on the other side that are claiming that animals understand it all and that the consent they give is identical to a humans.\n \n Animals are not human, that means not young human and not old human. Children do not have sexual relations as they are not sexually mature. Adult animals do. It is totally arbitrary anthropomorphizing to equivocate their intelligence with immature people.\n \n \nPermitting beatsility only serves to weaken the necessary self control that people need to form a stable society.\n\n ... wait .... a second.... Are you claiming that sexual pleasure will cause people to lose self control and devolve into anarchy?\n \n What about sex toys then?\n \n \nIf we all just did as we please whenever and however we would have total anarchy.\n\n Agreed, but if we all just did as we pleased whenever and however provided we violated no one's rights we would have a total utopia.\n \n \nWe would live in a place where law did not exist and be subject to the whims of those able to dominate. This is of course an extreme scenario, but don't forget it is how we started and we would all agree that we have progressed from that point to something better. I don't see any benefit that is gained by permitting it.\n\n We have progressed since anarchy but I seriously doubt a lack of bestiality was at all a component of that progress. Ancient societies have had nothing bad to say on it, even those we consider the most civilized and advanced of their era.\n \n It's far more likely that the judeo-christian tradition is responsible for modern views on sexual deviations than civilization in general.\n \n \nPolygamy or oddly what never seems to be considered Polyantry as long as is between consenting adults and under similiar obligations and protections as marriage I don't see a basis for it being illegal, I could but I don't think it would be representitive of the typical situation.\n\n Again you appeal to what your guessing the typical situation would be... \n \n \nWhy are the incest laws different than gun laws, building codes or labor laws? They all like almost all laws are for the protection of the population. They have been enacted in response to a demonstratable need. They are not without some lattitude in their interpretation nor do they impose a complete prohibition.\n \n You managed to list off other laws I don't agree with :p\n \n \nThe articles you refer to stated that when the age difference was within 5 years and was mutual and done in an experimental or playfully curious limited fashion, like playing doctor there was little to suggest that any type of measurable negative effects were carried on.

That they are incapable of feeling social condemnation and guilt for having sex I also do not doubt.\n \n \nAlso, saying that 'animals don't have rights' is not going to get you very far in a discussion on morality. \n\n lol, why?\n \n \nI think my example of raping a mentally impaired person (and I mean severe/profound mental retardation) is a very good example of why I disagree, and I don't feel like you (Freedom) have successfully refuted this argument at all.\n\n Well then would you care to address my response to that?\n \n \n\n I think my views on this subject are along the same lines as pappillion.\n \n Anyway, I'll still reply to this thread if it keeps going, but I don't really have much interest in a tedious, sentence by sentence breakdown of a debate when we have a fundamental disagreement on consent that makes any further debate pointless.\n\n Yes that does sound a bit like pappillion(sorry pap), if there is a fundamental disagreement that is not being addressed, why don't you identify it so we can argue it instead of throwing our hands up in despair?",

It really makes the discussion difficult to follow when there are 40 different items being discussed in each post (nearly always in a short one-two-liner style). \n \n \nThen you have already contradicted yourself and all evidence.\n \n 1. That they can give consent and that they get pleasure out of it were never really in question IMO; but neither of those things make morally 'ok' because they aren't human and the consent standard no more applies to them then it would if they didn't want to get eaten.\n\n \n I don't see how I've contradicted myself or any evidence. \n \n The eating animals thing was already explained pretty well by pappillion. Humans have to eat. I'm not saying that I agree with the way that all animals are treated in every situation, but killing and eating animals and plants is how we have to survive. I seriously doubt that if everyone became a vegetarian that we would have enough crops to be able to properly nourish people (We can't even feed everybody as it is).

Drown a dog? Electrocute baboons? Elephant genocide? Sure, why not? They don't have rights! \n \n And it's not a supportable claim, anyway. Who is to say that animals don't have rights? Who is to say that humans do? Many people would disagree with you, yet you state it as a well known fact. \n \n \nWell then would you care to address my response to that?\n\n \n Unless I missed something, your only response to the mentally impaired scenario was this:\n \n \nThey're people and they have a right not just to control sexual behavior but all their behavior.\n\n \n I honestly don't see how this is in any way a meaningful response, which is why I didn't directly 'answer it.' What you say is true about people, but doesn't address the specific situation where the person doesn't understand sexual behavior in the first place. You also don't make it clear whether you think a person having sex with one of these invalids would be acceptable.\n \n \n \nYes that does sound a bit like pappillion(sorry pap), if there is a fundamental disagreement that is not being addressed, why don't you identify it so we can argue it instead of throwing our hands up in despair?\n\n \n I've identified the underlying problem as being \"animals can give consent.\" You say it was never really in question, and that's the point. It is in question because the animal can't really understand what it is even consenting to. You don't think this matters; I do. \n \n If the animal is small enough to be hurt during the act, it can't do anything to fight back or let you know it wants you to stop. It doesn't even seem to me that there is any difference in an animal consenting or not consenting. A docile animal that trusts its owner probably isn't going to kick or attack him anyway, and even if the animal does somehow \"say no,\" what is going to stop the person from doing it anyway (if the person even get the hint in the first place... most men can't read a woman's body language, let alone an animal's). The animal can't testify or report a crime, and if we were talking about bestiality in a legal sense, there would be absolutely no way to even form a guess about whether it was a rape or consensual... there would really be no difference between the two things. \n \n Well, there I went with a long response...",

   "Freedom, I don't think I've been the only one who has mentioned it, but it's simply annoying when I, or other posters, post one or two paragraphs, only to see a response tear it down into 25 separate arguments with various hypotheticals and other questions. It really makes the discussion difficult to follow when there are 40 different items being discussed in each post (nearly always in a short one-two-liner style). \n\n It is 25 separate arguments, I respond to the units of meaning as they are understood by me. It's crazy to think the response would be more clear if I responded to the 25 units in one big paragraph where you couldn't tell what was responding to what except by extrapolation.\n \n The only other option I see is to kind of ignore the post your responding to and go in a direction that addresses generally what was said. That kind of generality leads no where and you know it. People just end up repeating the same things because they don't recognize responses to them, sometimes they ignore my responses even when they are directly after the quote in question.\n \n My way of responding is much more like a conversation with real time answers and questions. It is one of the reasons I love this environment for arguing, you can clearly identify the segments of communication you are dealing with. If you want a single big answer, make a single big paragraph which makes one point.\n \n \nI don't see how I've contradicted myself or any evidence. \n\n Remember when you said this:\n \nBy the way, I'm talking about humans putting things into animals, not the other way around. \n \n\n and I said:\n \nStonewall, the other way around is bestiality too. It's just more clear that the animal has given consent.\n\n \n You contradict yourself because even while you claim that animals cannot give consent you understand that this can't be true because male animals pretty much need to be in the loop, and so you excluded them from your consideration.\n \n You backed yourself into a corner where you have to update your claim to 'female animals can't give consent' because you already admit males can. That is a position I don't think anyone could defend.\n \n You have contradicted the evidence because animals will initiate sexual encounters with people, females and males both; especially after they learn it can happen. Sexual advances from animals have been documented completly independent of bestial people. Not to sound to coarse but all you need to do is google this, you will find youtube videos which are meant to be jokes, they are probably not jokes to the animals though.\n \n You need to define consent as something special beyond it's normal dictionary definition in order to claim animals can't give consent. It would not no longer mean 'agree to' but something else (?).\n \n \nThe eating animals thing was already explained pretty well by pappillion. Humans have to eat. I'm not saying that I agree with the way that all animals are treated in every situation, but killing and eating animals and plants is how we have to survive.\n\n So animals have rights but they 'give way to' our need to survive? How do you justify that?\n \n \nI seriously doubt that if everyone became a vegetarian that we would have enough crops to be able to properly nourish people (We can't even feed everybody as it is). \n\n We have plenty of area for farming and farming plants is more effective than farming animals when it comes to most nutrients. People don't do it because it's very difficult to establish a healthy diet on plants, i.e. you would need to eat very many of them and worry about having special ones.\n \n They also do it for pleasure, because it tastes great.\n \n \nHaving sex with animals is in no way necessary to survival,\n\n I've already responded to this if you remember, I listed off other things that are also unnecessary. Including keeping pets.\n \n \nand due to the sanitation issues, you would have to agree that it would actually be detrimental to survival. \n\n That would be situational. Most domesticated animals are healthy enough.\n \n \nSo you say, but you have no supporting evidence. \n\n I hold the default position, if you say something exists in an animal psyche it is up to you to produce the evidence.\n \n \nBecause by saying \"animals don't have rights\" you are basically giving support to the idea that we can literally do anything to any non-human and it be morally acceptable. Drown a dog? Electrocute baboons? Elephant genocide? Sure, why not? They don't have rights! \n\n That is correct they don't have rights. Just because a reason exists not to do it doesn't mean it would be immoral to do it.\n \n \nAnd it's not a supportable claim, anyway.\n\n That's another discussion, one I am sure I could demonstrate but not quite on topic here; I did not want to get into that which is why I am also willing to argue that animals to give consent for the very case that someone claims they do have rights.\n \n \nWho is to say that animals don't have rights? Who is to say that humans do?\n\n I\n \nMany people would disagree with you, yet you state it as a well known fact.\n \n A fact does not rely on how many people know it.\n \n \nUnless I missed something\n\n Perhaps this:\n \nI said already it's not about harm or affect it's about consent. A person under drugs can't give consent. If someone told another before they went under that someone could use their body that would be different. You would have to be more specific about what severely handicapped meant. If you are claiming that retarded people should be excluded from sex because they aren't mentally equal with others I would find that absurd. I suspect what you had in your mind was someone using their superior intelligence to trick a mentally ill person or a mentally ill person who is so out of it they can't even communicate.\n \n First and foremost it would be different because people have rights and animals don't.\n \n Secondly if you want to consider the consent of the animal they can understand sex as well as their species is capable and it is no deprivation to have sex with a creature with a different/wider understanding.\n \n It seems to me no matter how mentally damaged a human is if they can give consent they can understand sex to some degree.\n \n People with full mental faculties decide to have sex for the simplest of reasons. Very often purely for pleasure. That's a motivation you can be certain almost all higher animals share. If you find a person who can't understand and desire pleasure why would they give consent unless they were tricked?\n\n \n \nWhat you say is true about people, but doesn't address the specific situation where the person doesn't understand sexual behavior in the first place.\n\n If a person doesn't understand sex they can't consent to it. That does not mean they can't agree to something they don't understand but it does mean that they would be being tricked, in which case it would be deception on the part of the person asking. If they cannot understand and agree to something even if the other trying to communicate is being honest they can't possibly be interpreted as accepting it. BUT animals can understand sex, animals have to understand sex; animals can communicate well enough to give consent. An action speaks louder than a thousand words they say.\n \n How many countless people would agree with me when I say the fact that a horse or a dog comes home no matter how far the explore means the want to live there?\n \n \nYou also don't make it clear whether you think a person having sex with one of these invalids would be acceptable.\n\n That's because you didn't make the extend of the illness clear. If consent can be obtained I don't see a problem with it.\n \n \nI've identified the underlying problem as being \"animals can give consent.\" You say it was never really in question, and that's the point. It is in question because the animal can't really understand what it is even consenting to. You don't think this matters; I do. \n\n No I don't see how you can deny it given... reality. I thought you were building up to some new definition of consent or some metaphysical connections with human spirituality.\n \n How the hec do you thinks animals make themselves if they can't understand sex?\n \n \nIf the animal is small enough to be hurt during the act, it can't do anything to fight back or let you know it wants you to stop.\n\n What are you talking about? A fish? I can't think of many animals which have no way of displaying displeasure. Certainly no social animals, and only social animals have a hope interfacing with a human social framework and therefore the only hope of giving consent.\n \n \nIt doesn't even seem to me that there is any difference in an animal consenting or not consenting.\n\n Not morally I agree.\n \n \nA docile animal that trusts its owner probably isn't going to kick or attack him anyway, and even if the animal does somehow \"say no,\" what is going to stop the person from doing it anyway (if the person even get the hint in the first place... most men can't read a woman's body language, let alone an animal's). The animal can't testify or report a crime, and if we were talking about bestiality in a legal sense, there would be absolutely no way to even form a guess about whether it was a rape or consensual... there would really be no difference between the two things. \n \n\n I see three distinct points here:\n 1. An animal might not react badly even if they aren't actively pursuing sex because they trust their owner and/or are used to people touching their body.\n 2. Since animals cannot report anything even if they did say no and were raped there is no way to prove that was the situation, effectively making the legalization of bestiality the legalization of animal rape.\n 3. A human couldn't read the body language of an animal well enough to detect a 'I don't want to'.\n \n My response:\n 1.r True, but I don't see a problem with this. Humans in sexual relationships sometimes have sex when they aren't really interested in it, just for the sake of their partner. That doesn't mean they didn't give consent.\n \n The other two responses may need to be updated to a little more explicit than may be comfortable. I think we are going to need to start using examples and links if you refuse to extrapolate on other pet behaviors. I have found a couple sites that do not contain inappropriate material (within the context that means pictures, plenty of nasty text though) but I was hoping we could keep this internal.\n \n 2.r Not quite true... Alright don't fly off the top for this, but one could demonstrate that the sex is consensual by recording an encounter to observe the animals behavior. There is one thing I would like to point out though, you're right animals can't really talk about it which means if the are having sex with a human it would be quite easy for the human to keep it quiet. It might be easier to find animal rapers if non-rapers could be eliminated from the equation because they can admit to it legally. Finally and again I don't think animals have rights and I don't really care if somebody rapes them.\n \n 3.r Human body language is understandably understated (at least in people's minds) because we can talk. If you are trying to communicate without language (I have been in this situation) body language becomes much more important and it's remarkably easy to observe when you are concentrating on it. Further animal communication tends to be overstated or intense because of their lack of proper language. The idea that a dog would communicate something as serious as 'No' with some minuscule tilt of the head is a little unlikely in my opinion. Finally pet owners claim to understand their particular pets pretty well. If an animal wants to say no it would (as I said) probably take the form of walking away.\n \n \nWell, there I went with a long response...\n\n emoticon_xgood Fine with me, very clear emoticon_xgood",

   "First of all, I would like to admit that the issue of consent is pretty complicated and not as clear cut as either of us have made it out to be. I will also acknowledge that there are some reasonable arguments in favor of bestiality. That said...\n \n \nRemember when you said this:\n \n and I said:\n \n You contradict yourself because even while you claim that animals cannot give consent you understand that this can't be true because male animals pretty much need to be in the loop, and so you excluded them from your consideration.\n \n You backed yourself into a corner where you have to update your claim to 'female animals can't give consent' because you already admit males can.

Sexual advances from animals have been documented completly independent of bestial people. Not to sound to coarse but all you need to do is google this, you will find youtube videos which are meant to be jokes, they are probably not jokes to the animals though.\n\n \n I don't really think that any form of bestiality is morally fine, but I tried to narrow it down because I realize certain forms of it are much more ambiguous and harder to make an argument for or against (like masturbating an race horse to get it's sperm). So yeah, I am guilty of picking and choosing here to try and simplify the argument.\n \n I guess a better, more all encompassing approach would have been to argue that animals don't give informed consent at all, and even sex between two animals of the same species is more instinctual than anything else (I am aware that animals get pleasure of sex and some will even masturbate.) \n \n I just can't shake the feeling that when a human intervenes, he is taking advantage of an animal's instinctual nature. Even in the case of a male animal penetrating a human, the human has to get into that position in the first place, and it could be argued that the instincts of the animal 'kick in' at that point. Even in the case of an animal 'raping' a person or other animal (where one participant is actively unwilling), the animal can't really be at fault because they don't have the understanding necessary. They can't fully understand what is going on, they can't know the consequences, and they are often driven by their instincts and are thus don't always have control over their actions. \n \n It's not really much different from a child... they simply don't know any better.\n \n \nYou need to define consent as something special beyond it's normal dictionary definition in order to claim animals can't give consent. It would not no longer mean 'agree to' but something else (?).\n\n \n In the legal sense, 'agree' does not fit the bill of consent, which is why children can't give consent. There has to be a mutual understanding going on. If two 10 year old children fool around, then most likely neither was taking advantage of the other, when an adult does it then there is a problem. \n \n \nSo animals have rights but they 'give way to' our need to survive? How do you justify that?\n\n \n Because first and foremost, we need to survive. That's how nature works. Even if there is some way to keep every human alive without infringing on any other living creature (there isn't), that doesn't justify other acts that can be viewed as inhumane.\n \n \nWe have plenty of area for farming and farming plants is more effective than farming animals when it comes to most nutrients. People don't do it because it's very difficult to establish a healthy diet on plants, i.e. you would need to eat very many of them and worry about having special ones.\n\n \n And yet according to wikipedia, 14% of the world's population suffers from malnutrition, and people die every day from starvation. You also have to consider that many places aren't very good for farming... anyway, I did a quick google search and came up with this answers.com thing that was pretty interesting.\n \n Answers.com - What would happen if everyone was a vegetarian\n \n \nThey also do it for pleasure, because it tastes great.\n\n \n Of course it tastes great. It's evolutionary. We need food to survive, so foods give us pleasure as an incentive to eat. Same with sex. We need sex to keep the species going, so sex feels good. I don't see how this is an argument against anything, and as I've already said... even if you think that killing animals for food is wrong, it being legal and accepted does not justify other actions you may see as wrong.\n \n \nI've already responded to this if you remember, I listed off other things that are also unnecessary. Including keeping pets.\n\n \n And again, if one thing is unnecessary but accepted, that doesn't make all unnecessary things acceptable.\n \n \nThat would be situational. Most domesticated animals are healthy enough.\n\n \n It's still an issue.\n \n Zoophilia and health - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nI hold the default position, if you say something exists in an animal psyche it is up to you to produce the evidence.\n\n \n I don't think this is the default position. \"Do whatever you want until you can prove it has negative effects.\" Does that mean sex with children was okay before people learned about the trauma? Does that mean that comatose people were fair game for anything until we could prove that they had brain activity (or something... you get my point). When you are talking from a scientific point of view, then yes, evidence is necessary before an idea takes hold. But if you think you could be doing harm to something by performing an unnecessary action (despite having no evidence that it actually is harmful), then I think the default position should be not to perform that action. It reminds me of how a lot of people don't/didn't think fish can feel pain, but would that justify torturing a fish that you planned on eating?\n \n \nThat is correct they don't have rights. Just because a reason exists not to do it doesn't mean it would be immoral to do it.\n \n That's another discussion, one I am sure I could demonstrate but not quite on topic here; I did not want to get into that which is why I am also willing to argue that animals to give consent for the very case that someone claims they do have rights.\n \n I\n \n A fact does not rely on how many people know it.\n\n \n Well I'm glad you cleared that up... (sarcasm)\n \n Freedom and rights are a mirage. You only have freedom and rights that are given to you by the people who are more powerful than you. If the government wanted to, they could take away every ounce of freedom and every right that you think you have in a heartbeat. A murderer can do the same thing. This of course would be immoral, but it's no different from our interaction with animals. If we give them rights, they have rights. If you give them no rights and torture them or do whatever you want to them regardless of how it might hurt them, then that is also immoral. (I am also aware that as a species, humans have a lot of conflicting values. We need them for food, so we have to be able to kill them, yet at the same time we take care of sick animals, etc.)\n \n \nPerhaps this:\n\n \n \nIt seems to me no matter how mentally damaged a human is if they can give consent they can understand sex to some degree.\n \n People with full mental faculties decide to have sex for the simplest of reasons. Very often purely for pleasure. That's a motivation you can be certain almost all higher animals share. If you find a person who can't understand and desire pleasure why would they give consent unless they were tricked?\n\n \n Yet part of the consent you spoke of about animals was that they might walk away, kick, or in some other way show their displeasure. Seemingly, indifference is consent. Yet in the hypothetical situation of an impaired person who is unable to communicate and unable to fight back or show that they are willing or not, is it morally okay to have sex with him/her?\n \n People with full mental faculties may very well have sex only for pleasure, but they are also aware of the consequences of their actions, the diseases, injuries, etc.\n \n \nIf a person doesn't understand sex they can't consent to it. That does not mean they can't agree to something they don't understand but it does mean that they would be being tricked, in which case it would be deception on the part of the person asking. If they cannot understand and agree to something even if the other trying to communicate is being honest they can't possibly be interpreted as accepting it. BUT animals can understand sex, animals have to understand sex; animals can communicate well enough to give consent. An action speaks louder than a thousand words they say.\n\n \n My position is that it is trickery and deception. It is taking advantage of the simplicity of the mind of an animal (or person in the case of children or the disabled). As I have said, the animal can't fully understand the consequences of its actions or always have control over its impulses.\n \n Here I will claim to use the \"default position\" that an animal does not understand sexual acts. Action does not denote understanding; it can simply denote instincts. \n \n \nHow many countless people would agree with me when I say the fact that a horse or a dog comes home no matter how far the explore means the want to live there?\n\n \n That's not necessarily true either. They may rely on something in that area to survive. I also fail to see how this is really relevant, since giving a creature whatever they want does not mean that it is necessarily the right thing to do. As I have said, they don't know any better.\n \n \nThat's because you didn't make the extend of the illness clear. If consent can be obtained I don't see a problem with it.\n\n \n Well if clear consent could be had, it wouldn't have been much of an analogy now, would it?\n \n \nNo I don't see how you can deny it given... reality. I thought you were building up to some new definition of consent or some metaphysical connections with human spirituality.\n\n \n I don't know why you would expect this out of me.\n \n \nHow the hec do you thinks animals make themselves if they can't understand sex?\n\n \n Instincts.\n \n \nWhat are you talking about? A fish? I can't think of many animals which have no way of displaying displeasure. Certainly no social animals, and only social animals have a hope interfacing with a human social framework and therefore the only hope of giving consent.\n\n \n There's a thin line between pain and pleasure.\n \n \nNot morally I agree.\n\n \n So this means that you would see no moral difference in having sex with an animal that clearly didn't want it and having sex with one who 'initiated' it? I don't really know why I am arguing this subject with someone who inherently doesn't believe that animals have, or should have any rights. What difference does it make to you at all? \n \n \nI see three distinct points here:\n 1. An animal might not react badly even if they aren't actively pursuing sex because they trust their owner and/or are used to people touching their body.\n 2. Since animals cannot report anything even if they did say no and were raped there is no way to prove that was the situation, effectively making the legalization of bestiality the legalization of animal rape.\n 3.

And would this make non-filmed animal sex illegal?\n \n And maybe for some people body language is easy to get, but I would disagree completely that most people are like that. How many stories are there of a person petting a dog or cat and thinking that everything is peachy, and then out of nowhere they get bitten or scratched?",

So yeah, I am guilty of picking and choosing here to try and simplify the argument.\n\n Um... well you know by the very act of omitting instances of a category you are unable to render conclusions about said category.\n \n For instance if the category was heterosexual sex and some one was arguing against that, and they tried to narrow it down to rape because the rest was less ambiguous; they could only make conclusions about rape not heterosexual sex.\n \n \nI guess a better, more all encompassing approach would have been to argue that animals don't give informed consent at all, and even sex between two animals of the same species is more instinctual than anything else (I am aware that animals get pleasure of sex and some will even masturbate.)\n \n You would have to define informed consent vs consent, and explain what the former must replace the later as the standard.\n \n Human sexual attraction whether people like to admit it or not is pretty much preprogrammed biochemical response even if our conscious and sub-conscious minds weave an intricate web of conceptual connections around it. Nobody claims that a human couple can't consent to sex because there is 'chemistry'.\n \n \nI just can't shake the feeling that when a human intervenes, he is taking advantage of an animal's instinctual nature.\n\n So what. If you are treating all that animals do as pure insticnt no volition, then the fact that dogs can live with humans nearly seamlessly and almost so for most other domesticated animals is 'merely their instinctual grouping nature'. So is it 'taking advantage' to insert yourself into a dog or horses social structure? Just to have them around to do fun stuff (like taking walks or riding places).\n \n \nEven in the case of a male animal penetrating a human, the human has to get into that position in the first place, and it could be argued that the instincts of the animal 'kick in' at that point.\n\n Actually that is not always true, animals can learn to do sex in different ways.\n \n \nEven in the case of an animal 'raping' a person or other animal (where one participant is actively unwilling), the animal can't really be at fault because they don't have the understanding necessary. They can't fully understand what is going on, they can't know the consequences, and they are often driven by their instincts and are thus don't always have control over their actions. \n\n What consequences? There can be no children. Are you talking about the phrase from the bible which would have both person and animal slain?\n \n What can't they understand? They can understand sex and social bonds by all indications. Is there something else you are requiring them to understand to give consent?\n \n Oh and I've never heard of an animal raping a human.\n \n\n It's not really much different from a child... they simply don't know any better.\n\n Ok, I don't know many children who have made sexual advances on adults; but you really seem to be attached to that analogy.\n \n \nBecause first and foremost, we need to survive. That's how nature works. Even if there is some way to keep every human alive without infringing on any other living creature (there isn't), that doesn't justify other acts that can be viewed as inhumane.\n\n You mean you can't justify it. Like all other relativistic moral theory it's simply collapses under the weight of it's own contradictions. I asked why our need translated to our right and the destruction of the animals rights. You responded \"we need it, that's how it works\".\n \n \nAnd yet according to wikipedia, 14% of the world's population suffers from malnutrition, and people die every day from starvation. You also have to consider that many places aren't very good for farming... anyway, I did a quick google search and came up with this answers.com thing that was pretty interesting.\n \n Answers.com - What would happen if everyone was a vegetarian\n\n An intelligent analysis but hardly more through than one I could have given you. Was there something in particular that you wanted me to see?\n \n \nOf course it tastes great. It's evolutionary. We need food to survive, so foods give us pleasure as an incentive to eat.\n \n\n We have made the food better on purpose.\n \n \nI don't see how this is an argument against anything, and as I've already said... even if you think that killing animals for food is wrong, it being legal and accepted does not justify other actions you may see as wrong.\n\n It's a dual point:\n \n 1. Animals don't have rights, if they did we wouldn't get to kill them regardless of our so called need.\n \n 2. It is contradictory to except the exploitation of animals on the grounds that \"it's needed\" while also excepting the exploitation of animals for pleasure when it's not needed.\n \n \nAnd again, if one thing is unnecessary but accepted, that doesn't make all unnecessary things acceptable.\n\n True, but if one thing is unnecessary but accepted, it can hardly be accepted because it is necessary.\n \n \nIt's still an issue.\n \n Zoophilia and health - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n That list is minuscule. Do you realize how many diseases people can give to each other?\n \n Plus I didn't say it was impossible, I said most animals are healthy enough.\n \n \nI don't think this is the default position. \"Do whatever you want until you can prove it has negative effects.\" \n\n There are no negative effects, it is the default position because I am not going to try to prove the non-existance of negative effects. Up next is proving the non-existance of god.\n \n \nDoes that mean sex with children was okay before people learned about the trauma?\n\n Children are not sexual beings, they cannot give consent unless they are deceived, tricked, or pressured.\n \n \nDoes that mean that comatose people were fair game for anything until we could prove that they had brain activity (or something... you get my point).\n\n Just as soon as you get consent from the comatose guy.\n \n \nWhen you are talking from a scientific point of view, then yes, evidence is necessary before an idea takes hold.\n\n Alright, if you want the idea that having sex is necessarily traumatic to an animal go ahead and find it. It's against common sense to expect it, it's against evidence as it stands, but try if you want.\n \n \nBut if you think you could be doing harm to something by performing an unnecessary action (despite having no evidence that it actually is harmful)\n\n Then you are thinking irrationally aren't you?\n \n \nthen I think the default position should be not to perform that action.\n\n Because there was a disturbance in the force.\n \n \nIt reminds me of how a lot of people don't/didn't think fish can feel pain, but would that justify torturing a fish that you planned on eating?\n\n You can't torture a creature that doesn't feel pain can you?\n \n \nWell I'm glad you cleared that up... (sarcasm)\n\n NP\n \nFreedom and rights are a mirage. You only have freedom and rights that are given to you by the people who are more powerful than you. If the government wanted to, they could take away every ounce of freedom and every right that you think you have in a heartbeat. A murderer can do the same thing. \n\n They are as real as reason and science is. Constructs of our mind, yes. Subjective and unrelated to reality, no.\n \n \nIf we give them rights, they have rights.\n\n Or we are pretending they have rights.\n \n \nIf you give them no rights and torture them or do whatever you want to them regardless of how it might hurt them, then that is also immoral.\n\n Why?\n \n \n(I am also aware that as a species, humans have a lot of conflicting values. We need them for food, so we have to be able to kill them, yet at the same time we take care of sick animals, etc.)\n\n Here is a little bit of objectivist spiel for you.\n \n It is the value of life that makes all other values possible. The fundamental alternative between life and death exists for all living things and is the absolute basis of all value. Unliving matter like a rock can have no values, matter changes it's forms but it cannot be destroyed. Only in life is their an alternative, the matter in a life form must continue to organize itself and matter around it in the remarkable and unique phenomenon of a massive local reversal of entropy it can be destroyed. Life or Death is the binary unit of value, and life is positive. This is true from every approach of reasoning that is attempted but is most clear in evolutionary thinking.\n \n Only a rational being can comprehend values fully and understand the alternative they are based on metaphysically. The values however exist for all life. Every human value is an extension of the ultimate values. You value yourself because you value your life, your life includes your virtues your achievements your pleasure. You value your judgement because is your mode of survival, you value art because it represents things you value. You value pleasure because it enhances your life.\n \n When you value others you aren't randomly assigning values, you are extending the values that exist for yourself to them based on the logical and obvious fact that those same things you value in yourself exist in others. How hard a subjectivist tries and pleads with himself that he should value everyone the same but he cannot help that he holds virtue higher than despair. That is natural virtue represents life, despair death.\n \n A full understanding of the nature of value will explain to an objectivist what they have 'felt' since they can remember, that all life is good.\n \n Imagine a desolate lifeless universe, full of action and massive cosmic forces but not a single life form. Now consider a single plant growing on some planet in this place. Almost everyone can feel that it is now a better place but very few know why.\n \n Thus, all life on earth is also valuable and it's valuable to the extent that it's death is terrible. Life is a value upon itself unconnected with how it benefits us.\n \n Do not mistake the willingness to trade a lower value for a higher as the willingness to trade one right for another. Some one may help an animal or a plant (I have done far more of the later) simply because they value their existance. That does not mean the near infinitely greater value of a human being, their needs or pleasure; or the highest value one's self cannot supersede other values.\n \n If the willingness to abandon a cent for a dollar or a seed for a tree is conflict then you are right, but that is not the word I would have chosen.\n \n \n \nYet part of the consent you spoke of about animals was that they might walk away, kick, or in some other way show their displeasure. Seemingly, indifference is consent. Yet in the hypothetical situation of an impaired person who is unable to communicate and unable to fight back or show that they are willing or not, is it morally okay to have sex with him/her?\n\n You are trying to draw analogies between conscious and unconscious beings. An animal which is indifferent is not ignorant. They know what's going on and they choose to not really give a damn. A mentally impaired person who can't communicate cannot say the same.\n \n \nPeople with full mental faculties may very well have sex only for pleasure, but they are also aware of the consequences of their actions, the diseases, injuries, etc.\n\n ohhhh, your afraid the animal will get sick from the encounter and that is a risk they don't know about.\n \n Well, tell that to the next guy who let's their dog eat off his old plate. The risk is about the same counting number of occurrences.\n \n \nMy position is that it is trickery and deception. It is taking advantage of the simplicity of the mind of an animal (or person in the case of children or the disabled). As I have said, the animal can't fully understand the consequences of its actions or always have control over its impulses.\n\n So your complaining about the instincts of the animal not being under rational control like they would be in a human. Isn't that starting off with the premise that instincts need to be under rational control or else moral sex is out the window. What about when animals have sex with each other. Why isn't it doubly immoral because you got two beings who 'can't fully understand the consequences of their actions or control their impulses' instead of one?\n \n \nHere I will claim to use the \"default position\" that an animal does not understand sexual acts. Action does not denote understanding; it can simply denote instincts. \n\n Typically learning and adaptation indicate away from insticnt and point to understanding.\n \n Most animals don't think of people a sexual beings, probably because sexual advanced are blatantly ignored by most very consistently. Once that changes however animals show the ability to adapt to the situation, they don't merely 'go through the same old moves'.\n \n You have got to consider the animals you are charging with 'pure insticnt'. A horse can follow a known trail without an inkling of instruction for hours. It knows where the food is kept in the barn, I've seen horses open doors if they are too simple. They recognize different people and behave differently towards different people. They learn riding routines and jumps that are completly unnatural to them. They know when a saddle is not on right. A dog has been found to know over a hundred English words. These animals in particular show extraordinary ability to understand to human cues and intentions, and to actively cooperate.\n \n but.... when it comes to sex, then they become zombies; unable to understand the purpose of the exercise or how to accomplish it. It doesn't follow just from their behavior in other areas but besides that they have been observed to show the same level of abstraction and intelligence for sex as for anything else.\n \n \nThat's not necessarily true either. They may rely on something in that area to survive.\n\n Yea, the hay barn and the guy who takes care of them in the winter.\n \n \nI also fail to see how this is really relevant, since giving a creature whatever they want does not mean that it is necessarily the right thing to do.\n\n Never said it did. Yet after all this I am having trouble seeing the relevancy of any of it. The scale side that is marked 'why thou shalt not' contains 'may contract disease' and not much else.\n \n So far there are more reasons to avoid sex with humans who have far more communicable diseases, far harder to get consent from, far more maintenance in the relationship. Of course there is the anvil on the other side which is 'a friend with a brain'.\n \n You have tried to stack 'just insticnt' which didn't fit for most cases but even when it did no good case was made for why 'just insticnt' was morally damaging.\n \n You tried to stack 'no consent' but you are in the process of modifying what consent means so that you can say an animal can't give it.\n \n So as far as I can see, you have been talking about 'the animal doesn't know any better', well apparently the human doesn't know any better either; but most importantly you don't know any better.\n \n \nAs I have said, they don't know any better.\n\n I tried to ask a question a while back. I said myth was full of examples where a human wound up with the body of an animal.\n \n What would a human with animal body know better that an animal in animal body wouldn't? or would sex be then OK.\n \n \nWell if clear consent could be had, it wouldn't have been much of an analogy now, would it?\n\n Maybe that's my point :)\n \n \nI don't know why you would expect this out of me.\n\n because consent means: to permit, approve, or agree; comply or yield (often followed by to or an infinitive): He consented to the proposal. We asked her permission, and she consented. \n \n and it's undeniable that animals can do that for sex with a human.\n \n \nThere's a thin line between pain and pleasure.\n\n lol, is the animal going to tax themselves to much?\n \n \nSo this means that you would see no moral difference in having sex with an animal that clearly didn't want it and having sex with one who 'initiated' it?\n\n That is correct.\n \n \nI don't really know why I am arguing this subject with someone who inherently doesn't believe that animals have, or should have any rights. \n\n Well I admit that it's hopeless without the concept but that was your decision. If you want to lay aside that fact and proceed on the premise that animals do have rights (you would have to tell me what they are) we can. I never pretended that I was considering the rights of animals if you remember though. I was lumping it in with masturbation.\n \n \nWhat difference does it make to you at all?\n\n The truth? None. I used to feel disgusted at pretty much all deviations. One by one those emotions fell. First homosexuals, then polygamy, then bestiality; last hold out was incest.\n \n What destroyed those nasty feelings was arguments like this, some of them internal of course.\n \n I have never believed in animal rights and dismissed them and the political spectres of a lot of people anthropomorphizing animals. When I was against bestiality it was on the grounds that it bespoke dangerous and sick mental patterns in the humans involved. In other words I believed the stereotypes. As far as I can tell bestiality people are no more prone to evil than homosexuals.\n \n The fact that I don't give a XXXX about animal rape shouldn't bother you too much though because bestial people give many shits. In fact they are practical nut cases about condemning it. Maybe because they feel so threatened by it but in any case it would not be common by a long shot.\n \n Do you think I should care? Well I would but only for my orginal reason, if I was worried that some kind of sicko was getting a kick out of violence and pain, but I would be worried about the sicko not the animal.\n \n \nI don't think anything graphic or nasty is necessary, and I have no interest in reading anything like that.\n\n That's the way it's headed as you are being quite unreasonable about predicting animal behavior in these situations it seems like you are going to require more than extrapolation and instead want to know exactly what they do.\n \n \nI don't think recording video of the sex is very reasonable, and would still be apt to various interpretations of body language. \n\n There is growling and moving away and scratching and clawing and biting and kicking.\n \n It can be understood, especially by experts.\n \n \nAnd would this make non-filmed animal sex illegal?\n\n Of course not, just as a substitute for asking the animal. It would only be a test if the animal is suspected of being abused. Abused animals are not nice by the way, on the contrary they are very mean.\n \n \nAnd maybe for some people body language is easy to get, but I would disagree completely that most people are like that. How many stories are there of a person petting a dog or cat and thinking that everything is peachy, and then out of nowhere they get bitten or scratched?\n\n Many, but long time owners not so much. Thank you for noting how willing these animals are to make their discomfort known.",

   "You're talking about the label 'deviant'?\n\n \n yes\n \n Actually it is, what is not always simple is mitigating circumstances that make it hard to communicate this or it may be an issue why exactly the answer is as it is.\n \n Legally No and in this context I can't imagine there being some less restrictive use of the word.\n \n Legal Dictionary\n \n Main Entry: con\u00b7sent\n Function: noun\n 1 a : compliance in or approval of what is done or proposed by another; specifically : the voluntary agreement or acquiescence by a person of age or with requisite mental capacity who is not under duress or coercion and usually who has knowledge or understanding\n \n \nNo one can know the future, all that is implied is that the person isn't being deceived and is using their judgement what ever it's quality.\n\n \n That is what I said.\n \n \nFor the animal, it encompasses sexual intercourse or pleasure.\n\n \n And when it doesn't? Surprise me with something other than then it doesn't.\n \n \nYou misunderstood then, I was not talking about consciously imitating or mimicking animal relations. That the animal is domesticated and agreed is already proof that the necessary communicative interface has been established. Dog's for instance are an extreme example of social compatibility with humans and it doesn't really matter whether the dog genome moved towards humans or it was that way by coincidence.\n \n \n See how domesticated a Dingo is. I could just as easily argue pets make the best they can of the situation. I mean really what are they going to do?\n \n \nThe point is that dogs communicate to people and people communicate to dogs and people and dogs both do this pretty much automatically. That is why it is safe to leave a dog with your kids but not a wolf.\n\n \n Certain breeds have a temperament that gives them that patience many breeds do not. Communication is trained that is why you can't tell a wolf to fetch or roll over.\n \n Notice how it is not impossible to communicate with a wolf, or any other undomesticated animal (with a social structure); but you need to actively mimic their behavior to do it. Animals experts the 'whisperers' train and study to do this.\n \n Maybe in Jungle Book, but I don't think the Dog Whisperer walking into a pack of wolves is going to accomplish much other than becoming a scooby snack.\n \n \nIt is not necessary for domesticated animals or any animal which already shows the ability to understand humans.\n\n \n Without the domestication they understand when you yell and chase them and not much else\n \n \nYea, the human.... Once again when I said 'on animals level' I was talking about their level of relations, not reorienting a persons mind to the same as an animals.\n\n \n Neither was I\n \n \nPlaying is a totally normal human behavior and no one would claim that when somebody plays with their dog in the park they are abandoning their human nature and mimicking animal behavior. They don't need to because the 'dog playing' and 'people playing' are already compatible.\n\n \n You must be all the rage at a kid's party. Here Billy get the stick go get it theres a good boy:)\n \n \nLet people know the risks, that's all you can do. Unless you want to start handing out animal condoms :p\n\n \n The idea has probably already be patented.\n \n \nThere is no needs to have sex with humans on contraception, or with humans who are biologically incapable of producing young (homosexuals and sterile people). There is no need to keep pets or play with them in the park. There is no need for porn or gay pride parades or riding horses.\n\n \n \n Thats the sweet talk that gets all the ladies. Some of us get some emotional sensation from the act as well. Oddly women seem to not find appealing the idea of being breeding stock. Who knew?\n You talk about need as if harming animals were a 'necessary evil' that should be limited as far as possible, but then you want to apply it for the most part not to harming animals but to having sexual relations with them.\n \n \nThe truth is that bestiality doesn't need to be harmful,\n \n \n Doesn't need to occur either.\n \n \ntypically isn't even in it's underground state; \n\n \n Have we asked the animals? I have yet to hear of an underground anything that was kept in better than average conditions. Almost all have been bad.\n \n \nand even when it is harmful no different from the slaughter of countless animals.\n \n \n One is sustenance and one is pleasure that can be attained via a number different methods.\n \n \nIt's all fine and good to say we need meat to survive but the truth is we also desire the best tasting meat too and we take steps to get it.\n \n \n Would you prefer your steak of burger to be full of grizzle or tough as leather? Are slaughter houses the most humane places? No but at least the effort is made to try and minimize the suffering. In a perfect would we wouldn't need to kill anything.\n \n \nHardly indicative of behavior about a necessary evil.\n\n \n You didn't say anything except since we like our food to be nutritional and palatable were some kind of hypocrite for prohibiting beastiality which animals find pleasing and are treated better than typical. Please explain this again because I know that can't be right.\n \n \nYes, as I said before and as you have mentioned here animals have no rights.\n \n It is precisely the animals lack of intelligence that makes the kind of psychological damage possible to children impossible on the complex thoughts you would need to think.\n \n \n Go to the pound and compare an abused dog to one that wasn't and tell me again how they just shake it off. It is similar to the abused child they adapt to life as best they can other than suicide which isn't an option for pets what choice do they have? The sun will rise tomorrow regardless of how any one person feels about it.\n \n \nYes they get their food from their owners and their shelter and pretty much everything that sustains them. They aren't however at risk of contemplating how vulnerable they are to their owners nor resenting their lack of freedom because of it.\n \n \n I could call that resignation. What are the possible choices?\n \n \nIf they were human their existance in practical slavery no matter how pleasant would be reason enough to react badly but they don't. \n \n\n \n Now you want them to prove they are able to grasp such concepts and that they would be important enough to revolt against their masters. To do what? To go where? Lock a wild animal in a cage and see how happy it is. Look at animals in zoos, who either die or manage to not procreate while in captivity.\n \n \nTo them they are in a pack or a herd of family or what not. The leaders of the group of very resourceful when it comes to food and shelter but aren't they supposed to be?\n\n \n The pack picked them they didn't pick the pack.\n \n \nA human child is still a human, and their level of perceptions even at very young ages are vastly greater than an animal and greater still they will become. They can feel all the social condemnation, all the guilt, they can feel they were taken advantage of; but most importantly they have the rights that made it wrong.\n\n \n \n Animals don't share all the intellectual components of emotions as we do but they still feel sadness, depression, fear, empathy, happiness and compassion. Don't penalize them for not being human.\n \n \nI like this point though, I have noted the odd perversion that people have of calling themselves 'pet parents' and treating their pet increasingly like a child. While it may fulfill that psychological role in their life the label fits no better than 'husband' or 'wife'. I think the fact that so many think of animals like children is a strong factor in the anti-bestiality emotion, to them it seems like pedophilia. They are just as nutty though as the wackos on the other side that are claiming that animals understand it all and that the consent they give is identical to a humans.\n\n \n I had a girlfriend would dress her dog up in clothes and take pictures. He had rain gear when it rained. You could just see the look of WTF on his face.\n \n \nAnimals are not human, that means not young human and not old human. Children do not have sexual relations as they are not sexually mature. Adult animals do. It is totally arbitrary anthropomorphizing to equivocate their intelligence with immature people.\n \n\n \n If the comparison is being made then there has to be some thing to compare to.\n \n \n... wait .... a second.... Are you claiming that sexual pleasure will cause people to lose self control and devolve into anarchy?\n\n \n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nWhat about sex toys then?\n\n \n Ask poet.\n \n \nAgreed, but if we all just did as we pleased whenever and however provided we violated no one's rights we would have a total utopia.\n\n \n If a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. We also wouldn't have bestiality or incest.\n \n \n \nWe have progressed since anarchy but I seriously doubt a lack of bestiality was at all a component of that progress. Ancient societies have had nothing bad to say on it, even those we consider the most civilized and advanced of their era.\n\n \n Again emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nIt's far more likely that the judeo-christian tradition is responsible for modern views on sexual deviations than civilization in general.\n\n \n I would say more than more than likely.\n \n \nAgain you appeal to what your guessing the typical situation would be... \n\n \n I thought it was a good guess.\n \n \nYou managed to list off other laws I don't agree with :p\n\n \n What is there about 12 you find tolerable :)\n \n \nUntil you are ready to argue that it is inherent and not just a possibility I don't see a point arguing.\n\n \n ok\n \n \nSuch is the well observed moral incapacitation of anyone infected with subjectivism.\n\n \n When you can tell me where morality comes from that makes sense then you can claim to be clean of infection.",

No but at least the effort is made to try and minimize the suffering.\n\n If cannibals ever capture me I'll sign a petition of thanks for the quick death.\n \n \nIn a perfect would we wouldn't need to kill anything.\n\n Then even in this perfect world where no death is necessary sex with animals could be a part because it does not need to kill the animal.\n \n \nGo to the pound and compare an abused dog to one that wasn't and tell me again how they just shake it off. It is similar to the abused child they adapt to life as best they can other than suicide which isn't an option for pets what choice do they have? The sun will rise tomorrow regardless of how any one person feels about it.\n\n I did not say they could not be traumatized I said you needed to hurt them or do something they really don't like to make that happen. General human nasty emotion is never going to transfer to them as guilt unless it's a person intentionally transmitting that to them through language they can understand.\n \n \nI could call that resignation. What are the possible choices?\n\n If they are thinking clearly enough to realize their situation and be 'resigned' to it they must certainly understand that they are also 'resigned' to following the social lead of the owner. Which implies understanding of what that lead is, a far cry from the 'pure instincts' I was just hearing about.\n \n \nNow you want them to prove they are able to grasp such concepts and that they would be important enough to revolt against their masters. To do what? To go where? Lock a wild animal in a cage and see how happy it is. Look at animals in zoos, who either die or manage to not procreate while in captivity.\n\n I see, so they are beyond realizing that they are in a 'bad place' and now they are able to predict no resistance would be useful and have thus collectively 'given up on the idea'. It is sounding more absurd as you go on.\n \n Oh by the way the animals we are talking about are doing sex volitionally, that counts as procreating unless you think they understand that there can't be babies with humans but there can be with other animals.\n \n \nThe pack picked them they didn't pick the pack.\n\n So?\n \n \nAnimals don't share all the intellectual components of emotions as we do but they still feel sadness, depression, fear, empathy, happiness and compassion. Don't penalize them for not being human.\n\n Penalizing them for not being human is exactly what you are doing by opposing bestiality. You are saying their emotions are not sufficient to warrant the term 'consent'.\n \n If you want to compare apples to apples compare sexually immature animals to sexually immature humans.\n \n Acquiring a sexual dimension is a function of biology not intelligence.\n \n \nI had a girlfriend would dress her dog up in clothes and take pictures. He had rain gear when it rained. You could just see the look of WTF on his face.\n\n I'm sure that absurd maneuver was purely a matter of necessity on the part of your girlfriend. (sarcasm)\n \n \nIf the comparison is being made then there has to be some thing to compare to.\n\n Fine compare their intelligence, not their ability to give consent. Humans mature at a different rate than animals. What is intellectually mature for a human is not so for an animal. The principle we go by is that we treat people like people even when for all we know they have the intelligence of a goat. It's their overall nature not their current status we look at. A sleeping person or a baby is hardly an object of immediate intellectual prowess but that doesn't change their nature.\n \n \nAsk poet.\n\n emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nI thought it was a good guess.\n\n It was much more reasonable when you asserted it about incest, at least the evidence backed you up then.\n \n \nWhen you can tell me where morality comes from that makes sense then you can claim to be clean of infection.\n\n I tried, remember?",

   "For instance if the category was heterosexual sex and some one was arguing against that, and they tried to narrow it down to rape because the rest was less ambiguous; they could only make conclusions about rape not heterosexual sex.\n\n \n And when I narrowed down my argument, I didn't attempt to make conclusions about the types of bestiality that I excluded. \n \n \nYou would have to define informed consent vs consent, and explain what the former must replace the later as the standard.\n\n \n Having the mental capacity to understand what they are consenting to, which I think was explained in my last post.\n \n \nHuman sexual attraction whether people like to admit it or not is pretty much preprogrammed biochemical response even if our conscious and sub-conscious minds weave an intricate web of conceptual connections around it. Nobody claims that a human couple can't consent to sex because there is 'chemistry'.\n \n So what. If you are treating all that animals do as pure insticnt no volition, then the fact that dogs can live with humans nearly seamlessly and almost so for most other domesticated animals is 'merely their instinctual grouping nature'. So is it 'taking advantage' to insert yourself into a dog or horses social structure? Just to have them around to do fun stuff (like taking walks or riding places).\n\n \n I'd say they are taking advantage of us. I mean, free food/shelter/protection is a pretty good deal.\n \n \nActually that is not always true, animals can learn to do sex in different ways\n.\n \n How? A human has to \"teach\" it before they can learn it. A horse isn't going to watch a porno and learn how to ride cowgirl.\n \n \nWhat consequences? There can be no children. Are you talking about the phrase from the bible which would have both person and animal slain?\n\n \n Why would I be referring to that? I'm referring to things like disease and injury to the animal that it has no way of understanding.\n \n \nOh and I've never heard of an animal raping a human.\n\n \n Dolphins.\n \n \nOk, I don't know many children who have made sexual advances on adults; but you really seem to be attached to that analogy.\n \n \n A child won't make sexual advances on an adult unless an adult has initiated it in the past (which would be the case in the sex slave trade). The point of the analogy is very clear. A child may agree to doing sexual acts, but taking advantage of that is immoral.\n \n \nYou mean you can't justify it. Like all other relativistic moral theory it's simply collapses under the weight of it's own contradictions. I asked why our need translated to our right and the destruction of the animals rights. You responded \"we need it, that's how it works\".\n\n \n I think \"We would die if we didn't\" is pretty decent justification. We are responsible for our own survival and well being above all else.\n \n \n \nAn intelligent analysis but hardly more through than one I could have given you. Was there something in particular that you wanted me to see?\n\n \n That a vegetarian utopia is not feasible.\n \n \nWe have made the food better on purpose.\n\n \n And we would be more righteous if we only killed terrible tasting food? What is the point of this? As humans developed larger societies, hunting for meat would have become a much more difficult task to support the society and would have likely led to starvation. Domesticating animals for the purpose of eating and using for milk, eggs, etc was necessary to support larger groups of people.\n \n \nIt's a dual point:\n \n 1. Animals don't have rights, if they did we wouldn't get to kill them regardless of our so called need.\n \n 2. It is contradictory to except the exploitation of animals on the grounds that \"it's needed\" while also excepting the exploitation of animals for pleasure when it's not needed.\n \n\n \n 1. Humans don't have rights, otherwise I wouldn't get arrested for being drunk in public. (translation: your argument is bunk. Just because we don't give all animals the right to live doesn't mean that they don't have other rights, such as not being tortured.)\n \n 2. It's \"accept,\" and what you said makes no sense. If you accept the exploitation of animals no matter what, I don't see a contradiction. This isn't my view anyway as should be obvious by now. \n \n \nTrue, but if one thing is unnecessary but accepted, it can hardly be accepted because it is necessary.\n\n \n Obvious and meaningless. \n \n \nThat list is minuscule. Do you realize how many diseases people can give to each other?\n\n \n Why does that matter?\n \n \nPlus I didn't say it was impossible, I said most animals are healthy enough.\n \n\n \n Some diseases can also be transferred to animals, and \"most animals are healthy enough\" sounds like a really solid argument by the way.\n \n \nThere are no negative effects, it is the default position because I am not going to try to prove the non-existance of negative effects. Up next is proving the non-existance of god.\n\n \n Why do you always bring up stuff like this? I'm an atheist, I don't care about the Bible and I don't care about God. How do you know there are no negative effects? Are you saying there are no cases of harm to animals that have been sexually used/abused by humans? When talking about potentially doing harm to something, ignoring that possibility is immoral.\n \n \n \nChildren are not sexual beings, they cannot give consent unless they are deceived, tricked, or pressured.\n \n\n \n And animals are not inherently sexual toward humans. Yeah, a dog might hump your leg, but that's not much different than masturbation; and even babies will play with themselves. \n \n \nJust as soon as you get consent from the comatose guy.\n\n \n This is the problem with picking everything into individual sentences (and your post was ridiculously long, which is one reason I am being brief and ignoring parts). I wasn't referring to having sex with a comatose guy. I was referring to your idea that you shouldn't have to try and \"prove a negative.\" Before people understood comas, they wouldn't have known if a comatose person had any awareness, any brain activity or anything... In many cases they might as well have been dead. Since a person could easily have held the belief or assumption that a comatose patient didn't have brain activity or that they were not going to recover or anything, they could have basically thought of the person as being no better than dead. If the person was no better than dead, that could act as justification for anything (since you can't harm a dead person). No... this would easily be seen as wrong because you don't actually know for sure whether they have awareness or brain activity or a possibility of recovery. \n \n \nAlright, if you want the idea that having sex is necessarily traumatic to an animal go ahead and find it. It's against common sense to expect it, it's against evidence as it stands, but try if you want.\n\n \n I never said that it was \"necessarily\" traumatic, but it certainly can be. \n \n \nThen you are thinking irrationally aren't you?\n\n \n ? No. You just aren't taking unnecessary risks. I don't know for sure if I will get hurt if I jump off my house, but it's not irrational for me to think it's a possibility and decide against doing so.\n \n \n \nYou can't torture a creature that doesn't feel pain can you?\n \n \n The point is that the evidence shows that fish CAN feel pain. The people who think/thought that they couldn't were wrong. If they just decided that there was no way a fish could feel pain and accepted it as fact (like you have about animals and trauma), then they would have also used the \"prove a negative\" argument to justify anything they wanted to do. \n \n And even if there wasn't pain, there may still be fear or something else. \n \n \nThey are as real as reason and science is. Constructs of our mind, yes. Subjective and unrelated to reality, no.\n \n \n Or we are pretending they have rights.\n\n \n They are constructs of our mind. Your 'rights' completely depend on where you live and what government you are under, ranging from none to a lot. As George Carlin once said \"Rights aren't rights if someone can take them away. They're privileges.\"\n \n \n \nWhy?\n\n \n We feel pain and we know that animals feel pain. Inflicting pain on them for our pleasure is simply sick. There is no use in arguing with you if you can't understand that.\n \n \nDo not mistake the willingness to trade a lower value for a higher as the willingness to trade one right for another. Some one may help an animal or a plant (I have done far more of the later) simply because they value their existance. That does not mean the near infinitely greater value of a human being, their needs or pleasure; or the highest value one's self cannot supersede other values.\n\n \n Blah. Humans are only have infinitely greater value to humans. Dogs would likely feel that dogs have the greatest value, and the same with any other animal. That's why none of them would hesitate to eat you if need be.\n \n \nYou are trying to draw analogies between conscious and unconscious beings. An animal which is indifferent is not ignorant. They know what's going on and they choose to not really give a damn. A mentally impaired person who can't communicate cannot say the same.\n \n\n \n I never said unconscious. The rest of your argument is begging the question.\n \n \nohhhh, your afraid the animal will get sick from the encounter and that is a risk they don't know about.\n \n Well, tell that to the next guy who let's their dog eat off his old plate. The risk is about the same counting number of occurrences.\n\n \n So? If a person has kids or pets, carelessly leaving out things that are dangerous to them is bad. It's not a good analogy, however. A better analogy would be knowingly feeding a pet food that may be harmful to it. \n \n \n \nSo your complaining about the instincts of the animal not being under rational control like they would be in a human. Isn't that starting off with the premise that instincts need to be under rational control or else moral sex is out the window. What about when animals have sex with each other. Why isn't it doubly immoral because you got two beings who 'can't fully understand the consequences of their actions or control their impulses' instead of one?\n\n \n Animals aren't really moral beings. They have their own social systems, but they aren't the same as humans. In the case of sex, I'm sure that rape is common in the animal kingdom, but at the same time, mutual sex between two dogs,cats, etc. doesn't involve one taking advantage or deceiving the other.\n \n \n \nTypically learning and adaptation indicate away from insticnt and point to understanding.\n \n Most animals don't think of people a sexual beings, probably because sexual advanced are blatantly ignored by most very consistently. Once that changes however animals show the ability to adapt to the situation, they don't merely 'go through the same old moves'.\n \n You have got to consider the animals you are charging with 'pure insticnt'. A horse can follow a known trail without an inkling of instruction for hours. It knows where the food is kept in the barn, I've seen horses open doors if they are too simple. They recognize different people and behave differently towards different people. They learn riding routines and jumps that are completly unnatural to them. They know when a saddle is not on right. A dog has been found to know over a hundred English words. These animals in particular show extraordinary ability to understand to human cues and intentions, and to actively cooperate.\n \n but.... when it comes to sex, then they become zombies; unable to understand the purpose of the exercise or how to accomplish it. It doesn't follow just from their behavior in other areas but besides that they have been observed to show the same level of abstraction and intelligence for sex as for anything else.\n \n \n Yea, the hay barn and the guy who takes care of them in the winter.\n \n \n Never said it did. Yet after all this I am having trouble seeing the relevancy of any of it. The scale side that is marked 'why thou shalt not' contains 'may contract disease' and not much else.\n \n So far there are more reasons to avoid sex with humans who have far more communicable diseases, far harder to get consent from, far more maintenance in the relationship. Of course there is the anvil on the other side which is 'a friend with a brain'.\n \n You have tried to stack 'just insticnt' which didn't fit for most cases but even when it did no good case was made for why 'just insticnt' was morally damaging.\n \n You tried to stack 'no consent' but you are in the process of modifying what consent means so that you can say an animal can't give it.\n \n So as far as I can see, you have been talking about 'the animal doesn't know any better', well apparently the human doesn't know any better either; but most importantly you don't know any better.\n \n\n \n In the case of a horse, the horse will have to first be broken or raised in way that they are exposed to sex at an early age (I doubt sex with a wild horse would be possible for a human). \n \n And the issue of disease and possible damage to an animal is a pretty big deal. With humans, each partner is going to be aware of the possibilities, and also has control over using protection and even seeking medical attention if he/she is hurt. Animals can do neither, and aren't capable of understanding either scenario's possibility. The issue of physical harm is of course much more relevant with smaller animals like dogs than with horses.\n \n \nI tried to ask a question a while back. I said myth was full of examples where a human wound up with the body of an animal.\n \n What would a human with animal body know better that an animal in animal body wouldn't? or would sex be then OK.\n \n\n \n Irrelevant. If it had the mind and understanding of a human there would be no issue, but it's an impossible scenario anyway.\n \n \nbecause consent means: to permit, approve, or agree; comply or yield (often followed by to or an infinitive): He consented to the proposal. We asked her permission, and she consented. \n \n and it's undeniable that animals can do that for sex with a human.\n\n \n Not in the legal sense, otherwise a child could also consent to sex. \n \n \n \nThat is correct.\n\n \n I'm not one to question someone's morals (even if they believe an animal can give consent to sex), but if you think animal rape (animal abuse) is not morally wrong, then you have issues. I said it before and didn't follow through, but I'm not wasting my time on any more of these long drawn out posts.",

The point of the analogy is very clear.

If your justification for killing and eating animals is that it is necessary what is your justification for keeping pets for pleasure?\n \n \nWhy does that matter?\n\n because the danger is not significant, it is predictable, and controllable.\n \n \nSome diseases can also be transferred to animals, and \"most animals are healthy enough\" sounds like a really solid argument by the way.\n\n Thank you, it's got the tensile strength about equal to 'you might get sick'.\n \n \nWhy do you always bring up stuff like this? I'm an atheist, I don't care about the Bible and I don't care about God.\n\n It's a well known example of people demanding that a negative be proven.\n \n \nHow do you know there are no negative effects?\n\n First off, you are talking way to general at this point. How do I know that there aren't negative psychological effects to consensual sex between a human and an animal?\n \n There's no sign of them.\n \n \nAre you saying there are no cases of harm to animals that have been sexually used/abused by humans?\n\n I am saying that you need to hurt an animal before it registers an offense. They couldn't possibly care about metaphysical contemplations about equality or natural relations.\n \n \nAnd animals are not inherently sexual toward humans.

If they just decided that there was no way a fish could feel pain and accepted it as fact (like you have about animals and trauma), then they would have also used the \"prove a negative\" argument to justify anything they wanted to do.\n \n I have never said animals can't be traumatized. If evidence shows that a fish can feel pain, then you have a reason to believe so don't you?\n \n \nAnd even if there wasn't pain, there may still be fear or something else. \n\n I wonder if a horse is afraid when they go through the breaking process (being taught sometimes not too gently how to be ridden)?\n \n \nThey are constructs of our mind. Your 'rights' completely depend on where you live and what government you are under, ranging from none to a lot. As George Carlin once said \"Rights aren't rights if someone can take them away. They're privileges.\"\n\n They are absolute, objective, and inalienable. If you want to argue with me about this could you please start up in the formal open debate about the ideal society.\n \n \nWe feel pain and we know that animals feel pain. Inflicting pain on them for our pleasure is simply sick. There is no use in arguing with you if you can't understand that.\n\n Appealing to emotion isn't going to cut it with me no, if you can't make a case without going \"that is just sick\" then there is no point. I will catalog it with all the times homosexuals get called perverts and psychos.\n \n \nDogs would likely feel that dogs have the greatest value, and the same with any other animal.\n\n If they could.\n \n \nSo? If a person has kids or pets, carelessly leaving out things that are dangerous to them is bad. It's not a good analogy, however. A better analogy would be knowingly feeding a pet food that may be harmful to it.\n \n Sex is not necessarily harmful.

In the case of sex, I'm sure that rape is common in the animal kingdom, but at the same time, mutual sex between two dogs,cats, etc. doesn't involve one taking advantage or deceiving the other.\n\n Why must a human deceive an animal to have sex with them? I agreed that a human is taking advantage of an animal if they have sex with them but as you pointed out that doesn't mean animals aren't taking advantage of humans at the same time. Mutual advantage is considered more ideal than singular advantage which is considered more ideal than disadvantage.\n \n \nIn the case of a horse, the horse will have to first be broken or raised in way that they are exposed to sex at an early age (I doubt sex with a wild horse would be possible for a human). \n\n Are you saying that a horse has to be exposed to sex at a young age or they can't understand it?\n \n \nAnd the issue of disease and possible damage to an animal is a pretty big deal.

Animals can do neither, and aren't capable of understanding either scenario's possibility. The issue of physical harm is of course much more relevant with smaller animals like dogs than with horses.\n\n There is danger to horses in horse breeding. It is the owners responsibility to seek medical attention for their animals if they are hurt no matter how they became hurt. Animals hurt themselves sometimes, shall we lock them up in a padded cell?\n \n Humans don't always understand risks either. Oh and you have definitely not made the disease case.\n \n \nIrrelevant. If it had the mind and understanding of a human there would be no issue, but it's an impossible scenario anyway.\n\n Hold on I'm not done with it yet. You assumed I was talking about sex with a human. What if the human in animal body went to go have sex with another animal?\n \n Would it then be immoral because the human would have better knowledge about the risks?\n \n \nNot in the legal sense, otherwise a child could also consent to sex. \n\n Can a horse consent to being ridden?\n \n \nI'm not one to question someone's morals (even if they believe an animal can give consent to sex), but if you think animal rape (animal abuse) is not morally wrong, then you have issues.\n\n I believe sigma has already called me a sociopath because I said emotion is a derivative of reason. Perhaps you could throw your resources together and get me psychological help? :p\n \n \nI said it before and didn't follow through, but I'm not wasting my time on any more of these long drawn out posts.\n\n If you can walk up to a cow and chop of it's head and feel just fine but if you notice the guy next to you is cutting steak out directly thereby extending the animals death by five minutes and throw them in prison, you have issues about rationality.",

   "I would like to discuss/argue the matter of the principle of morally judging sexual behavior. The most common phrase one might here with the defense of the modern deviations of bi-sexual and homosexual is 'two consenting adults'.\n \n This implies that the standard is consent of the people involved.\n \n I am not interested in so much if people think that is a valid standard, I know it is (that doesn't mean you can't challenge it in this thread). I am more interested in a complete application of that standard.\n \n I have noted that those who defend homosexuality tend to react very badly to comparing it to anything but heterosexuality. I do not care to comment on why I think this is so in my opening post but let me say I think they can be compared on several common properties. The most important one being 'are all people involved consenting adults' as mentioned above. There are two more I am comparing, how many adults are involved and are children possible.\n \n In Heterosexuality, Homosexuality, Bestiality, Polygamy, and Incest it is possible for all people involved to be consenting adults.\n \n In Heterosexuality, Homosexuality, Bestiality, Polygamy, and Incest can manifest in pedophilia but is not an essential component of any.\n \n In Incest, Heterosexuality, and Homosexuality there can be the famous 'two consenting adults'\n \n In Bestiality there is one consenting adult, making it the second resident of this category along with masturbation.\n \n In Polygamy there are more than two consenting adults.\n \n In Homosexuality and Bestiality there can be no children.\n \n If I were to make a chart...\n \n Incest can be heterosexual or homo-sexual, I would place it in between them then.\n \n Bestiality is closer to homo-sexuality because no children are possible so it would go on the homo side.\n \n Polygamy spans all.\n \n My chart would look like this:\n \n Heterosexual - Incest - Homosexual - Bestiality\n [--------------------Polygamy---------------]\n\n \n My comment is who cares what consenting adults do as long as it is consenting. \n \n If you want to have orgies every night with hundreds of people involved then it is none of my business. If I to try and stop you legally then I am the one who would be the one who interferes with your freedom and personal liberty. Only busybody religious good for nothings try and stop others from expression their sexual freedom. \n \n I posted the below proposed constitutional amendment on this forum years ago being that I consider it a necessary to stop christianists from interfering with our liberty and personal freedom.\n \n I would sorely love to see the below added to the US constitution.\n \n \n \n Proposed constitutional amendment\n The privacy amendment,\n \n \n Section 1\n The people's right to privacy shall not be infringed upon, whether in the privacy of their homes, work environment, personal effects, papers, or electronic transfers or writings of any kind. Congress, the states, or local authority, whether public or private, shall make no law infringing or abridging the people's right to privacy.\n \n Section 2\n The people have the right to sexual freedom between consenting adults of either sex. The people have the right to have sexual intercourse of any kind between consenting adults of either sex.\n No state, congress, or local authority shall make any law infringing or abridging the people's right to sexual relations between consenting adults of either sex.\n \n Section3\n The people have the right to control their own bodies and make choices about organs, their own deaths, and anything within the confines of the body. Congress, the states, and local authorities shall make no law infringing or abridging the people's right to control their own bodies.",
