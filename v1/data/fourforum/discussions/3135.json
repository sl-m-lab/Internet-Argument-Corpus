It was blocked by Republicans who preferred to pass dividend tax cuts and upper income tax rate reductions. [S1054, 5/15/2003, #149] \n \n Bush and Republicans BLOCKED repeal to preserve cuts for the wealthy. The 1993 increase on the wealthiest beneficiaries was successful in extending the solvency of Medicare and eliminating the deficit. Democratic efforts to REPEAL the 1993 Social Security tax last year increase were thwarted by Republicans who were bent on enacting George Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy.\n \n \n LIE\n Narrator: \"He supported a 50 cent a gallon gas tax increase.\"\n \n Kerry Never Sponsored or Voted for a 50 cent Gas Tax. Sen. Charles Robb introduced legislation in 1993 that phased in a 50-cent increase. John Kerry did not vote for or co-sponsor this bill. [S. 1068, Introduced 5/28/93] \n \n Kerry actually voted for a LOWER Gas Tax & to Keep Medicare from Getting Cut. A third vote was actually for a LOWER gas tax. The tax that was in the bill was 9 cents per gallon. John Kerry voted for an amendment that would have replaced that with a 6 cent per gallon gas tax. And once other provisions of the bill were calculated in, it would have only been a 3.5 cent increase.
