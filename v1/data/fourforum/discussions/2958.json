   "Say what you will, but I'd like to link to a couple of videos.\n \n The first is of Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice basically saying that it's silly to think that Iraq was capable of threatening anyone. It was from 2001. But I'm sure Saddam had built up his massive weapons programs to threaten us in the span of a year (Remember 2002 was when Bush started the WMD scare.) Sorry about the narration, I wish they had just left the raw video.\n \n http://www.bi30archive.org/extras/Powell-Rice-Iraq_no_threat.asx\n http://100777.com/node/view/589\n http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,7350504%5E2,00.html\n \n \n Then, here is video of Norman Schwartzkopf explaining why it is a bad idea to occupy Iraq. Of course this is video from well before GWII. http://www.bushflash.com/wmf/Schwartzkopf.WMV Just threw this in for the kids.\n \n So why would Colin Powell say one thing in 2/2001 and then say the complete opposite before the UN in 2/2003? Are the Iraqis that good at producing weapons and delivery systems so quickly? I like that the title at the top is \"Denial and Deception.\" How fitting. http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030205-1.html\n \n Here is some more \"propaganda\" but you won't like it since it's filled with those pesky facts.\n http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&b=40520\n \n A letter from Rep. Henry Waxman to Condoleeza Rice.\n http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs_108/pdf_inves/pdf_admin_iraq_nuclear_evidence_june_10_let.pdf\n That guy must have been programmed by Michael Moore!\n \n Poor George Tenet: http://www.npr.org/display_pages/features/feature_1335540.html\n \n The Bulter Report on British Intellegence: http://www.npr.org/documents/2004/iraq/britain_butler_report.pdf \n Of course I haven't read all 216 pages.\n \n http://www.worldrevolution.org/article/732\n http://www.prioritypeace.org/ (can't download the report)\n http://www.prioritypeace.org/education.html (but this is ok)\n \n A USA Today article by Rice defending herself: http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2004-07-15-oppose_x.htm\n \n Again I ask why these two were saying one thing before 9/11 and the complete opposite after?",

   "You DID notice the December 2001 date on that Iraq report, right? Like I said, there was a different tune being sung about Iraq after 9/11, a tune quite opposite to the one being sung before 9/11.\n \n So Colin Powell, our Secretary of State, and Condoleeza Rice, our National Security Advisor were THAT wrong? They are that incompetent?\n \n From the intro to the report: \"Iraq poses an extremely serious threat to the United States and to U.S. allies not only because of its continued possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), but also the increased likelihood that it will use such weapons in any future military conflict.\"\n \n So in one year they went from no threat to major threat and one year constitutes \"continued\" possession of WMDs? I'm sorry, not one year. July to December is 7 months.\n \n Did Rice ever answer those questions that were asked by the Congressman and friends? So the British are standing by evidence that others are calling total garbage? that they were forged documents?\n \n From the letter:\"Your claims are, however, directly contradicted by other evidence. Contrary to your assertion, senior Administration officials had serious doubts about the forged evidence well before the President's state of the union address. For example, Greg Thielmann, Director of the Office of Strategic, Proliferation, and Military Issues in the State Department, told Newsweek last week that the State Department's Bureau of Intellegence and Research (INR) had concluded the docements were \"garbage.\"4 As you surely know, INR is part of what you call \"the intellegence community.\" It is headed by an Assistant Secretary of State, Carl Ford; it reports directly to the Secratary of State; and it was a full participant in the debate over Iraq's nuclear capabilities. According to Newsweek:\n \n \"When I saw that, it really blew me away,\" Thielmann told Newsweek. Thielmann knew about the source of the allegation. the CIA had come up with some documents purporting to show Saddam had attempted to but up to 500 tons of uranium oxide from the African country of Niger. INR had concluded that the purchases were implausible - and made that point clear to Powell's office. As Thielmann read that the president had relied on these documents to report to he nation, he thought, \"Not that stupid piece of garbage. My thought was, how did that get into the speech?\"\" page 2",

   "Well, I'm glad to see so many standing by their beliefs, as flawed as they may be. Old Saddam Hussein was standing by his beliefs too, if those beliefs are these as outlined in that report you gave us:\n \n \"...the ongoing daily aggression in the unlawful no-flight zones; the maintenance of the comprehensive sanctions that have taken the lives of nearly 2 million Iraqis, most of them children and women; and the use of depleted uranium, which constitutes the crime of the epoch and 'moral barbarism' in its most manifest form. This is to say nothing of the American moral barbarism that found expression in the use of nuclear weapons against Japanese civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the use of chemical weapons against the people of Viet Nam and biological weapons against the people of Cuba and in other crimes in all parts of the world.27\"\n \n This sounds pretty accurate to me. Saddam Hussein really felt threatened by the continued use of American WMDs, biological weapons, etc. Sure, he should have sold one of his palaces to feed the hungry under UN sanctions, but who would buy it? :) The next paragraph says it was all a misperception:\n \n \"While this quote could be dismissed as simple propaganda, it actually reflects a genuine perception that the United States undertakes actions that are both illegal and immoral. The United States is above using no tactic, regardless of how vile. The importance of this perspective is how it relates to the potential for Iraq's using WMD. In Iraq's view, if it were to respond to U.S. aggression with WMD, it would be doing nothing that the United States had not already done to its other victims.\"\n \n Is it just a perception? Of course, the United States has most definitely undertaken actions that are both immoral and illegal. You can call bombing personnel with napalm as immoral (actually bombing anyone is immoral in my book,but..) since that's what the Geneva Conventions call it. And that's just another example. HERE\n But, when have we EVER followed the unenforceable Geneva Conventions ?\n \n So maybe you are right. Maybe Saddam Hussein was getting tired of being under the thumb of the US and UN, since his country was kept quite crippled by it and decided to stop taking it lying down. He could have done this two ways. He could have impeded every action of the UN and US trying to control him, basically being defiant and stubborn, the result of which we see today. Or, he could have launched an attack using WMDs that would surely result in his defeat and the occupation of Iraq. I guess it was a no-win situation.\n \n So, you think that it's possible that within the span of 5 months, between the time that Rice was saying that Iraq posed no threat at all and the publication of that report (if it were researched and written very quickly but we wouldn't want to do anything sloppily would we?) that they were able to develop a sophisticated WMD program that is capable of threateneing the US, its allies and Iraq's neighbors?\n \n And you say that Powell and Rice are not bumbling XXXXXX. I would say the same thing. That leaves us with two options. Either they were lying before 9/11 or Bush/Blair were lying after 9/11.",

The US did not say, \"Well, let's kill a bunch of civilians.\"\n\n What the hell did you think they were trying to do by dropping atomic bombs on cities? There was a military objective, to accomplish that the US said, \"Well, lets kill a bunch of civilians.\" Exactly that. Japan was not going to surrender, ever. They had to wipe out a city or two so that the emperor was convinced that if he did not surrender, the entire country would be destroyed.\n \n \nThe use of those two bombs saved a lot more people than it killed.\n\n Probably, but let's not stray into arguing whether we should have used nukes in WWII. I am not saying that we should not have done it. But this is all beside the point.\n \n \nNumerous Iraqi deaths occurred as a result of Saddam's crooked dealings regarding the Oil for Food program.

They were a bad idea in the first place. Alternate solutions? I think Colin Powell was talking at one point about \"smart sanctions,\" as in limiting access to only those things that could be used militarily. Food and medical supplies should bever be limited. That was a huge mistake.\n \n Anyway, I wasn't trying to defend Saddam Hussein. \n I was merely pointing out that he was standing by his beliefs. \n Isn't that something you look up to in W? \n Isn't that what the British were doing when they stood behind their documents?\n \n \n \n \nSo, are you finally admitting that he had them?\n\n Hell, no. Or, he didn't have them when the hawks said he did. I was merely showing Saddam's options. He had none. Even if he really did have WMDs, which we have no trace of, he wouldn't be able to use them, or he would use them to his own demise. Saddam was in a no-win situation. The US was determined to colonize Iraq.\n \n As far as whether he had WMDs in 2001, I'll just believe Powell and Rice (believe Rice, I can't believe I said that). That's the whole problem with this. Whether Saddam had to be deposed is one story. In the end, I don't think you'd find an informed person that beleives that Iraq and American interests wouldn't benefit by the removal of Saddam. It was HOW it was done that is so atrocious. The administration felt that they needed to lie and dupe congress and the american people that Saddam was an immenent threat, which he was not. They follow that up by sending in too few troops, chaos broke out, and there wasn't much we could do about it. Now we are dealing with a constant insurgence that will not give up until we are out. We can keep killing them, but they will keep coming.\n \n \nThey could have been ill-informed.\n\n Give me a break.\n \n So they were ill informed pre 9/11 and Rummy/Wolfy/W weren't, post 9/11? O wait that's only what they are saying NOW.",
