   "Once i am in hell can i repent my sins and go to heaven?\n \n When i asked the question of \"would a good man go to hell if he did not accept god\" \n \n the answer by a few christians was that yes you would, becuase you made the decision not to go to heven by not accepting god.\n \n But even a christian must admit that its not exactly clear cut wether god exists or not. I mean that most people that do not accept god, do not accept him becuase they dont think he exists, and im sure if they were brought up in heaven and saw for himself that it was true that they would beleve. \n \n The same goes for a good person who doesent beleve in god and then goes to hell becuase of it. when there in hell they realize that they were wrong and im sure would now beleve in god. so now you have a good person in hell that beleves in god... would he not now go to heaven?\n \n furthermore would a native american or any1 else that had never heard of god before go to hell? even if he was a good person?",

Meaning the ones who never learn of God will not be punished.\n I can't give a Bible verse for that, but I am sure someone will soon.",
