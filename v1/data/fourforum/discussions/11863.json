   "AIG used billions from Fed but hasn't said for what\n By Mary Williams Walsh\n Published: October 30, 2008\n The American International Group is rapidly running through $123 billion in emergency lending provided by the Federal Reserve, raising questions about how a company claiming to be solvent in September could have developed such a big hole by October. Some analysts say at least part of the shortfall must have been there all along, hidden by irregular accounting.\n \n \"You don't just suddenly lose $120 billion overnight,\" said Donn Vickrey of Gradient Analytics, an independent securities research firm in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n \n Vickrey says he believes AIG must have already accumulated tens of billions of dollars worth of losses by mid-September, when it came close to collapse and received an $85 billion emergency line of credit by the Fed. That loan was later supplemented by a $38 billion lending facility.\n\n AIG used billions from Fed but hasn&#039;t said for what - International Herald Tribune\n \n Don't Republicans ever get tired of stealing my tax dollar?",
