   "Agreed and I would be fine with this no marriage for anyone. However marriage does exisist as a legal institution and I am being unfairly excluded from it because of someone elses bigoted religious beliefs.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but it seems like both sides make this to be way to big a deal. For gays, is there really that much of a difference between a civil union and a marriage (as long as there are exactly the same legal rights, otherwise I am completely against it)? Sure the word is different, but who really cares? You can tell everyone you're married, you can call your partner your wife/husband. The only difference is the name of it.\n \n And people who oppose gay marriage, what's the difference between giving equal rights through a civil union and marriage? Will there really be any effect on your marriage if gay people get married? It's a word, and it's people that you don't even have to talk to. Does it really make that much of difference?\n \n \n As long as they are given the same rights, I really don't care what you call it. Both sides make way too much of a big deal about it, as a diversion from everything else happening. It seems most people give about as much weight to gay marriage stance as they do for a war, or medicare. I understand abortion, some think it's mass murder, but gay marriage doesn't have that much of an impact on the country (again, assuming all rights are given). A war is causing lots of death, soldiers and civilians, and preventing rape and torture. Medicare is a pretty big problem yet many people are more worried about where a candidate stands on the issue of gay marriage than how they're going to deal with reforming medicare, or fighting this war. Whatever your political views, these things are important. The problem is this is what actually takes work and brains. It's easy to give your view on gay marriage and claim it's a big issue. It's a lot harder to wage a war or solve a problem.",

Any power not specifically given to the federal government is reserved for the States and the people. The government is not given the authority to ban abortion or drugs.
