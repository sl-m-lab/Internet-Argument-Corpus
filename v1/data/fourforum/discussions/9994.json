   "How does evolution happen when mutations do not and can not create new body parts? Evolutionists need a mechanism of random change that links new body parts to a vehicle of inheritance. But they don't have it.\n \n Let's take for example the hypothetical evolution of a millipede. Evolutionists say that this creature evolved from a primitive worm. However, a worm has no legs. Thus, some sort of mechanism would have to come along to create all these legs. But mutations don't add new body parts, and that's because mere changes in matter cannot add the information needed to create them. What's needed to add new body parts is an entirely new/different developmental pathway -- but mutations don't create those either, they only make them defective, resulting in defects, duplications and disease.\n \n And it's not just millipedes evolving from worms. Evolutionists say snails spiders, lobsters and squids also evolved from a worm. But these other creatures have antennaes, gills, glands that emit poison, compound eyes, etc and many more structures that worms don't have. Not only that but even if a worm were to create one of these body parts, it would not turn them into a completely different creature (A millipeded is not a mere worm with legs.); it would simply create a worm who posesses that particular trait. \n \n And it's the same the world over. There are millions of new parts for evolutionists to account for. Another example is the bat's sonar system. Assuming that the earth's most primitive organism (some sort of bacteria-like creature) did not have sonar capabilities, at some point this capability had to evolve by way of the evolution of new physical hardware. But how? (Of course, this says nothing of the reality that other bats would have to be able to receive and interpret this new sonar-producing capability, which would also require the evolution of new hardware....randomly, of course.)\n \n So how does the evolution of new body parts happen? -- and yes -- since this is science -- I would like some scientific evidence, including some examples of mutations that create new parts.\n \n Without a mechanism for the production of new body parts, we can assume that an organism that contains entirely new or different parts cannot be evolved from another organism that lacks them.",

There is no creation involved although you keep looking for it. But mutations do produce new chemical structures (and chemical structures ARE physical structures!). For example a point mutaion of A to T due to a copy error or a chemical mutaion or an inversion or a number of other factors results in a NEW physical structure namely a sequence of DNA which is different than its predecessor. Such structures are active not passive and the subsequent chain of causation can and does produce \"new\" physical structures given sufficient numbers of mutations accumulated over time.

We have compared Hox and other homebox genes between vertebrates and their closest living relatives, Amphioxus. The results suggest that after evolutionary divergence of these two lineages, homeobox and other genes were duplicated in the lineage leading to vertebrates, but that Amphioxus retained the archetypal homeobox gene organisation. We suggest that prior to vertebrate origins there was an intense phase of gene duplication, followed by recruitment of new developmental control genes to new roles.

However, recent evidence has shown that Hox gene clusters are fragmented, reduced, or expanded in many animals-findings that correlate with interesting morphological changes in evolution.

The evolutionary success of Bilateria is credited partly to the origin of bilateral symmetry. Although animals of the phylum Cnidaria are not within the Bilateria, some representatives, such as the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, exhibit bilateral symmetry. We show that Nematostella uses homologous genes to achieve bilateral symmetry: Multiple Hox genes are expressed in a staggered fashion along its primary body axis, and the transforming growth factor-\u00df gene decapentaplegic (dpp) is expressed in an asymmetric fashion about its secondary body axis. These data suggest that bilateral symmetry arose before the evolutionary split of Cnidaria and Bilateria.\n \n Originally published in Science Express on 1 June 2006\n Science 7 July 2006:\n Vol. 313. no. 5783, pp. 63 - 68\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1128650\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Research Articles\n Hox Control of Organ Size by Regulation of Morphogen Production and Mobility\n Michael A. Crickmore1 and Richard S. Mann2*\n \n Selector genes modify developmental pathways to sculpt animal body parts. Although body parts differ in size, the ways in which selector genes create size differences are unknown. We have studied how the Drosophila Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) limits the size of the haltere, which, by the end of larval development, has ~fivefold fewer cells than the wing. We find that Ubx controls haltere size by restricting both the transcription and the mobility of the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Ubx restricts Dpp's distribution in the haltere by increasing the amounts of the Dpp receptor, thickveins. Because morphogens control tissue growth in many contexts, these findings provide a potentially general mechanism for how selector genes modify organ sizes.\n \n \n =======================\n \n Just a few abstracts from Science about HOX, their functions and their own evolution.",

You are wrong.\n\n \n http://www.mattox.com/genome/QA-1.html\n \n oh?\n \n By whatever means, if evolution of new genes has to be achieved by tinkering with randomly duplicated genes by random mutations within the duplicated genes, on statistical basis we should see many, many more duplicated genes undergoing such evolution than we see today in the genomes of living organisms. Again, if sequences are being overwritten, the inability of incipient genes (a partially new gene in the process of formation of a fully new gene) being selected would show that it is extremely improbable to evolve new genes if unselected genes are being overwritten. Under such circumstances, it is simply improbable to evolve a new gene by tinkering with a duplicated gene within the short time-frame in which the distinct organisms are said to have evolved. \n \n The reality is that the set of genes of any organism is essentially constant. A genome is changed by the many types of mutations including point mutation and gene-duplication, but only to change the intergenic junk sequences and introns to a great extent. Even the protein coding exons can mutate up to about 90% without changing the structure or the function of the proteins they encode (due to the high tolerance of every protein to amino acid sequence variation) -- all without evolving new genes or new organisms. This physical genetic-flux -- occurring independently in distinct, independently originated organisms -- is mistakenly cited as the molecular mechanism of evolution, but the evidence simply does not support that conclusion. These genetic changes are the cause for the normal \"individual variations\" in the population of an organism.

   "Ok nutballs....\n \n I've asked you guys for any evidence that mutations can create a new, functional body part. I was given no such evidence. Mutations may be able to inflict harm on an organism, resulting in defects such as a duplication of an already-existing body part or a rearrangement of an already-existing body part such as a leg sticking out of the head of a fly, but as far as generating new morphological characters the well is bone dry.\n \n check out the following quote from Biochemist Ernst Chain, who shared a Nobel Prize for his work on Penicillin:\n \n To postulate, as the positivists of the end of the last century and their followers here have done, that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely (his emphasis) a consequence of chance mutations, or even that nature carries out experiments by trial and error through mutations in order to create living systems better fitted to survive, seems to me a hypothesis based on non evidence and irreconcilable with the facts....These classical evolutionary theories are a gross oversimplification of an immensely complex and intricate mass of facts, and it amazes me that they were swallowed so uncritically and readily, and for such a long time by so many scientists without a murmur of protest.\n \n So my question is this: I don't know if anything could convince you that mutations do not perform as advertised -- that they do not create new, beneficial body parts such as limbs, organs or any other tissues -- but if something could convince you of this, how would you, how could you, continue to cling to your theory without them? How could you still possibly believe in common descent without mutations and without a mechanism to create new body parts? \n \n ToE was based on the premise of natural selection culling random mutations. Without random mutations to cull, natural selection has no materialistic mechanism of heredity to select. Therefore what you'd be left with is nonrandom variation plus nonrandom natural selection....and there's nothing random or materialistic about that.\n \n So to repeat my question: could you still believe in common descent without random mutations in the mix? If so, how?.....please explain how common descent could happen without them....\n \n And just in case you doubt the importance of mutations to ToE, check this out from Futuyma:\n \n http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/futuyma.html\n \n There cannot be evolution without genetic variation in the first place. So there must be mutation and often recombination to generate the different genotypes or the different versions of the genes, known as alleles, which then may or may not make a difference in the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce. You can't have any evolutionary change whatever without mutation, and perhaps recombination, giving rise to genetic variation\n \n Lynn Margulis:\n \n \n The major difference between our view and the standard neodarwinist doctrine today concerns the importance of random mutation in evolution. We believe random mutation is wildly overemphasized as a source of hereditary variation....Many ways to induce mutation are known but none lead to new organisms. Mutation accumulation does not lead to new species or even to new organs or new tissues. Acquiring Genomes. Pg. 15\n \n \n The neodarwinists' inventive literature and valiant attempts to unite the genetic stability in the unblended mixture of Gregor Mendel's factors to the gradual evolutionary change promoted by Darwin's natural selection were as brilliant as they were incorrect. Pg. 201\n \n by the way, I'm having to work alot lately so if I don't get back quickly, just hang tight and be patient.",

How could you still possibly believe in common descent without mutations and without a mechanism to create new body parts? \n The question is moot since mutations can and do occurr and since morphology is changed when they do so. All thats necessary is to change morphology over billiions of years. Doing so generates ultimately modifications which appear to be \"new\". Flagella from secretory mechanisms, Proteins greatly changed in shape from their starting points, formation of simple photosensors from pigmented cells, and subsequent modification of same into various forms of eyes - including our own, transformation of fins to limbs, transformation of earlier structures to fins, formation of those earlier structures from sheets of cells, etc etc etc. Frankly your idea of \"new\" body parts meaning de novo from no precursors is absurd. There are no \"new\" body parts all arose ultimately by modification via heritable variations. I would challenge you to name a \"new\" body part and we can start from there.

For most diploid species it all starts as a fertilized egg or its equivalent which subsequently divides, folds up in various ways and grows differentially to produce the \"body part s\" its a morphing into the final form (thus morphology). The parts are produced during this process and the sequencing and specifics are the controlling facttors of what one ends up with be it a frog, a mouse, or a man. The details and dynamics are largely determined by the specific genome along with all its integral control elements and master switches. Alter that system by mutation and potentially the body parts which result are also altered. Add a new component by duplication and suAbsequent mutation and you get a different result yet again. In a very real sense there are no \"body parts\" only elaborations of structure generated by the geneome during development. The so called developmental program. And that program is mutable.",

This would mean that over time, animals with jaws will acquire beaks.\n \n This doesn't explain birds.
