   "MANIFESTO: Together facing the `new totalitarianism'\n Mar. 2, 2006. 01:00 AM\n After having overcome fascism, Nazism, and Stalinism, the world now faces a new totalitarian global threat: Islamism. \n \n We, writers, journalists, intellectuals, call for resistance to religious totalitarianism and for the promotion of freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all. \n \n The recent events, which occurred after the publication of drawings of Muhammad in European newspapers, have revealed the necessity of the struggle for these universal values. This struggle will not be won by arms, but in the ideological field. It is not a clash of civilizations or an antagonism of West and East that we are witnessing, but a global struggle that confronts democrats and theocrats. \n \n Like all totalitarianisms, Islamism is nurtured by fears and frustrations. The hate preachers bet on these feelings in order to form battalions destined to impose a liberticidal and unegalitarian world. \n \n But we clearly and firmly state: nothing, not even despair, justifies the choice of obscurantism, totalitarianism and hatred. Islamism is a reactionary ideology which kills equality, freedom and secularism wherever it is present. Its success can only lead to a world of domination: man's domination of woman, the Islamists' domination of all the others. To counter this, we must assure universal rights to oppressed or discriminated people. \n \n We reject \"cultural relativism,\" which consists of accepting that men and women of Muslim culture should be deprived of the right to equality, freedom and secular values in the name of respect for cultures and traditions. We refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of \"Islamophobia,\" an unfortunate concept which confuses criticism of Islam as a religion with stigmatization of its believers. \n \n We plead for the universality of freedom of expression, so that a critical spirit may be exercised on all continents, against all abuses and all dogmas. \n \n We appeal to democrats and free spirits of all countries that our century should be one of enlightenment, not of obscurantism.\n \n Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Chahla Chafiq, Caroline Fourest, Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, Irshad Manji, Mehdi Mozaffari, Maryam Namazie, Taslima Nasreen, Salman Rushdie, Antoine Sfeir, Philippe Val, Ibn Warraq",

If you want to see if something is a real word the dictionary is a better bet.\nMy Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary, Third Edition, often fails to yield results on many words I need to know about and I am compelled to refer to specialized dictionaries. For example, the specific definition of a word commonly used in 17th century England was not available, although I could reference it to a word in the Oxford which has been rendered invisible in American dictionaries. One truly needs several dictionaries and access to the internet to truly find out what a word means--and to particularize the context of that word.\n \n Good Gad!
