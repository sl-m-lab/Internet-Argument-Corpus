   "Does anyone have an opinion on minors' rights? I had to do an essay on it. Someone please respond.\n \n President Essay\n \n The job of President, the highest public office in the land, has long \n been held in high regard. Over time, many people have held this great \n office. And many different types of people have been restricted from voting \n for their person of choice for President. Women and people of color have \n both gained their right to vote. Now, only one group of people is restricted \n from voting, minors'. If elected President minors would be my main focus. \n I hope Presidential candidates take up minors' as an issue for the 2008 \n Presidential election race.\n \n If I were to be elected President, minors' rights would be at the top of my agenda. Minors' rights include lowering the voting age, funding \n research on the crash rate of different ages, eliminating age as a deciding \n factor in the Presidential race, public education and general rights. Now to \n elaborate on lowering the voting age. I would attempt to get legislation \n passed to lower the voting age to allow all legal citizens the right to vote. \n Though there would be special rules regarding minors. They would have to \n register without any parental help. They would have the opportunity to vote, but only if they utilized it.\n \n The next part of my \"Minors Deal\" would be to fund research for a \n study on the car crash rates of different ages. Eight to twenty-one year olds would be involved in the study. It would provide data that might convince state General Assemblies to lower their driving ages. If the data was convincing enough, I might even be able to get Congress to pass a law \n restricting the driving age from being above a set age. It all depends on the \n data that the research reveals. It could lower the driving age to twelve or \n raise it to twenty-one, we just don't know until we complete the study.\n \n The third part of my \"Minors Deal\" would be to put an amendment to The Constitution on the ballot to get rid of age as a deciding factor in \n whether a citizen could become President. The amendment would also have\n to change the wording in The Constitution so that as long as you have lived \n in The United States for all or most of your life and you've met the other \n requirements you could become President. It would be the tipping point for \n minors' rights. After that, I would try to get a similar amendment passed so \n that citizens under the current age restriction could become \n Congresspersons' or Senators'.\n \n Public education is in a terrible state, most likely the worst it has ever been. This is mainly because it has been introduced to several aspects of our culture we wish were non-existent. These include drugs, gangs, extreme fashion, leaving the basic educational purpose, money, non-school \n electronics' and general aspects of the twenty-first century. The list could \n go on and on but I will focus on the first three.\n \n First, I will discuss drugs in the school setting. Drugs have been \n around for a hundred years, but they just made their big entrance in to public \n schools in the mid-1990's. It is true that the problem has decreased, but \n there is no denying that it isn't there. Even with drug prevention programs \n like D.A.R.E., there is still the presence of drugs in public schools. \n Anonymous test results state that 37.5% of twelfth graders do drugs across \n The United States (from reports fro the 06-07 school year*). It has also \n stated that the trend has gone down but it is now stabilizing in twelfth and \n Eleventh graders across The United States. If I were President, I would meet with kids across the country in all grades as a part of the D.A.R.E. program. I would also increase funds for D.A.R.E. and other programs like it.\n (*Based on fda.gov statistics) \n \n Second, I will discuss gangs in the school setting. Gangs have been around sine The Mafia came from Italy to New York over seventy years ago. Since then, gangs have expanded over the entire country. They are well situated in large city's public schools like Los Angeles. Several different \n methods including uniforms and strict punishments are currently used to \n hamper gang activity in schools. If I were to become President, I would \n require police officers in all public middle and high schools with police \n departments that can mange it. Departments' that can't, can apply for \n federal money to help with the burden.\n \n \n Lastly, I will discuss extreme fashion in the school setting. Extreme \n fashion, though not known by this name, has completely over taken most if \n not all public middle and high schools. Clothing that is too short, too baggy \n or that would violate the simplest dress code all fall into this category. As \n President I would request the Department of Education to create a basic \n dress code and get Congress to pass a law requiring that all schools have at \n least a basic dress code policy or some sort of consequence(s) will follow. \n I am strongly anti-uniform and pro-dress code. That is why I would send something that seems so repetitive (referring to Bill Clinton's State of The \n Nation address 1996) out.\n \n If I were to be elected President, I would reaffirm minors' rights. All \n legal citizens are covered under The Bill of Rights, including minors. \n Although not all minors wish to utilize them, they do have rights. I would \n reaffirm minors' rights by having Congress pass a law that did so. I would \n also get Congress to pass a law requiring public places including malls and \n schools to have policies and/or rules on minors' rights.\n \n As you have read in the last eight paragraphs I would do a lot of \n things as President most involving minors. I would also do other projects, \n but minors' rights would be the main one. I hope this essay has taught you \n what I would do as President and the current state of minors' rights. Even \n though minors' rights can be covered in eight paragraphs, I anticipate it \n would take more than four years to complete. Therefore, I plan to run for \n two terms if elected. I hope you will all, one day, vote for me to be your \n President.\n \n \n \n \n I will also start a thread on the education related side of minors' rights if someone would like to debate that in the education forum",
