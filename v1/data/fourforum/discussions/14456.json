   "It looks like gay pride groups are still trying to push the conspiracy theory about the Mormons and Prop 8. (Never mind that polls all over the country are in-line with what happened in CA, showing it's certainly not just some 'Mormon-thing'.) There's a rather one-sided looking documentary about it now and what got my attention is that it's now on iTunes as a new release. Considering the hot-button nature of the issue, no doubt someone's making a lot of $ on milking this stuff. The 'synopsis' section uses the typical propaganda like bringing up the oft-seen claim of teenagers getting \"kicked out of their homes\", as if certainly most Mormons and most everyone else wouldn't be appalled at that. \n Anyone here seen this? If so, what did you think of it?\n 8: The Mormon Proposition",
