Because you are essentially saying you want the line for what constitutes marriage moved past opposite-sex couples.

Whenever people who argue for same-sex marriage do so, they often resort to such non-arguments as \"how does it effect your existence\" (as you just did) or \"why will it effect YOUR marriage\". But no one ever said it would; rest assured my marriage and existence will be unaffected, but that's not the point. One can have views and opinions about broader social issues regardless of whether it personally effects them or not. There are many, many social issues like this, but it seems that some people thing others should have NO opinion on gay marriage unless it effects them personally! That's ridiculous; imagine if we applied that to other issues like abortion:\n \"What? You've never had an abortion? Nope, sorry, your opinion doesn't count!

The constitution recognises the gulf between the ideal of democracy and the practical reality.\n\n \n Welcome back Peeling. It's been awhile since I've seen you. I've missed the good debate with you. I'll address this in 3 points:\n \n - Believe me, you don't want to depend solely on the Constitution to prove the legitimacy of redefining marriage. The constitution says NOTHING about marriage, or the giving of marriage benefits at all (which are over and above inalienable rights, IMO). You have to remember the the marriage issue is really just about govt. benefits--that's really all legal marriage is about. Couples' benefits were not a reality early on--they were put in place over time. If we rely on the constitution rather than the public setting up benefits as we see fit, then we should probably take away such benefits for EVERYONE--for any sort of marriage. Because the constitution doesn't promise such at all, to anyone. Do you understand what I'm saying? Couples' benefits were never a consitutional issue, and still aren't. \n \n - Now if I may do a bit of prediction here, you will then argue that we should give them equally based on the constitution (and that the issue is more a matter of equal distribution than the whether the benefits should be there to begin with), but I don't think that flies either because there are many, many examples of inequality in terms of benefits that we don't consider unconstitutional--and the criteria for determining that is left up to the people. Heck, there is not even direction in the constitution on how we determine what is rightfully discriminatory and what's not ... it never gives the terms \"harm\", \"consent\", and so forth. We determine what is rightfully discriminatory based on the judgement of the people. We don't consult the constitution on, say, whether disability benefits should go to just disabled people to to everyone--we've made that judgement as a society. This is the reason that when issues come forth where one group feels it is truly discriminated against, amendments are the process by which the rights are guaranteed. Examples of this are the 1st, 2nd, 8th, 13th, and 19th amendments. (and there are others.) By historical precedent, gay people should be pushing for an amendment on this. They don't take that strategy (electing instead to go against historical precedent for the most part) because they know what they seek is too unpopular to pass muster in terms of getting an amendment.\n \n - Finally, even if you do still hold that this is somehow an entirely constitutional issue, you can only go so far as to say that it is a matter of consitutional interpretation. You see, even the way the constitution is viewed is a matter of the will of the people, because it is a document that is subject to interpretation. You have an interpretation, and I have an interpretation. And it seems that my interpretation seems to be winning the day, given that most states are simply instituting civil unions for gays, and the one state that tried to give them benefits based on \"marriage\" is essentially in the process of having that action undone.\n \n \nThe argument over gay marriage is not about whether more people want it legalised than don't. The argument is about whether failing to treat gay and straight couples equally is itself illegal; unconstitutional. The argument is about whether the majority should be allowed to deny the minority the right to be married in the eyes of the law.\n\n \n Ah, my prediction above was correct. See my refutation in point 2.\n \n \nWould you say the same about a roof beam that's fallen and only pinned some of the people in the room below? The line, as you call it, is wrong where it is now. It might not be perfectly right when moved to the other side of gay marriage either (we're not putting the beam back in the roof, just lifting it off the people crushed beneath it), but it's certainly better there than where it is. There's something quintessentially EZ-ish about the argument \"Unless you can supply a perfect answer, you're not allowed to point out the problem.\"\n\n \n Why move the line to yet another place where it is not fully right? If anything, it demonstrates that gays are not so much fighting for a general sense of equality, but rather to see marriage be what they want. It seems to me the issue here is the moving of the line to begin with. I don't think it should be, because the line is for an opposite-sex institution. I'm fully supportive of giving couples' benefits to gays in other ways, though, such as in the way that states are taking up the matter.\n \n \nOnce upon a time, the right to vote was defined so as to exclude women and black people. Should an alternative solution have been found to accommodate their needs, rather than relaxing the restriction?\n\n \n Then do what both blacks and women did to deal with this problem and get an amendment passed to solve this problem. I don't so much oppose your stance as I do the fact that your movement seems inclined to avoid historically precedented due process to get there.",

If you don't qualify then you don't enter. By all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.\n\n \n Uh, no, it has not always been. At one time it was man and property. Even further back, when it was still just a pagan ritual and before it was taken over by christianity, same-sex couples could marry just as easily as opposite sex couples, so there goes that part of your argument out the window. \n \n As to religious grounds, why do they oppose it with those? That's right, because they say the bible tells them it is a sin, therefore, it is a subcategory of being against homosexuality in general, which is what we said.\n \n Two strikes, peter, one more and you're out.:)",

Maybe you can help me with this week's lottery? emoticon_rolleyes:xbanghead \n \n \n\n \n Why move the line to yet another place where it is not fully right? If anything, it demonstrates that gays are not so much fighting for a general sense of equality, but rather to see marriage be what they want. It seems to me the issue here is the moving of the line to begin with. I don't think it should be, because the line is for an opposite-sex institution. I'm fully supportive of giving couples' benefits to gays in other ways, though, such as in the way that states are taking up the matter.\n \n\n \n Ah, so in other words, why move the beam of the people getting crushed to another place if you don't move it back up into the roof?

Good use of the analogy, thanks!\n\n Because we can't get it to the roof yet, so let's at least help those we can.\n \n To abandon the analogy and answer the actual question, laws aren't always perfect right off the bat. When you see a problem, you fix the problem. Denying marriage to gays is a problem, so let's fix that. If someone comes along later and says there's another problem, we'll address that then. We don't need to make the marriage laws perfect for everyone for all time right now, we just need to improve them. If someone thinks that another change is warranted, let them make their case. If it's a good case I'll support them, otherwise I won't. But that's a separate issue, and has nothing to do with what's being discussed now. No one is shooting for perfection, because we're not going to get that in one shot; we're just striving for better. As long as you always strive for better, than you're heading in the right direction. If you insist on perfection or nothing, then you'll get nothing.\n \n \n\n And there's no need for the hateful attitude of your 1st comment. \n\n You've been pushing that \"hate\" thing recently.

The line IS being moved to begin with, and you indeed might as well be arguing to give benefits to anyone under any arrangement because marriage is still being redefined.

Let's look at this for a minute, shall we?\n \n \"everyone ... would be able to marry the consenting adult of their choice.\"\n The \"consenting adult\" caveat still has 2 major qualifiers in place:\n [*]MrWrite's view limits marriage to arrangements consisting of 2 people (\"THE adult of choice\"), thereby denying people wanting polygamous marriage[*]MrWrite's view denies people who happen to be under 18 who want to get married (\"the ADULT of choice\") - what about the rights of the 17 year old? Or the 15 year old? Sometimes 15 year olds are more emotionally mature to make good decisions than 18 year olds!\n There are more qualifiers there as well, but to take them away would infringe upon the freedom of the participants (\"choice\" and \"consenting\"). Regardless, with all those limits still there, it's hardly \"equality for all\", huh? Sometimes people refute themselves and don't even know it.",

   "\n Well of course not--that involves something other than persons. I don't think anyone here is talking about marrying animals or thinking of that as a reasonable possible marriage arrangement.\n\n Says you. I would have said the same about brother and sister, but you found that reasonable. There's probably someone out there who really wants to marry his blow up sex doll. If your stated purpose is \"marriage rights for all\" then you'll spend all you time sorting through edge cases and dealing with wackos, and get no actual work done.\n \n \n\n You could make the same claim about all the different gay rights issues--anti-sodomy, anti-discrimination in the workplace, marriage, civil unions, adoption laws, housing, .... \"a million stupid fights\", yet you don't seem to mind those.\n\n Know what? There are people who just work on anti-gay-housing discirimination, and those who work for just adoption rights. They support all those causes, but they know that they can't do everything, so they concentrate on one issue. No one calls them hypocrites, no one thinks that just because they concentrate on just one thing that they don't support the whole range of gay rights. They're breaking the whole issue of gay rights down into smaller bits, and dealing with those bits. And when they make progress in that one small area, that's a victory for gay rights in general.\n \n \n\n Actually, this a pretty good example you've used, and almost compelling. However, I think there is a subtle difference here. People viewed 'blacks voting' and 'women voting' as two separate issues, not the same issue. It was never just an issue of 'voting.' With the matter we are discussing, we're dealing with one issue: marriage. (at least that's the way those who oppose gay marriage see it!) \n\n voting ~= marriage\n black voting, women voting ~= gay marriage, polygamous marriage\n See how that works? Do I need to expand on that, or is the point clear?\n \n \n\n But the thing is, even if we accept your example, you've still blown it: there's also a degree of hypocrisy in people fighting for blacks to vote, when they are leaving out women. So the hypocrisy existed then as well.\n\n You're clearly using your own definition of hypocrisy here, one which is only vaugley related to the one the rest of us use. You want us to assume that what you mean is bad, but since we don't know what you mean by the term there's no reason for us to assume that. Care to share your definition and explain why it's supposed to be a bad thing?",

As a matter of fact, separate but equal rights are being successfully extended to various groups of people today based on age, sex, national origin, skin color, sexual orientation, etc.\n \n Just as easily as we write a law that says one cannot discriminate against a person because of these things ^^^^, we can write laws that say one cannot discriminate against legally joined couples because of the genders involved. It still does not require that we call the two males 'married'.\n \n \n \n\n On the other hand, if you wanted to get government out of the marriage business all together, and have them only grant benefits to civil unions, that would be fine with me. Leave marriage to the churches, and civil unions to the government, and never the twain shall meet. I don't see it happening, but it's a solution.\nThe government does not need to get out of the marriage business. The government grants certain rights and benefits to married couples. All it needs to do is grant the same rights to other LEGALLY JOINED couples.\n \n And, BTW, it should be just as difficult and painful to get out off a civil union as it is to get out of a marriage. In general, men pay women in ending a marriage. Who's gonna get screwed when two men end a civil union? Does the top pay the bottom? Does the bear pay the sissy? Damn! This could drive the judges crazy!",

Go ahead and give this new benefit to just the straights, put this special requirement on just the gays\" For example, if your system is set up I guarantee there will be people pushing to force the gays to get AIDS tested as a condition, but not the straights.

I'm just not built for it. I should have the right to walk into any ladies room anywhere in the world...but I don't. We all have gender related rights. Marriage is one right extended to two people of opposite gender.\n \n\n And the difference here is that your gender is actually relevant, you don't have the bits that a gynecologist cares about. There's nothing that's actually important about geneder when it comes to weddings. The only difference between your civil unions and marriage is the name, the defintion.

   "No the issue is not marriage in the sense you are talking about. What is it about marriage that same sex couples want and can't have? Some do but I think most will trade the traditional church wedding for the STREAMLINED, AUTOMATIC, ALL AT ONCE SET OF RIGHTS that are immediatly granted to each spouse. Read the posts of same sex marriage supporters it's not I wanna wear a white dress in May at the Church and they won't let me. It's I want visitation rights in the event of illness, I don't want to jump thru hoops to set up sharing and transferring property because the law automatically sets an order for the distibution of property, I want to be able to have the person who I most trust make medical decisions for me. There are plenty more.\n \n Sure same sex couples with a fair amount of money and a good lawyer can achieve most of those to some degree. But marriage is like the multi-vitamin of marriage law. They get the most wanted all rolled up into one neat, inexpensive, legally binding little piece of paper. \n\n \n That's pretty much why I believe others than male/females should be allowed to have these rights and benefits.\n Many gays can already have any type of ceremony they desire. Many already behaved in a 'married' fashion.\n All they really want is simple legal recognition of such. \n \n As to where would I draw the line on 'marriage'?\n 1) you have to be legally able to enter into a contract. 18+\n 2) you have to be human and exercising your free will without coersion of any type.\n 3) all involved have to give permission and sign the contract willingly. Makes polygamy fine but not secret bigamy. This prevents the event of the spouse dying and odd questions on who is entitled to what.\n \n So, polygamy and others would be fine. Heck, you can 'marry' your best friend even if you don't have relations or interest in them as beyond you want to share all the responsibilities and benefits/detriments with them that a marraige entails.\n \n I don't see how letting others live their life would adversly affect mine. I know several gays live in my middle class suburbanite neighborhood. They trouble me as much as any others...not at all. Actually, one lesbian couple lent me their lawn mower last year when the good conservative elderly married couple refused to rent me theirs. (My lawn was shite and my mower was kaput and I was broke at the time).\n If they're going to burninate in evah lastin' hellfire...let them. All an evangelist is required to do is to warn them of such an impending dooooom. not prevent them from doing it.",

That doesn't take away from their desire to show in some way the commitment they want to express to each other and the world. Let's face facts same sex couples end up having many problems that opposite sex couples faced over the centuries and have been addressed legally.

   "Also Known as: Appeal to the Old, Old Ways are Best, Fallacious Appeal to the Past, Appeal to Age \n \n Description of Appeal to Tradition\n \n Appeal to Tradition is a fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that something is better or correct simply because it is older, traditional, or \"always has been done.\" This sort of \"reasoning\" has the following form: \n \n [*]X is old or traditional [*]Therefore X is correct or better. \n This sort of \"reasoning\" is fallacious because the age of something does not automatically make it correct or better than something newer. This is made quite obvious by the following example: The theory that witches and demons cause disease is far older than the theory that microrganisms cause diseases. Therefore, the theory about witches and demons must be true. \n \n This sort of \"reasoning\" is appealing for a variety of reasons. First, people often prefer to stick with what is older or traditional. This is a fairly common psychological characteristic of people which may stem from the fact that people feel more comfortable about what has been around longer. Second, sticking with things that are older or traditional is often easier than testing new things. Hence, people often prefer older and traditional things out of laziness. Hence, Appeal to Tradition is a somewhat common fallacy. \n \n It should not be assumed that new things must be better than old things (see the fallacy Appeal to Novelty) any more than it should be assumed that old things are better than new things. The age of something does not, in general, have any bearing on its quality or correctness (in this context). In the case of tradition, assuming that something is correct just because it is considered a tradition is poor reasoning. For example, if the belief that 1+1 = 56 were a tradition of a group of people it would hardly follow that it is true. \n \n Obviously, age does have a bearing in some contexts. For example, if a person concluded that aged wine would be better than brand new wine, he would not be committing an Appeal to Tradition. This is because, in such cases the age of the thing is relevant to its quality. Thus, the fallacy is committed only when the age is not, in and of itself, relevant to the claim. \n \n One final issue that must be considered is the \"test of time.\" In some cases people might be assuming that because something has lasted as a tradition or has been around a long time that it is true because it has \"passed the test of time.\" If a person assumes that something must be correct or true simply because it has persisted a long time, then he has committed an Appeal to Tradition. After all, as history has shown people can persist in accepting false claims for centuries. \n \n However, if a person argues that the claim or thing in question has successfully stood up to challenges and tests for a long period of time then they would not be committing a fallacy. In such cases the claim would be backed by evidence. As an example, the theory that matter is made of subatomic particles has survived numerous tests and challenges over the years so there is a weight of evidence in its favor. The claim is reasonable to accept because of the weight of this evidence and not because the claim is old. Thus, a claim's surviving legitimate challenges and passing valid tests for a long period of time can justify the acceptance of a claim. But mere age or persistance does not warrant accepting a claim. \n http://search.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-tradition.html",
