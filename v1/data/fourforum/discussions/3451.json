   "Kerry And My Sister \n Tom McLaughlin\n -Many readers know me only as a conservative and are surprised to learn that I haven't always been one. Seeing and hearing John Kerry several times a day is an almost constant reminder that I used to think quite differently when I worked for him back in 1972. I was more liberal then and Kerry was staging an unsuccessful run for congress in the fifth district of Massachusetts. Prior to that, he had been involved with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and I had been fighting city hall in Lowell, the district's biggest city. His campaign people contacted me and I went to work for them. Some friends and relatives came into the campaign as well, including two of my sisters, Jane and Elaine. When my daughter, Annie, got married last August, they came up for the wedding and we reminisced about those days.\n After Kerry lost the election, I had no more contact with him. I had sensed a lack of passion in him and had come to see him as an empty suit. But Elaine and Jane had become friendly with Kerry's first wife, Julia, and their association with Kerry went on for a few years. Both got to know his family fairly well when they babysat his daughters. Elaine watched them sometimes at the three-unit apartment house we had purchased together and they played with my daughters there. Jane was younger and still lived with our parents in nearby Tewksbury. In the summer, she would sometimes accompany the Kerrys to Naushon Island, the private, seven-mile-long summer retreat of the Forbes family, and help with the children.\n My family has always been politically active. We were born Boston-Irish-Catholic-Democrats and politics is innate. During the 1960s and '70s, though, the Democrat Party veered left while the McLaughlin family veered right. Not one of the nine of us still living belongs to the party any more, and I'm sure even my father would have resigned if he had lived to see what's happened to that once-venerable party.\n The day after the wedding last August, we were all sipping wine and talking politics on the porch of my mother's house in Lovell when Jane told a Kerry story I hadn't heard before. We had been taking turns relating just when it was that each of us had come to dislike the man the Democrats have since nominated for president. Jane described how she was spending a week on Naushon. Unaware that she was on a nearby porch and within earshot, Kerry was telling Julia that he didn't want Jane to eat dinner with the family that evening. When Julia asked why, Kerry explained that some dinner guests he had invited didn't approve of the help eating with the family.As Jane was telling the story 30 years later, she was still angry and it showed clearly on her face. She's fully as much of a spitfire now as she was at 15 when the incident occurred, and it had been years since I'd seen that I angry look only she can display. She has a way of pursing her lips and knitting her brow when she's mad that is unique to her and I had to laugh. \"It wasn't funny,\" she said-again with the angry expression. \"I was mortified.\"\n \"So what happened?\" I asked, trying to be serious. Jane went on to explain that Julia had put her foot down and told her husband she refused to explain that Kerry wanted her to eat in another room. With that, our would-be president backed off and Jane ate with the family as she usually did. I could picture her sitting at the dinner table, looking at Kerry and doing the slow burn as only Jane can.\n \"John Kerry-courageous man of the people,\" I said.\n \"That's when I came to hate him,\" said Jane.\n \"Understandable,\" I answered.\n Eventually, the Kerrys sold their house in Lowell when he went to law school at Boston College. Then he served as Assistant District Attorney in Middlesex County, Mass. I finished school and moved north to the mountains to teach. Elaine and Jane married and moved to the suburbs. Kerry then ran for Lieutenant Governor under Michael Dukakis, then U.S. Senator. Reading snippets of what he was up to in the Boston papers, I was gradually moving from left to right on the political spectrum. Kerry, obviously, remains on the left-the most liberal member of the Senate. Seeing and hearing him every day is a continuous affirmation that I moved in the right direction.\n www.mountwashingtonvalley.com",

How about when he came home from Vietnam and immediately began to slander EVERYONE who was serving in that war? \n\n \n Whether you agree with what he did or not, that is opinion. If he felt the war was immoral (which many many many people did), he did what he had to do according to his own ethics.\n \n \n\n How about when he met with members of a hostile government, as a private citizen, essentially to discuss the terms of US surrender?\n\n \n Is there any proof that's what he discussed? Did he have any authority to negotiate surrender? \n \n \n\n Or how about the one consistency in his record as a US senator, always voting to underfund or to not fund the military, even when that military is currently facing an armed foe?\n\n \n What about the same underfunding that Cheney voted for? What about Bush sending our troops into combat before they were equiped, regardless of what Kerry voted for or against?",

   "Is there any proof that's what he discussed? Did he have any authority to negotiate surrender? \n \n \n \n \n\n No, that's not correct. If you are meeting with the enemy delegation in an attempt to determine how you may assist the enemy in meeting their goals, then that is treason. Giving aid to the enemy. And remember, when Kerry met with the North Vietnamese delegation, he was not a member of the US Senate. His only connection to the government at the time was the fact that he was a member of the inactive Naval Reserves (I think).\n \n The more I look into Kerry's actions, the more convinced I become that those actions were every bit as treasonous as the actions of Jane Fonda. I can overlook youthful indiscretions. Treason does not count as \"youthful indiscretion.\"\n \n We have Kerry's own admissions about what he did. He admitted to \"private\" meetings with the North Vietnamese delegation at Paris. He was not a representative of our government. That meets the conditions of treason.",

   "No, that's not correct.\n\n \n What's not correct? I didn't make any claims emoticon_confused\n \n \n\n If you are meeting with the enemy delegation in an attempt to determine how you may assist the enemy in meeting their goals, then that is treason.\n\n \n I suppose. I don't know what is legally treason. In any case, I asked if there was any proof that is what he was doing.\n \n \n\n Giving aid to the enemy. And remember, when Kerry met with the North Vietnamese delegation, he was not a member of the US Senate. His only connection to the government at the time was the fact that he was a member of the inactive Naval Reserves (I think).\n\n \n blah blah blah. Ok, does that make it not treason if he was not a member of the Senate? Why did you say this?\n \n \n\n The more I look into Kerry's actions, the more convinced I become that those actions were every bit as treasonous as the actions of Jane Fonda. I can overlook youthful indiscretions. Treason does not count as \"youthful indiscretion.\"\n\n \n Opinion. I don't know if I share it, because I would need examples. A young idealistic person I would probably overlook.\n \n \n\n We have Kerry's own admissions about what he did. He admitted to \"private\" meetings with the North Vietnamese delegation at Paris. He was not a representative of our government. That meets the conditions of treason.\n\n \n His own admissions that he did what, exactly? Does it meet the conditions of treason? Meeting with a \"delegation\"? Was there any proof that there was a \"delegation\"? Does anyone know what they discussed? Perhaps it was a club or something that wanted peace in Vietnam that wanted to meet a similar group from America, I don't know. Where are the details?\n \n You are basing an opinion on questionable \"evidence\" and I think it's more than likely that your mind was already made up and so you are making sinister any aspect of Kerry's life that you can. Typical partisanship.",
