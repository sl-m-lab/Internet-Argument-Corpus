   "I have read repeatedly throughout these forums about how the Catholic Church has supposedly endorsed slavery, promoted anti-women lines of thought, been in favour of racism, been a friend of Hitler, promoted sexual violence, been in favour of indoctrination, rejected reason because it is \"heretical\", etc., etc., etc.... However, a profound and coherent study of the history of the Western world and of Western thought will lead us to see that it is in the doctrines of the Catholic Church where we find the first assertion and the philosophical foundations of things like the equaility of human beings, the inherent dignity of each person, the idea of freedom, the idea of human rights, the need to be compassionate and selfless for others, the goodness of the desire of knowledge, the true value of reason for the human person as one of the bases of his dignity, etc., etc., etc...\n \n I would like those of you who consider the Church to be that evil conspiracy machine that has ever intrigued to undermine all progress and justice to explain to me these ideas. There is obviously no such thing as a historical infallibility of all the Roman Catholics or all the Ministers of the Church that have ever lived, but I do believe in the correctness of the Church's teachings, their coherence and their HUGE value when analysed historically as true catalysts of human progress and of the respect for human dignity.",

I am willing to dispute the fact that ANY of those evils have been perpretated, promoted or favoured by the Catholic Church, while I also believe that all the goods I have named are indeed founded, although of course not entirely or exclusively in all cases, on Catholic doctrine.

   "What about the Vatican's most recent position on gay priests. Even if a gay priest remains completely celibate, his sexual orientation is now regarded as a threat to \"priestly life.\" A gay celibate priest, according to the new rules, is incapable of \"sexual maturity coherent with his masculine sexual identity.\" He has \"a problem in the psychic organization\" of his sexuality, barring him from priestly responsibility. Gay seminarians should be spotted and rooted out because they allegedly have \"trouble relating to their fathers; are uncomfortable with their own identity; tend to isolate themselves; have difficulty in discussing sexual questions; view pornography on the Internet; demonstrate a deep sense of guilt; or often see themselves as victims.\" These are contrary to the state of the art of medical opinion.\n \n Please also see from another thread.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=202992&postcount=1\n \n and\n \n \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=204810&postcount=8",

   "The question of sexism is of course controversial. However, let's make a few clarifications.\n \n The priesthood is not what we could accurately call \"the decision making\" or the \"inside power structure\" of the Church. The Church is composed of all fathful, and those who have been ordained the Ministers of Church do not constitute a hierarchy that rule over the rest. The power of the Church is not of dominion, it is of faith and of what today is called \"moral authority\" - a concept which, as can be seen intuitively, is founded on the basic premise of the value and respect for human freedom. Thus, saying that priests are the equivalent of a country's adminsitration in the Church is inaccurate, because the Church is not a structure of power.\n \n The exclusion of women from priesthood constitutes what Pope John Paul II called \"an ancient tradition that we don't have the authority to remove\". Now, it is important to say, first of all, that the Church does not consider women to be inferior to men, or vice versa, but that does not mean they are all exacly the same in everything - because I believe it is quite evident to all that men and women aren't the same thing. In Catholicism, manhood and womanhood are complementary aspects of the human creature, they are equal, but complementary, and so a society that wants a completely igualitarian regime between both is rejecting the very nature of mankind. I'm not saying women belong in the house, don't misunderstand me, and of course this does not mean that women or men should have less opportunities, are less capable or should be discriminated against. What I am saying is that society is based on the fundamental cell of family, and in a family men and women have equal but complementary roles. In the Church it is similar, men serve God becoming Ministers of the Church (priests) and women serve God dedicating themselves to prayer and work for Him, but always remembering that women, unlike men, share with God a very mystical and beautiful link in life: the gift to bring the children of the world to life.\n \n The possibility to access the priesthood doesn't mean that the Church understands that men can or should have a more profound connection with God than women. A priest doesn't necessarily have a more profound mystical connection than any other faithful, and certainly nuns have very profound faiths and links to God. The knowledge that is given to priests, of theology, philosophy, mathematics, history, literature and languages, doesn't mean that they are better prepared to find God, it means that they must be armed with the appropriate tools in this world in order to preach and acclaim God to all peoples, and understand the full meaning of the sacraments they give.\n \n The place of women, in Catholicism, is not \"the home\". This is a ridiculous simplification. What this means is that the comprehension of a naturally appropriate society, for the Church, is based on the family. The roles we play in society as men, women, fathers, mothers, children, brothers and sisters are based on those we play in our families. So, women are the mothers in this scheme, and so they have different prerogatives. Of course, in a society in which family no longer occupies 100% of people's time, the opportunities to work, study, etc. of women must be recognised, not as a new phenomenon, but as a recognition of the natural value of women as integral members of society. This does not mean, however, that the family roles must be forgotten or ridiculed. For example, homosexual marriages are a mockery and a denaturalisation of the institution of family. \n \n The Concordat signed in 1933 between Germany and the Holy See has been overly misunderstood. This Concordat basically established for the administrative statute of the Church and its members in Germany. It, as you say, provided for the independence of the Church in its affairs in Germany, and for the exclusion of the Church from the political framework. However, it never constituted a means through which the Church acquiesced, and allowed the savage killings with indifference. Fortunately, in Germany this meant that Catholicism was not rooted out, or incorporated into a State Church. However, in other countries occupied by Germany, the Catholic Church was brutally and savagely persecuted. This happened especially in Poland, where thousands of priests were sent to a concentration camp in Dachau, where they died and were tortured. All Catholic universities, schools and seminars were closed (just have to read the biography of H.H. Pope John Paul II, he had to receive theology classes clandestinely in Nazi-occupied Poland because the seminars were banned). Also, the help the Church provided for the salvation of tens of thousands of Jews and others minorities from the Nazi death camps is a historical fact. If you check the list of institutions and people that received the thanks of the Jewish organisations, you will find both the Catholic Church as an institution, and H.H. Pope Pius XII.\n \n With respect to homosexual ministers. The Church does not reject that any homosexual should become a priest, this is of course ridiculous. What has been said in the recent document published on this matter is that those who demonstrate to have deeply rooted and evident homosexual tendencies cannot be priests because a major part of their identity, the sexual part, is out of order. A disconnection between the biological order of the body and the psychological reproductive tendencies cannot be seen as anything less than a dysfunctionality of sexual order. This does not mean that homosexuals have less dignity, are ill or should be \"rooted out\", it does mean that those who present these strong tendencies mustn't be allowed to be priests before they put their sexualities in order.\n \n I know this is extremely politically incorrect. I am simply trying to explain the Church's position on these issues. Perhaps I have not persuaded anyone, but that is not my objective. What I want is that, when speaking of the Roman Catholic Church, its history or doctrine in this forum, or of Roman Catholicism or the Pope, etc., you know what you're talking about, and aren't simply repeating sensationalist anti-religious slogans.",

Even the Jews defend the Church on this. Click here for many good sources:\n \n http://www.catholicleague.org/pius/framemain.htm\n \n Please note the two articles by RABBI David Dalin.\n \n Also an excerpt from The Truth About Pope Pius XII by Sister Margherita Marchione:\n \n An interesting document is the testimony of Albert Einstein who, disenchanted by the silence of universities and editors of newspapers, stated in Time magazine (December 23, 1940): \"Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. ...The Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom.\" Indeed, executing the directives of Pope Pius XII, religious men and women opened their doors to save the Jews.\n \n The Jewish Community publicly acknowledged the wisdom of Pope Pius XII's diplomacy. In September 1945, Dr. Joseph Nathan-who represented the Hebrew Commission-stated \"Above all, we acknowledge the Supreme Pontiff and the religious men and women who, executing the directives of the Holy Father, recognized the persecuted as their brothers and, with great abnegation, hastened to help them, disregarding the terrible dangers to which they were exposed.\" In 1958, at the death of Pope Pius XII, Golda Meir sent an eloquent message: \"We share in the grief of humanity. ...When fearful martyrdom came to our people, the voice of the Pope was raised for its victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out about great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace.\" \n \n Note also the Catholic League's Ad in the New York Times on April 10, 2001. All it does is run quotes from the Times newspaper articles and editorials from the 1940s--and they are favorable descriptions of the Church's role.\n \n For a supreme example of the Church's work in WWII look into the life of Maximilian Kolbe--a Catholic priest martyr of Auschwitz who gave his life for another after he had been helping to hide Jews previously:\n \n http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintm01.htm\n \n And don't forget Edith Stein--a Jewish convert to Christianity who became Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross--another martyr to the Nazis. \n \n http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintt05.htm\n \n I wonder why the Catholic Church would be collaborating with the Nazis when they were being killed also?\n \nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood, and hence from the decision making of the church, is inherently sexist, as it pre-supposes that men are able to have a closer relationship with God than women.\n\n Do you believe in Jesus? Do you believe that Jesus was God in the form of man--a man? Why do you believe that God was embodied in a man? Was God the Father sexist for embodying himself as a man?\n \n If we call the Church sexist for excluding women from the priesthood must we also call Jesus sexist for excluding women from the 12 apostles?\n \n \nThe Catholic church has also made it very clear that it believe that a woman's place is in the home. There is also the issue of the differing attitudes to mothers as opposed to fathers of children born outside of marriage, particularly in Ireland up until the 50s.\n\n I must echo Pejotif on this issue. The Catholic Church believes in the family. In so doing, it believes that a woman is the best mother. It believes that a mother should be in the home. So yes, in a sense the Church believes that a woman should be in the home. The home is perhaps the seat of greatest power, for the person who wields the power of the household wields the power to shape future minds that will guide the future of the world.",

   "This is exactly what I mean. If you want to criticise the Catholic Church, then it can be minimally required that you understand the most basic principles of Catholic doctrine.\n \n In Roman Catholicism, Holy Tradition is one of the two pillars of faith, along with the Holy Texts. This means that we believe both what is said in the Bible and the interpretation the Church has made of the Bible over the centuries. This is why, for example, the Catholic Church was the first to say that the more fantastical passages of the Bible can be interpreted as metaphors. This is also why in Catholicism the many literal contradictions contained in the Bible can be explained and understood. Much like a judge interprets the law. This is unlike the Protestant branches of Christianity, in which the Bible is taken to be the only source of faith. This is why Protestant theology is, to some extent, less coherent in many areas than Catholic theology, or choses not to address a particular issue because the Bible speaks of it in contradictory terms, is too fantastical or it simply omits the question.\n \n The exclusion of women from the priesthood is a part of Holy Tradition, and therefore would require an authority higher than the Pope's to be repealed. THere is only one earthy authority higher than the Pope's, that of the ecclesiastical councils, like the II Vatican Council that met under the Papacy of H.H. John XXIII.\n \n The Inquisition was not a part of Holy Tradition, it was an institution of the Church given a particular duty: to care for the uniformity and pursuance of Catholic doctrine. Today, the Inquisition no longer exists, and the Commision that has come to replace it, previously presided by the current Pope, is something like a consultation tribunal. Catholics worldwide ask the Commission about the compatibility of a particular practise, belief or ideology with Catholic doctrine. This is the body that has revealed that things like abortion, euthanasia or homosexual marriages are contrary to our faith.\n \n Slavery might have been a social institution founded on tradition, but that has nothing to do with the Holy Tradition I explained above.\n \n Concerning homosexuality, the quote given about what H.H. Pope Benedict has to say about it is correct. Homosexuality as a tendency is not a sin, letting oneself be driven and controlled by that tendency is. Why? Because homosexuality, as I said earlier, is a disconnection between the biological order of the body and the psychological reproductive tendencies. This obvious description of what homosexuality is, as a disconnection, cannot be seen as anything less than a dysfunctionality of sexual order. The fact that we believe homosexuality is a disorder does not mean we do not respect homosexuals, it means that we see that there is something not entirely in order with them. I think that to say homosexuality is perfectly normal is a very gross dismissal of objective reality. Saying someone suffers a disorder is not an insult.",

The idea of difficulty relating to fathers, etc. mentioned in my above post has been debunked years ago. With respect to gay priests, the Vatican assured us in official documents in 1975 and '86, that gay people were \"often generous and giving of themselves,\" and the notion that gays could not lead celibate lives was an \"unfounded and demeaning assumption.\" This was said in the context of allowing celibate gay men to be priests, with no mention of any innate problems.

This is what I have been doing. If it offends you, and you find it excessively arrogant or insenstivie, I of course apologise. However, I would like to add the fact that not so many of you jump to the rescue on these forums when opnely anti-religious statements are made, when it is said that a belief in God is outdated, ridiculous or childish, or when it is said that those who \"still\" believe in all the doctrines of the Church are intolerant or old-fashioned.\n \n Also, there is no such thing as \"orthodox\" Catholic doctrine, because giving the doctrine an adjective means there are other versions. There aren't. There is one Church, and one faith. Opinions and personal judgements are of course another thing. I have several questions and disagreements with Church postures on several issues, but I attempt to salvage them seeking answers from those who understand that doctrine because, most of the time, my misgivings derive from ignorance of the doctrine instead of pure head-on disagreement. I would not flee from my faith on a mere disagreement with doctrine.\n \n Thelmoose, what I have spoken of above is my faith. I mean of course no offence.

So, this means that there could be many perfectly faithful and celibate gay priests, I don't think it is just to discriminate without considering each individual case. However, what the Church has done is establish parameters for decison on who is accepted in seminars. Thse parameters are not categorical rejections, (like, for example, that placed for married men), they are guides. The Church, with the mystical wisdom it has been given (in which you may of course chose to disbelieve), sees homosexuality as a disorder. And I think that in many cases this is not entirely inaccurate, for there are many gays, who unlike you are not entirely secure about their sexuality, and suffer from it, I happen to know quite a few, and some are close friends. If you think it is wrong that they suffer from this, or that this suffering is the product of some sort of Catholic \"brainwahsing\", that is your opinion. Choosing the appropriate method to end that suffering would depend on who was helping the person. Some would try to help them end their homosexual tendencies, others would try to make them \"come to peace\" with them. The morality of the issue, in Catholicism, would be based on the fact that one solution leads to sin and the other doesn't.\n \n I know that this rejection sounds like the Church is saying \"we don't want any homosexuals among us\", but it's far from it. The Church wants all peoples to be converted and saved, but believing that engaging in homosexual sex is okay morally is not a coherent Catholic view, and so the faithful must chose between what they prefer, and what they have been shown is correct.",

It is a medical one. Mystical wisdom, my asphalt. The Vatican does not have the expertise or authority to call homosexuality as disorder. Even if it did, that statement is categorically inaccurate.\n \n It is also an entirely new position that the Church only recently adopted. Why would this radical and backward change occur now? It is readily apparent that this change is a reaction to the pedophilia scandal among priests. Rather than address the issue honestly and bravely, the church has chosed to make homosexuality itself the problem, rather than the criminal actions of priests and bishops. This abomination had been allowed to continue due to the shameful actions of the church hierarchy. Rather than do the right thing, they have chosen to blame the homos! If you want to believe that the edict or fiat or whatever they call it has a spritual foundation, you are certainly entitled to that naive opinion.",

   "Simone,\n Did you know that Oscar Wilde was baptized and converted to Catholicism on his deathbed?\n\n \n \n Oh yes.. all these death bed conversions, the death bed refutions.. and so many of them total lies.\n \n Of course, the person who \"converted\" wasn't around to object. However, many of these tales have witnesses that deny the rumor.\n \n So, I don't take stories about 'death bed' convesions very seriously.\n \n On Edit: from http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0093.html\n \n \n\n The story has long circulated that Wilde converted to Catholicism just before his death in Paris on November 30, 1900. But it is often dismissed as either fiction or the aberrant action of a very sick man in a moment of grave weakness. Richard Ellmann's 1988 biography of Wilde, which incorrectly speculates that syphilis was the cause of his early demise at age 46, treats the conversion as a minor detail, perhaps further evidence of the broken man that Wilde had become after his two years in prison for sodomy. In a particularly uncomprehending passage, Ellmann compares the application of sacred oils to Wilde's hands and feet during the last rites to \"putting a green carnation in his buttonhole.\" Thus, Ellmann encourages us to overlook Wilde's conversion and not let it spoil our image of him as an icon of the gay lifestyle.\n \n But Rev. Cuthbert Dunne, C.P., the priest who was with Wilde at his death, told a different story. When he arrived, Wilde was semi-comatose, so Dunne did not give him Holy Communion, but he did provisionally baptize him. In a report, Dunne wrote that, once roused, Wilde \"gave signs of being inwardly conscious. He made brave efforts to speak, and would even continue for a time trying to talk . . . Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and give him the Last Sacraments. From the signs he gave as well as from his attempted words, I was satisfied as to his full consent. And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with [an] act of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.\" Moreover, at \"subsequent visits, he repeated the prayers with me again and each time received Absolution.\"\n \n Why was a priest at Wilde's deathbed in the first place? Wilde had often said to his friends that \"Catholicism is the only religion to die in.\" And in a letter written after his death, his lifetime Catholic friend Robert Ross revealed, \"I had always promised to bring a priest to Wilde when he was dying, and I felt rather guilty that I had so often dissuaded him from becoming a Catholic, but you know my reasons for doing so.\" Ross had wondered whether Wilde was really serious about wanting to convert. Also, Ross feared that Wilde would \"relapse\" into sinful behavior after converting, which would \"cause grave scandal.\"\n \n Indeed, it is hard to know how serious Ross himself was about his faith. Wilde variously referred to Ross as a \"pagan-Catholic\" and a \"low-church Catholic.\" Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, who converted to Catholicism years after Wilde's death and even became aggressively orthodox in his religious views, reported that Ross had had his own troubles with the faith. In any case, Ross later felt guilty and wondered if he had been wrong for having stood at the entryway to the Church to try to keep Wilde from coming in. And yet, on at least one earlier occasion, Ross had urged Catholicism on Wilde, and Wilde had responded, \"No, Robbie. It isn't true.\" This exchange might have discouraged further attempts on Ross's part. \n \n\n \n It seems like the Reverand that attended his death got him when he was too bad off to properly respond, and took his attempts to speak as assent to convert.\n \n For all you know, he might have been saying \"Get the eff away from me\".",

So you will be in hell with the gays, and possibly with the little brats who dared rat on all of the Catholic priests for molesting them.\n\n Dam,\n When have I condemned gays to hell? \n \n Which do you think is the church closer to the truth of the message of Jesus...your old Fundamental Baptist church or the Catholic Church?\n \n But gay love cannot be compatible with Christian teaching. \n \n Genesis 1:26-28 \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

   "Okay, let's get some things clear.\n \n POINT 1: Homosexuality is NOT a sin. The simple condition of being a homosexual is not a sin, what is sinful is to allow yourself to be subdued by homosexual tendencies and engage in homosexual sex, etc. That is what is sinful. In other words, what we reproach is the weakness of the will in the face of what we consider to be a disordered sexual tendency.

Because gay marriages constitute a denaturalisation of the institution of matrimony; because giving a sexual education to children that addresses homosexuality as normal is simply not respecting the natural order of things.\n \n POINT 3: Despite the denial, it is now unreasonable and myopic to say that it is impossible to change one's sexual orientation. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ex-gays that are now happily heterosexual.

So, being sexual, or acting on your innate tendencies is sinful for gays but not straights. Being a sexual person means one is allowing one's tendencies to \"dominate one's will.\" Well I am certainly glad you cleared that up. I am not supposed to have, shall we say, uneasy feelings about being called sick?\n \n Why on earth do you think that the Catholic Church is an authority on human sexuality, especially when those ideas are directly contrary to virtually all medical and psychological authorities?\n \n \n\n POINT 2: The Christian right is not against gays.

Because gay marriages constitute a denaturalisation of the institution of matrimony; because giving a sexual education to children that addresses homosexuality as normal is simply not respecting the natural order of things. \n\n \n Not \"against\" gays? Just thinks they're disordered - that sounds a tad \"anti\" to me. Gay marriage does nothing harmful to the institution of marriage, and I would like to hear one single tangible, objective harm it might cause. Other than damage to puritanical sensibilities. Homosexuality is normal. It happens, always has, always will and gays are perfectly well-adjusted, moral and functioning people - well, no more or less than anyone else. There are mountains of empiric evidence to support than. Children cannot be harmed simply by know homosexuality exists. Who are you to define the natural order of things?\n \n What do you mean, \"alleged\" gay rights? In most places in the US, it is not illegal to discriminate againsts gays in employment, accomodation, housing, and adoption, etc. No right to marry. NO equal treatment in the military. What part of that is not a denial of civil rights? Even where anti-discrimination laws have been passed, exceptions have to be made for religious organizations, because they are so kind and loving, I suppose.\n \n \n POINT 3: Despite the denial, it is now unreasonable and myopic to say that it is impossible to change one's sexual orientation.

It has not been scientifically validated. That one's sexual orientation is for the most part fixed, has been scientifically validated. \n \n More important, the \"suffering\" of homosexuals has most certainly been demonstrated to be due to outside forces telling them they are sick, sinful, and inferior. This cruel indoctrination, often from religious authorities is responsible for an enormous amount of mental illness, depression and suicide and is inhumane. Why do you deny the science behind this?\n \n You really don't see how arrogant this posturing of superiority is - telling someone else they are sick and their only hope is to repent and shun their natural selves.

However, in each (this forum and the world population) homosexuals are quite vocal and seem to think the world should revolve around them and their struggle for unfettered acceptance. This is minority control in action. I believe this is why so many threads turn to discussions of gay issues here and why it seems to be the prevalent argument regarding church doctrine.\n \n Legislated (either by government or clergy) sexual activity is simply a futile effort. Sex, sex drive and all the required body parts are gifts of nature and should not be controlled by manmade rules. To say that a priest should be celibate is nonsense, especially in that priests are just men who chose to be priests. They have sex drive just like everybody else. I think the prohibition on priests marrying has a lot of infuence on how many of them molest young boys, a common event that is swept under the rug by the church rulers. (Rather than throw the bastards out of the church and to the wolves, they simply move the molesters to another church.)\n \n To say that couples should have sex only when they want to have another child is nonsense. Sex drive kicks in gear at puberty. After that, it takes will power to refrain from having sex. While I agree that marriage is proper and adultery should be discouraged, I definitely believe in using birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies...sure beats abortions and unwanted children. Of course, the Catholic Church is against birth control because it decreases the number of potential contributing members. It's all about power and money.",

Sometimes the gay proponents get a little out of hand, and make some very sweeping statements. To the extent I have been guilty of that, mea culpa. I raised the \"gay stuff\" with this post as I thought the Vatican's recent proscription against gay priests was relevant. I deleted the last 2/3 of your post, which addresses the criminal way the church has not dealt with the child molesters and I agree fully and also feel this recent \"anti-gay\" action was a politically motivated way to shift the blame.\n \n But to address your point above, I disagree that gays folks want \"unfettered\" acceptance, just acceptance of the fact that we are people and deserve the same rights and bear the same responsibilites as anyone. I do not think the \"world revolves around me.\" However, the issues of gay rights affect my well-being, my pursuit of happiness more directly than they do you, so perhaps they are more important to me and I feel more strongly. With all due respect, the effect of oppression is not felt as acutely by the unoppresssed. (I hope that \"oppression\" is not too strong a word, here.) I am not sure what you mean by \"minority control\", either. The RC church and the rabid evangelicals make directly provocative verbal attacks against homosexuality and I would think that at least some response is not uncalled for.\n \n Thanks.",

If heterosexuals did not believe the world revolved around them and their lifestlye then there would be no debating anything gay because it wouldn't matter to the heterosexual what a gay person did. If heterosexuals don't believe the world revolves around them why all this fuss about non discrimination, gay adoption, and samesex marriage. The problem is that that heterosexuals are oblivious to the fact that the world revolves around them and their lifestyle. You have to be gay to understand and view this fact.

Suppose you wanted to set up a debate on why catholicism opposes modern progressive opinion, would you insist that homosexuality should be the only contentious issue discussed? If not, why not?\n\n \n \n Nope.. I would not. However, homosexuality IS just one of the major issues that the RCC has been very vocal on recently. Their statements about homosexuals and the priesthood in response to the pedaphile sex scandals in teh U.S. make it a major point of concern. \n \n I personally don't care that homosexuality is agaisnt catholic teaching one way or another. I AM concerned that they are using the issue to misdirect attention away from the sexual misconduct of Priests, and the cover up of that misconduct by the heirarchy. \n \n I am concerned that they are using their international status to transfer priests that face sexual criminal charges from one country to another country that does not have an extradition treaty with the first country so they won't face the charges against them. THis is particularly concerning when the charges are about being a pedaphile, and the position they get transfered to puts them in close contact with children. \n \n I am concerned when the RCC church is taking their specific religious prejudices, and then try to campaign to change the laws and effect me. Of course, I don't limit that to the RCC. But I don't like it when they use the 'threat' of excommunication against polititions to try to alter their votes.\n \n IMO, homosexuals in the RCC have the option of going to another religion if they so desire. I do view most christian denominations of playing the roll of the pharasees and sadducciess in the parables that are attributed to Jesus though. The early christinas are amoung the ones that were reaching out to the 'unclean'.. the lepers, the blind, the crippled, the poor. .. basicaly, the outcasts of society.

However, a profound and coherent study of the history of the Western world and of Western thought will lead us to see that it is in the doctrines of the Catholic Church where we find the first assertion and the philosophical foundations of things like the equaility of human beings, the inherent dignity of each person, the idea of freedom, the idea of human rights, the need to be compassionate and selfless for others, the goodness of the desire of knowledge, the true value of reason for the human person as one of the bases of his dignity, etc., etc., etc...\n \n I would like those of you who consider the Church to be that evil conspiracy machine that has ever intrigued to undermine all progress and justice to explain to me these ideas.

   "Jesus called people at the time of his ministry who were appropriate at that time. If you're telling me that no woman has ever been more suitable for entry to the priesthood than any of the men currently in it, I'd be very surprised. There were female priests and ministers in the early church, and the experience of the Anglican and Methodist churches has shown that women are suitable ministers and celebrants.\n\n \n \nSo why is it that women are excluded from positions of leadership in the Roman church? Why has there never been (officially at least) a female Pope? How many women participated in the Vatican Councils?\n\n Called those who were \"appropriate at that time?\" Is this not the man who saved the adulterous woman from stoning (John 8)?

If the barriers to a female priesthood were to be abolished/a female priesthood fulfilled then would that have not been the time and place for it? Would Jesus who was so outspoken in regard to traditional roles of women be afraid or neglect in recognizing them? Or did he mean for the priesthood to be male?

   "Jim's trucking\n To say that a priest should be celibate is nonsense, especially in that priests are just men who chose to be priests. They have sex drive just like everybody else. I think the prohibition on priests marrying has a lot of infuence on how many of them molest young boys, a common event that is swept under the rug by the church rulers. (Rather than throw the bastards out of the church and to the wolves, they simply move the molesters to another church.)\n\n The saying that celibacy is nonsense is the true nonsense--that is if you believe in God, the supernatural, and the ability of man to have a relationship with God. If the commitment in celibacy is nonsense then the commitment in marriage is nonsense (but yet you seem to believe in marriage). Both the priesthood and marriage are a lifelong commitment of loyalty to one that is loved. And both celibacy and marriage are signs of our relationship with God and signs pointing to our ultimate fulfillment with God. We long for each other in marriage due to our longing for God. So marriage is a sign of our love and commitment to God. The celibate priesthood through a special sacrifice of self (giving of one's body and life as Jesus gave us his body and life) which points us to the heavenly marriage of Jesus and his bride, the Church. The priest skips the earthly fulfillment and sign of the marriage of the Lamb in anticipation of the heavenly fulfillment of the marriage of the Lamb and our ultimate fulfillment in our union with God. Remember that scripture says that we will not be given in marriage in heaven as we are here. Why not? Probably because we will be fulfilled by our union with God.\n \n If you think celibacy is the reason for priests molesting then consider this:\n \n Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children?\n \n If for some reason, your significant other died or for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction?\n \n If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children?\n \n And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate?\n \n Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy.\n \n \nTo say that couples should have sex only when they want to have another child is nonsense. \n\n This is not really what the Church says. The Church says that a couple must always be accepting of a child if one comes about from intercourse. A couple can have sex during a known naturally infertile time for the unitive purposes of the marriage to foster love and fidelity. But this does not block the procreative aspect of sex as does artificial contraception. The Church also says that parents have the right to plan their family size when considering serious reasons that do not fall into the materialistic mindset of modern society. Read the encyclical Humanae Vitae by Pope Paul VI and it will explain a lot--it's fairly short.\n \n \nWhile I agree that marriage is proper and adultery should be discouraged, I definitely believe in using birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies...sure beats abortions and unwanted children. Of course, the Catholic Church is against birth control because it decreases the number of potential contributing members. It's all about power and money.\n\n Actually, I would guess that artificial birth control is a major component that allows adultery. It eliminates a fear of pregnancy from the adulterous relationship and being found out due to that. It also can contribute to abortion as a last resort when contraception fails.\n \n Now, if the Church is seeking to increase its numbers at all costs to provide power and money then why do you think it hasn't endorsed in vitro fertilization and other fertility techniques? The its sterile members would produce children and its members would produce multiple children per births due to the effect of fertility drugs? The reason the Church is against artificial contraception and in vitro is because they both eliminate one of the two essential aspects of the marital act-the procreative aspect and the unitive aspect. Artificial contraception eliminates the procreative aspect and in vitro eliminates the unitive aspect. It has nothing to do with money and power--it has a lot to do with keeping the marital act as an intimate, personal, Godly act.",

   "trebor\n The response of the RCC to the molestation charges was to blame 'homosexual' priests.. and make statements abot not letting homosexuals become preists.\n \n Nope.. I would not. However, homosexuality IS just one of the major issues that the RCC has been very vocal on recently. Their statements about homosexuals and the priesthood in response to the pedaphile sex scandals in teh U.S. make it a major point of concern. \n \n I personally don't care that homosexuality is agaisnt catholic teaching one way or another. I AM concerned that they are using the issue to misdirect attention away from the sexual misconduct of Priests, and the cover up of that misconduct by the heirarchy.\n\n There is good reason that homosexuality has been a focal point of the Church in light of the recent scandals. It is due to the fact that most cases were cases of ephebophilia and not pedophilia. I apologize to those of you who have read this article already due to the fact that I have posted it numerous times. But the facts still don't seem to get out there:\n \n The Myth of the Pedophile Priest:\n http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0534.html\n \n \nYet, what do they do when a priest is accused of molestation of a minor??

   "MatthewS\n Case in point as to who started this war against us. The christian right has declared war upon gay people then complain when we fight back with the same weapons they use aganist us. They simple do not want us to exist and if they had the power would reinstitute burnings at the stake, immprisonment, and reeducation therapy. They do not have our best intrests in mind. They push us away and when we try and live our lives in the truth they say we are pushing an agenda.\n\n I think everything we are discussing here about homosexuality and Christianity must be qualified. If we are talking about homosexual Christians or Christian homosexuals then several important points must be considered.\n \n Modern Christians are simply presenting the message of Christianity that has existed for 2000 years. We are conveying the Revelation of Christ as presented to the Church. This message seems meaningless to an atheist or secular homosexual and there may be a case for imposition of values or oppression, or restriction of liberty there (although a secular argument against homosexuality can be proposed also). But if you are a Christian homosexual then you must pay heed to the creeds, history, and record of Revelation that you profess to follow. \n \n But most rebellious Christian homosexuals do three things:\n \n 1.demonize the traditional churches that uphold the constant teaching of the Revelation of Jesus for 2000 years--don't kill the messenger-the message is simply being presented--the modern church hasn't formulated this message--it was there from the beginning\n 2. attempt to change the theology of Christianity and change the meaning of sin\n 3. consider their homosexuality first and their Christianity second--Christianity is modified to fit their homosexuality instead of their homosexuality being modified to fit their Christianity\n \n However, the Christian homosexual must not attempt to mold the faith according to his own desires and will but rather mold his desire and will according to the faith. There are two choices:\n \n 1. He must choose to be actively homosexual, disregard the teaching of Christianity, and enter into sin.\n 2.He must choose to be celibate (if he cannot tolerate heterosexuality), adhere to the teaching of Christianity, and refrain from sin. He must acknowledge the legitimacy of the teachings of the Church and at the same time recognize its boundless mercy and guidance. This would be a very great burden. But he must submit, as we all must in different ways, to the will of God and lay his sufferings at the foot of the Cross, uniting them with the sufferings of Jesus.\n \n \nthelmoose\n Homosexuality is not a sin, just a disordered sexual tendency. So, being sexual, or acting on your innate tendencies is sinful for gays but not straights. Being a sexual person means one is allowing one's tendencies to \"dominate one's will.\" Well I am certainly glad you cleared that up. I am not supposed to have, shall we say, uneasy feelings about being called sick?\n \n Why on earth do you think that the Catholic Church is an authority on human sexuality, especially when those ideas are directly contrary to virtually all medical and psychological authorities?\n\n Actually, the Church does not discriminate between homosexuals and heterosexuals when it teaches against sexual sin. Many heterosexuals cannot act on their \"innate tendencies.\" You see, they cannot have as much sex as they want with as many different people as they want. They cannot have sex before marriage/outside of marriage (that is, they must remain celibate at certain times just as would be required of the homosexual who can't \"become\" heterosexual). They cannot masturbate. They cannot look at pornography. They cannot use contraception. Many of these actions would seem like \"innate tendencies.\" But the Church says, \"No. These are disordered tendencies even though they feel natural, fulfilling, loving, and pleasurable...they are counterfeit, fallen tendencies...tendencies due to the concupiscence of original sin.\" \"But man is called to a higher, purer, more virtuous view of sex due to its intimate relation to our relationship with God and reflection of our love with God.\" (see my post #57)\n \n As to why the Catholic Church is an authority on human sexuality, we must go back the distinction between a Christian homosexuality debate and a secular homosexuality debate. In the context of Christian homosexuals, the Church is the conveyor of the Revelation of God. God had things to say about sex as we are told in Scripture and Tradition, and rightfully so, if he is the author and creator of all life and the one with whom we cooperate in creating life through sexual intercourse.\n \n Peace.",

What is the nature of their physical transformation?\n\n They are (mainly) aesthetics/monks who have taken on several physical transformations; they even smell differently.

Theosis means to be illumined and transfigured by God.\n \nA lofty dismissal of anyone who queries your assertions as 'not prepared to consider evidence that upsets their comfort zone' will not do. Assertions are not evidence. If you'd like us to consider evidence, show us some.\n\n I'm not dismissing anyone who queries my assertions. I'm dismissing people who\n a) dismiss my assertions as Trebor has done - it seems rather pointless someone asking me these questions then\n and\n b) being frustrated by people asking me to repeat myself - it seems even more pointless (thus head-bangng) when someone is asking me these questions again and again.\n \n ...in the visible form of our nature the immortal God described the likeness of His invisible Being, and thus we apprehend eternity. Through prayer we enter into Divine life; and God praying in us is uncreated life permeating us. Archimandrite Sophrony (His Life is Mine, Chapter 8; SVS press pg. 66)\n \n To contemplate this [Christ's] glory we must needs be in this glory. Otherwise we cannot see it. To apprehend, even dimly, 'Who this is?' (cf. Matt. 21:10) we must become like Him by abiding in His word. Whoever has not followed after Him in faith; who has not loved Him and therefore has not observed His commandments, cannot pronounce judgment, since he possesses no grounds for forming an opinion.\" Archimandrite Sophrony (His Life is Mine, Chapter 11; SVS Press pg 84)\n quoted at\n http://www.orthodox.net/gleanings/theosis.html",

That is another unfounded belief. \n\n \n No limits to reason? Well, aren't you arrogant. So basically what you are saying is that it is absolutely impossible that we could find something that was incomprehensible to reason? This is totally absurd. Human experience and history demonstrates that there are very many phenomena and situations that are vastly beyond the comprehension of reason, regardless of how much technology or science is involved. The existence of God Himself is not explainable exclusively through reason, but neither is His inexistence. Can you demonstrate yo me that God doesn't exist on a purely rational basis, because if you can, you're probably one of the smartest persons in history, I mean, countless of philosophers have tried and failed at this, from the sophists to the theists like Voltaire, to the positivists like Nietzche and Schopenhauer.\n \n \n Belief in God is NEVER based on reason. Please explain how you make the preposterous assertion to the opposite. \n\n \n Well, since you obviously haven't taken the time to read up on St. Thomas Aquinas, check this out.\n \n The five ways Aquinas presents to demonstrate the existence of God, all based on pure reason. It's pretty interesting reading, I took this from the actual English translation of the Summa, so I haven't added anything or made anything up:\n \n \n\n Objection 1. It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word \"God\" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist. \n \n Objection 2. Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence. \n \n On the contrary, It is said in the person of God: \"I am Who am.\" (Exodus 3:14) \n \n I answer that, The existence of God can be proved in five ways. \n \n The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is certain, and evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion. Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another, for nothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to that towards which it is in motion; whereas a thing moves inasmuch as it is in act. For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from potentiality to actuality. But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality. Thus that which is actually hot, as fire, makes wood, which is potentially hot, to be actually hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not possible that the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in the same respect, but only in different respects. For what is actually hot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot; but it is simultaneously potentially cold. It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that by another again. But this cannot go on to infinity, because then there would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover; seeing that subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the first mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand. Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be God. \n \n The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God. \n \n The third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be, since they are found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they are possible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to exist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not. Therefore, if everything is possible not to be, then at one time there could have been nothing in existence. Now if this were true, even now there would be nothing in existence, because that which does not exist only begins to exist by something already existing. Therefore, if at one time nothing was in existence, it would have been impossible for anything to have begun to exist; and thus even now nothing would be in existence--which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings are merely possible, but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary. But every necessary thing either has its necessity caused by another, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary things which have their necessity caused by another, as has been already proved in regard to efficient causes. Therefore we cannot but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. This all men speak of as God. \n \n The fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among beings there are some more and some less good, true, noble and the like. But \"more\" and \"less\" are predicated of different things, according as they resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum, as a thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that which is hottest; so that there is something which is truest, something best, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost being; for those things that are greatest in truth are greatest in being, as it is written in Metaph. ii. Now the maximum in any genus is the cause of all in that genus; as fire, which is the maximum heat, is the cause of all hot things. Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; and this we call God. \n \n The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God. \n \n Reply to Objection 1. As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): \"Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil.\" This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good. \n \n Reply to Objection 2. Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article. \n",

I don't seem to grasp it.\n \n \nyou cannot prove something doesn't exist.\n\n \n EXACTLY. Therefore, it is absurd to attempt to reason the inexistence of God.\n \n \nYou tell me a rational reason for the belief in god and I would be glad to listen.\n\n \n Believe in God because without that belief the world is lacking of any sense.

   "Aquinas has been refuted? Really? Please give me one satisfactory refutation of St. Thomas Aquinas... \n\n \n Suffice it to say, that philosophy has long realized the futility of trying to prove god's existence. Again with Aquinas, he assumes the existence of something for his proofs to be valid. \n \n \n\n Would you like to please point out to me the illogical inconsistency you see here? I don't seem to grasp it.\n \n EXACTLY. Therefore, it is absurd to attempt to reason the inexistence of God.\n\n \n My point was this. Everything we believe in, we do so with reason. Except religion. We belief in god in the absence of reason. You stated that god cannot be explained through reason, but neither can the non-existence of god be explained. First, I wasn't trying to reason about my lack of belief in a god. Second, it was illogical because one could never prove there is no god, as your subsequent statement asserts. \n \n \n \n \n\n Believe in God because without that belief the world is lacking of any sense. Sartre's final conclusion. \n\n \n Sartre shmartre.\n I do not see how that necessarily follows.\n \"If there is no god, the world lacks sense\" Why?\n \n The common idea that there is no sense or meaning in existence without god is not a conclusion I can follow.\n 1. There can be sense without a god. I see sense in life. I don't believe in god. PROOF!!!\n 2. Who cares if the world has meaning or makes no sense. Maybe it doesn't. It doesn't have to.\n \n If we can get away from proving god, my point was about belief. \n \n I believe it is going to rain today. Why? It looks cloudy and gray and the weather report said so. \n \n I belief that my lungs oxygenate my blood. I have read this in physiology texts. It also seems to make sense based on my other knowledge of science. \n \n How do I know that all these science books are true? Well, they all corroborate each other. No one is disagreeing. I cannot conceive of any logical reason why all these scientists would be putting in all this effort to deceive me. Also, the stuff makes sense to me, given all the other information I understand about the world.\n \n If given new information, would I change my beliefs? Of course, why not?\n \n I pose the following to all you out there that believe the following TWO things.\n \n 1. There is a God.\n 2. The earth revolves around the sun.\n \n If you believe those two things, please state why.\n \n The issue I am trying to understand is why does religious belief differ from all other belief.",

   "Indeed. As God is real (and I merely need to re-state this as you re-state your opinion; I play to my audience) your non-acceptance of this reality means that excepting that God is in fact real, your whole premise is false.\n\n \n Can we raise the argument out of grade school, please. So's your old lady. Pffffft!\n \n \n \n\n Are you saying that everything that there is is potentially knowable? Or do you believe that some things are unknowable? \n\n This is my last response to you about this. I will now repeat for the second time:\n \n \nto be clear - no one is saying there are not things that are beyond our comprehension. That would be an arrogant position. There certainly are limits to human perception and understanding (though, hopefully, we are expanding those daily.) Therefore, there well may be things we cannot comprehend, but that is just the point. If we can't comprehend them, we shouldn't go around saying we know about them for certain. I am willing to be certain on things I can believe based on our wonderful powers of reason.

You have turned his ideas backward. He didn't recommend believing in god. Those existential guys thought existence was absurd, and were perfectly accepting of that. \n God? We don't need no stinking God!!\n \n To quote Norman Mailer's (somewhat humorous) refections on Sartre:\n \n \nSartre, however, was comfortable as an atheist even if he had no fundament on which to plant his philosophical feet. To hell with that, he didn't need it. He was ready to survive in mid-air. We are French, he was ready to say. We have minds, we can live with the absurd and ask for no reward. That is because we are noble enough to live with emptiness, and strong enough to choose a course which we are even ready to die for.
