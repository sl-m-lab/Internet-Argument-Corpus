   "Here is an interesting story about a man with a bullet in his head that the police want as evidence.\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,238267,00.html\n http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/12/21/teen.bullet.ap/index.html\n \n Brings up an interesting question about whether the police can get the bullet out via a warrant. \n \n \nPORT ARTHUR, Texas - In the middle of Joshua Bush's forehead, two inches above his eyes, lies the evidence that prosecutors say could send the teenager to prison for attempted murder: a 9 mm bullet, lodged just under the skin.\n \n Prosecutors say it will prove that Bush, 17, tried to kill the owner of a used-car lot after a robbery in July. And they have obtained a search warrant to extract the slug.\n \n But Bush and his lawyer are fighting the removal, in a legal and medical oddity that raises questions about patient privacy and how far the government can go to solve crimes without running afoul of the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n \n Any thoughts on whether this is constitutional or not? Does this relate to removing drugs found \"in\" the body?",

It is much better to say \"well abortion is bad but hey, its outta my control thanks to those dirty judges\" then to actually take a stand on it and risk getting unelected. In fact, you could say the these new moral judges are making the legislative branch lazy on social issues. Besides, how are you going to solve the problem? Impeach one? It is hard to impeach for something that half congress probably agrees with and half don't (ie half probably like the decisions by the justice that may be impeached and half don't). Finally, since when is it a sign that something is a problem when the congress actually takes action (which some have by the way)? \n \n It just seems that in 200 yrs we should have figured out what a judge is supposed to do.

   "Not what I said. I said they can all enact change; of course their methods for doing so are different.\n Depends what you mean by change...if you mean change in the law then no...that is the job of the legislature. \n \n \nI trully have no idea how you reach that conclusion. The constitution says that searches have to be reasonable, that's all it says, it doesn't define reasonable.\nIt also doesn't define and word so do you believe anything should go? The fact that words have meaning means that \"reasonable\" meant something at the time of adoption. To say the judicial branch can change this meaning contradicts the democratic process. Take the 8th amendment. At the time of adoption the death penalty was around and existed before during and after the adoption of the 8th amendment. So if not cruel then why cruel now? Because some judge said so? I don't recall judges being granted the power to define terms as they see fit. What criteria do you use for such a power? Polls? Other countries? Philosophers? How about the people who adopt the amendment...seems obvious to me. The term \"cruel\" or \"reasonable\" can be changed with one vote in Congress or your state government.\n \n \nThe courts make sure that the constitution is followed, that's what they do. If the legislature passes a law that says the cops can strip search you in public if they think they smell pot, who is supposed to say that that is or isn't a reasonable search if not the courts?\nNo one questions the fact that they make that determination. The question is what is the standard for applying that amendment. One approach is to say it means what the judge feels it should mean...what a tredmendous amount of power (and power not really given to them if you read the federalist papers). You could have 5 judges say strip searching is ok if you think you smell pot...with this philosophy you have no answers to the constitution because it all depends on who you get up there. And you wonder why republicans now want conservatives on the court and democrats want liberals....the answer is obvious!\n \n \nThe courts are there to put a check on the legislature, to prevent them from acting unreasonably. To do that they obviously must be able to say what is or isn't unreasonable. If only the legislature gets to say, then what's supposed to stop them from simply defining anything they like as being reasonable? Do you see why your assertion, if it were true, would give way too much power to the legislature? That's why it is not, if fact, set up that way.\nBut they can do this! The amendments set up a boundary..for example the 8th amendment never allowed torture but did allow the death penalty. So congress can call for torture as a punishment unless it passes an amendment saying so but could get rid of the death penalty and reinstate it. My point is that the constitution sets up these boundaries and they are static. The legislatures can make laws which restrict within the boundries but they can't go outside...however, they can amend the boundries which is a harder process. So that is your check. The other approach (the one I argue against) says the boundaries change....it would be like kicking a field goal with moving goal posts. If they don't have a static meaning then how on earth do you ever now if you are following the law? In a sense you put 9 people at the top and make them god of the country...very democratic :(\n \n By the way, as Scalia once said, this approach doesn\\'t always give you an answer but it gives you most answers...the other approach gives you none. The goal is not to prove my approach is perfect but it prove it is better than any other approach.",
