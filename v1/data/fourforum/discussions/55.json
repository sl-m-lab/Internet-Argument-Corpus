In some states if you defend yourself in your own home against an intruder you have to abandon the property if possable, if you can't you have to take numerious steps backwards warning the intruder before you can legaly shoot. Also some states you can have a gun but you can't carry it for protection. So there is no easy way to factor it all in to the equation. There are few ways to come to a difinitive conclusion unless you take in to account every factor. Though in my state I have been a gun owner for more than 30 years and have watched gun control work since the Bartly Fox laws were inacted and diffrent factors that changed the law and it's meaning. You can corilate the law with homicides and time line and realize that gun control has the opposite effect of it's intent. I have in other debates layed it out and the evidence is conclusive gun control puts everyones lives at risk.",

   "\n \n I don 't really care what you think and as i future law enforcement officer, i am glad that the supreme court will rule in favor of the d.c gun ban in a few months.\n\n \n The lower court decision in Heller striking down the DC gun ban is going to be upheld. I expect the decision will be 9 - 0 to uphold the lower court's decision but I also expect Breyer, Stevens and Souter to only concur in part and write a separate opinion explaining differences based on political and sociological positions. There is going to be an agreement on the fundamental constitutional principle of federal protection of an individual right but their argument will be \"times have changed' so we must apply an \"evolved\" basis of scrutiny. I don't think they will argue an evolving \"living\" constitution, that the \"meaning\" of the Constitution has changed, just that our legal, enforceable adherence to those fundamental principles must yield to modern pressures. (Which of course is BS but they're liberals so we need to give them a break)\n \n After that decision comes down you will need to completely revamp your entire position on how to deal with armed violent criminals. You will need to begin blaming and focusing on armed violent criminals as the cause of violent crime instead of focusing on restricting the rights of the law-abiding. \n \n I realize as a current student in an American institution of higher learning infested with leftist professors this might come as a shock to you . . . \n \n Oh well . . .",

   "I'm sorry Redsoxlvr13 but I must point out you incorrectly cite your cases. \n \n The first case you cite is actually U.S. v. Warin, and it was not a SCOTUS case. It was a decision by a panel of the 6th. Cir. Court of Appeals.\n \n You are correct that U.S. v. Miller was a SCOTUS case. You are incorrect when you claim that it was a collective right opinion. Miller was a bootlegger. He was a private citizen who was not a member of any state militia. If the Miller court wanted to limit the RKBA to only members of state organized militias (as the collective right arguments commands), it would have dismissed his second amendment claim by saying something like this: \"The defendant is not a member of a state organized militia, and is therefore not a member of that class of persons the amendment protects. Therefore, he lacks standing to pursue a claim that his second amendment rights have been infringed.\" \n \n Rather, this is how that Court described the term \"militia\":\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n (Note that one of the \"writings of approved commentators\" cited by the Court was former Justice Joseph Story's work in which he claimed that the right to keep and bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833))\n \n Regarding the shotgun Miller possessed, this is how SCOTUS decided that issue:\n \n \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \"shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" Id. at 178.\n \n Now evidence in cases like this is presented at the trial court level in the district court. In this case, Miller never presented any evidence for his 2nd. Amendment claim. Instead, an activist judge on his own ruled the NFA violated the 2nd. Amendment and invited an appeal. Miller absconded during the appeal process (and unknown the legal minds involved he was murdered before SCOTUS issued its opinion). No one appeared to argue his case for him. The Court heard only from the government. The \"in the absence\" comment that starts SCOTUS' analysis is a clear swipe at the defendant's failure to present any evidence below or even have anyone argue his case for him.\n \n What the Miller court really suggests is private citizens have a RKBA, and that the scope of the right is defined by whether the citizen could prove his weapon is \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" In the end this opinion becomes a foolish interpretation of the RKBA, because it could be read to protect a RKBA in a flamethrower or a bomber.\n \n You are correct that Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886) was a SCOTUS case. You are incorrect when you claim that it was a collective right opinion. SCOTUS did not at any time declare, or even imply, that the individual RKBA does not exist. This was a pre-incorporation doctrine case which held that the 2nd. Amendment, like every other right in the BoR, operated only as a ban against the federal government and was not a ban against state action. \n \n By the way, how does the phrase \"the right of the people\" fit into your collective right interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment?\n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928).",

   "Thats a well constructed paragraph. Im proud of you.\n\n \n Why thank you for the compliment; I know it is a shock that a gun rights supporter can communicate on a level above that of sitting in their own excrement clicking two rocks together.\n \n \nThats your opinion as to what will happen. I don't agree.\n\n \n Are you aware the Court has framed the specific question that it wants to hear argued? \n \n Have you read the briefs?\n \n Did you know 31 states have filed in support of Heller? That's almost enough for a Con-Con!\n \n Did you know 55 Senators (plus the VP) and 250 Representatives have filed in support of Heller? (306 total vs. 18 House members filing for DC emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_xclown )\n \n If DC comes in pontificating about gun crime or how DC residents want the ban or other arguments not related to the direct constitutional questions presented, the Court will cut and dice the DC attorneys.\n \n \nThe supreme court has ruled in favor of the second amendment being a collective right in United States vs. Miller, Presser v. Illinios, but most notably in United States v. Warren. \n\n \n The \"collective\" theory is dead and has never had any life breathed into it by SCOTUS. It is an illegitimate creation of the lower federal courts that only infests their decisions. \n \n The theory was incorrect and illegitimate by SCOTUS precedent when it was first penned in 1942 and is even more wrong today after PRINTZ v UNITED STATES. The 2nd Amendment has never been inspected for illumination of any militia power, federal or state. More importantly, it has never been claimed by any state as an immunity from federal preemption of state militia powers; which is inexplicable if the Amendment had the action the \"state's right\" or \"collective right\" supporters claim. Warin is one of those Circuit court decisions of which I speak, NOT A SCOTUS DECISION.\n \n There is a collective determination in Presser?? That's a hoot! Presser makes it clear that the scope and action of the 2nd Amendment does not speak at all to the states and their militia regulation power. If it did, the Court would have applied the Amendment's scope and restriction on the federal government's \"overreaching\" in deciding an issue of purely state militia power, not the state militia law requiring a permit for an armed march by private citizens. \n \n If the 2nd had the action you claim, SCOTUS could not have heard Presser!\n \n It is clear SCOTUS believes the scope and action of the right protected by the 2nd Amendment is applied to and protects exclusively \"all citizens capable of bearing arms\" who \"undoubtedly\" are \"the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the states,\" and that, \"the states cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms,\". . . \n \n The citizen's right to arms is secured by two layers of federal protection. First, explicitly by the 2nd Amendment and second, simply by the nature of our Constitution and the form of government it establishes. The promise that the Constitution shall forever provide a republican form of government grants the federal government an inferred power to keep that promise . . . To bind a state from acting in an un-republican manner, such as \"prohibit[ing] the people from keeping and bearing arms,. . .\" \n \n Surely the same principle applies to DC, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view. emoticon_smile emoticon_xgood emoticon_smile \n \n DC v Heller can be decided without any reference to the 2nd Amendment because all the 2nd Amendment does is redundantly forbid the federal government to exercise powers that it does not possess.\n \n \nI don't believe I have many leftist professors. I personally have been pounded into fully researching both sides of the arguement and understanding bais\n\n \n Your position belies any claimed full examination of the evidence because your position is unsupportable after a full examination of the evidence.\n \n \nBut you are entitled to your opinion of my education if you want\n\n \n Oh my, thank you so very much.\n \n My opinion remains unchanged.",

Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833))\n\n \n And people also forget that another work cited by the Miller Court as an \"approved commentator\" on this issue was Thomas Cooley's Principles of Constitutional Law. redsoxlvr13 would do himself a favor if he fully examines what the Miller Court endorsed as the meaning of the 2nd Amendment:\n [*]\"It may be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent. The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms, and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose.\"\n It's interesting how the anti-rights side never mentions Cooley or Story or Tucker or Rawle but professes to have undergone a complete examination of the principles behind the 2nd Amendment . . .",

Because they had no evidence they left it open to interpretation and review at a later point in history. Today many manufacturers produce sawed off shotguns for the military and police, therefore if someone was ever arrested for having an unregistered sawed off Remington 870 they would stand a better chance than Miller.\n \n \nAlthough the Miller decision could be interpreted to mean that the ownership of militia type weapons is protected, it doesn't necessarily mean that engaging in such activities as hunting and personal self defense against crime is protected by the Second Amendment.\n \n \n The Miller decision was about whether or not the National Firearms Act of 1934 was unconstitutional or not.

After quoting Miller's \"In the absence of evidence\" paragraph the Cases court says:\n [*]\"Apparently, then, under the Second Amendment, the federal government can limit the keeping and bearing of arms by a single individual as well as by a group of individuals, but it cannot prohibit the possession or use of any weapon which has any reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia. However, we do not feel that the Supreme Court in this case was attempting to formulate a general rule applicable to all cases. The rule which it laid down was adequate to dispose of the case before it and that we think was as far as the Supreme Court intended to go. At any rate the rule of the Miller case, if intended to be comprehensive and complete would seem to be already outdated, in spite of the fact that it was formulated only three and a half years ago, because of the well know fact that in the so called 'Commando Units' some sort of military use seems to have been found for almost any modern lethal weapon.\"\n So, Cases recognizes Miller speaks only of the weapon and whether it has useful military application and thus 2nd Amendment protection. Cases decides if that is the Miller \"rule,\" then it is \"already outdated\" because the shotgun Miller said was not, \"any part of the ordinary military equipment\" could, just 3-1/2 years later, be proved so. \n \n This court offers no reason how or why Supreme Court decisions on constitutional principle are subject to being declared \"outdated\" or how a lower court is to legitimately decide when that occurs or how far that lower court can diverge from a SCOTUS decision because it is \"outdated.\" Cases v US continues:\n [*]\"In view of this, if the rule of the Miller case is general and complete, the result would follow that, under present day conditions, the federal government would be empowered only to regulate the possession or use of weapons such as a flintlock musket or a matchlock harquebus. But to hold that the Second Amendment limits the federal government to regulations concerning only weapons which can be classed as antiques or curiosities,-- almost any other might bear some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia unit of the present day,-- is in effect to hold that the limitation of the Second Amendment is absolute.\"\n So the Cases court recognizes that if the 2nd's protection grows and expands with technology the federal government would only have the ability of regulating those arms that have been superceded by the new \"in common use at the time\" arms. This court now realizes just about any gun is immune from federal controls at this point and it reluctantly but unequivocally says . . . \n [*]\"Another objection to the rule of the Miller case as a full and general statement is that according to it Congress would be prevented by the Second Amendment from regulating the possession or use by private persons not present or prospective members of any military unit, of distinctly military arms, such as machine guns, trench mortars, anti-tank or anti-aircraft guns, even though under the circumstances surrounding such possession or use it would be inconceivable that a private person could have any legitimate reason for having such a weapon. It seems to us unlikely that the framers of the Amendment intended any such result.\"\n And there is the nitty gritty unavoidable, undeniable bottom line of the \"meaning\" of US v Miller. The court expresses how uncomfortable they are with what they imagine to be the inevitable societal implications of the Miller rule being applicable at their present time. But now the judges were faced with a dilemma. The binding precedent could afford them no comfort, the law was a bed of nails. This realization forced them to turn to their only solace, the only place where judges can mold and create what they want to decide like putty, . . . the facts of the case before them. It was time to make some lemonade.\n [*]\"We therefore turn to the record in the case at bar. From it it appears that on or about August 27, 1941, the appellant received into his possession and carried away ten rounds of ammunition, and that on the evening of August 30 of the same year he went to Annadale's Beach Club on Isla Verde in the municipality of Carolina, Puerto Rico, equipped with a .38 caliber Colt type revolver of Spanish make which, when some one turned out the lights, he used, apparently not wholly without effect, upon another patron of the place who in some way seems to have incurred his displeasure. While the weapon may be capable of military use, or while at least familiarity with it might be regarded as of value in training a person to use a comparable weapon of military type and caliber, still there is no evidence that the appellant was or ever had been a member of any military organization or that his use of the weapon under the circumstances disclosed was in preparation for a military career. In fact, the only inference possible is that the appellant at the time charged in the indictment was in possession of, transporting, [FN3] and using the firearm and ammunition purely and simply on a frolic of his own and without any thought or intention of contributing to the efficiency of the well regulated militia which the Second Amendment was designed to foster as necessary to the security of a free state. We are of the view that, as applied to the appellant, the Federal Firearms Act does not conflict with the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n \n Let's review for a moment . . . The Cases court thus far opined that they don't feel Miller created any hard and fast rule to be used by the courts but IF they did, that rule is outdated because almost all guns would be immune from federal oversight. Then they opine on what the founders intent was in securing the citizen's right to arms, of course without one quote or citation. Now they make the incredible leap of stipulating the state of mind of the person claiming a 2nd Amendment right as a condition for protection. The Cases court changed the rules, they required that the person, as a prerequisite to maintaining a Second Amendment claim, have as his intent in using the firearm, essentially his paramount concern, the maintenance and preservation of the militia! If the gun isn't used by the military, its use is only protected if that use is \"in preparation for a military career.\" \n \n The obvious explanation for the Cases decision is the court felt that, as a matter of public policy, any meaningful limitation upon the government's power to restrict private ownership of firearms was unacceptable. The court felt the need to sustain the status quo and decided the case accordingly, opining that the framers of the Second Amendment did not intend it to present an impediment to the government in this regard. That is I feel, the ultimate insult to the framers and the First Circuit.\n \n This case was not decided on the law or precedent or the intent of the framers. It was decided for political reasons, none of which had as their concern, adherence to the Constitution, endurance of the founding principles or the continuation of this Republic.\n \n So, if you (or anyone else) is game for a case by case examination feel fee to rebut my analysis of Cases v US and then read the next case, (a real doozy), but the genesis of the \"state's right\" theory in the federal courts, US v Tot.\n \n Awaiting your reply . . .",

   "Well Brady, I agree with part of what you said: \"Lets see what the courts have to say because they are a better authority.\" For anyone who is interested, the full cite for the case Brady cites is U.S. v. Hale, 978 F.2d 1016 (8th Cir. 1992). \n \n I tracked down a free on-line copy of the full opinion here for anyone who is interested: \n \n http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wbardwel/public/nfalist/us_v_hale.txt\n \n But you should not stop there Brady. The words \"courts\" and \"they\" usually imply usage of the plural, and I recommend that you look at more than one case. You will be particularly interested to read Silveira v. Lockyer, 312 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 803 (2003), for it is undeniably another \"collective right\" opinion. The full text of the opinion can be found here: \n \n http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/661116A4ECB1A7BE88256C8600544DCB/$file/0115098.pdf?openelement\n \n For balance, I would also recommend United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 2362 (2002), which is undeniably an \"individual right\" opinion. The full text of that opinion can be found here: \n \n http://www.publichealthlaw.net/Reader/docs/Emerson.pdf \n \n Finally, I would recommend Shelly Parker, et al. v. District of Columbia and Adrian M. Fenty, 478 F.3d 370 (D.C. Cir. 2007), which became the \"Heller\" case now pending before SCOTUS. The full text of that \"individual right\" opinion can be found here:\n \n http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200703/04-7041a.pdf\n \n Of the 4 cases cited, the last one is the only one SCOTUS has decided to review. The review is limited as follows:\n \n Petition GRANTED limited to the following question: Whether the following provisions - D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.02(a)(4), 22-4504(a), and 7-2507.02 - violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes? \n \n See [URL=&quot;http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-290.htm&quot;]\n \n I ask that you read the additional three cases I cite because they do a fair job of outlining both sides of the individual/collective right dispute we are involved in. I would like to get into a discussion with you on the history and nature of the 2nd. Amendment, if you are willing to do so. \n \n Consider this an invitation, Brady.",

   "\n I want to see the qualifications on Saul Cornell. I remember one noted historian writing a book about how gun ownership was rare in colonial times and he wound up being exposed as a liar and discredited.\n \n\n I'm talking about a different historian than the one you remember. Here's a quote from an article by Cornell:\n \n \"The interesting question for historians is what happened when legislatures enacted laws that severely limited the right to own and use weapons intended primarily for self-defense. During the Jacksonian era, this is precisely what happened as states reacted to a widespread perception that handguns and bowie knives posed a serious threat to social stability. Legislatures acted on this perception by passing the first comprehensive laws prohibiting handguns and other concealed weapons.6 Most of the legal challenges to these gun/knife control statutes were dismissed by the courts, including the case Churchill uses as one of the anchors for his argument, Aymette v. State. According to Churchill, Aymette 'found within the constitutional right to keep and bear arms an individual citizen's right to own guns, grounded in an American rejection of English precedent.' Once again, Churchill's thesis rests on a misreading of the evidence. Aymette's distinction between a right to keep and bear arms only referred to military-style weapons needed for militia service. The court rejected the argument that non-military weapons had any claim to constitutional protection. Churchill's summary of the court's ruling ignores the crucial passage in the court's decision that clearly establishes that the right to keep arms referred to militia-style weapons, not pistols, bowie knives, or other weapons intended primarily for individual self-defense. The court did not mince words when it came to asserting this vital distinction.\"\n http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.1/cornell.html",

   "I'm talking about a different historian than the one you remember. Here's a quote from an article by Cornell:\n \n <SNIP<\n\n \n Cornell is a man on an island of ever decreasing population. His theories have been under constant and foundational evolution as the state / collective \"right\" theory has had the flesh flayed from it. \n \n Any author that must be so self-referential (5 cites in 14 footnotes) has serious problems with substantiating his claims. In the article you quote from Cornell he chooses as his primary target for rebuttal a guy's dissertation that has never been submitted for publication and is not publicly available in any law review archive.\n \n His use of Tucker is amusing at best drawing an illogical conclusion from a rhetorical argument Tucker made as a law professor. \n \n Tucker isn't saying that there is no individual RKBA just that if a state were to choose to arm its citizens that would not be a dangerous thing nor violative of Art I, \u00a78 federal powers. In fact, to consider it dangerous (because those arms could be used against the federal government) would be to belie the fundamental principles of freedom in America . . . Why would putting arms in the hands of citizens be argued as dangerous, after all, Congress had the wisdom of ratifying the 2nd Amendment which secured the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms just for that purpose! Cornell misses the actual topic of the discussion, putting arms in the citizen's hands and argues for the opposite. F'n amazing!\n \n His analysis of Aymette is suspect also . . . I note he does not quote page 158 from Aymette that is usually cited in gun rights cases (i.e., Miller) but chooses a later passage from page 159 that, without the context of the theory laid out two paragraphs before, is subject to the massaging Cornell exercises. On 158 we find;\n [*]\"As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defence, so the arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment. If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights by those in authority.\"\n That passage holds the key to where anti-gunrights people go off the rails. They are taking Aymette's (and Miller's) simple explanation of the \"object\" of the amendment and applying it to the pre-existing individual right merely recognized and secured by the amendment. Re-read the last sentence of the quote above . . . Wouldn't an act of government declaring that only a select, approved class of gun bearers shall exercise the right to keep and bear arms be exactly the type of illegitimate governmental action the citizens should repel?\n \n \"The object for which the right . . . is secured\" does not in any way permit the thought that the provision creates the right or that such reasoning limits the right. No power was ever granted to government to impact the private arms of the citizen so none exists to do so.\n \n All of the individual right extinguishing theories must violate that fundamental tenet; the mindset must be that the right flows from government and the 2nd is merely a permission slip.\n \n That premise is wrong because all the 2nd Amendment does is redundantly forbid the federal government to exercise powers that it does not posses.\n \n Cornell is a hack and so is his lapdog Konig.",
