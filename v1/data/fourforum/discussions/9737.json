   "Democrats are tearing normal society apart\n Al Goodwin, Pittsfield\n \n For the Monitor\n April 08. 2007 10:00AM\n \n I\n have watched in alarm as the New Hampshire Democratic leadership attempts to destroy the normal family and tear apart society as we know it. With all the important issues facing this state, why is this so?\n \n The first volley seemed to be the revocation of parental notification concerning abortions performed on minors. Schoolchildren cannot take a class trip without written parental consent, but now they can have a secret abortion? What a horror!\n \n Now it seems that the Democratic leadership is trying to advance a militant homosexual agenda. This is being attempted by bill after bill advanced and supported with mostly Democratic leadership and sponsorship.\n \n Is the general population aware of what is going on in Concord?\n \n There are now four bills pending concerning \"homosexual marriage\" and four more concerning \"homosexual\" \"rights\" or \"access\" and one concerning the legalization of drugs.\n ---ADVERTISEMENT---\n \n No one has given these people a blank-check mandate to re-engineer society into the moral nightmare of a homosexual Utopia and legalization of drugs. This is being done to favor a minority of a minority of a minority at the expense of normal society. Why?\n \n Normal society, normal families and normal people cannot allow themselves to be deceived and manipulated so easily. There are no facts, no logic and no proof to support a benefit to children, or to families, or to society at large concerning high-risk and destructive homosexual relationships. This activity should not be condoned or legitimized by any government.\n \n The advancement of this agenda should not come at the cost of dismantling the normal family and normal society at large. The social costs will be astronomical. What future is being built for our children?\n \n AL GOODWIN\n \n Pittsfield",

It is largely because of these Christians' loving kindness and forbearance that these things are so.\n \n Even on your editorial pages you can see this. Which group is more tolerant - the Christians or the liberal group who clamor so loudly for tolerance of everything save a God who is real and acts sovereignly in the world today?\n \n The Christian loves the truth, so he's not willing to buy the \"everything is okay to do\" philosophy. He believes certain things are sin. Yet after that check and see. He loves the sinner, including the homosexual, though he is not willing to throw the truth by the wayside or the notion that there is an absolute truth to make a new morality to accommodate a sinner's actions. Christ came to die for that sin if the sinner is willing to forsake his sin and receive Jesus as his savior. There is no other accommodation for sin.\n \n But look at the liberal reaction to the Christian. Do you see hate there? I bet you can.\n \n JOHN DEMAKOWSKI",

   "Faith is an entirely subjective experience. If I don't feel faith toward a particular doctrine or figure, then there is no way that I can be made to feel that faith. The strongest demonstration of this reality was the Protestant Reformation. Luther, Calvin, John Knox, John Wesley, and the others showed by all their activities that they could not be made to share the subjective experience of Catholic faith as described by the Church. When I am asked to respect other people's faith, I actually cannot do that, because I can have no idea of what they are talking about--it is their experience, not mine. The closest I can come to respecting their faith is to respect whatever they say or demonstrate that their faith is, as well as respectng their right to have that subjective experience. Nevertheless, faith, like love or obsession, is a very powerful feeling that sometimes impels people who are having it to attempt to impose it on others by, for example, \"witnessing\" or \"testifying\". To witness or testify is to enter into a social interaction. In most cases, both parties to a social interaction, such as a conversation, agree to it. With social interactions based on faith, though, there can be an element of coercion. Someone who constantly witnesses to his or her subjective experience of faith is like a stalker in that he or she is imposing his or her emotions on others. This is why I am so suspicious of Evangelicals--first, they want you to share (supposedly for your benefit) their subjective state of mind (an impossibility), and then they want you to give them money--to enter into the religion part of the faith/religion duo.",

   "The years 1982-1986 marked the period Pat Robertson and radio and televangelists urgently broadcast appeals that rallied Christian followers to accept a new political religion that would turn millions of Christians into an army of political operatives. It was the period when the militant church raised itself from centuries of sleep and once again eyed power.\n \n \n \n At the time, most Americans were completely unaware of the militant agenda being preached on a daily basis across the breadth and width of America. Although it was called \"Christianity\" it can barely be recognized as Christian. It in fact was and is a wolf parading in sheep's clothing: It was and is a political scheme to take over the government of the United States and then turn that government into an aggressor nation that will forcibly establish the United States as the ruling empire of the twenty-first century. It is subversive, seditious, secretive, and dangerous.[9]\n \n \n \n Dominionism is a natural if unintended extension of Social Darwinism and is frequently called \"Christian Reconstructionism.\" Its doctrines are shocking to ordinary Christian believers and to most Americans. Journalist Frederick Clarkson, who has written extensively on the subject, warned in 1994 that Dominionism \"seeks to replace democracy with a theocratic elite that would govern by imposing their interpretation of 'Biblical Law.'\" He described the ulterior motive of Dominionism is to eliminate \"...labor unions, civil rights laws, and public schools.\" Clarkson then describes the creation of new classes of citizens:\n \n \"Women would be generally relegated to hearth and home. Insufficiently Christian men would be denied citizenship, perhaps executed. So severe is this theocracy that it would extend capital punishment [to] blasphemy, heresy, adultery, and homosexuality.\"[10]\n \n Today, Dominionists hide their agenda and have resorted to stealth; one investigator who has engaged in internet exchanges with people who identify themselves as religious conservatives said, \"They cut and run if I mention the word 'Dominionism.'\"[11] Joan Bokaer, the Director of Theocracy Watch, a project of the Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy at Cornell University wrote, \"In March 1986, I was on a speaking tour in Iowa and received a copy of the following memo [Pat] Robertson had distributed to the Iowa Republican County Caucus titled, \"How to Participate in a Political Party.\" It read:\n \n \"Rule the world for God.\n \n \"Give the impression that you are there to work for the party, not push an ideology.\n \n \"Hide your strength.\n \n \"Don't flaunt your Christianity.\n \n \"Christians need to take leadership positions. Party officers control political parties and so it is very important that mature Christians have a majority of leadership positions whenever possible, God willing.\"[12]\n \n Dominionists have gained extensive control of the Republican Party and the apparatus of government throughout the United States; they continue to operate secretly. Their agenda to undermine all government social programs that assist the poor, the sick, and the elderly is ingeniously disguised under false labels that confuse voters. Nevertheless, as we shall see, Dominionism maintains the necessity of laissez-faire economics, requiring that people \"look to God and not to government for help.\"[13]\n \n \n \n It is estimated that thirty-five million Americans who call themselves Christian, adhere to Dominionism in the United States, but most of these people appear to be ignorant of the heretical nature of their beliefs and the seditious nature of their political goals. So successfully have the televangelists and churches inculcated the idea of the existence of an outside \"enemy,\" which is attacking Christianity, that millions of people have perceived themselves rightfully overthrowing an imaginary evil anti-Christian conspiratorial secular society.\n \n \n \n When one examines the progress of its agenda, one sees that Dominionism has met its time table: the complete takeover of the American government was predicted to occur by 2004.[14] Unless the American people reject the GOP's control of the government, Americans may find themselves living in a theocracy that has already spelled out its intentions to change every aspect of American life including its cultural life, its Constitution and its laws.\n \n \n \n Born in Christian Reconstructionism, which was founded by the late R. J. Rushdoony, the framers of the new cult included Rushdoony, his son-in-law Gary North, Pat Robertson, Herb Titus, the former Dean of Robertson's Regent University School of Public Policy (formerly CBN University), Charles Colson, Robertson's political strategist, Tim LaHaye, Gary Bauer, the late Francis Schaeffer, and Paul Crouch, the founder of TBN, the world's largest television network, plus a virtual army of likeminded television and radio evangelists and news talk show hosts.\n \n \n \n Dominionism started with the Gospels and turned the concept of the invisible and spiritual \"Kingdom of God\" into a literal political empire that could be taken by force, starting with the United States of America. Discarding the original message of Jesus and forgetting that Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world,\" the framers of Dominionism boldly presented a Gospel whose purpose was to inspire Christians to enter politics and execute world domination so that Jesus could return to an earth prepared for his earthly rule by his faithful \"regents.\"",

   "Dominionism\n \n New Webpage - 9 September 2005\n \n Dominionism can be defined as \"the seizure of earthly (temporal) power by the church as the only means though which the world can be rescued; only after the world has been thus 'rescued' can Christ return to 'rule and reign'.\" [1] A more extreme version is Theonomy which seeks to reinstate the Old Testament civil code -- for example, putting to death -- by an electric chair vice stoning -- all homosexuals and gluttons.\n \n This \"Christian Reconstructionism\" is an extremist view whose goal is to eliminate religious freedom by imposing a misinterpreted-Bible-based political, religious, and social order. Any thing outside the interpretation of the very narrowly construed church would be suppressed, with nonconforming Evangelical, main line and liberal Christian churches no longer being allowed to hold services, organize, proselytize, and so forth. Even blasphemy -- however \"they\" want to define it -- would be criminalized. When found guilty, they would be executed -- thus raising the specter of religious genocide. Much of this slaughter of innocents would be justified by a literal and irrational interpretation of the Biblical books of Leviticus and Exodus, just to name a few -- all of this in terms of a \"defense of the faith.\" The difficulty of such a \"defense\" is, as always, in the definition of what constitutes the \"proper faith\".\n \n Katherine Yurica has written an excellent piece of Dominionism [2], in which she notes that the movement now includes in its membership: President George W. Bush, Vice-President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Karl Rove (Bush's chief political advisor), Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, former Vice-President Dan Quayle, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Oliver North (of Contra fame), Pat Robertson (700 Club), Billy Graham, and others.\n \n To give you a sense of the potential horror of this movement, Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court has said that the Bible teaches and Christians believe \"...that government ...derives its moral authority from God. Government is the 'minister of God' with powers to 'revenge', to 'execute wrath', including even wrath by the sword...\" [3]\n \n We are talking here about a seriously deluded, dysfunctional, and demented viewpoint. To say that such advocacy and action to accomplish same is treason and anti-ethical to virtually all systems of moral legitimacy is to damn it with faint praise. The powers that be in Washington, DC represents an out-of-control return to all of the horrors and evils of the Spanish Inquisition. Whether or not the power-mad advocates of Dominionism truly believe in this theology -- as opposed to just using the movement for their own personal agendas -- is not clear. What is clear is that this narrowly focused Christian fundamentalism in America makes the extreme fundamentalists in the Middle East appear relatively tame",

First off, you kind of misread what Judge Marshall said in that case but this really doesn't matter. The courts job is to determine what the law is but this is a far cry from the determining what it will be. Determining what it is implies an established meaning that is to be found. I agree with this. \n \n You then go on to say the constitution is ambiguous which I disagree with. It had a very specific and clear meaning at the time of adoption. The states that voted on it seemed to know what it meant. The general definition of the 1st amendment was understood for some 120 years before a few judges decided it must change. \n \n Anyway, the main point is that you can't go from \"well we don't know what this means\" to \"we don't know what it means so we get to decide what it means based on what we think it should mean\".

   "Why is it inappropriate? In exercising the power of judicial review, the Supreme Court determines \"what the law is\" to quote Chief Justice Marshall from Marbury v. Madison in 1803.\n\n \n Indeed, the Chief Justice is correct. But, this is worlds apart from saying that the Supreme Court determines \"what the law ought to be.\" The Supreme Court has engaged in this throughout history, and has received a great scolding for it. Dred Scott v. Sandford and Lochner v. New York are perfect examples of this.\n \n \nThe Supreme Court was faced with determining the meaning of the establishment clause and how to determine when a state or federal law violates the establishment clause. In 1971, they developed the Lemon test to provide a standard by which they could determine when a law crosses the line and becomes an unconstitutional government intrusion on freedom of religion.\n \n The Supreme Court has developed other balancing tests, to determine, for example, when a discriminatory law violates the 14th amendment due proces and equal protection clauses and when a discriminatory law represents a constitutional use of state power.\n\n \n The court interpreted the First Amendment to have a new meaning in this case, it did not interpret it in its original meaning. That is why its decision was wrong.\n \n The First Amendment had never been interpreted before to require that a law have a \"legitimate secular purpose.\" That may sound nice, and it may even be a good idea. But that was not what the Constitution said in 1971.

   "A few things wrong here. First off, you kind of misread what Judge Marshall said in that case but this really doesn't matter. The courts job is to determine what the law is but this is a far cry from the determining what it will be. Determining what it is implies an established meaning that is to be found. I agree with this. \n \n You then go on to say the constitution is ambiguous which I disagree with. It had a very specific and clear meaning at the time of adoption. The states that voted on it seemed to know what it meant. The general definition of the 1st amendment was understood for some 120 years before a few judges decided it must change. \n \n Anyway, the main point is that you can't go from \"well we don't know what this means\" to \"we don't know what it means so we get to decide what it means based on what we think it should mean\". That is a bit of a stretch.\n\n \n Here is what Chief Justice Marshall said in his opinion in Marbury v. Madison: \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.\"\n \n He was quite clear. He was declaring that it is up to the judiciary to interpret the constitution. He was asserting the Supreme Court's power of judicial review. Throughout U.S. history the Supreme Court has interpreted the meaning of the U.S. constitution. \n \n Did the constitution have a specific and clear meaning at the time of adoption? Hardly. That's why the Supreme Court is regularly called on, through various lawsuits, to interpret its meaning. Let's take the example of the first amendment. What did the framers of the first amendment mean by \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof?\" Some argue that the framers of this amendment meant only that there should be no official national religion. Some argue that the framers meant that there should be no official national religion and also that the national government should give no preference to any one religion. Still others argue that the framers meant to keep religion entirely free of interference by the national government, the idea that developed into Thomas Jefferson's \"wall of separation\" argument. We don't know exactly what the framers of the amendment meant, because no one took notes during the discussions of the amendment and its wording! \n \n We do have an early draft of the proposed amendment by James Madison, who was one of the framers of the amendment. It read as follows: \"The Civil Rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, nor on any pretext infringed. No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.\" \n \n So what were the intentions of the framers with these clauses of the first amendment? People have debated their intentions throughout American history, and people still do. The people who actually rule on what the amendment means are the justices who sit on the Supreme Court. \n \n You call the Supreme Court's interpretation of the constitution \"a stretch.\" But the Supreme Court has been interpreting the constitution since the Supreme Court was created, and certainly since Marbury v. Madison. Yes, they get to decide what it means. That's the power we the people have granted them. Do they sometimes interpret the constitution in ways that we find odious? Yes. That is true whatever our political persuasion, because the Supreme Court has over time made rulings that have upset just about everyone.",

The Constitution has meaning, and it is up to the Court to discover that meaning, not to create new meaning.\n\n \n Actually, the Supreme Court ruling in Lemon v. Kurtzman did not say \"legitimate secular purpose.\" It said only that a law must have a secular purpose. And the ruling in Lemon v. Kurtzman was a ruling that struck down state laws, not federal law. Here is the actual wording from the majority opinion in Lemon v. Kurtzman regarding what came to be called the Lemon test. I am putting the words of the Court in blue here rather than in quotation marks to indicate the quotation: \n \n The language of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment is, at best, opaque, particularly when compared with other portions of the Amendment. Its authors did not simply prohibit the establishment of a state church or a state religion, an area history shows they regarded as very important and fraught with great dangers. Instead, they commanded that there should be \"no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" A law may be one \"respecting\" the forbidden objective while falling short of its total realization. A law \"respecting\" the proscribed result, that is, the establishment of religion, is not always easily identifiable as one violative of the Clause. A given law might not establish a state religion, but nevertheless be one \"respecting\" that end in the sense of being a step that could lead to such establishment, and hence offend the First Amendment.\n \n In the absence of precisely stated constitutional prohibitions, we must draw lines with reference to the three main evils against which the Establishment Clause was intended to afford protection: \"sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\" Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 668 (1970).\n \n Every analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative criteria developed by the Court over many years. Three such tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 243 (1968); [p613] finally, the statute must not foster \"an excessive government entanglement with religion.\" Walz, supra, at 674.\n \n ",

There is a difference between a law that has a secular purpose and a law that seeks to impose someone's religious doctrine on everyone else through civil law. In the case of a law with a secular purpose, the citizens are not forced to adhere to a religious doctrine that may not be their own. \n \n Apparently, you do not see the passage of laws with a religious purpose as a problem. You say that we should let democracy work it out. At least that is how I understand your post. Please correct me if I misinterpret you. So let's imagine a hypothetical scenario. Suppose conservative Christians in a particular state succeed in garnerning 51% voter support for a binding ballot measure that requires the state to pay fully for the funding of previously private Christian schools. The newly passed law would not require the state to fund the schools of any other religion, just Christian schools. \n \n Would this be okay with you, because it was supported by a majority of voters? Surely someone would bring a lawsuit arguing that this law passed by the majority of voters violates the religion clauses of the first amendment.

Here is an article from World Net Daily is regards to Oregons advancement of civil rights of the glbt community; they have scare tactics down to a science, no one does it better. Seems to me they want to impose their view of morality on all of society.\n \n http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55271\n \n \n 'Pagan morality' to go before voters?\n Lawmakers advance 'gay' marriage, mandatory 'attitude' adjustments\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Posted: April 19, 2007\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \n By Bob Unruh\n \u00a9 2007 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n \n A referendum may be needed to allow voters to make the final judgment on the \"pagan morality\" endorsed by the Oregon Legislature's approval of one plan to create \"gay\" marriage and another to grant homosexuals civil rights minority protections, pro-family groups say. \n \n David Crowe, of the Restore America ministry said the referendum is one option being considered following the votes in the state House approving the two plans. The votes were 34-26 in favor of \"gay\" marriage in the state and 35-25 on Senate Bill 2 in favor of granting homosexuals the protected status as a civil rights minority. \n \n \"So one option is a referendum that would put the issues before voters, he said. \"I don't think we can allow this not to happen,\" he said. \"I think the people are outraged. For us as Christians to roll over when there's still another stop to go isn't right.\" \n \n Vernon M. Marks, superintendent of the Oregon Assemblies of God churches, has said the more than 30,000 members of those churches want the plans rejected. He said they would \"violate the very moral and ethical foundations of our culture.\" \n \n He also said the legislation would \"disregard fundamental biblical guidelines for the sanctity of traditional family\" as well has ignore the state's \"overwhelming\" vote to preserve traditional marriage. The legislation itself would create discrimination against parents caring for handicapped adult children as well as parental moral values and convictions. \n \n Lastly, it would \"infringe on the constitutional protection of the free exercise of religion,\" he said. \n \n Crowe said Christian leaders from around the state, including many who worked on the campaign three years ago through which voters decided to limit marriage in the state to one man and one woman, are planning a meeting to discuss the next steps. \n \n \"I have to do something,\" he told WND. \"Someone has to do it, or the Christian community is sending the signal we'll put sandbags around the church but the rest of you are on your own and we'll just watch this moral freefall. \n \n \"That's not really loving your neighbor,\" he said. \"We have the opportunity to clarify to the public what is moral and what is not. \n \n \"We can communicate that we Christians are not stupid and we are concerned about others. These plans affect everybody's free speech, family and religious rights,\" he said. \n \n While more than 55,000 signatures of registered voters would be needed to take that step, Crowe said he collected 12,000 signatures on a petition against the state's Senate Bill 2 in just a short period of time. \n \n A total of about 500 pastors from across the state have gathered to express to the Legislature the opposition of the tens of thousands of Oregonians in their churches to the plans. \n \n John Fortmeyer, publisher of the Christian News Northwest reported that the Legislature gave the appearance of allowing public input, but didn't really allow those comments to change any decisions. \n \n \"Also, PRAY!\" said a message from Marks to the church group's pastors. \"This is possibly the most dangerous piece of legislation to come from Oregon's legislature.\" \n \n The Constitution Party said the plan is a \"recipe for civil war.\" \n \n \"Everyone should read this legislation. It clearly gives those who choose non-traditional sexual behavior preference over those with traditional moral values,\" said state Chairman Jack Brown. \"This legislation will lock religious people inside their church buildings and let perversion occupy the rest of the landscape!\" \n \n Crowe said the first legislative bill simply overturns what voters approved: the status of marriage being limited to one man and one woman. The new plan calls for \"domestic partnerships,\" changed recently from \"civil unions,\" but he said it amounts to the same thing. \n \n The second plan, classifying homosexuals as a protected minority, is \"the most sweeping and culturally devastating law in Oregon history, establishing pagan morality under the guise of a 'civil right,' and imposing it upon all Oregonians under the cover of 'law,'\" Crowe said. \n \n Among its provisions? \n \n \"A clause that talks about developing a program of education to change our attitudes,\" Crowe said. \"To change our attitudes? Is it the government's business to change attitudes? But that's precisely what's in the bill.\" \n \n \n Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski \n \n The plans have been approved by both legislative houses and once minor amendments are approved, they will head for Democratic Gov. Ted Kulongoski, who has expressed support for the plans. \n \n The civil rights changes would give broad new powers to homosexuals and would impact churches, businesses, individuals, school children and others. \n \n Crowe said homosexuals could demand that churches hire them, business owners would be facing huge costs to make \"accommodations\" for employees choosing that alternative lifestyle and schools would be forced to make those accommodations as well as teach the abolition of traditional family values. \n \n The \"civil unions\" plan \"defied the people of Oregon who clearly said in 2004 that they wanted marriage to be between a man and a woman only,\" Crowe said. And the civil rights blessings for homosexuals came from \"a scene of the worst sort of obfuscation, assertion without facts, feelings without wisdom, and political chicanery you can imagine.\" \n \n \"The people of Oregon deserve people in office who respect their wishes, not those of a small minority who wish to impose their morality upon others while forcing acquiescence by using the authority of human law, in disregard of God's Law,\" he said. \"Our next step in opposing these bills is a Referral to the people of Oregon. They have the right to approve or disapprove the actions of the legislature.\" \n \n Crowe said he attended the hearings on the proposals, and Democrats in support of the proposals were unable to answer such questions as what sexual acts would be protected by the civil rights legislation, would pedophiles find new protection from prosecution, and who defines \"sexual orientation.\" \n \n \"[The questions] were so good it made the Democrats look like fools, saying, 'We didn't address that,'\" he said. \n \n The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, praised the action. Executive Director David Fidanque that they would move Oregon towards \"a just society for all.' \n \n \"[Under S.B. 2], it will be legal for a man to walk into a women's shower, locker or rest room, as long as he keeps his underwear on, and anyone who complained (spell discriminate), could be sued under S.B. 2!\" Crowe said. \n \n The need for such a dramatic change, Crowe said, has been documented as unnecessary. While there have been about 170 cases of such same-sex discrimination reported since 2000, a state agency has confirmed the validity of only a handful of cases. \n \n Churches would be exempted under the affirmative action-type program only if the situation \"is closely connected\" to the \"primary purposes\" of the church. Making that determination already would be assigned to the court system. \n \n \"The bill forces Christians and specifically Churches to ACCEPT this lifestyle, not TOLERATE it, that is unacceptable,\" said Kathy, on the Baltimore Reporter blog.",

   "Well, by all means, lets take any fringe group at their word and assume they are right in whom they say they represent. emoticon_wow Let's let the KKK represent white people, for instance. When you dislike or even hate a large group to begin with, it becomes a lot easier to take their fringe elements 'at their word' rather than using some sense and reason.\n\n \n Your selective quoting notwithstanding, I WASN'T advocating for taking a fringe group at their word but making a point that most Christians are fond of referring to Christians as if their particular group or ideology represents \"Christians\". There is no \"Christian\" viewpoint against same sex marriage, for instance, but a \"some Christians\" viewpoint. \n \n The Christian Reconstructionist view, which I identified as one that \"most other people would say [is] on the fringes of Christianity\", which calls for the death penalty for gays in the theocratic society they would like to see come to fruition, is an extension of the same religious \"gay = sin\" ideology that drives all other gay civil rights opposition. The KKK was far less of a \"fringe group\" for instance, when most of society were both complicit and complacent with racism and white supremecists were pillars of society. \n \n Am I saying that Christian Reconstructions represent the majority of Christians? No. But by the same token, would the majority of Christians who are vehemently opposed to gay civil rights say that they represent nothing similar to their own views? Consider the comments on The Chalcedon site about \"The Gay Agenda\" for instance, which includes: \n \n \"\"Gay rights\" is not compatible with our basic civil liberties. The gay agenda cannot be made to stick without abridging free speech or stifling the open profession of Christian religious principles. It's no wonder at all that gay activists have tried, on their own, to impose these restrictions: they are impatient for the government to get around to it. The sin that drives their private behavior drives their political behavior, too.\"http://www.chalcedon.edu/articles/article.php?ArticleID=2699\n \n And I'm sure you've heard of former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, for instance, known for the Ten Commandments monument he installed in the rotunda of that state's judicial building. http://www.chalcedon.edu/articles/article.php?ArticleID=2699\n \n In 2002, Moore wrote a lengthy concurrence in a custody case involving a lesbian mother. After describing homosexuality as \"abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature,\" Moore asserted that \"[t]he State carries the power of the sword, that is, the power to prohibit [homosexual] conduct with physical penalties, such as confinement and even execution. It must use that power to prevent the subversion of children toward this lifestyle.\"  http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=862\n \n If you read the whole article, you'll know what many gay Americans already know -- the history of the hate campaign against them. Included in that history was Anita Bryant's \"Save Our Children\" national campaign in the 70s which distributed a press kit with a paper titled, \"Why Certain Sexual Deviations Are Punishable By Death.\" Homosexuality was, of course, among those deviations. So was \"racial mixing of human seed.\"\n \n Personally I think the paranoia some have over Christian Reconstruction is way overblown, especially nowadays when it looks to me as if the influence of the religious right is waning. But I understand why it may look different to those who already feel in the crosshairs of so much opposition. \n \n JL",

There is no \"Christian\" viewpoint against same sex marriage, for instance, but a \"some Christians\" viewpoint.\n \n \n I think that, when it comes to same-sex marriage, Christians who are for it are definitely the exception and not the rule. But that is beside the point here; if Samiinh thinks that \"dominionism\" (in pushing for true theocracy) is representative of the general Christian view, he's wrong. A hundred links or quotes to \"dominionist\" writings or statements will not prove that. \n \n I think part of the problem here is that people have differing views of what they think \"theocracy\" is. Perhaps it would be beneficial for Samiinh to tell us exactly what he thinks theocracy means. If he thinks of theocracy as leaders who happen to be religious and naturally are going have their convictions guide their actions (as every leader does), then yeah, a lot of Christians are ok with such an idea. After all, that's the way most anyone is. If he thinks of theocracy as a nation where religion supercedes democracy, then no, he is wrong because most Christians don't call for this at all.

And I'm not the only one who thinks so. Consider this book review on what appears to be a Christian site, for instance. http://www.burnsidewriterscollective.com/reviews/books/h/chris_hedges_american_fascists0307.php I hope you really do take the time to read it as I think it will explain better what I've been talking about than anything I might try to say in fewer words. \n \n So, no, you're right, I don't hear of many Christians calling for gays to be killed. But what I do hear is an alleged Biblical \"Christian\" call for legal societal discrimination that appears to be coming from the same rationale as those who would envision such a Christian theocracy where gays would be subject to the death penalty. Without that context, without the power being wielded here by the Christian majority against gays, it would be far easier to see Christian Reconstructionism as a completely dismissable fringe ideology, in the same way we tend to see white supremacists today. \n \n JL",

   "Well your understanding is very flawed. Anyone attempting to impose what you are attributing to all Christians in the name of dominionism are not representing Gods will but purely mans, and oppressive oversight at that. \n\n \n Please show where I have said that Dominionism represents ALL Christians. Let me repeat that -- please show from one of my posts where I have represented Dominionist views as \"all Christians\". \n \n I fully appreciate and respect that there is a huge variety of viewpoints within Christianity. After all, some Christian churches are performing same sex marriages, for instance. \n \n \nI support the death penalty for murderers and child rapists, mass killers and terrorists. Not jaywalkers, pot smokers and people who just refuse to live according to judeo christian ethics.\n\n \n Is it in that latter category that you put gay people?\n \n \nWhy must basic human moral values be tied to religion in all cases ?

Well we used to be a moral country outside of Church in this Country. But now, any reference to morality is regarded as me imposing my religion on you. Further evidence that we have become a totally reprobate society. \n\n \n I think there are \"basic human moral values\" that are NOT tied to religion, though they are probably encompased in most religions. We decide certain things are immoral regardless of religious teaching. We don't need religions to say \"Thou shalt not murder\" to understand we shouldn't murder. \n \n It's \"moral values\" that are specific to a particular religion, that do not fall into the category of \"basic human moral values\" that I am concerned about. Catholic and some Protestant teaching about the meaning of sex (that it should be open to procreation) and the subsequent prohibition of birth control is a specific religious teaching, imo; one that is a matter of personal morality that does not belong enshrined in our collective law. \n \n I think opposition to same sex marriage is in the same category. Iow, religious believers and churches that teach against same sex marriage, are free to do so and act accordingly within their own context. They should never be required to perform same sex marriages, for instance, something which no one is agitating for anyway. But civil marriage, which includes government recognition of other churches same sex marriages not incidentally, is another story. The primary opposition to it is within a \"religious belief\" context. Otherwise, people are primarily balking at change. As the man said, \"The only constant is change\". People who object to same sex marriage because it's just too different, need to consider their fellow human beings who happen to be gay and apply The Golden Rule, imo. And there I am moralizing, you will notice! \n \n \nWell you can judge me all you like but thankfully for me it carries no weight with the true and final judge of all of us.

Not some other group labeling Christians like this but an actual link of the Dominionist group itself.\n\n \n And I do judge you, of course. We all do judge each other constantly in terms of our own idea of right and wrong. It's not our personal judgments of each other that are at stake here though, imo, when it comes to same sex marriage, but rather what should be our society moral value, so to speak. I believe that that should be fairness and equal treatment under the law for gay people. Very simply, anything less is discrimination, sanctioned bigotry and prejudice. Children of gay parents, for instance, should be protected by the same sort of marriage and family laws that protect children of straight parents. Anything less is immoral, imo. \n \n JL",

You do not get to tell me that I have to use the Bible as a moral compass. \n \n \nWhat isn't fine with me is throwing out moral foundations and traditions that are good for society under the false pretense that they inhibit our freedom of religion rights outlined in the seperations clause because they can be found to exist in the bible. \n\n \n What isn't fine to me is clinging to foundations and traditions simply because they are. You have yet to provide a single solid shred of evidence of how gay marriage has or will cause harm, despite being asked by more than one poster to do so. In such cases where tradition has no real tangible value and is trumping someone else's freedom, said tradition can take a hike.\n \n \nAnd that is precisely the argument the secular humanists use to erase any reference to God from the public square. God is not a swear word, nor is his name banned from public use in the Constitution. But if the secular humanist has his way, that is exactly the extreme definition they will use to protect society from Him.\n\n \n You are arguing with your imaginary monster and not me again. \n \n \nThen you support chaos and anarchy. You would typically throw out a lawful society in favor of a jungle that is controlled by the strongest predator. And among humans, the strongest predator is always the cruelest disctator. As usual you haven't considered the end result of your prefered Social Norm. Well hang around a while jito because such a World leader has been prophecied and you are evidence that the masses have been psychologically prepared to receive him when he comes. And the cruelty he will impart on this World will dwarf all of the evil taskmasters combined who have preceeded him throughout the history of the World.\n\n \n And again. \n \n I never said that society should be lawless. I said laws should protect citizens, freedoms and rights. They should not define morality.",

   "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/cont/node/2316\n \n Onward Christian soldiers?\n April 22, 2007 - 12:35.\n * Sandy Price\n \n The subject of prohibitions (abortions, same sex marriages, death with dignity and stem cell research) are all in the minds of many Americans who are very involved in their Christian doctrines. They somehow feel that there is something wrong with being able to make these choices on their own without the government's permission.\n \n How are we as a Nation of Federal Laws, going to enforce the prohibitions being lined up by Christian America? In the past we saw armies of Christians go to battle with Islam in the Middle East by a private army called \"The Crusaders.\" Then followed a group of very religious knights who wandered all over the Middle East and they were called \"The Knights Templars.\" This combination of Christian warriors massacred many innocent people all over the Middle East and was considered \"justified\" as these murders were done in the name of Jesus Christ. We saw Spanish armies rape and pillage through North, Central and South America killing millions as they push their way to find gold.\n \n Have we now seen the beginning of another Christian army this time in America?\n \n Hal Brown did a wonderful commentary on Blackwater and I was so impressed by the information I bought the book and am reading about the development of a private army to protect our American people abroad and now at home.\n \n http://www.capitolhillblue.com/cont/node/2249\n \n I've been taught to follow the money when I see a new system in development and the money for this new private army comes from the billionaire Erik Prince.\n \n Mr. Prince represents a massive movement of Evangelical/Christian groups who have in their agenda to pass all the prohibitions mentioned in my first paragraph. My first question was \"how many Congressmen are involved in this movement and why are they allowing money to be spent on Blackwater instead of funding our soldie'rs safety equipment?\" Is this part of the surge that Bush is pushing in Iraq?\n \n There are too many questions as to why a Christian financed army is needed anywhere to represent America. When the war in Iraq is over, will these private warriors be brought home and put in the Homeland Security to enforce the new prohibitions passed by our federal government?\n \n I've Googled \"Blackwater\" and have read all their good deeds and actions but under the Bush Administration in conjunction with the Christian Coalition, my doubts about the legality and ethics of this, stand out as just another cheap movement to get those prohibitions into our laws. They have the enforcement all lined up and it will put America in the arms of a police state run by Christians. Am I the only one who finds this dangerous? I've listened to a lot of comments about the massacre at V.T. and the words \"Festering Anger\" popped up several times.\n \n Where does this festering anger come from? Some say the hypocrisy found in the corruption in the White House. I'm upset by it but am working to find solutions to stop the rage and, hopefully the corruption, in America. There is anger in all of us when our dreams of individual freedoms die in our government and then in our local laws and then in our schools and homes.\n \n The thought of an armed Christian Crusade representing America abroad and at home would be the final straw in breaking down the Constitution for all Americans. No one American can act against such a movement but a team of active Americans can stop this utter nonsense from developing.",

The reasons are just as illogical and rigidly ideological in those cases where it does not involve religion.\n \n \nI'm of the theory that a lot of what is behind opposition to gay people is not so much religion, but basic human aversion toward things that don't fit one's sexuality. The ick-factor gone bad, so-to-speak.\n\n \n I don't believe it's that. The opposition is the result of social conditioning. I'm gay and I wouldn't say I have an aversion or opposition to straight people and their sexuality. I don't find it icky. I accept it. It's just not who I am. I've met many so-called \"cool\" straight men who feel the same way about gays, or who have had their minds open up very easily when I explained to them about who I am. I've watched as everything they were pre-taught that was negative about me fall apart, as they came to know me.\n \n Homophobia in my own Canadian society, and I think in many European societies takes on more subtle forms and is less entrenched when compared to some circles in U.S. society. Having travelled, I've noticed this. General politeness and a less homophobic culture are probably both at play in the Canadian and European societies I mentioned, which are both social factors.\n \n \nHomophobia, I suspect, is probably natural to some degree and maybe even genetic to some degree.

No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay.",

   "Show me where Jesus teaches us to tolerate sin ? Jesus told everyone He healed or dealt with to go and SIN no more. And according to His own definition of sin mind you. Not according to their worldly standards. So to attempt to paint Jesus as some all accepting non judgmental acceptor of the status quo or popular culture is to corrupt Him like you corrupt everything else you attempt to define according to your own comfort zones.\n \n The only truths you know are the truths of this World, and this World is dead spiritually, so what does that make any and all who follow it ? Three guesses and the first two don't count. \n \n What you fail to understand, all of you who label me a hater and a bigot is that I am the only person here who is truly loving you as Jesus did. I'm not massaging your ego and endorsing your sin like every feel good liberal out there who thinks by accepting you for who you are is loving you. I'm telling you the truth from Gods perspective which is the only perspective that will count at the judgement. I have shared the Gospel of salvation and you've thrown it back at me like I'm lording it over you and not openly and freely sharing it.\n \n You reject the good news as if its a curse, and you embrace the curse as if it's the treasure. Further proving that what is wrong, is actually right in your eyes. And what is right, is actually wrong to you. The perfect definition of the darkness and the reprobate mind which the bible promised would infect the last generation of this AGE, which scoff as you may, we are near the end of now and you are part of the proof of that end.\n \n Now rather than hear what I'm saying and take it as a sincere warning that it's meant to be. You will hate me for saying it and take it as me cursing you. But I have no power to curse or condemn anyone. If you reject the messengers God sends you though as you scoff and mock them as lunatics, you just prove that the truth is not in you and you hate it as you hate the light.\n\n \n There is so much here about non-acceptance being for a gay person's benefit. Acceptance \"for who you are\" is not love, non-acceptance is love, according to these beliefs. It goes against everything humans reason is good and healthy. It asks gays to embrace non-acceptance. Yet we are the ones who are \"reprobrate\", and embracing darkness as opposed to your peculier brand of sweetness and light? I don't think so.\n \n At any rate if this is what your God tells you, it will never be my God. I guess we will find out, or no. We will see if I am either not accepted for who I am or else judged and punished for being who I am, if your \"loving\" God is the true God. I'm okay with my choice to accept who I am and live the way I do.",

   "Its most common form, Dominionism, represents one of the most extreme forms of Fundamentalist Christianity thought. Its followers, called Dominionists, are attempting to peacefully convert the laws of United States so that they match those of the Hebrew Scriptures. They intend to achieve this by using the freedom of religion in the US to train a generation of children in private Christian religious schools. Later, their graduates will be charged with the responsibility of creating a new Bible-based political, religious and social order. One of the first tasks of this order will be to eliminate religious choice and freedom. Their eventual goal is to achieve the \"Kingdom of God\" in which much of the world is converted to Christianity. They feel that the power of God's word will bring about this conversion. No armed force or insurrection will be needed; in fact, they believe that there will be little opposition to their plan. People will willingly accept it. All that needs to be done is to properly explain it to them.\n \n All religious organizations, congregations etc. other than strictly Fundamentalist Christianity would be suppressed. Nonconforming Evangelical, main line and liberal Christian religious institutions would no longer be allowed to hold services, organize, proselytize, etc. Society would revert to the laws and punishments of the Hebrew Scriptures. Any person who advocated or practiced other religious beliefs outside of their home would be tried for idolatry and executed. Blasphemy, adultery and homosexual behavior would be criminalized; those found guilty would also be executed. At that time that this essay was originally written, this was the only religious movement in North America of which we were aware which advocates genocide for followers of minority religions and non-conforming members of their own religion. Since then, we have learned of two conservative Christian pastors in Texas who have advocated the execution of all Wiccans. Ralph Reed, the executive director of the conservative public policy group the Christian Coalition has criticized Reconstructionism as \"an authoritarian ideology that threatens the most basic civil liberties of a free and democratic society.\" \n \n This sounds just like you Archie.",

   "Specific beliefs include\n 1. A rejection of Antinomianism: the belief that salvation is obtained totally through faith and not through performing good works and living a moral life\n 2. Presuppositionalism: the acceptance on faith that the Bible is true. They do not attempt to prove that God exists or that the Bible is true.\n 3. Inerrancy: the belief that the Bible, as originally written, is totally free of error.\n 4. Postmillennialism: the belief that Christ will not return to earth until much of the world has converted to Christianity. This will not take place for some considerable time; it will not be a painless transition. Most Fundamentalists and other Evangelists hold to a different view. They are Premillenialists and believe that all (or almost all) of the preconditions of Christ's return have been met. They expect Jesus' second coming to occur very soon.\n 5. The 613 laws contained in the Hebrew Scriptures' Mosaic Code can be divided into two classes: moral and ceremonial. Christians are not required to follow the ceremonial laws, because Jesus has liberated them from that responsibility. However, all persons must follow those moral laws which were not specifically modified or cancelled by further revelation --generally in the Christian Scriptures (New Testament). In contrast:\n 6. Non-reconstructionist Christians generally divide these laws into three classes: moral, civil and ceremonial law, and generally believe that most Old Testament laws are no longer binding on Christians.\n 7. Jews generally believe that the Mosaic Code is binding only on Jews.\n 8. The moral laws given by God to the ancient Israelites reflect of God's character, which is unchangeable. Most of the laws are intended for all nations, cultures, societies, religions and all eras, including the present time. However, there are a few laws, in such areas as personal safety and sanitation, which are no longer applicable because of changes in architecture and sewage disposal. These do not need to be obeyed.\n 9. The primacy of the Hebrew Scriptures, relative to the Christian Scriptures (New Testament). All of the Hebrew Scriptures' non-ceremonial laws are still in force, unless they have been specifically rescinded or modified by verses in the Christian Scriptures. \"Only if we find an explicit abandonment of an Old Testament law in the New Testament, because of the historic fulfillment of the Old Testament shadow, can we legitimately abandon a detail of the Mosaic law.\" 3 This is largely supported by their interpretation of Matthew 5:17:\n \n \"Do you think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\" (NIV)\n \n 10. Civil laws must be changed to match the Bible's moral rules. That is, anything that is immoral (by their standards) is also to be criminalized.\n 11. The only valid legislation, social theory, spiritual beliefs, economic theory are those derived from the Bible\n 12. In every aspect of life, there are only two options: God-centered or man-centered; Theonomy or autonomy. Their political goal is to ban the latter, everywhere. Each individual, family, church, government and society must be reconstructed to eliminate sin. Each Christian has the responsibility to contribute to this conversion.\n b13. They oppose inter-faith, inter-racial, and same-sex marriages. R.J. Rushdoony wrote about opposition to:\n \n \"inter-religious, inter-racial, and inter-cultural marriages, in that they normally go against the very community which marriage is designed to establish.\" 4\n \n Rushdoony's condemnation of inter-racial marriage appears to have been his own and unrelated to the biblical text. It was not shared by other Reconstructionists.\n \n 14. Reconstructionists regard the Gods and Goddesses of all other religions to be \"the devil,\" and their teachings to be false. They would attempt to replace all religions with their version of Christianity. For example, David Chilton wrote about Judaism:\n \n \"The god of Judaism is the devil. The Jew will not be recognized by God as one of His chosen people until he abandons his demonic religion and returns to the faith of his fathers--the faith which embraces Jesus Christ and His Gospel.\" 5\n \n \n Are these not the same beliefs you hold and preach to us each day?",

   "Air Force Academy Debate: Role of Religion in the Military\n \n Reported by Mike Conneen\n \n mconneen@fox21news.com\n \n Tuesday, the Air Force Academy hosted a debate on the proper role of religion in the military. An Academy law professor moderated and two prominent speakers from either side of the issue participated.\n \n The debate will have no influence on military policy, but it could have an influence on opinions in the military.\n \n Academy alum Mikey Weinstein said he demanded to speak at the Academy, because he said Christian groups like Focus on the Family have free access there.\n \n The Academy agreed to let him speak, but in a debate format. Weinstein said he does not want to take religion out of the military. However, he said there is a time and place for it.\n \n Weinstein said, \"We have a Christian Taliban within our U.S. military, the pentagon has become the penacostalgon and this administration has turned the Department of Defense into a faith based initiative.\"\n \n Weinstein believes non-believers in the military are no longer protected by the separation of church and state. He said, \"I'm sad to report to you today as I come to you with the gun smoke in my face from this battle, that that wall is nothing but smoke and debris.\"\n \n During duty day or duty night, he argued no service member should be allowed to force or coerce other service members to accept a religious faith.\n \n He said, \"Dominionist Christianity praying and preying on non-Evangelical Christians saying you know what, you're not Christian enough.\"",
