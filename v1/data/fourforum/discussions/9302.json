   "Considering that a major majority of the US public is dissatisfied with our Iraq involvement, current administration faces a serious political and possible legal dilemma. To not make immediate reductions in troop numbers or other actions indicating an effort to extricate the US from Iraq in the near future will drive even more moderate Republicans and independents to support Democratic investigations as to how we got there, why we're there and why we're not leaving.\n \n From an administration point of view, their historical legacy now depends entirely on what happens in Iraq and to a lesser extent US economics over the next 18-months. Do they increase US presence in Iraq in an attempt to achieve victory for a thoroughly corrupt Iraqi government pursuing revenge against the former ruling party? We actually don't have the ability to accomplish that as estimates have been and are 3-400k US troops to successfully occupy Iraq and quell the violence. \n \n All reports I've read about the new Iraq government being capable of governing itself by fielding a military and civilian police force effective to a point of controlling insurgency and common crime are negative, suggesting it will take years of building management structure and loyalty while eliminating corruption. To complicate that process, Kurds have their own military and will not share their oil resources just as Northern Shiites refuse to share their oil resources, leaving Sunnis with no potential wealth for reconstruction, encouraging increased violence with Sunni Sauds supporting insurgency. \n \n Last but not least is the US economic impact of reducing military spending in Iraq. The US economy is primarily dependent on consumer and government spending facilitated by debt. Any serious drop in consumer confidence will affect US ability to peddle US debt in those countries who currently support our spending binge by selling their products here. Staying in Iraq is now a public political issue. A US economic slow down will put enormous public pressure on the new congress to reduce military expenditures for a yet to be defined 2007budget. \n \n I think it will be extremely difficult for current administration to successfully use the current refocus of defining Iraq as a central theater for a war on terrorism as a rationale for continuing a fruitless Iraq effort now under very close scrutiny by congress and the American public. Beyond a now small core of a party dogs, blind patriots and the usual self-serving political interests, that card won't play. A new attack on the US by al Queda would only reinforce public opinion that Iraq was a classic blunder and waste of US resources. \n \n I've always said write the check and leave, but I'm a business person, not a politician or supporter of unilateral US aggression.",

Iraq would only be the front line. Their further insinuation that they might use their oil to influence the situation pretty much seals things. While some have theorized that what they meant by this was that they woudl pump so much extra oil that it would drive the price down to insanely low levels, thus hurting Iran, any reasonable person recognizes that they have been producing at capacity...they certainly do not have the capacity to drive the price of oil anywhere. \n \n Keeping that in mind, thers is really only one way theri comment cna be taken....they are threatening to shut off the tap, driving our energy costs through the roof, if we bail on Iraq before we have done something to clean up our mess. \n \n Short of ethnic cleansing of the Shia population, it looks like we will be in Iraq for a very, very long time.",

These clowns are putting the US in the position of maintaining Iraq at greatly increased US expense while the Arab Gulf monetary union creates a single currency to displace the petrodollar. Does it get any dumber? Bin Laden's group has to be ecstatic.\n\n \n \n The truly sad thing is that all of this was entirely foreseeable from day one. It is not like we can look abck and say \"hindsight is 20/20\" There was no hindsight invloved, just a reasonable, basic understanding of the situation. \n \n Fortunatly for the Bush administration, and unfortuantly for future generations of Americans, most Americans don't seem to pay much attention to them dard foreigners. Their edjamacation just doesn't cover things like that. After all, only America matters, right? And since we are obviously the best, everybody on the planet is lining up to emulate us...all they need is the chance.\n \n Nothing says \"absolute power\" like having saudi arabia boss you around.\n \n I think the fact that theya re pushing ahead with their monetary union pretty much signals the fact that the states involved have decided that the US is not the threat it has been in the past. \n \n The monetary union is looking more like a threat, even with Oman pulling out (not actually pulling out, just delaying entry). While 5 years ago there were assurances from the gulf states that they woudl not require oil payments in the new currency, those assurances have dried up. Saudi Arabia has openly stated that they would \"encourage\" payments to be made in the new currency. With the sauds, \"encourage\" generally means \"do it or you get no oil\". \n \n From what I have heard from arab bankers (or what passes for arab bankers), there is a great deal of debate as far as how much of the new currency they can generate. If all member states switch to the new currency for oil payments, they can print trillions, all of it inflation free, becuase other nations will be forced to carry the new currency in their reserves in order to pay for oil. Such specualtion was not welcomed prior to the Iraq invasion because the member nations were afraid of being \"liberated\". Now the new currency seems to openly be linked to a shift in power from the west to other regions, and the arabs see a place for themselves there. With a large percentage of the worlds manufacturing capacity now in Asia, and a large percentage of our energy being supplied by the ME and Africa, people there are startign to wonder why the west shoudl rule the world. If those in the west are not going to DO anything, or produce anything but headaches and paperwork, why should the west not suffer the famines while the more productive parts of the world rule it? \n \n While I am certainly not a big fan of a shift when it comes to global influence (since I am an American and enjoy living int he most wasteful society the world has ever seen) there do seem to be some structural deficiencies in our system, and it seems likely that we will see some corrections. In the never ending battle between the haves and the have nots, the haves only get to keep what they have as long as they outperform the have nots.",

Democracy doesn't have to be perfect anyway, it just has to be better than anything else.\n \n \n That leads to an interesting dillema.

Do you intend to take credit for the British conversion from a monarchy as well??\n \n \nThe biggest problem I have with the US (and this applies to you too Europe) is that we don't have a clue about other cultures. This is why we complain about outsourcing and why we demand having all these things and demand unrealistic wages and demand so much and get mad when we don't get it. The citizens of the US are the children of a rich guy who yell and scream at \"daddy\" until he/she gets her way. So of course we would say \"become a little America\" because we thought they were exactly like us...they have internet, 3 cars, 5 bedroom house in the 'burbs and a blonde haired wife. What's that?

I find myself agreeing with you on the expectation of invading nation's expecting gratitude for the changes imposed on conquered nations. \n I personally have higher expectations of Americans than you suggest. \n If Iraqi and terrorist insurgents eventually succumb to the coalition or an Iraqi democratic government force how does that insure control over Iraqi resources? One difference in the results of Roman, British excursions and American is that America has never caused the defeated nation to pay taxes.\n Also, I don't view a foothold in the ME as a negative considering the fact that a murderous attack that surpassed in effect the attack on Pearl Harbor by a true military, developed in said region. The rhetoric that comes daily from Iran suggesting that America and it's Jewish allies must be removed from the face of the earth seems to justify the existance of a base of operation.\n It is good that you so diligently hold the feet of America to the fire, but we must not lose sight of the hatred that seethes from her potential enemies.",

The US didn't concentrate on deterring Iranian development of nuclear power until Iran announced intent to establish their bourse that would bypass USD exchange for oil in favor of the Euro. \n\n \n I agree entirely. Saddam started refusing dollars not long after the oil for food program was started. The US STRONGLY opposed allowing him to do so, but other nations could see no reason to stop him from demanding Euros. We had inspectors ont eh ground for a long time, certainly long enough to make it pretty clear that there were no WMDs. The Iraqis turned over literally truckloads of documents, and the biggest disputes that seemed to be coming up had to do with whether american CIA agents who were posing as weapons inspectors had the \"right\" to wander around during their off time and collet targeting informmation, and who should pay for communications towers that the UN inspectors were using.\n \n It was pretty clear that if the UN weapons inspectors had been allowed to continue, Iraq would have been declared WMD free and sanctions would have been lifted. The inspectors only asked for TWO WEEKS, and we could not give it to them.\n \n Considering the dwonward slide fo the dollar and value disparities, Saddam was essentialyl making 15% more on his oil by dmeanding Euros than other countrie were who were being paid in dollars. If we had lifted sanctions and he had started to rebuild capacity, European countries would have flocked to buy his oil, since there are definate advantages to buying oil in your own currency, and other oil producers could not possibly have ignored the benifits he was seeing.\n \n Instead, we invaded and kileld half a million people. I think it was as much a matter of stopping Saddam as it was a message to other oil producers...keep the dollar or be \"liberated\". Unfortunatly, the plan backfired because the invasion ahs been so costly to us that other nations seem to see the threat of US invasion as a joke...they know we can not afford to do it.",

At that time the US military was considered almighty and Iran backed down from accepting Euros for oil. Since the US failure in Iraq and acceleration of US economic problems, Iran is now prepared to go forward with their bourse and Russia now accepts Euros for oil. The advantage for European nations (and others) in paying for oil in Euros is reducing USD reserve requirements as their trade outside of oil is completed in Euros, not declining value USD. \n \n When the link was published the Euro was new and at .82 to the dollar.

   "In four years of war I have never heard about Hussien's attempt to trade in Euros rather than dollars. The odd thing about these accusations of vieled imperialism is that after the Democrats voted \"with\" the president for action in Iraq and then changed their minds, that seemingly vital point was never mentioned. I believe that Senator Kerry, who was certainly bold in his choices of ammuntion to use against current administration would have no qualms about tossing that around as it would have been difficult for current administration to defend were it true. The Europeans and the press would have gladly shared that info with the public.\n\n \n \n Yes...because John Kerry woudl really like to see the dollar fall like a rock, trasnforming the Us into a third world country overnight. Obviously that is what ALL non bush worshipers want. There has been muc written abotu it in the european press. The Us press does not seem to be real big on sharing it with the people of the US. They get much better advertising revenue when they say \"everythign is good...spend spend spend!\n \n A few links abotu Saddam selling oil in Euros and possible reprocussions:\n \n http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Iraq/Iraq_dollar_vs_euro.html\n \n \nIn November 2000, Iraq began selling its oil in euros. Iraq's oil for food account at the UN was also in euros and Iraq later converted its $10 billion reserve fund at the UN to euros. Several other oil producing countries have also agreed to sell oil in euros-Iran, Libya, Venezuela, Russia, Indonesia, and Malaysia (soon to join this group). In July 2003, China announced that it would switch part of its dollar reserves into the world's emerging \"reserve currency\" (the euro).\n\n \n that is actually a pretty good article. It explains dollar hegemony pretty well. \n \n http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/oil1.htm\n \n http://observer.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,896344,00.html\n \n Iraq nets handsome profit by dumping dollar for euro\n \n \nA bizarre political statement by Saddam Hussein has earned Iraq a windfall of hundreds of million of euros. In October 2000 Iraq insisted on dumping the US dollar - 'the currency of the enemy' - for the more multilateral euro. \n The changeover was announced on almost exactly the same day that the euro reached its lowest ebb, buying just $0.82, and the G7 Finance Ministers were forced to bail out the currency. On Friday the euro had reached $1.08, up 30 per cent from that time. \n\n \n http://www.oicu2.com/afc/oil.html\n \n Might I suggest that in the future, you might try googling things before asking for help? Many of your post seem to indicate that you are not very well informed. They make it appear that you lack a lot of common knowledge. Post like that sometimes curb the desires of others to respond to you. This is, after all, a deabte forum, not an \"educate people who were not paying attention\" forum. It can be extremely tiresom to start with the very basics in order to get a debate going. \n \n Google is a wonderful tool. For example, in this case you could have put in \"Iraq oil dollars euro\" and it woudl have immediatly netted you thousands fo articles about Iraqs switch form the Dollar to the Euro for oil payments, including its potential consequences.",

It is a militant liberalistic ideaology (that is american liberal, not traditional european liberal). \n \n So, in short, NO, berating others complete ignorance of topics they obviously feel they have a firm grasp on has never been a liberal trait.

Invaded an ally? Who???? Kuwait was certainly not our ally. In fact, it is generally held (and has been admitted by bush 1) that Saddam was given permission by the US to invade Kuwait and take their northern oil fields. Saddam got into hot water becausee the silly boy did not stop with the oil fields, he took the whole country. He overstepped his bounds, which led to a major outcry from saudi arabia, whihc meant we had to smack him down both for overstepping the boundries we had set and so we could maintain our close ties with the totalitarian despots running Saudi Arabia. \n \n \nActually going as far as to suggest that Hussien actually did things \"for\" his people. Your let leftwing websites provide your so called knowledge. All they provide you is fodder for your hatred. \n\n \n Again, an emotional appeal based on complete and total ignorance. Compared to the rest of the middle east, Iraq was an enlightened garden spot. BY FAR the most \"western\" of ME nations. Women there drove, voted, and held jobs. Nobody went hungry in IRaq, as opposed to other nations in the ME, like our allies the sauds, where people literally starve to death in the streets outside of palaces. \n \n Was Iraq a nice place by our standards? Hell no...but considering the alternatives, it was pretty nice.\n \n \nI understand that you must respond with fire. or ignore this as you have threatened.

I have no doubt that Jims Trucking was a staunch conservative supporter in earlier years, before becoming a neo fascist. What gets me is how easily the shift was made considering the VAST differences between the neocon and conservative ideologies. On the one hand you have conservatives, who traditionally have stood for fiscal responsibility, personal freedoms, personal responsibiity for leaders (i.e you impeach the SOB who lies us into a war that is fiscally disasterous), and limited government. \n \n It was a good plan.\n \n The neocon, on the other hand, seems to value large government, scoffs at personal freedoms, and has no conception of fiscal OR personal responsibillity. The democrats have not changed, but the neocons are so far out there that even the democrats, who have always been loose when it comes to fiscal responsibility and have always tended towards the totalitarian side, are stepping back and saying \"enough is enough...fascism and this wild spending is just going a little too far\".",

Posts denying current US difficulties from those driven by patriotism alone merely serve to reinforce my impression of that portion of the general public still being clueless and locked in to party dog affiliation claims of 'the other party' being at fault. \n \n 2. As I've pointed out in this thread and others, there are posters who cling to WMDs still being in Iraq, Iraq is now a functioning democracy, we're doing good things in Iraq, everything will be fine in Iraq when all the insurgents are dead and other dream world slogans based on current US administration policies. 2a. All this with world and majority US opinion being against those policies while the Sauds announce they'll support those insurgents and break us with energy costs if we don't fix what we've broken. I don't believe those posters who defend current US domestic and foreign policy have any consideration for themselves, their children, grandchildren or other Americans, their carefully manipulated blind patriotism overcoming all semblance of reality. \n \n 3. Again, I don't hate current administration, I wouldn't waste that effort on any politician(s). I've known too many on personal and professional levels and most are in it for self-serving purposes, power and money or both. That's simply the way our system works. As any lobbyist can tell you, all a change of administration means in contemporary US politics is changing the names on the checks. Current administration just happens to be the sleaziest and most inept I've ever experienced from Ike on and pointing out their gross mistakes is child's play.\n\n \n 1. True. the absence of fiscal responsiblity will come back to haunt America. \n At some point someone will pay the price for the big spree. But, it won't be as devastating as the big crash. Technology and resources and the abused and inadequate welfare system are the safeguards. As long as America has it's own resources, mainly rich soil that produces more than enough food products. The economic catastrophe can be forestalled. All it needs is the absence of panic from wall street. \n \n 2. Since this is the first time my fingers have typed the letters \"WMD\" in this forum I feel exonerated. Hussein had every intention to defy the U.N. and the U.S. at every opporitunity. His people were being killed on whims. I base my opinions on the current conditions in Iraq on conversations with Meelad, a resident of Basrah. Who lost family under Hussien and by insurgents. I consider the Iraqi people worthy of the attempt of our \"all volunteer military\". \n Democracy in Iraq is in turmoil. Democracy in the U.S. is in turmoil. Turmoil is in the nature of Democracy as it allows for conflict and descension. \n 2a. Majority does not absolutely equate to \"right\". \n World opinion that does not give consideration to conditions of people within nations who threaten to support our enemies need their motives explained.\n Threats by Saudis should create a rally of those \"world opinions\" to support a movement that could change the Arab world. \n Carefully manipulated/blind patriotism?\n Posters supposedly not taking themselves, their children and grand children into consideration may actually be including the welfare of others (non white, non Americans) in thier considerations. Freedom, or something closer to it than Sharia Law is worth the lives and the monetary cost. Would be easier with world support. \n 3. Probably right, but Johnson's administration is probably worthy of a closer look. \n 4. Hoping that Americans will come to their economic senses and conduct themselves or demand fiscal responsibility of it's governing bodies seems to be more of a dream than optimism for a victory in Iraq.",

   "jim's trucking", 
   "Ahhhhhh the good 'ol days LOL. I remember being run out of town with a pitch fork and banned for being the \"Canadian\" that disagreed on Iraq.\n \n If only I could track down half of those knuckleheads now. Oh how I would love to watch them squirm. I suspect more than half would fall into the \"jim's trucking\" mode though and simply stand pat in the face of reality.\n \n Waxy\njim's trucking doesn't abandon principle when faced with the reality of unpredictable warfare...all warfare is unpredictable. jim;s trucking doesn't disagree that this war has gone badly. jim's trucking believes the enemy was encouraged to persevere and expand their violent attacks by the anti-American, anti-war rhetoric spewing from wellmeaning but overly zealous enemies of the current admin, the rhetoric being more political than sincerely humanitarian. Let me see, that kind of #### came from several members of this board...following right down the line the speaking points of such great Americans as John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, Michael Moore and many other socialist, ultra-liberal political hacks.\n \n jim's trucking also believes that these hindsight-braggarts will sing a new tune when they discover that appeasement and 'writing a check and pulling out' are equal to handing the terrorists the blade with which to slit our throats. Terrorism is not going to become uncommon until most of the terrorists are dead.\n \n \nPolitics in the US have reached new heights of insanity. Just 10 years ago, gman would have posted things like this and everybody on the forum would have recognized him for what he is, a totalitarian socialist. Anymore, with the neocons taking the whitehouse, the fascists and socialists have come out of the woodwork, claiming to be conservatives and (much to the chagrin of traditional conservatives) given the illusion that the nation is evenly divided between their totalitarian socialist agenda and the democratic socialist agenda of the traditional american liberals. \n \n As the last set of elections showed, that is no the case. There are still people in this country who do not particularly care for socialism, and certainly do not care for the fascist elements that the neocons have brought to washington.\n \n This has been one of the more interesting political transformations in recent times. The neocons DID pick up some traditional conservatives...mostly those who were not well enough informed to understand why they agreed with the conservatives. I have no doubt that Jims Trucking was a staunch conservative supporter in earlier years, before becoming a neo fascist. What gets me is how easily the shift was made considering the VAST differences between the neocon and conservative ideologies. On the one hand you have conservatives, who traditionally have stood for fiscal responsibility, personal freedoms, personal responsibiity for leaders (i.e you impeach the SOB who lies us into a war that is fiscally disasterous), and limited government. \n \n It was a good plan.\n \n The neocon, on the other hand, seems to value large government, scoffs at personal freedoms, and has no conception of fiscal OR personal responsibillity. The democrats have not changed, but the neocons are so far out there that even the democrats, who have always been loose when it comes to fiscal responsibility and have always tended towards the totalitarian side, are stepping back and saying \"enough is enough...fascism and this wild spending is just going a little too far\".\n..and the great daewoo is wrong again...on two counts. You should stop being so presumptuous. (Oh, my God! I forgot! Being presumptuous aids your argument.) As late as the '60s, jim's trucking supported mostly Democrats...even campaigned for a Democratic Governor...none of which was conservative. jim's trucking has already demonstrated to those who read carefully that daewoo's attitudes are a lot closer to fascism than his. \n \n Go #### up a rope, daewoo.\n \n \nThen I would say that you don't understand or respect the term \"public forum\". If you wish to discuss issues only on your terms you might consider private chat. Posting anti America statements validated by agenda driven websites generally will or should incite a response, and yes, an emotional response. \n And you and your's have the gaul to accuse someone of being totalitarian socialist. You read websites that SPECULATE and do nothing more than feed your burning hatred. And anyone who does not buy into it is ignorant. I have not asked you teach anything. As you have yet to present anything that could be considered educational. And no, nor have I. I have asked that websites be presented so as to define them as agenda driven. The ones that have been presented are exactly that. Of course some facts are presented but the end is always a declaration of how the U.S. is headed down the tubes. \n After the next attack, I do ask the three of you to define your ideals.\n I have been defined as a totalitarian socialist. Jim has been defined as a neo-facist. \n I obviously erred in judging you as leftist due to your burning, obvious hatred of current administration. It is not my goal to have an unending conflict with you. It is my goal to find a conservative movement (named) which has the goal of correct fiscal responsibility that reasonable people can be guided toward to support. Rather than what is available to them at present. Hostility toward potential support is not what can lead nations in the right direction. \n I notice that Jim no longer involves himself in debate with the three of you and I suspect he grew weary of being attacked as an uneducated buffoon. \n As will eventually occur with me if you so desire. So, if all you want is to feed your egos at the expense of others feel free. You have diligently exposed current administration as ineffective and bumbling. Now you have the challenge of constucting viable options or mentioning an existing one. \n I know demolition is much more fun though.\nYou've figured their MO precisely. They have no viable plan. They have nothing but smuggery and disdain for those who differ from them. I suspect that they each cherish a copy of something similar to Mao's Little Red Book and that they exchange rings on special occasions, kissing each other gently on each cheek as they meet.\n \n Of the three, georged is the most intelligent, daewoo is the biggest liar and gamehuis is just a child parading in men's clothing.\n \n \nThe only solution to the current one-party US governing problem is the general public reaching a point of awareness to demand accountability from their elected representatives. That would involve financial hardship sooner than later for most of that general public, who live much like our government, on credit, so I'm sure they'll continue blaming someone, anyone else rather than their own apathy right to the edge of the cliff in the downward US economic trend. \n \n Some posters on this and other forums, myself included, use these forums to express our own opinions based on professional experience within the financial community as a sounding board which most often parallels our own knowledge and that of private publications we use for investment planning purposes.

You must be using some definition for that word that I am unfamiliar with. The simple facts of the matter is this war was VERY predictable and our failure was predicted by many prior to the war even gettign off the ground. In fact, it was predicted by many HERE (myself included) prior to its start. Not only was it predicted, but the method of our failure was laid out. Too many (you included) based their assesment on ignorance and flag wrapped rhetoric. This course fo this war was anything BUT unpredictable.\n \n As far as blaming those who opposed the war...that is absolutly insane. Those of us who have a little common sense said \"Do not jump out of the plane without a parachute\". The war hawks, Bush included, refused to listen. Now it is somehow the anti war crowds fault that you folks have smacked into the ground? I think not. The war hawks #### in their own cheerios.

Terrorism is not going to become uncommon until most of the terrorists are dead.\n\n \n then you need to explain to the rest of us how this has anythign at all to do with Iraq. At this point, the military and the Bush administration estimate that roughly 5% of the anti American insurgents in Iraq are foreign fighters. Also, according to the last intelligence review, we are in MORe danger now than prior to the invasion of Iraq, becuase the invasion has basically put world opinion of the US in the toilet, and AQ has been recruiting and raising money like crazy due to our actions. Apparently they are NOT shipping those new members to Iraq, which kind of makes you wonder exactly what they ARE doing with them.\n \n I don't knwo that appeasement is not necessarily the answer, but your solution, siding with the terrorists and giving them assistance, does not seem to have been a good plan.\n \n \n..and the great daewoo is wrong again...on two counts.

Then did you become a conservative, or skip right over to fascist?\n \n Which of my views have you shown to be fascist, Jim? Is it my stanch support of the democratic process, personal freedoms, individual responsibility, and a government accountable to the people, or is it my view that corporatism in the form of special interest pandering is unacceptable. \n \n Jim, your attitudeshave been shown time and again to be wholly and unapologetically fascist. Get over it, admit that you are a fascist, and move on. Every time you try to show that I am the REAL fascist here, you just make yourself look stupid. Its OK.

Sounds like you have a macho man complex about politicians. \n\n \n The public also disliked Carter because many incorrectly assinged blame for the inflation during the carter administration to Carter. Apparently many segments of the American public fail to recognize that it was nixon taking us off the gold standard that caused that inflation (and his subsequent irresponsible coinign of money).\n \n Jim ahs told us why he does not like carter. IIRC, his dislike for Carter when it comes to foreign policy is related to the fact that Carter did not aid the Shah of Iran in a wholesale slaughter of the Iranian people so the Shah could hold onto power there. In Jim land, this somehow (he has never really clarified how) \"telegraphed\" to the russians that they could go ahead and invade afghanistan. Apparently in jim land if you are not willing to aid in wholesale slaughter to preserve the power of a currupt and tyrannical leader, the logical next step is the invasion of an entirely different country by the soviets union.\n \n His next grievance is apparently the fact that Carter did not take all measures necessary to get the soviets out of afghanistan. When it was pointed out to him that we had no way to do this militarily short of thermonuclear war, he indicated that carter should have done whatever it took. He also suggested that Carter should have blockaded afghanistans warm water port (which does not exist).\n \n So, as far as I can tell, here are the top reasons jim hates carter:\n \n 1. Nixon took us off the gold standard\n 2. Failure to engage in slaughter to preserve the power of a tyrant\n 3. Failure to launch a thermonuclear strike against Afghanistan to show the soviets that we are tough (likely resulting in the end of all life on earth)\n 4.

   "Reagan was not mentioned because he is only mentioned when \"GREAT\" men are discussed. \n\n \n Besides the economic implications of the Reagan administration...none of which were good in the long run, Reagan was directly responsible for the rise and dominance of Al Queda. After Afghanistan fell to the soviets, the Carter administration, knowing there was nothing that we could do directly to influence it, devised a strategy to aid Afghani fighters. They updated the cell based structure plan for resistance fighters (which has proven equally effective for terrorists) and started training and supplying Afghan militants. \n \n The carter administration DID see a definate downside to teaching the islamic fundamentalists to destroy a superpower using an undefeatable cell based structure and advanced financing, so they didn't/ The CIA was prohibited from working with the islamic fundamentalists.\n \n Enter Reagan. After a couple years in office and looking pretty shabby, he wanted to accelerate the timetable in Afghanistan. The only way to do that was to have the CIA start working with the Islamis fundamentalists, so that is what they did. They taght the islamic fundamentalists how to create a cell based infrastructure that was unbeatable, and taght them how to pick targets and carry off attacks that would wear down the enemy and make the war so expensive the enemy would be forced to abandon it or bankrupt themselves fighting it....which is exactly what happened to the soviet union. Ultimatly it was not the arms race with the US that bankrupted the soviets...we were the only ones running that race...it was the financial losses from the war in afghanistan.\n \n In addition to his part in arming and training islamic fundamentalists to beat a superpower, Reagan also provided Iran with advanced anti armour missiles (TOW missiles) which the Iranians reverse engineered, moving their research in that area ahead by decades. Irans current short and medium range missile technology is a DIRECT result of that deal. We have no militaary solution for Iran today because the Reagan administration sold them advanced weapons.\n \n Even the problems we have in S America...an increasingly important region...are directly the result of the Reagan administration.

Now we are stuck dealing with S americans who hate us, and are sitting on a lot of resources that we need. \n \n While at the time Reagans policies seemed like a good idea, when viewed in the light of history, with the conseqeunces now becoming clear, I think it would be a pretty safe bet to say that Reagan harmed this country more than any president int he last 20 years, with the possible exception of baby bush.",

   "\n Of course prosperity is at the top of the list for US well being. Without that how does the country generate revenue to advance its infrastructure for industry to flourish? Pay its debts? Field a military? The only difference between what a true third world country provides its citizenry and one that's developed is wealth. We've squandered our wealth, so be prepared for other nations to eventually dislodge us from our role of wealthist nation. \nDamn! I thought it was life, liberty and the PURSUIT of happiness that our government was into protecting for us. Do you mean we're supposed to be the wealtiest nation on earth?\n \n \n\n I didn't have any problem with Carter's administration; ...\n You wouldn't!\n \n \n...take a look at his dereglation and treaty work. Plus he gave us Volcker. The public disliked him because of the Iranian hostage situation. Sounds like you have a macho man complex about politicians. \nHe didn't give us Volcker. Volcker was forced on him by Wall Street. He takes credit for it....like you do for him.\n \n \n\n Your dislike of Clinton must be seated in your Christian morality.\nYou should read what I say and not extend my thoughts according to your need for argumentative bias. Clinton lied under oath. My distaste for Clinton has more to do with his ethics than it does with Christain morality. I've been an adulterous male myself. More power to him for getting a hummer. However, when you do it in the Oval Office and keep a head of state waiting for you while you're being blown, you're sleazing up the office of President. What that lying scholar does in his own bedroom or private apartment is none of my business. What he does in the Oval Office is.\n \n So far he's the only President to be impeached. \n \n Clinton's group misplaced hundreds of FBI files. Clinton's First Lady On Paper claimed to know nothing of the Rose Law Firm papers. (The ones that turned up in the Clinton's living quarters.) \n \n There are many who still think the Clintons were invovled in a murderous climb to the White House.\n \n \n He did nothing many other presidents haven't done, other than picking women who didn't have the descretion to go about their business without trying to make a buck off their time with him. I don't particulary care what anyone does with his or her sex life, as long as it doesn't harm me.\nI don't think I've expressed an opinion that opposes this. You must be generalizing again to say that is my reason for not liking Slick Willy.\n \n \n His administration was fine with me, but I don't mind paying taxes if someone keeps us out of dumber than a rock wars and uses fiscal restraints such as maintaining a defensive military as designed by our constitution.\nGet real! Clinton gutted the military in a Jimmy Carter fashion.\n \n \n \n\n Why didn't you mention Johnson, Nixon or Reagan? All three did the nation far more harm than Carter or Clinton, but couldn't hold a candle to the current crooks.\nI have mentioned Johnson before. His Great Society Socialism plan screwed us also. \n \n Nobody on the list has done the nation more harm than Carter.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnpredictable? You must be using some definition for that word that I am unfamiliar with. The simple facts of the matter is this war was VERY predictable and our failure was predicted by many prior to the war even gettign off the ground. In fact, it was predicted by many HERE (myself included) prior to its start. Not only was it predicted, but the method of our failure was laid out. Too many (you included) based their assesment on ignorance and flag wrapped rhetoric. This course fo this war was anything BUT unpredictable.\nI won't get into the semantics battle with you on the word 'predictable'. Your prediction here is nothing more than a guess that turned out to be right....similar to correctly guessing the outcome of a football game. Those who guessed correctly usually say they 'knew' it would come out their way...after it does. It's all hindsight that you brag with here. You didn't 'know' what would happen. War is unpredictable. Once upon a time the Mexicans defeated the French Army using sticks, hoes, some Indians and a huge herd of cattle. Who'd have thought that would happen? I doubt the French predicted anything other than a full slaughter of the Mexican's...\n \n ...I know...that was then...this is now. Different war, different methods, more countries, more religions involved, more everything including modern technological weaponry...making it even more unpredictable what will happen in the future. You may guess and be right...but, that doesn't mean you knew it would happen.\n \n The French prediction that they could easily defeat the Mexican peasants is much the way as many of us thought modern weaponry would easily defeat Al Kyda. They (terrorists) are still succeeding because of their great stealth (hiding in the general public) and their surprise bombings with powerful explosives. They will continue to succeed if we do not continue to sniff them out and disarm them. \n \n \n Hindsight can always be turned into a claim of an accurate prediction even though you had no real knowledge of the outcome. You simply guessed and things turned out your way. Either that or you claim to have guessed what has already happened, making yourself a guru amongst 'forecasters'.\n \n ...and again you have misrepresented what I have said. This is one reason that exchanges such as this have been rare lately and will become more rare as time passes. You are not really worth arguing with.\n \n \n\n As far as blaming those who opposed the war...that is absolutly insane. Those of us who have a little common sense said \"Do not jump out of the plane without a parachute\". The war hawks, Bush included, refused to listen. Now it is somehow the anti war crowds fault that you folks have smacked into the ground? I think not. The war hawks #### in their own cheerios. Now they can smile and eat them.\nI don't place sole blame for the outcome of the war on the protestors...just some of it. It appears that not only do we have to fight our real enemies, but the enemy within consisting of political hacks who perceive their anti-war rhetoric to be healthy and harmless when all it does is prolong the war and encourage the enemy.\n \n \n \n\n then you need to explain to the rest of us how this has anythign at all to do with Iraq. \nThat's where the current battle is being waged.\n \n \n At this point, the military and the Bush administration estimate that roughly 5% of the anti American insurgents in Iraq are foreign fighters. Also, according to the last intelligence review, we are in MORe danger now than prior to the invasion of Iraq, becuase the invasion has basically put world opinion of the US in the toilet, and AQ has been recruiting and raising money like crazy due to our actions. Apparently they are NOT shipping those new members to Iraq, which kind of makes you wonder exactly what they ARE doing with them.\nCan you link us to the 'last intelligence review' or is this another of your made-up claims? You seem to know more about the enemy than most people do. Do you keep up with them to follow your money or what?\n \n \n \n \n\n I don't knwo that appeasement is not necessarily the answer, but your solution, siding with the terrorists and giving them assistance, does not seem to have been a good plan.\nIt is you that sides with and gives assitance to the terrorists. You've already admitted to this so don't make me rehash that argument.\n \n \n \n\n So, 40 years ago you supported some democrats. Then did you become a conservative, or skip right over to fascist?\nCute. You need to give up this childish approach you have. I suspect you think it infuriates me to be called a fascist. Well, here's a news flash...all it does is build a foundation under the argument that you are fresh out of ideas and nothing better than name-calling to work for you.\n \n \n\n Which of my views have you shown to be fascist, Jim? Is it my stanch support of the democratic process, personal freedoms, individual responsibility, and a government accountable to the people, or is it my view that corporatism in the form of special interest pandering is unacceptable. \n \n Jim, your attitudeshave been shown time and again to be wholly and unapologetically fascist. Get over it, admit that you are a fascist, and move on. Every time you try to show that I am the REAL fascist here, you just make yourself look stupid. Its OK. Some people are conservatives, some are liberals, some are fascists. Nothing wrong with that. \nI'll not rehash the whole segment, but I'm almost certain you will remember calling for the death of a whole generation of Americans that you blame for our current fiscal state. I believe even your father was on your hit list. I believe we argued then about who's closer to fascism. I seem to recall finding that all definitions of fascism includes a sense of male superiority and I have many times advocated doing things the Cherokee Indian way...let the females run things.\n \n No, daewoo, it is you that is fascist, not I.\n \n \n \n\n Jim, you still have not exposed any lies on my behalf. You did argue for pages and pages that I was a liar when I made a mistake...a mistake that I admitted in my VERY NEXT post. \n \n Thisis getting pathetic, Jim. The more your neocon ideaology is proven wrong, the more veneomous you get. \nI'm not being venomous. It is you being venomous.\n \n I laughed at your previous attempts to hide the fact that you liled. I'm laughing again now. It was far from the very next post that you admitted your lie. It was only after posting some additional (non-related ) links to 'summaries' that didn't exist except in the mind of the biased author you presented who wanted to include the total cost of the mideast wars as aid to Israel and only after being impeached soundly that you admitted your 'mistake' (the one that I correctly identified as a deliberate mistake.)\n \n Face it, daewoo. You are a liar!\n \n You lied again when you said you couldn't even count the times that I had lied on 4forums. You have yet to come up with a list or even a single incident where that supposedly occurred.\n \n In your world, it's okay to lie. So...it's okay daewoo. I don't really care how much you lie. Just don't deny it when caught.\n \n \n \n\n Or, George is smart enough to recognize that a broke country does not get to be a superpower for very long.\nWho says we have to be a superpower? I know many a delightful country that can in no way be classified as a superpower.\n \n \nThe public also disliked Carter because many incorrectly assinged blame for the inflation during the carter administration to Carter. Apparently many segments of the American public fail to recognize that it was nixon taking us off the gold standard that caused that inflation (and his subsequent irresponsible coinign of money).\n \n Jim ahs told us why he does not like carter. IIRC, his dislike for Carter when it comes to foreign policy is related to the fact that Carter did not aid the Shah of Iran in a wholesale slaughter of the Iranian people so the Shah could hold onto power there. In Jim land, this somehow (he has never really clarified how) \"telegraphed\" to the russians that they could go ahead and invade afghanistan. Apparently in jim land if you are not willing to aid in wholesale slaughter to preserve the power of a currupt and tyrannical leader, the logical next step is the invasion of an entirely different country by the soviets union.\n \n His next grievance is apparently the fact that Carter did not take all measures necessary to get the soviets out of afghanistan. When it was pointed out to him that we had no way to do this militarily short of thermonuclear war, he indicated that carter should have done whatever it took. He also suggested that Carter should have blockaded afghanistans warm water port (which does not exist).\nWe've already been through that one, too.\n \n So, as far as I can tell, here are the top reasons jim hates carter:\n \n 1. Nixon took us off the gold standard\n 2. Failure to engage in slaughter to preserve the power of a tyrant\n 3. Failure to launch a thermonuclear strike against Afghanistan to show the soviets that we are tough (likely resulting in the end of all life on earth)\n 4. Failure to take proper naval measures to blockade the imaginary port of afghanistan (though I take issue with this one....how does Jim know that carter did not send an IMAGINARY navy to block the imaginary port?!?)\n \n This is a lot more fun that slapping Missouri Mule around.[/QUOTE]It doesn't take much to entertain children.\n \n \nYour perception is erroneous. Daewoo is far better versed in international finance, international cultural aspects and policy relating to economics, domestic economic circumstances and world military capabilities than I'll ever be. Gamehuis has a better understanding of equity, bond and money markets than most of the people I personally know who have been involved in it for many, many years including so-called stock brokers. That means he can interpret financial statements, combine them with operational history and determine trends rather than getting his US economic knowledge from talking heads. Once anyone has that ability, politics are ABC stuff sorted out by which public segment has to be bought to achieve the goal. You do understand politics are predicated on money and power, nothing else? \n \n With your confused political loyalties, normal use of profanity in attempts to make discussion points and constant, mostly incorrect political labeling, you do remind me of undergrads from my college years who were majoring in the sciences trying to fit in at a liberal arts or business major wine/pot parties. Once a subject went beyond their field of desired expertise and they got into the refreshments, out came the belligerence.\nYou're describing the three of you right here. Belligerence is being excreted through every pore of daewoo and gamehuis. Yours is a bit better hidden. I've not been repeatedly called a fascist by many other than you three stooges. \n \n \n \n \nMethinks Jim's Trucking needs to put on his finest brown shirt and practice saying the following: \"Wir haben es nicht gewusst.\"\n...making my point that you spew childish gibberish.\n \n \nI think you're right but most former Southern democrats who prefer an aggressive military policy, big government directed by industry and fiscal irresponsibility (the new Republicans) will say they didn't know.\n...another pure generalization prompted by political kool-aid.",

   "1. Nixon took the US off the gold standard and turned US monetary control over to the counterfeiter, the Federal Reserve System. In comparison to that, Watergate was nothing. His legacy is the gold standard and being the only US president to resign. \n \n 2. Conscription is available by a simple act of congress. \n \n 3. Reagan started the cycle of abnormal government spending deficits for military expansion (consensus was that the USSR was already falling apart before Afghanistan) to drive an economy in recession. That put US government focus on servicing the debt rather than infrastructure improvement: http://www.uuforum.org/deficit.htm \n Reagan's popularity was with the public as he supposedly ended inflation and was providing them with jobs through debt, same as both Bush administrations. Buying popularity with public money is a Post ww2 political favorite. \n \n 4. Pakistan and Taiwan, our staunch allies, and our spy-ridden security agencies provide with China all the US military software it wants. US defense industries were standing in line to sell them source code and programs to eliminate the middlemen and enhance their bottom lines. The US has around 10,000 stabilized nuclear devices, enough to obliterate the world. What promotes your fear? \n \n 5. Microsoft has never driven the US economy. With annual sales of about $43-44B, that's four months of US Iraq expenses. You may be referring to the .dot com bubble, which amounted to Wall Street using street money to invest in high tech start-ups with no earnings forecasts, driving their equity stocks and bonds to ridiculous highs before taking their profits and leaving 401k contributors holding the bag. The Clinton Administration went after Microsoft for anti-trust measures in conjunction with Europe, which has since been settled.\n\n \n 1. In 1971 the U.S. was the last nation still on the gold standard. \n The removal of the gold standard had zero effect on the standard of living of the common citizen. \n 2.\n 3. Spending deficits were common since FDR's administration. A deficit is a deficit regardless of it's origin. Military spending as any other spending created many jobs. Regarding Reagan's popularity one can not forget the integrity the great one was covered with. And the patriotic feeling that flowed from him and over the people. A great change from the depressing years after the death of President Kennedy. \n 4. Just 10,000? No fear here. \n China as a communist nation is our enemy. The act of selling them material which would advance their ability to cause the U.S. harm is illegal. \n Fairness to them in the arena of arms is not a concern to me. \n 5. I don't question your qualifications to clarify this point. \n Clinton waited until 6 months before the end of his administration to do it. \n My major point is that presidents get a lot of blame and credit for economic issues which are actually out of their control.",

   "1.Besides the economic implications of the Reagan administration...none of which were good in the long run, Reagan was directly responsible for the rise and dominance of Al Queda. After Afghanistan fell to the soviets, the Carter administration, knowing there was nothing that we could do directly to influence it, devised a strategy to aid Afghani fighters. They updated the cell based structure plan for resistance fighters (which has proven equally effective for terrorists) and started training and supplying Afghan militants. \n \n 2. The carter administration DID see a definate downside to teaching the islamic fundamentalists to destroy a superpower using an undefeatable cell based structure and advanced financing, so they didn't/ The CIA was prohibited from working with the islamic fundamentalists.\n \n Enter Reagan. After a couple years in office and looking pretty shabby, he wanted to accelerate the timetable in Afghanistan. The only way to do that was to have the CIA start working with the Islamis fundamentalists, so that is what they did. They taght the islamic fundamentalists how to create a cell based infrastructure that was unbeatable, and taght them how to pick targets and carry off attacks that would wear down the enemy and make the war so expensive the enemy would be forced to abandon it or bankrupt themselves fighting it....which is exactly what happened to the soviet union.

What event suggest that Reagan's economics was a failure? \n Or Bush's or Clinton's or Bush's? The standard of living in America has risen gradually since the U.S. entered WWII. With a few down periods such as 1978. Forced up by the industrial revolution which put Americans to work. Americans found themselves making money and liked it, then got used to it, then would accept no other standard for themselves. Americans, not government drive economics. Assisted by technology. Just by the mere fact that resources exist and people have the knowledge of how to process them and market them is what drives economics. The puny details that speculators scratch their heads over on how to maximize every cent mean very little and damn sure aren't the defining factor in the success or failure of any president. \n Life for Americans is good by the hand of Americans. \n \n The rise of Al Queda is a result of hatred of people who they describe as infidels. Dominance by Al Queda is a figment of someone's imagination and the cowardess of the people who tolerate them on their soil. \n \n 2. The Carter administration was led by an anti semite. In sheep's clothing. \n President Carter's focus was more on weakening the Jews versus empowering the Arab foes of Israel. I am not accusing the president of supporting terrorism. He also weakened America in removing the possiblity of any future draft.\n \n 3. All of the things you have credited Reagan for are the responsiblity of those who choose to take up arms against America. The defense of America is the responsiblity of Americans. Iranians showed their prowess in combat in their 8 year war with Iraq. The one thing they have become proficient at is marching in goose step. An important process of all dictatorial, aggressive organizations. Nazi's, Japanese, Communist Russia, China , N.Korea, Iran, Hussein's Iraq.",

Trying to grasp something that's rapidly slipping away, a fool's errand that will take them with it.\n\n \n Speaking of \"emotionally charged rhetoric\", several days and a few pages back I was accused of being a totalitarian socialist.

As I have faith in free market. \n It is becoming clear to me that it has little to do with what we believe in. Having more to do with our refusal to lose, based on love for ideals versus money. We know that we are not socialist or Nazi's. We believe in the American people's ability to overcome through perseverance what ever the obstacle. Economic or enemy. Our few failures at attempts to secure freedom for other nations not being representative of what Americans can do. Rather examples of how rendering undeserved respect to leftist within our midst, for the sake of Democracy, is more destructive than any Ho Chi Mihn can ever hope to be. \n But, we will continue to honor that devotion to Democracy no matter how leftist tie our soldiers hands in their endeavors.

Do you know what a fascist or a socialist is? \n You seem to be seriously confused as how to define what you are. \n And lack the respect for others to define themselves. \n You seem to have an excellent grasp of economics and the left version of history.

It was not just a matter of a bunch of people saying \"I think we will loose\". The manner of our loss was discussed in great deatails, including regional fallout and effects, casualty predictions, hell, Jim, we even predicted the outcomes of the Iraqi elections and the support of the eventual elected government for shia militias. \n \n It is not because a large segment of the public is just extremely lucky. It is because when you consider the social, cultural, political and economic realities couple with the military realities, there was only one likely outcome, and this is it. Fact based, logical reasoning won out over flag draped emotional rhetoric....and it always will. \n \n There is a quote from Orwell I feel is especially appropriate here:\n \n \n\"We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right.

It appears that not only do we have to fight our real enemies, but the enemy within consisting of political hacks who perceive their anti-war rhetoric to be healthy and harmless when all it does is prolong the war and encourage the enemy.\n\n \n You do realize that there is no CNN in the ME, right? Your average Arab has no clue what the american public is thinking. \n \n We lost because there were a bunch of absolute XXXXXX who refused to face and accept the realities of the conflict. In the real world, cultural differences made the vision for Iraqs future held by the war hawks laughable. The type of campaign we were waging...heavy on civilian casualties in order to keep US death tolls low....was destined to lead to serious backlash with the IRaqi people which would inevitably lead to the creation of a large insurgency. The geopolitics of the region dictated that such an insurgency would have no trouble with funding and material acquisition. The empowerment of a Shia government closely alinged with Iran, leading to sectarian violence was also inevitable. \n \n \nThat's where the current battle is being waged.\n\n \n Waged against who??? 5% of the insurgents are believed to be foreigners. The other 95% are not terrorists, they are fighting either to expell an illegal occupation force, or they are fighting because they do not wish to live under sharia law in an Iranian sattelite state. \n \n \nCan you link us to the 'last intelligence review' or is this another of your made-up claims? You seem to know more about the enemy than most people do. Do you keep up with them to follow your money or what?\n\n \n Sure, Jim. heres a link http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/wdc/documents/terrorism/keyjudgments_092606.pdf\n \n If I know more about the enemy than most people, it is because most people are XXXXXX who trust their polticians to tell them what they need to know, what they should think, and how they should think. The information is out there and has been for years. You don't know much about the enemy because you ahve not bothered to study them, or have studied only those sources that agree with your initial assesment. You look for consensus rather than reality. \n \n \nIt is you that sides with and gives assitance to the terrorists. You've already admitted to this so don't make me rehash that argument.\n\n \n One of Bin Ladens stated goals for years has been the removal of Saddam hussein and the establishment of sharia law in the Iraq. Anotehr of his major goals has been the bankrupting of the US. You guys gave him Iraq on a silver platter. AQ could never have hoped to remove Saddam on their own, leaving a big secular block in the middles of their proposed caliphate. Luckily, thier allies in the white house, and the dumber than dirt american people, were willing to remove that obstacle for them and make giant leaps towards the bankrupting of the US in the process.\n \n Way to go! \n \n \n \nI'll not rehash the whole segment, but I'm almost certain you will remember calling for the death of a whole generation of Americans that you blame for our current fiscal state. I believe even your father was on your hit list. I believe we argued then about who's closer to fascism. I seem to recall finding that all definitions of fascism includes a sense of male superiority and I have many times advocated doing things the Cherokee Indian way...let the females run things.\n \n No, daewoo, it is you that is fascist, not I.\n\n \n We had this discussion before, and If you will recall, you got slapped down. First, I did not call for the death of an entire generation of Americans. I advocated putting your entire generation on an island and lettign the terrorists have you. After all, it was your selfish stupidity that put us in the position we are in today. While that is certainly mean and cold hearted, it is a long ways from fascist. \n \n I already educated you regarding the definition of fascism once. Do you really need a refresher?\n \n \n \nI laughed at your previous attempts to hide the fact that you liled. I'm laughing again now. It was far from the very next post that you admitted your lie. It was only after posting some additional (non-related ) links to 'summaries' that didn't exist except in the mind of the biased author you presented who wanted to include the total cost of the mideast wars as aid to Israel and only after being impeached soundly that you admitted your 'mistake' (the one that I correctly identified as a deliberate mistake.)\n\n \n BS, Jim. I made a mistake. As soon as I recognized it, I admitted it. What really gets under your skin is that I made a mistake and admitted it, but still won that round. Even when I am wrong, I am more right than you!\n \n You are right, I screwed up and mis cited a source. I admitted that, brought in several more sources that backed my original contention, then sat back and laughed for several pages (in fact, IIRC, I printed out some of those pages so others could laugh as well) as you refused to address the validity o the provided numbers. You continually claimed that it was invalid because you disliked the source, but despite the fact that all the numebrs were there for review including original sources and methodology, you still could not touch it.\n \n That is because it was what is called a \"fact\". You shoudl try looking into some yourself. That was yet anothe case where you preferred to look for views that backed your own and refused to accept the unimpeachable facts which were laid out for you.",

   "Speaking of \"emotionally charged rhetoric\", several days and a few pages back I was accused of being a totalitarian socialist. Jim was accused of being a neo fascist while the accusers claimed to be the picture of conservatism. \n I wasn't sure what either he or myself had said to provoke these accusations.\n As no definitions accompanied. \n I am still not familiar with Jim's political opinions or stances are but I suspect, like myself he is a conservative. As I have faith in free market. \n\n \n Faith in a free market MIGHT make you a capitalist (though most socialists in the UE are free market socialists) but does not necessarily make you a conservative. \n \n If you believe in a free market, why in the world woudl you support a president that has used public spending (deficit or not) as a crutch ot keep our economy rolling? \n \n \nIt is becoming clear to me that it has little to do with what we believe in. Having more to do with our refusal to lose, based on love for ideals versus money. We know that we are not socialist or Nazi's. We believe in the American people's ability to overcome through perseverance what ever the obstacle. Economic or enemy. Our few failures at attempts to secure freedom for other nations not being representative of what Americans can do. Rather examples of how rendering undeserved respect to leftist within our midst, for the sake of Democracy, is more destructive than any Ho Chi Mihn can ever hope to be. \n\n \n the nazis were not fascists. They were Nazis. Nazism and Fascism certainly shared some traits, but the two are not really interchangable in a political discussion. \n \n \nBut, we will continue to honor that devotion to Democracy no matter how leftist tie our soldiers hands in their endeavors. Killing our youth by holding them to standards that insure their deaths while excusing the atrocities committed by their enemies. \n\n \n Maybe you could give some examples of this. Our troops hands in Iraq are FAR, FAR from tied. In the past, the stratgey that we are using in Iraq wiht its heavy civilian death toll in order to preserve the lives of our professional soldiers would have been criminal. The Bush administration changed the rules of engagement for our military. Carrying out military actions in this manner during the Clinton adminsitration or the first bush administration would have resulted in court martials or war crimes trials. How can you possibly argue that our troops hands have been tied when we are looking at a half a million + Iraqi casualties and only a few thousands american casualties? Our guys are killing the hell out of the place. \n \n \nThe post of today consist of attacks on Republican presidents and defense of Democratic presidents on their parts. Gamehuis excluded from this accusation. \n Defense of Republican and attacks on Democrats by ourselves.\n What this exchange exposes is that no one defining themselves as \"pure conservative\", as georged has done, could ever come to the defense of a Democrat and make that claim. \n\n \n This is absolutly insane. Clintons fiscal policies were the most conservative we have seen in the past 20 years. IMO, the best president we have seen during my life time was Bush I. He was willing to do waht it took, even if it led to him being a one term wonder, to get this country back on track. He raised taxes when he needed to, which led to the budgetary surpluses of the Clinton administration, despte the fact that it made him unpopular with Americans who were willing to sell their children into slavery in order to maintain their inflated standard of living. \n \n \nAre you guys teenagers? Do you know what a fascist or a socialist is? \n\n \n yes, we know what fascism and socialism are. We have had long, and sometimes heated, discussion sbout fascism and socialism. From your posts, it seems like you have little or no idea what either are. I would suggest you do a little study and increase your knowledge in this area so you can participate in the discussion intelligently. \n \n Make sure that you differentiate between \"market socialism\", which is an entirely different concept from free market socialism. The former has the state owning the means of produciton, while the latter has it owned by private enterprise, but taxation and government spending are used to direct the economy and provide socialist benifits. Sweden is a pretty good example of this. \n \n \nYou seem to have an excellent grasp of economics and the left version of history. But even your command of economics is diseased with an obsession with numbers that is hardly indicative of the conditions of the average citizen. Which does matter. \n\n \n The average citizen has a negative savings rate and is up to their eyeballs in debt. Real wages have been declining for the last 30 years, and debt loads have increased nearly 800% in real dollars in that time. \n \n The \"left\" version of history? This is laughable. We deal in facts here. If you would like to dispute a fact presented, do so. Otherwise, you may need to re-examine your \"right\" view of history, since, if it does not line up with the presented facts, it is probably wrong.\n \n You have a disadvantage here in that you are coming in at the middle of a long standing debate. For example, Jimms trucking was made a laughing stock based on his mispercetions of the actiosn and results of the carter administration. We haev already been over all of that, and it basically ended up being a public flogging for him...the end result was a general consensus that he had no idea what he was talking about.\n \n Now he has popped back up, and i smakign the same tired claims despite the fact that he has been stopped on before on this. I doubt he stopped to think where this may go when he typed the line about carter since nobody likes to revisit a time when they were made a fool of and lost all credibility. \n \n If you disagree with something, dispute it, but do it concretely. This post, where yoy make these vague claims, does not leave much to be debated. \n \n \nMuch more than the gloom and doom of people who see the glass as half empty. Especially people obsessed with the demise of their own nation. Your lack of any solution other than \"individuals\" confessing to themselves the sky is falling exposes you as nothing that really matters. \n\n \n Solutions have been posted on several occasions. Again, if there is something concrete you would like to debate, do so.\n \n Finally, a friendly word of warning. You seem to be falling into a big dog-me to kind of roll with Jim. This is not uncommon on debate boards, where a weaker poster will attach themselves to a stronger debater and almost become thier cheering section. I don't know that this is necessarily a bad thing, especially when the \"me too\" portion is a person who does not have a lot of experience with semi formal debate. \n \n Jim isn't the big dog you want to attach yourself to. Steeeve might be a good choice, but Jim gets beat down too often, generally due to an ignorance of and distain for facts.",

Without going through a serious economic recession or depression to lower the US general public standard of living and consumer consumption to a level that's competitive within a global economy?\n\n \n Oooohhh, You want details.........?

As soon as you pull your head out of George's arse, I'll consider your suggestion. \n \n Most of this was absolutely unnecessary and I have dove head long to your level.

And American's resilience in the face of trouble. Yours is supported by speculation and hatred of a president. Very weak. Unless you wallow in numbers. \n But we're in the mud now, so let's wallow. Call your public, it's hammer time. lol \n Semi-formal, what a joke.

Mine of course being the one that matters. lol\n\n \n I have alredy posted my definition of a conservative.

My past post expose that I give presidents little credit or blame for conditions of economy. My support or disapproval of presidents is moral based. Giving none a free pass, nor damning them for their humanity. \n\n \n If you are judging presidents on moral issues, how could you possibly find one that you like int eh last 50 years?\n \n \n4. Depending on where you get your news from. Mine is from mainstream news sources. I refuse to look at agenda based websites. Except to verify that info provided is agenda driven. \n\n \n This is called \"poisoning the well\" and is a logical fallacy. It is essentially a technique where you attack the source of fact based information, without ever actually addressing the presented facts. In formal debate, this would cost you bucu points because it is illogical. \n \n There are a couple of problems with your position here. The first is the assinine contention that mainstream news sources are not agenda driven. Mainstream news sources are wholly driven by the generation of ad revenue. They are money whores.\n \n The second is that everybody has an agenda, and what you are essentially doing is discounting anybody who does not have the same agenda as you. For example, I posted links to several sites that covered Iraqs conversion from dollars to Euros for oil sales. Most of those sites cited it as a key reason for our war there. Understandably, most of them held an anti war stance. This is to be expected since once you accept the fact that we went into Iraq largely to prop up our currency, only a sociopath could still support the war. \n \n When you simply dismiss facts because the site offering them does not carry your agenda without anny attempt to refute those facts, what you are doind is conceding that the facts are correct...essentially conceding the argument. \n \n \nThe vast majority of deaths occur due to insurgent activities. \n I also have more faith in our troops as individuals. Having been one and in action with many other Americans, my father, my brother, my son having been one in action with many others I know that due to their honorable natures (naturally some exceptions) they will not kill civilians with abandon. This enemy has chosen to hide among and use civilians as a tool. Knowing that those who hate America and or Bush will blame American soldiers for the results. The enemy dresses like the civilians. \n\n \n If you actually believe this, then either you are a liar who has never served, or delusional. Would a soldier set up a post and snipe civilians all day? Highly doubtful. Would a jet jockey drop a 10,000 Lb bomb on a school? You bet your XXX...if he was told that there were bad guys in the school. The fact that there are 200 civilians in there as well does not impress him (and he will probably never know). Our VERY FIRST strike in this war occured when we droped 2 10,000 lb bombs on a busy restaurant in downtown baghdad during the lunch rush because we thought that saddam might be there. For 2 weeks we carried out a massive \"decapitation\" campaign where we hit civilian targets because we were trying to take out Iraqs leadership, so don't try to feed me this ########. \n \n I once had to testify against one of my own men for using a hand grenade in a civilian area in a situation where there was a high probability of civilain casualties. NOBODY WAS EVEN KILLED and he was stil found guilty, fined, spent some time behind bars, and was demoted. That was a decorated soldier. Now we are bombing restaurants during the lunch rush, and you want to tell me that things have not changed??\n \n \nClinton, as explained in my previous post conducted a war never having placed ground troops making the tally of bodies and who those bodies, were provided by Muslims who were aided by his actions. He could paint the results as he wished. Bush 41 stopped the American advance to N. Iraq by order of the U.N.. Avoiding the conflict within the arena of civilians. \n\n \n BS on 2 counts. First, Clinton never conducted a war without ground troops, and the body counts did not come from the muslims who were aided by his actions, those mortality figures came from the red cross, who conducted a survey identical to the one used in Iraq to establish casualty figures.\n \n The second bit of BS there is the assinine contention that Bush stopped short of Baghdad because the UN ordered him to. That is idiotic. The UN made no such order or request. The reasons we stopped short of Baghdad were well ecplained and documented. He was concerned that if we actualyl toppled husseins regime, we would end up stuck in a quagmire of sectarian violence that would degenerate into civil war. He also understood that the inevitable outcome of such a course of action would be an Iraq being ruled by shia who were sympathetic to IRan. \n \n \n5. I agree with your assessments of Bush 41 and Clinton. I argue that Bush's action simply was his intelligence forcing him to be flexible for the good of the nation. American's were bombarded by the \"read my lips\" attack and bought it. That along with Ross Perot is the only reason Clinton ever left Arkansas.\n But, once again, I place little credit or blame to presidents and their actual effect on economy. It is simply a campaign tool they all use. \n\n \n Presidents inherit theri economy from their predecessor and it is pretty rare that we see much benifit form tehir programs withing the first 4-6 years. It was the policies of Bush 1 that led to the economic boom under clinton (excluding the .com bubble which was the result of investors who were XXXXXX). Unfortunatly we are just starting to see the results of the Bush economic plan...inflation out of control and a dollar in freefall. It makes me wonder about the intelligence of anybody who would run for president next. They will have to deal with the fallout from the bush economic legacy, and with the typical american ignorance of economic matters, they will probably get the blam for the inevitable recession. \n \n \n6. You may place your suggestion and your judgement where the sun don't shine. You must have not learned anything from your many heated discussions. \n\n \n No, I didn't. I learned about things like fascism, socialism, nazism, etc... during the course of my poli sci coursework. How about you? Wherever yuo learned it, you might want ot go back and study harder, because you don't seem to have a clue.\n \n \n7. This quick lesson exemplifies your obsession with being right. I am guilty of not addressing all of the details of my beliefs or picking apart your beliefs. But I do reserve the right to define my beliefs. And will respect yours. By the way I totally agree with your lesson. And it defines how I believed before you worded it. At no point had I defined my beliefs in detail that would have allowed any of you to place a label on me. \n\n \n That is fine...define your beliefs.

Nor did I in any way imply that to be the case. \n \n \n9. Hogwash. You present your views and proclaim them as reality and accuse anyone who disagrees as fanatical or stupid. \n\n \n No, I proclaim verifiable facts to be reality, and form my views based on those. If you can't dispute those facts, you need to re-examine your position.\n \n \n10. No disadvantage. As the \"general public\" tends to be happy being led around by their nose rings by media, being flogged by majorities carries no weight, nor provides any shame.

   "1. I have alredy posted my definition of a conservative. Traditional conservative values incluse belief in a limited government, fiscal responsibility, personal responsibilty, personal rights, etc...\n If you are judging presidents on moral issues, how could you possibly find one that you like int eh last 50 years?\n \n \n \n 2. This is called \"poisoning the well\" and is a logical fallacy. It is essentially a technique where you attack the source of fact based information, without ever actually addressing the presented facts. In formal debate, this would cost you bucu points because it is illogical. \n \n 3. There are a couple of problems with your position here. The first is the assinine contention that mainstream news sources are not agenda driven. Mainstream news sources are wholly driven by the generation of ad revenue. They are money whores.\n \n 4. The second is that everybody has an agenda, and what you are essentially doing is discounting anybody who does not have the same agenda as you. For example, I posted links to several sites that covered Iraqs conversion from dollars to Euros for oil sales. Most of those sites cited it as a key reason for our war there. Understandably, most of them held an anti war stance. This is to be expected since once you accept the fact that we went into Iraq largely to prop up our currency, only a sociopath could still support the war. \n \n 5. When you simply dismiss facts because the site offering them does not carry your agenda without anny attempt to refute those facts, what you are doind is conceding that the facts are correct...essentially conceding the argument. \n \n 6. If you actually believe this, then either you are a liar who has never served, or delusional. Would a soldier set up a post and snipe civilians all day? Highly doubtful. Would a jet jockey drop a 10,000 Lb bomb on a school? You bet your XXX...if he was told that there were bad guys in the school. The fact that there are 200 civilians in there as well does not impress him (and he will probably never know). Our VERY FIRST strike in this war occured when we droped 2 10,000 lb bombs on a busy restaurant in downtown baghdad during the lunch rush because we thought that saddam might be there. For 2 weeks we carried out a massive \"decapitation\" campaign where we hit civilian targets because we were trying to take out Iraqs leadership, so don't try to feed me this ########. \n \n 7. I once had to testify against one of my own men for using a hand grenade in a civilian area in a situation where there was a high probability of civilain casualties. NOBODY WAS EVEN KILLED and he was stil found guilty, fined, spent some time behind bars, and was demoted. That was a decorated soldier. Now we are bombing restaurants during the lunch rush, and you want to tell me that things have not changed??\n \n 8. BS on 2 counts. First, Clinton never conducted a war without ground troops, and the body counts did not come from the muslims who were aided by his actions, those mortality figures came from the red cross, who conducted a survey identical to the one used in Iraq to establish casualty figures.\n \n 9. The second bit of BS there is the assinine contention that Bush stopped short of Baghdad because the UN ordered him to. That is idiotic. The UN made no such order or request. The reasons we stopped short of Baghdad were well ecplained and documented. He was concerned that if we actualyl toppled husseins regime, we would end up stuck in a quagmire of sectarian violence that would degenerate into civil war. He also understood that the inevitable outcome of such a course of action would be an Iraq being ruled by shia who were sympathetic to IRan. \n \n 10. Presidents inherit theri economy from their predecessor and it is pretty rare that we see much benifit form tehir programs withing the first 4-6 years. It was the policies of Bush 1 that led to the economic boom under clinton (excluding the .com bubble which was the result of investors who were XXXXXX). Unfortunatly we are just starting to see the results of the Bush economic plan...inflation out of control and a dollar in freefall. It makes me wonder about the intelligence of anybody who would run for president next. They will have to deal with the fallout from the bush economic legacy, and with the typical american ignorance of economic matters, they will probably get the blam for the inevitable recession. \n \n 11. No, I didn't. I learned about things like fascism, socialism, nazism, etc... during the course of my poli sci coursework. How about you? Wherever yuo learned it, you might want ot go back and study harder, because you don't seem to have a clue.\n \n 12. That is fine...define your beliefs. But use terminology that actualyl has some meaning. Otherwise you are just jabbering.\n \n 13. Of course not. Nor did I in any way imply that to be the case. \n \n 14. No, I proclaim verifiable facts to be reality, and form my views based on those. If you can't dispute those facts, you need to re-examine your position.\n \n 15.Jim is always welcome. \n \n 16. ROTFLMAO. Running out of responses here?? \n \n 17. I deleted the rest, as it provides no substance. Until you can actually bring a fact or at least a concrete point to debate, I am done with you. Continual emotional, long winded diatribes by somebody who seems to SERIOUSLY lack knowledge of the subject matter are a waste of time.\n\n \n 1. Sorry, I had not seen your version of conservatism. And I agree with it and classify myself the same. I don't recall what I might have said that could cause me to be classified as a \"totalitarian socialist\". \n I suspect it is the respect I afford President Bush. I don't need to agree with presidents to give them respect. Including Johnson and Carter, who I believe actually did harm our nation. But, each had good n their intentions. \n 2. Call it what you will. Agenda driven material automatically gets thrown out. \n I am not, nor do I aspire to being a professional debater. I just enjoy the conversation with colorful people like you guys. I care more about your opinions than what material you can produce. \n 3. I agree. I get news from the mainstream media whores. Then I listen to several talk radio shows, then I decide. \n 4. True, we all have agendas. I have not dismissed your agenda. I have dismissed your websites. They make the accusation so as to vilify America or the administration. Exposing that the only concern they have is monetary. I suspect that you have not read all of my post. As I have in numerous post mentioned my Iraqi friend and consider his assessment of the results more credible than people making judgments with veiled concerns for human lives from the safety of their offices or dens. Accompanied by accusations of concern for people as sociopathic. \n 5. No, I'm simply dismissing it. \n 6. I have nothing to prove to you. Lying to you gains me nothing. Having served, I know the agony that goes with killing and the anger that comes from seeing friends die. Pilots and artillary units don't look at their targets. Most soldiers would have bombed the restaurant. Had intel said enemies were there. Soldiers follow orders. I am not attempting to defend soldiers who need no defending. I am blaming an enemy who hides among and conceals himself as civilians as a tactic. Justification for collateral death is a new tactic used only on Americans. Tying their hands. \n 7. Justice prevails. I'm not asking for different standards. Things have changed. Making it harder to identify and to stay alive. \n 8. The point has to do with your statement that 1/2 a million Iraqis have died in this war. Are you crediting the U.S. military with this number? \n 9. I believe I've heard that explanation before. We stopped short. Avoiding the battle among civilians as I stated. \n 10. This I do agree with. Always have believed it. But I still contend that presidents receive too much credit and blame for economics. \n 11. And in those heated arguments, you attempted to reduce any and all who opposed you to bumbling, fumbling, liars and XXXXXX. My studying harder is not going to help your BS be anymore factual. The hardest part about decrypting your BS is trying to read it. But even so, spelling must be your strong suit. \n But, once again you have avoided the entire point of any of my post. \n My \"only point\" in addressing any of you has to do with the fact that you gents are obsessed with hatred for Bush and post material that falsely \"in my humble opinion\" has America going down the tubes. Exposing your lack of faith in the system and the people. Both of which will, without me, prove you wrong. The sky is not falling.",

I blame the enemy rather than the president. \n\n \n I think we need to differentiate the presidents response to 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq, since the 2 are unrelated. The reaction to 9/11 was the invasion of afghanistan, which I supported (though not the manner in which it was conducted) and calls for increased cooperation in dealing with global terrorism. that was a pretty good reaction. Then he diverted the peoples attention from the \"war on terror\" to Iraq. Even he has now admitted that the war in IRaq had nothing to do with the war on terror. \n \n So, we move on to the war in IRaq. What exactly do you blame the enemy for? If you walk into a bar and start a fight, and leave on a stretcher with both of your knees broken backwards, you have nobody but yourself to blame. You instigated the violence. You cannot whine if the other guy wins. If tomorrow a foregn force decided to \"liberate\" the US, woudl you fight them? I know I would, regardless fo what they were trying to do, and the more civilians that died, the harder I would fight. \n \n \"The enemy\" in Iraq is the IRaqi people. They were sitting around minding their own business, not bothering anybody, and we started dropping bombs in them. They were made of tougher stuff that we thought, and did NOT like seeing their friends and family turned into collateral damage. \n \n The real disaster here is that Saddam was the #1 things standing between AQ and their goal of a unified caliphate in the ME. Now, he is gone, and his secular, western government has been replaced by a government of islamic findamentalists with close ties to Iran. This was predictable from day one. There was no other possible outcome.\n \n \n \nI too believe we are headed for a major correction.

I believe the U.S. will avoid what would be defined as a depression by the safe guards in place that prevent people from starving to death. But, economics is cyclic and the down must come. It's just a matter of who you want to blame. \n\n \n That is where the math part comes in. Whne you consider debt loads, cost of servicing debt, capital inflows and outflows, including import and export earnings, our industrial output as a fraction of GDP, and otehr common economic factors, the picture goes form a little scary to downright terrifying. A total correction would be roughly 4x worse than the correction that came with the great depression. There is no possible way that the nation could survive that intact, so I am hoping for something more like a 40% correction, which may be doable.\n \n As far as who to blame, every american needs to take a look in the mirror on that one (children excluded of course). We have been dismantling and selling off our industrial infrastructure for 40 years and making up the difference by printing money. In the short run, that was fine. Demand for dollars as a reserve currency and as a requirement to purchase oil (due to an arrangement between the US and the sauds) allowed us to generate trillions of dollars in currency. All good things must come to an end, and the dollar is now falling out of popularity both with central banks and with oil producers. Central banks have openly been discussing capitulation points...the point at which the dollar falls in value to the point that they dump it from their reserves. Every oil producer except Iraq (since we have been runnign the oil ministry by proxy) now accepts euros for oil payment, and 13 have announced pans to require eithr full payment or partial payment in non dollar currencies within the next 10 years.\n \n This will leave a MASSIVE glut of dollars on the market, whihc will drive their value down considerably. If you look at the underlying economic fundamentals (production, value added economic activity, etc..) over the past 30 years, it quickly becomes apparent that a full 80% of the dollars generated durign that time frame should never have existed. We are reaching the point that those dollars are unwamted on the international market, so they are dropping in value. Most in the financial communities are essentially calling this \"playing chicken with the dollar\" when viewed from the banking side. Everybody wants to unload their dollar assets. Hell, I have some dollar assets I woudl like to unload, and I am an American. Central banks know that as they dump dollars, the value of their remaining reserves, still held in dollars, will plumet. So, the challenge comes in either dumping your dollars on the sly, in which case the effect is nto seen market wide for a few months, or dumping them all at once and saying \"screw it, we are the first and are taking our money\". The problem there comes in the fact that most of the western world stands to take some serious hits if the dollar fails, so you try to prolong the inevitable.\n \n The one thing that everybody can seem to agree on is that the dollar WILL fall, and it will be sooner rather than later. How far is the only question, since considering the makeup of dollar holdings worldwide, how fast is off the table. People start liquidating dollars and the whole world will be forced to do so. It will be FAST. Maybe only a few months from start to finish. How far is a matter of much debate, and until it happens there is really no way to tell. Anything from a 50% devaluation of the dollar to a dollar that trades 1:1with the peso are all possible. A 50% devaluation of the dollar we can handle. It woudl be incredibly painful, and more severe than the great depression by several orders of magnitude, but it COULD be done. Any more than that, and surviving the correction as a coherent nation would become exponentially more difficult. \n \n The safety nets we have in place to prevent people from starving to death would fail to function under such a scenario. They are dependant on government spending, which would be SEVERELY curtailed in the even of a major dollar correction.",

Even he has now admitted that the war in IRaq had nothing to do with the war on terror. \n \n So, we move on to the war in IRaq. What exactly do you blame the enemy for? If you walk into a bar and start a fight, and leave on a stretcher with both of your knees broken backwards, you have nobody but yourself to blame. You instigated the violence. You cannot whine if the other guy wins. If tomorrow a foregn force decided to \"liberate\" the US, woudl you fight them? I know I would, regardless fo what they were trying to do, and the more civilians that died, the harder I would fight. \n \n \"The enemy\" in Iraq is the IRaqi people.......................................................... \n\n \n Your assessment of the invasion of Afghanistan I agree with. \n I have no problem with Bush's decision to invade Iraq based on the fact that Hussein's rhetoric concerning our ally Israel. Also his arrogance concerning the inspectors. And above all not disregarding his murdering of Kurds and Shiite.\n Now for the real reason I am glad that the invasion occurred. Every wannabe terrorist that could find transportation to Iraq went. For the honor of fighting the U.S. military. That had a twofold effect. It occupied them fighting in Iraq with soldiers who are volunteers, trained and prepared. Which prevented them from devising ways to kill unarmed and unprepared civilians in the U.S.. \n \n What you have discribed is that the world is becoming financially competent and realizing that they do not have to leave their fates to America's economic whims. The difference between us is that I believe America will adjust and overcome. You can hammer me with math if you like but America will not lay down and leave our fate in the hands of Europeans or Asians. It could of course lead to catostrophic conflict, but I won't blame us for it.",

   "I've got tired from Bush's shadowing! How long will he humbug people that we are fighting against international terrorism for it's clear that we'll get nothing out of it! Simple Americans got used to be wrapped in cotton wool and their opinion is no interest for government. Look, we spend much money for such police and military operations and for equipping it but I don't see real results! \n Not long ago my son was on excursion with his classmates. Close to boarder with Mexico the school bus was stopped by police and teachers were arrested! They were seated cruelly into the cop's car and cops said that they were terrorists! Children were shocked! In some time teachers were set free and police said it was a mistake! \n Ha-ha, and that it their new terrorists' data base! The govt spent dozens of millions on it and as a result we have shocked children and teachers! I think that war against terrorism was thought out to bluff people because thus we'll support any budget augmentation for Special Services upgrade!",
