   "Theism is not the only alternative to materialism. \n\n \n Of course not. The other alternative is immaterialism in which immaterial causes are NECESSARY to account for observable (ie material) outcomes. But so far there is not a SINGLE instance where immaterialism contributes any explanation of observable outcomes in which the immaterial explanation is an improvement over the materialist one. Oops.\n \n \n Belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space does not require belief in a personal god. \n \n\n \n Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.\n \n Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.\n \n \nOne does not have to ascribe to any particular religious belief to be skeptical that natural cselection could create complex biological organs out of a series of genetic accidents.\n \n \n One can be skeptical without being a theist - wow a revelation. Indeed one might say that being a theist inhibits skepticism to a large degree. On the other hand a skeptic will find it hard to maintain his skepticism of NDS or modern evolutionary theory if he is honest about it. Science works on the basis of RATIONAL skepticism, not RADICAL skepticism. which is oblivious to both evidence and logic.\n \n And of course there is an awful lot of evidence that not only can natural selection against a background of normal variability result in the evolution of complex organs - it actually HAS done so. \n \n \nBelief that all living systems have some limited ability to respond intelligently and purposefully to the environment during growth and development has nothing to do with religion. \n\n \n It also has nothing to do with modern science. Its wishful thinking and projection of human qualities onto non-human natural systems. A philosophical stance unsupported by evidence for organisms without intelligence and very close to the long discarded concept of vitalism which invoked elan vital - as some ephemeral non-physical thing which differentiates life from the rest of matter. There is no reason to accept vitalist theories whatsoever.\n \n \nID is not \"biblical creationism\"\n\n \n Well not exactly, but it does come down to \"biblical creationism\" without the courage to admit that it is a son of \"biblical creationism\". At least the biblical creationists (YEC and OECs) were sufficiently honest to identify their candidate for the creator/designer. IDers cannot seem to recall who the designer might be - they like most laywers take the fifth amendment.\n \n \n \nOne version of ID would be that biological change originates in living systems, not their genomes. \n\n \n Which is roughly like claiming that your vision originates in your brain but not your eyes. Genomes are vital components of organisms, they are not some external entity. Genomes are subsystems of living systems indeed essential components.\n \n \n \nAll biological systems are guided in their development by a memory of the development of their ancestors. \n \n \n Which memory is stored in and retrieved from their genomes. Yes you are right a dog will develop from an animal having a dog genome which is how dogs remember how to make a dog.\n \n \nHowever from the moment of conception organisms have some limited ability to reorganize their development if circumstances warrent, and that ability to change decreases with age.\n\n \n But if there are too many dogs wandering around they do not change to be cats, or rabbits, or humans do they. They do not change so as to have eight legs and spider eyes do they. But yes development of the phenotype is a result of the genetic heritage interacting with the environment, but its not an intelligent process. If you starve a young organism to near the point of death and then rescue it with food it will not develop as if it had food when it needed it. It will not express its full genetic potential. The environment OFTEN changes the outcome of development by imposing limits on reaching the biotic potential provided in the genome.\n \n \nReligious people are certainly free to believe their god might participate in such a process. But the concept is equally coherent without any particular religious belief.\n\n \n Actually the idea (intelligent modification of a developing organism by that organism during its development) is as INCOHERENT with or without the introduction of GOD. Its an immaterialist concept invoking elan vital or its equiavlent which these days is sometimes designated as \"intelligence\" so as to put the old and spoiled wine of vitalism into new bottles with the hopes that the new label will allow the proponents to sell it to the public.",

If one denies materialism, which also means materialistic causes for the origination/evolution of life then that leaves a bit of a void when it comes to how everything -- including humans -- got here. If the mind or intelligent, internal, nonrandom processes are what drives evolutionary change, then that answers nothing as to how the intelligent processes got here in the first place.

Perhaps what we describe as 'life' is statistically inevitable given the prevailing conditions in the universe. And the prevailing conditions in the universe could be the way they are for a reason completely unrelated to the existence of what we call 'life'. Or for no reason at all.\n \n Perhaps every possible universe exists, derived from every possible set of rules or lack of rules, consistent or inconsistent - universes that would defeat our powers of comprehension entirely. Or perhaps there's just this one, and its amenability to something we've decided to label 'life' is an accident. Either way, asking 'why this and not that' is a question that only makes sense when playing by the rules of this universe.

One of the things necessary for life, so far as I can see, is consistency - things operating according to rules. For what we call 'intelligent life' to exist it must be further possible for organisms to construct a mental model of their surroundings. Hence their universe must be amenable to abstract modeling.

I do apologise.\n \n Allow me to try again, and go back to what you said earlier:\n \n \n \n Your purpose in asking this question is to highlight what you perceive as being significant. You're trying to get the reader to think \"hey, yeah, it could have been - yet it's not: that must mean something; it must mean that life is important and significant!\"\n \n But exactly the same could be said about, oh, black holes. \"Why couldn't the universe be just devoid of black holes? Wow, that must mean something! Making black holes must be the whole point of this universe!\"\n \n Black holes are an inevitable consequence of the physics of this universe - and so far as we know, so is what we call 'life'. The existence of either says nothing about whether the universe was designed with them in mind. Maybe the universe was designed to bring forth life, and black holes are an incidental side-effect. Or maybe it's the other way around. Or maybe neither.\n \n And then there are all the wondrous and amazing things the universe doesn't contain - things we can't even imagine; things that would make black holes and 'life' look positively mundane by comparison. Is our universe really all that special?\n \n Perhaps meaningless is the wrong word for the question you're asking. \"Misleading\" is better, because it presumes that whatever the answer is must pertain to your belief that life is special and important in absolute terms, rather than just being special and important to those experiencing it. You're falsely inferring support for your philosophical position from our ability to ask the question, rather than from any particular answer. Now do you see what I'm saying?\n\n \n I am not asking you about the meaning of life. I am simply asking you how come that life exists, how come that inert matter organised itself to produce life and intelligence and mind an self-awareness. I never mentioned black-holes.\n \n You are being disingenuous pretending to miss the point.\n \n All I wanted was to know if you had any answers to my questions and you don't. \n \n So I think it is pointless to continue this subject for I already got the answer : you simply don't know why life exists and you don't know why mathematics which are an abstraction and therefore independent of our material universe are an intrinsical part of it. You don't know what mind is and what is the connection of it to the brain. But that is OK nobody has ever found an answer yet, maybe we never will.\n \n Philosophy is divided on the nature of mathematics. some philosophers and mathematicians think that math are a social construct other think like Plato that they are eternal, independent of matter. so all mathematicians do is to discover them.",

Like crystals forming, like the nuclear fusion taking place in the sun - to put it crudely it's what matter does when it's a certain shape. We aren't sure what the very simplest 'shapes' were yet, but we're working on it. So, my plain and straightforward answer to why life exists is the laws of physics. \n \n You're trying to make something out of the fact that life exists - trying to imply that it must have happened for a purpose, rather than merely a reason. Inferring purpose from the fact of the existence of life is as fallacious as inferring purpose from the fact of the existence of black holes. If you think the question 'why does life exist?' has philosophical import, then so does the question 'why do black holes exist?' because both are equally inevitable consequences of the laws of physics.\n \n Now, if you can't spot an answer in there somewhere (I bolded it just in case), I really can't help you.",

After all, if god the designer exists, then he must be more complex than the universe he has designed, so if we feel we need to postulate an intelligent origin for something as complex as the universe, then we are forced to contemplate an even more intelligent origin for the intelligent designer.

   "you haven't defined 'reality'. aren't you confusing the perception of reality with reality itself?\n \n are you saying that matter and energy are not material? what are they then ?\n \n Science is just about answering 'how?\" not about answering 'why?\"\n \n It is by definition limited.\n \n Religion does not answer neither 'how' nor 'why' but seems to satisfy the majority of people by just saying: \"God made it so\" and who would argue with that?\n\n \n Science does answer Why? questions in addition to how? questions. Evolution is a case in point -- evolutionary theory gives reason and mechanism, proximate and effective causes. It can even answer a question such as \"Why evolution?\"\n \n As for the \"God did it!\" line of argument, the problem is not with that, it's with the \"My god did it and you'd better believe it or else\" line of argument that so many Christian fundamentalists are so fond of. The trouble is \"God made it so\" isn't a satisfactory answer to any question, because it provides neither mechanisms nor reasons. It just makes a vapid assertion without any visible means of support. Lots of people just aren't satisfied with that.",
