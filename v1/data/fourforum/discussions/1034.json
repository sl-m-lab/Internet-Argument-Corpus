   "Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) have been used by one nation over the last fifty years; the United States. Still, this nation has not been brought to account.\n\n \n Those in power make the rules. I doubt we will ever be held accountable for this. I'm actually surprised that you are not debating here that the US has no right to stop other countries from making WMDs if they have them themselves.\n \n \nnuclear: Only one nation has used these in anger; the United States of America - against Japan.\n\n \n I don't think it was used in anger as much as it was to save lives. Yes, it was to save American lives, not Japanese ones. So sue us.\n \n \nIn peace-time the United States irradiated various islands in the Pacific (most famous being Bikini Atoll); as well as countless tests on American human guinea-pigs.\n\n \n Tests on human guinea pigs? Anyways you should be more upset about France doing this so recently rather than the US who quit doing this long ago.\n \n As for the cases where people got unintentionally hurt because of our use of WMDs, those are unfortunate cases but what do you expect us to do about it? All those things listed were unintentional and I really doubt that anyone could have expected it to occur. Also if you want to talk about unintentionally consequences, then why not mix in pollution problems caused by the US? Why are you not going to bring up Russia who caused much worse things to happen in Europe after Chernobyl?\n \n \n \n biological: Anthrax used on American Postal Workers - suggestion made that the Anthrax was from disgruntled American scientists\n http://www.tetrahedron.org/articles/anthrax/anthrax_espionage.html\n\n \n And the North Koreans use Russian planes. Shall we hold Russia responsible for whatever the North Koreans are about to do?\n \n \nStill to this day, this rogue state has not been called to account.\n\n \n How would you like us to be held accountable? Do you want us to rebuild the atolls? Then what will you make other countries do? Do you want us to pay for those who got sick from nuclear weapons tests? Then the same will go for every other country who did this as well? Use of chemicals causing sickness? Do you even hold Saddam responsible for this? Do you hold every country responsible for their pollution related deaths? And of course, if you hold us responsible for our use of a nuclear weapon that caused the death of so many people, then can we hold Japan accountable for crashing planes into things to kill people? We sure held al Queda responsible for it.",
