I had experience with what your were saying about children getting passes even tho they didnt know the work. there was a young lady in 12th grade that couldnt pass the Graduation test becuase she couldnt even write a simple 4 paragraph paper. Now sombody had to lie for years for her to get all the way to 12th grade and not be able to write!!",

But this is still a problem. NCLB didn't fix this. All that is happening now is, for example, kids in quite a few schools are being taught nothing but math and reading in 5th grade because that is all NCLB tests for at that level. They aren't getting science, social studies, etc. I don't know how NCLB came out of anyone, especially a supposed \"conservative\" which Bush has made painfully clear that he is anything but.\n All this act does is equivocate nationally standardized testing (which is impossible to do well) with education. You'd think they would have maybe talked to a few teachers before throwing this :xcensored out there.",

We (as a school) spent more time \"studying\" for these tests and actually passed as a school this year (we failed the last 2 years). So how does less instructional time and more time just practicing for these tests mean we're learning more? Answer, these tests don't test how much you've learned. By the way, these tests are in no way a measure of how much you know. For biology, while we were learning about the history of life, macromolecules, and stuff like that, the NCLB tests had stuff about \"which tool would you use to measure this? Ruler, yardstick, etc.?\" Pointless bull@#$#.",

   "I think that the Bush Administration thought they had a great idea and I mean the title \"No Child Left Behind\" sounds great too, but the real title should be \"No Child Left Untested\". I don't think standarized testing is the answer and I also disagree with a lot of the legislation in No Child Left Behind because it puts all of the accountability on the teacher and doesn't consider the fact that a teacher can be the most amazing incredible teacher there is, but there are some kids who just aren't motivated and maybe that has to do with parents, maybe it just has to do with the individual child, but whatever it is, teachers should not be held 100% accountable for a child's low test score on standardized testing. \n \n I do believe we need some sort of reform, but I don't think standardized testing is the answer. In addition to that not every child is the same. Standardized testing pretty much says that \"one test fits all\". However, even though we try to mainstream kids and say that they all fit into one test, that simply is not true. \n \n I am a middle school science teacher, however because I have a special knack at helping out kids who are in resource and ESL. I have a lot of students who aren't up to reading level or who don't understand the test. A lot of them need special accomodations, but even with those special accomodations it doesn't mean they have the same advantage as the other kids I teach. Honestly in some ways I want to tell the resource teachers or the ESL teachers to stop giving me so many of their kids because in reality they bring down my test scores and with NCLB legislation, if my test scores don't reach a certain proficiency level by 2012 then I'm in danger of losing my job. I take the ESL and resource kids because I care and I want them to feel like they are apart of a normal classroom. I want them to feel included with the other kids who aren't in resource or ESL, but it does bring down my scores.",
