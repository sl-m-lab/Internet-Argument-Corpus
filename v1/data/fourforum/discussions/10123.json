   "Gould once said that an organism was not merely a result of a culmination of its genes. (I'm paraphrasing here, as I don't have the exact quote.) In the same vein in The Panda's Thumb, he said body parts are not translated genes...(again don't have the exact quote but I can find that one if someone really wants it.)\n \n So my question is, if he is right, and body parts such as knees, kneecaps, lungs, tongues and eardrums are not translated genes, how did they oginate in the first place? \n \n Even skin color....look at the following link:\n \n http://in.news.yahoo.com/070108/139/6axgp.html\n \n London, Jan 8 (ANI): People of particular races look different not because of a difference in genes but the same genes being expressed differently.\n \n So is it a surprise to anyone that the distinction of race in humans has no genetic basis? And there can be no darwinist selection if there is no genetic change. There can be no selection if the organism is merely using its genes as tools to express itself.\n \n Likewise with these caterpillars:\n \n http://www.livescience.com/animals/060202_lab_evo.html\n \n The idea was to use similar temperature shocks to evolve a similar change in M. sexta.....Differing color traits induced by environmental factors are called polyphenisms\n .\n Similar differences show up in genetically identical ants, which can develop into queens, soldiers, or workers based on the hormones they're exposed to early in development. Similar hormonal differences can affect the specific color of a butterfly or bird.\n \n Scientists have not understood evolution's exact role in the differences. \n \n So once again, what we have is a contradiction to darwinism, which says only populations evolve. Instead, we have individuals who have the ability to evolve during development. No change in genes, no selection, no darwinism. Just a re-expression of the same genes during development in response to an environmental cue. These expressions are heritable. \n \n But the key here is there's no change in genes. Remember, Gould said the organism is not merely a culmination of its genes. And this proves it. But ToE says new body parts show up randomly, just by pure chance:\n \n http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/nwep1.htm\n \n Adaptations are the result of evolution. Evolution is a change in a species over long periods of time. \n \n Adaptations usually occur because a gene mutates or changes by accident! Some mutations can help an animal or plant survive better than others in the species without the mutation. \n \n For example, imagine a bird species. One day a bird is born with a beak that is longer than the beak of other birds in the species. The longer beak helps the bird catch more food. Because the bird can catch more food, it is healthier than the other birds, lives longer and breeds more. The bird passes the gene for a longer beak on to its offspring. They also live longer and have more offspring and the gene continues to be inherited generation after generation. \n \n The obvious question here is, (outside of a blatant contradiction to Gould) where did this new gene come from? A similar question can be made of a recent post by WW regarding butterflies. New genes don't pop up randomly, accidentally out of magic hats. David Copperfield isn't responsible for biology. But even if a gene could pop up out of thin air for no reason (and from no cause), by Gould's admission, organisms -- and their parts -- are not translated genes.\n \n And remember, the article above says that skin color does not have a genetic basis. Neither did the change in caterpillar color, the sex of ants, or colors of birds or butterflies. So my question is -- can anyone in here show me ANY body part that has a genetic basis....?\n \n And if no body part has a genetic basis -- how did body parts originate and get selected? If body parts are a culmination of multiple genes, then it would take all the genes being in the same place at the same time for that corresponding body part to appear. And obviously it opens up the possbility, if all the genes are not in place to create a whole, fully-functional body part, then we should be seeing organisms/fossils all over the world that have 10%, 20%, or 50% limbs.....not to mention partial organs.\n \n So the main question here is: do specific body parts correlate to specific genes. If not, then please explain yourself.",

Just yesterday a guy came on here and made a post about how he couldn't believe in creation because creationists had no explanation for the races. I told him that the emergence of different races had absolutely nothing to do with darwinism because skin color is not genetic. Instead, skin color is an epigenetic trait, and as a corrolation, I even showed him a link how green caterpillars can turn black when exposed to heat during development. Here it is:\n \n http://www.livescience.com/animals/060202_lab_evo.html\n \n The idea was to use similar temperature shocks to evolve a similar change in M. sexta.....Differing color traits induced by environmental factors are called polyphenisms\n .\n Similar differences show up in genetically identical ants, which can develop into queens, soldiers, or workers based on the hormones they're exposed to early in development. Similar hormonal differences can affect the specific color of a butterfly or bird.\n \n Scientists have not understood evolution's exact role in the differences. lol!\n \n So what we have in the above experiment is a contradiction to darwinism, which says only populations evolve. Instead, we have individuals who have the ability to evolve during development. \n\n \n Color change in response to developmental differences in temperature is not evolution. Strawman.\n\n Quote:\n \n No change in genes, no selection, no darwinism. Just a re-expression of the same genes during development in response to an environmental cue. These expressions are obviously heritable. \n\n \n It is amazing what you can find out when you look beyond a dumbed-down internet news article. This is the paper alluded to in the linked story:\n \n =====================================Science. 2006 Feb 3;311(5761):650-2.\n \n Evolution of a polyphenism by genetic accommodation.\n Suzuki Y, Nijhout HF.\n Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA. ys16@duke.edu\n \n Polyphenisms are adaptations in which a genome is associated with discrete alternative phenotypes in different environments. Little is known about the mechanism by which polyphenisms originate. We show that a mutation in the juvenile hormone-regulatory pathway in Manduca sexta enables heat stress to reveal a hidden reaction norm of larval coloration. Selection for increased color change in response to heat stress resulted in the evolution of a larval color polyphenism and a corresponding change in hormonal titers through genetic accommodation. Evidently, mechanisms that regulate developmental hormones can mask genetic variation and act as evolutionary capacitors, facilitating the origin of novel adaptive phenotypes.=======================================\n \n And what was it Supersport wrote?\n \n Ah, yes:\n \n \"No change in genes, no selection, no darwinism\"\n \n \n\n Quote:\n So is it any surprise that we also see that races of humans have no genetic basis? Of course not! \n \n http://in.news.yahoo.com/070108/139/6axgp.html\n \n London, Jan 8 (ANI): People of particular races look different not because of a difference in genes but the same genes being expressed differently. (ie..no selectionist darwinism again.)\n \n So at this point, only a complete atheist/activist ideologue could maintain that the different races of humans evolved via darwinian selection. If a caterpillar can turn black due to an increase of temperature during development, then there is absolutely no reason to believe that humans can't do the same thing. And again, the effects are heritable. And if different races/different pigmentations don't arise as a result of selection, why should we believe any other biological trait does?\n \n Darwinism is scientifically worthless and it needs to be flushed.\n \n edit:.....the article says that skin color does not have a genetic basis. So my question is -- can anyone in here show me ANY body part that has a genetic basis....? \n\n \n The very title of the article shows that you are being dishonest/incompetent in your 'reporting':\n \n Same genes expressed differently behind races looking different\n \n \n Genes being expressed differently is NOT a genetic basis?\n \n Of course, again, we see something different when we look at the actual paper:\n \n =============================================Nat Genet. 2007 Feb;39(2):226-31. Epub 2007 Jan 7.\n Common genetic variants account for differences in gene expression among ethnic groups.\n Spielman RS, Bastone LA, Burdick JT, Morley M, Ewens WJ, Cheung VG.\n Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. spielman@pobox.upenn.edu\n \n Variation in DNA sequence contributes to individual differences in quantitative traits, but in humans the specific sequence variants are known for very few traits. We characterized variation in gene expression in cells from individuals belonging to three major population groups. This quantitative phenotype differs significantly between European-derived and Asian-derived populations for 1,097 of 4,197 genes tested. For the phenotypes with the strongest evidence of cis determinants, most of the variation is due to allele frequency differences at cis-linked regulators. The results show that specific genetic variation among populations contributes appreciably to differences in gene expression phenotypes. Populations differ in prevalence of many complex genetic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. As some of these are probably influenced by the level of gene expression, our results suggest that allele frequency differences at regulatory polymorphisms also account for some population differences in prevalence of complex diseases.==================================\n What is an allele, Sport? And what does frequency difference mean to you?\n \n This was a particularly poor showing by you, Sport. Your hyperbolic thread title seems especially pathetic in light of the fact that, yet again, your \"interpretation\" of news releases (the second of which, sadly, was so poorly written that I can almost see how you misinterpreted what was written) was so comically inept that this thread can really only act to embarrass the YECs on this board.\n\n \n Sport then, of course, went on a tangent-fest attempting to justify and support his misinterpretation and failed miserably, but, of cours,e that is beyond his ability to realize.",

   "Derwood/SLP: The experiment involved did not produce a new mutation, it unmasked the old one. You see? \n \n Yes I see -- and it's just as I said...the mutation part was a guess based on Fred's worldview.\n\n Brick wall...\n\n \n It's no different than Richard Dawkins blindly claiming that millions of copying errors built up animals gradually over millions of years. It's a guess -- and a non-evidence-based guess at that. I could do the same thing by saying God formed this ability with a bolt of lightning. What's the difference? Neither is science.\n\n Gibberish.\n\n \n The rest of the experiment, the acutal biological reality, has nothing to do with darwinism...in fact, it's anti-darwin. Sorry, you sure wasted alot of time and effort for nothing.\n\n \n That much is true - it is clearly a waste of time to try to correct the naivete, ignorance, and false claims of an invincibly ignorant propganda spewing rube.\n \n By the way, I've been very busy today...my wife's been dragging me back and forth to relatives' houses. So even a 3-minute \"dig\" is more than I can manage at the moment.[/QUOTE]",
