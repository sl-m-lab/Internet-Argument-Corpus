This is why we have established such drastic measures to control inflation. The two main methods we use to control inflation in the US are intrest rates and government spending. We are seeing an interesting phenomenon right now. Interest rates are as low as they are likely to get (low enough that it is damaging some portions of the economy), and government spending is way up. The dollar is still down. This has never happened before. \n \n We saw a brief economic burst when the government went to deficit spending (500 billion in new revenue being injected into the market will always give you a little burst), but the result was not as drastic as some felt it should have been. You also have a situation where scrap comodities (scrap metals) are goin up in price, which has always been a fairly accurate indicator of impending inflation.

   "Europe cannot bring up the value of the dollar, we can only do that here at home. You see an interesting trend looking back tot he last 60 yrs or so (namely since WWII). You will note that there has been a progressive increase in revenue for the top 20% of our society. The problem is that the economy has stalled. We have seen this before. Imagine capitolism as a guy in a tree with a hose. The idea is, all the lower class folks put water into the line, it ries up the tree, and the upper class (the guy with the hose) is the guy with the hose (I think I have used this analogy before). the hose has a mist sprayer on it, and the money is re-distributyed down tot he lower classes (through the purchase of goods and services).\n \n Somebody has installed a tank at the top of the tree. The majority of Americas money is not in circulation, keeping the economy running. It is sitting in trust fuds and bank accounts. There is some question as to whether or not there is enough money left in circulation to bring the economy out of the slump it is in, and to save the dollar. The closest comparison to the current US economy (an almost exact match, in fact) is english feudalism. \n \n This ha actually happened before (during the depression). Then, we had WWII that brought us out of the slump. I don't thinkthere is going to be another world war handy to save us this time. We are going to have to get creative. \n \n It is interesting to me that, while most peple can tell you whn the depression occured, ad what casue it (stock market crash) most people have no idea where the money all went, and if you ask them, you get this kind of dumbfounded look and \"well, it was gone\". Peple tend to think of money as a liquid because we say it flows. If it flows, logic tells us it can evaporate. This is not actually the case. Money does not evaporate. \n \n Stalls in the economy like we are seeing now were predicted by early economic commentators and economic theorists. The predictions of such events was largly the reason that the founding fathers saw fit to required a backed currency. You are right, we could not back the dollar. If you cannot back the currency, it stands to reason that it is overvalued. \n \n As far as the price of gold being unstable, to a degree, you are right. There are minor fluctuations in it's value. You cannot afford to look at the daily, monthly, or eve yearly cost of gold. You have to look at the long run. The same is true of silver. If we had kept gold and silver backing for US currency, the dollar would be worth $3.20 (1940's dollars)today, instead, the dollar is worth about $0.21 (again, 1940's dollars). The moral of the story is: If you can't back it, don't issue it. In the days leading up to WWII, you could take a wheelbarrow full of 500,000 mark notes to the post office, and by the time you got there you would not have enough money to buy a stamp. \n \n Of course, it is too late to fix this now. Now we just have to figure out how we are going to correct our economy, since the only two controls that have been proven effective in the past have failed. I have seen a couple of economists on TV say the same thing you did, that we could count on Europe to pull us out of the slump. Neither of them was able to give an answer as to exactly how they believed Europe was going to do this. Inflationary control is 100% an internal matter. Besides, I think that europe would be more than happy to let the dollar crash. While there would be short term difficulties in the rest of the world (and not as severe as many seem to want to predict), I think the european Union would be happy to see the Euro emerge as the new standard worlwide currency.\n \n The US, and US citizens tend to overestimate the effect the US has on the rest of the world. If we woke up tommorow, and the US was wiped off the face of the planet, the rest of the world would survive. Thre would be a worldwide recession, with economies in a large portion of the world being depressed by as much as 20% i some cases. This is really no big deal, we have seen 20% economic depressions before. Thre is some indication (such as other currencies rising as the dollar falls) that a world without the US would be economically advantageous after the adjustment period.",

I am not calling you a liar, as I am certain you heard it from an allegedly reputable source. It is a lie that has been told for years. \n \n Devaluation of the dollar leads to higher prices, as the dollar is worth less. In the last 20 years, we have seen prices rise with inflation, but when inflation declines, we have not once witnessed a general decline in prices in proportion to the decline in inflation. Short term, a weak dollar is great for large corporations, manufaturers and retailers. It allows them to raise prices without raising eyelids. Inflation is TERRIBLE for the poulation at large. You are working for the same amount of money, but your buying power is greatly decreased.\n \n I have seen several economists point as low interest rates as one of the primary causes of inflation. Low interest rates has always in the past been an economic stimulus, whihc helps curb inflation. What low interest rates hurts is the marketability of treasury bonds. Low marketability of treasury bonds due to low interest rates is NOT the same as a weak dollar.",

   "That clarifies things, though I do still think you are putting a little too much faith in what one private individual can do. A lot of people felt greenspan dropped the ball here lately. If instead of a bunch of little quarter or half percent decreases in the interest rates, he had advocated a couple of bigger drops, it might have set the economy straight. Of course, now we will never know. \n \n I think that a particular element of his testimony the other day was very telling. This is the guy who backed Reagan to the nines on deficit spending. This time around, he is heavily advocating a different approach. Whether he dropped the ball or not, people should pay a little more attention when he says \"no more deficit spending right now\". I just hope that the economic \"geniuses\" in washington were listening.\n \n I think the American economy is in much greater peril than people are willing to realise. With the interest rates where they are, the big tax cuts, and the injection of $500 billion in phantom money, the economy should have shot right up. Instead, we are looking at \"moderate\" gains (whihc during the Reagan, Bush 1 or Clinton era would have been called \"minimal\" gains). And we are arguing about whether there were 112,000 or 113,000 jobs created. 112,000 or 113,000 jobs is nothing. We are still running in the red as far as jobs go.\n \n \nThe ECB has changed it's policy.

I have been watching them pretty carefully for the last several months, waiting for the beginning of the big dip. It is a little troublesome to me that scrap metlas have just started a real climb. This would indicate that the \"big dip\" is yet to come. I'm not sure how much of a \"big dip\" we can take.
