   "http://blog.case.edu/mxs24/2005/07/18/the_allure_of_rapture_violence\n \n \nJuly 18, 2005\n The allure of rapture violence\n I must say that since I recently started reading about the rapture (see here and here for previous posts on it), it has fascinated me. (Some readers of this blog who had never heard of the rapture before I started posting on it have told me they were startled to find people they know accepting the idea of it very matter-of-factly, as if it were nothing special.) Not that I take the basic idea of huge numbers of people being transported suddenly up into heaven seriously, of course. That strikes me as a wild flight of fancy that belongs in the same genre as Star Wars or Harry Potter films, i.e., enjoyable largely because it is so outrageously improbable.\n \n No, what interests me is the sociology behind it, especially the question of what it is that attracts otherwise presumably regular people to believe in this dark tale of violence, revenge, cruelty, and blood.\n \n The basic rapture story is that at some point (devotees think \"very soon\"), a select group of people will be raptured up to heaven by Jesus, and from that vantage point they will observe the Antichrist ruling the world, leading to seven years of violent struggle between the good and bad forces left behind on Earth. As the Left Behind novel series illustrates, the people propagating the rapture myths do not see the violence in the rapture story as something that is a necessary evil, to be passed over quickly before the final victory of God. No, they actually wallow in it, imagining it in the most lurid of details. In his highly entertaining review of the books, Gene Lyons recounts one passage:\n \n Rayford watched through the binocs as men and women soldiers and horses seemed to explode where they stood. It was as if the very words of the Lord had superheated their blood, causing it to burst through their veins and skin. . . . Their innards and entrails gushed to the desert floor, and as those around them turned to run, they too were slain, their blood pooling and rising in the unforgiving brightness of the glory of Christ.\n and says that \"the slaughter runs on for close to eighty gleeful pages.\" (my emphasis)\n \n I find it hard to fathom the attraction of something like this. I have never understood the appeal of violence, even fictionalized, so that I avoid films that have excessive amounts of it. This dislike started early for me. I remember even as a very young child hating circuses, mainly because they had people (like trapeze artists) who were risking death and injury just for the sake of entertaining others, and this just made no sense to me. I could have tolerated it if the trapeze artists and tightrope walkers performed with a safety net. I can understand that some people (like firefighters, police, and soldiers) have to take risks as part of their job, but they at least take as many safety precautions as they can. Taking huge and avoidable risks just for entertainment seems absurd to me.. The recent mauling of Roy Horn by the tiger in his act sickened me because the senselessness of it all.\n \n I know that many people do not have the same reaction to violence as I do, but there is a difference (I feel) between being able to tolerate violence as a an unavoidable component of life and actually enjoying it, and it is the latter response that I find hard to understand. I know that there are people who flock to the scene of some disaster, hoping to see the injured or dead, and then relish repeating what they have seen over and over to whoever will listen. That kind of attitude is incomprehensible to me. But Barbara Rossing in her book The Rapture Exposed suggests that one can get addicted to violence. She quotes Chris Hedges who said that as a former New York Times war correspondent in El Salvador, Bosnia, Kuwait, Iraq, and elsewhere, he became addicted to war. It was like a narcotic and he had to tear himself away from it. . . .\nHmmm, the narcotic effect of violence. OK, that may serve to explain the addiction of rapturists.",

He's back!' and climbed out through the sunroof and jumped off the roof of the car,\" said Everet Williams, husband of 28-year-old Georgann Williams who was pronounced dead at the scene.\n \n \"I was slowing down but she wouldn't wait till I stopped,\" Williams said. \"She thought the rapture was happening and was convinced that Jesus was gonna lift her up into the sky,\" he went on to say.\n \n \"This is the strangest thing I've seen since I've been on the force,\" said Paul Madison, first officer on the scene.\n \n Madison questioned the man who looked like Jesus and discovered that he was on his way to a toga costume party, when the tarp covering the bed of his pickup truck came loose and released twelve blow-up sex dolls filled with helium, which then floated up into the sky.\n \n Ernie Jenkins, 32, of Fort Smith, who's been told by several of his friends that he looks like Jesus, pulled over and lifted his arms into the air in frustration and said \"Come back,\" just as the Williams' car passed him, and Mrs. Williams was sure that it was Jesus lifting people up into heaven as they drove by him.\n \n \"I think my wife loved Jesus more than she loved me,\" the widower said when asked why his wife would do such a thing.\n \n When asked for comments about the twelve sex dolls, Jenkins replied \"This is all just too weird for me. I never expected anything like this to happen.\"\n \n \n \n",

   "As it is there have been many healings at loureds, then there are those who for whatever reason have been healed and not told people these healings including physical, emotional and spiritual. For all the healings that have occured at lourdes and there are many, only 62 cases have been validated by Rome as miracles. These healings contary to what you may expect are not \"seized on\" and called \"miracles\" Rome is highly suspicious of such claimes and they take years to investigate them. A doctor may say \"there is no medical explanation for this, its a miracle\" The church would remain skeptical - there are many many cases that have been passed on to the church by medical experts to be validated but the church is reluctant to validate them.\n\n Of the 62 validated cases I think only 3 have occured in living memory IIRC.\n As opposed to the Evangelical churches which seem to have \"miracle healings\" on a laughably regular basis.",

   "People with terminal illnesses dont just get better of their own accord as a man of logic and reason I would have expected a much better answer than that.... a flat out denial would have held more weight than \"some sick people get better of their own accord\" fine yes you cut your fingure it heals but terminal illnesses they dont just get better of their own accord.\n\n \n They do if the diagnosis or prognosis was wrong. Not everyone who is declared terminally ill is. Cancers may go into spontaneous remission - rarely, yes, but not never. If this happens to a pilgrim at Lourdes, it's ascribed to the healing powers of the place; if it happens in the patient's own home we just admit we got the prognosis wrong, or that we don't understand the condition sufficiently.\n \n \nAs it is there have been many healings at loureds, then there are those who for whatever reason have been healed and not told people these healings including physical, emotional and spiritual.

Why does a devout amputee praying for healing at Lourdes not wake up with her legs grown back?",
