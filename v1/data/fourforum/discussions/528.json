   "To understand the actions of a freemason one must think like a freemason. The assaination of JFK was revenge for the burning at the stake of Jarke De molaysbythe catholic church. De Molays was the Grand Master of the Knights Templar latter to become known as the Right Scotish order of Freemasonary. It was also convienient that it brought about revenge for the saking of Robert Dules the brother of the governer of texes and High ranking Freemason. It is also convienient that it brought about the removel of Bobby from the post of attourny general. This ended a war he was haveing with J E Hoowver a high ranking freemason. Italso took the heet of there friends in the Mafia who bobby was also useing his office to attack. They returned the favour by knocking of Oswald who was starting to talk very loudly about the fact he was a CIA contractor.\n \n A MKULTRA stooge was used to get rid of Bobby before he could get the white house and case closed. These were just a couple of occult hits desighned ultimately to effect the mind of the masses. This is known as Ritual Occult Magic and that is what freemasons learn while they are not perfoming acts of kind charity.\n \n It was in fact a coupe. LBJ was a high ranking freemason. He apointed Warren a high ranking freemason to cover up the coupe. Freemasons take blood oaths. This means if they go against the brotherhood they end up like JFK. This information has been available for some time I fail to see the need for speculation.",
