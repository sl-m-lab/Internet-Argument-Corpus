   "Wow, this is the guy that might get elected? It'll be a sad day for americans especially the lower and middle class.\n \n I really don't see this \"plan\" going over so well. I personally see:\n \n 1. Bankrupting companies and leading to a sudden drop off of companies providing electricity leaving millions in the dark, or\n \n 2. Those companies hiking their prices and passing it off to the customer - that precious middle class person Obama claims he wants to protect and help out, causing even more economic difficulties for America. Or,\n \n 3. Companies reduce production so they are charged less, leading to drop in supply eading to rolling brownouts, etc. Or,\n \n 4. A combination of the three.\n\n \n \n \n \n I still think McCain's going to take it. I can't force myself to believe that the US has become a place that would elect a person who hates capitalism, hates private property rights, has anti-American friends. I can't believe that people no longer believe in working for their own betterment, and I can't believe that the press is a willing accomplice in it.\n \n The silver lining in an Obama win is that when his BS #### backfires he'll set the liberals back for a generation. Also, we won't have to hear Jesse et al squawking about racist America.",

WHY did they stop us from hearing what he had to say next?\n\n \n Does this mean that it's automatically innaccurate? Thought not.

He prompted for \"better coal\". This project of his would raise taxes, further diminishing CEO incentive. It's odd that many who want to start their own business also want to vote for Osama. People want to start a business. When that option (or delusion) is no longer on the table, then they scream for the government to lower their taxes. I will once again ask the question that you evaded: Where's the ceiling?\n \n \n4) MCCAIN has been shown to SUPPORT what Obama WAS ACTUALLY proposing.\n But of course you guys ignore that, don't you...\n\n \n What reason have I to refute it if you don't even support it?\n \n \nThis is dealt with elsewhere, and you're relying on other lies to try to pass this junk off\n\n \n So far, you've done nothing to support this except scream \"YOU'RE WRONG!!! YOU'RE WRONG!!!!!\"\n \n \nNo, Ethmi, his opponents lie through their teeth.\n And then they refuse to deal with the truth when it is offered.\n\n \n And what is this \"truth\" you speak of? Or does it exist?\n \n \nQUIT MAKING UP QUOTES.\n Quote EXACTLY what he said, IN CONTEXT, or don't even try...\n You guys are so filthily dishonest its repugnant!\n\n \n It seems everyone you debate is predictabley dishonest or evasive. Are you so desperate? Second, stop shouting. This is a debate forum, not a place to scream and bitch and say that people are wrong and stupid. If you want to do that, go to a noob site like speakout. You've misquoted me before. Do you forget so soon?\n \n \n\n Even the \"Palin's a racist screamers, blah, blah, blah...\n \n\n \n What you did to me is what I did to Obama.
