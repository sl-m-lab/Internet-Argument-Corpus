   "I'm not going to confirm but I seems that most part of Georgian officials took their cue from president Saakashvili. This babbler infected anyone! Well, they just lie in case back-burner issue but in time of 'global' problems they could get order from president how to lie! \n July 26 as a result of Asin terrorists' diversion a half part of Georgia was cut off from juice! But head of PTL-500 Imereti declared that it was simple emergency! How long will you lie?\n Look, my friend from police said that it was a warning of terrorists to Saakashvili who delays payments to them! It's too hard for perception - Georgian president pays for terrorists! And in case of trouble terrorists start thinking how to jog memory!",

   "Georgian opposition faces new treatment of officials. Not a single publishing firm would dare accept an order for making graphic arts production for opposition under pains of shutdown! Manager of some publishing firms apologized a lot but told me that most part of Georgia has got unofficial warning of Ministry of Home Affairs that any collaboration with opposition will lead to punishment! In fact, Saakashvili has got full control over Georgian printed matters in his gands. Wasn't it enough of Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of State Security's restrictions of opposition and nation-wide oppressions? But no, Saakashvili just wants to shut everybody up! People are sort of to know their place whilst bloody dictatorship is basically maintained through fear and foggage! As for the rest of the world, Saakashvili gives one more deception show!",

   "Since when did international organizations start to close their eyes at human rights violation? I wonder can it ride on the fact who and how violate those rights?\n Georgian friends of mine told me that over two hundred of Georgian soldiers and officers who refused to take part of this gamble are in prison from the time of war in South Ossetia (2008)! If you please that during two years those people are in prison no trial, no record! Most interesting that everybody in Georgia know about it but no one do anything!\n I'm sure that coursed Georgian nation afraid their dictator but why tenners of non-governmental organizations are keep silent about it? Those organizations are working in Georgia officially but keep silent! There are a lot of questions but too little answers. I want to ask you: all those organizations and humanitarian funds can actuate the case of human right violation by order from high-rank owners. It could be Washington's order, for example. That's why all of it keeps silent - they didn't have an order for it only!",

   "I'm sitting in my chair and smiling, I'm smiling because I know that Georgian president Saakashvili is sly but now I know his secret. All his reports in respect of Sochi Olympic Games are XXXXXXXX!\n It's true some time ago I have read a lot of information in the web and of course I have had a wrong opinion in this connection - I thought that Sochi is scrap-heap now. In actual fact we all made great mistake! I took part in International Investment Forum 'Sochi-2010' on France delegation and during three September days I saw a lot and everything what I saw made me happy! That is not the case that we've got some bumper contracts; I saw Sochi 2014 preparation alive! I was shocked by range of constructions! Now I'm sure that Russian will be able to realize their promises and I know that the words of the head of International Olympic Committee are not vox, this is reality! That's why I have a right to say that Saakashvili is twaddler only. We can't spend our time for hearing of his mad delirations!",

Friends of mine told me that American type weapons and equipment used by Nagorno-Karabakh Self-Defense Force!\n I was shocked but they are frontier guards and can't lie to me! In truth I could take no notice of it but for present Saakashvili's dalliance with Aliev! It looks like Saakashvili is trying to keep company with everybody but our president he has used as a guarantee of his power keeping! At that time Saakashvili stoop to anything even debt retirement by weapons delivered by USA. I wonder what American advisers of Saakashvili could say about this fact.\n Saakashvili is like Lukashenko now who shows his dirty dances for all but now we knew that his days are numbered; for only thing, no one knows how long Saakashvili is to stay in power!",
