Many elements of Gardnerian practice and liturgy are ancestral to other traditions of* Witchcraft, partly through Gardner's influential books on the Craft. Gardnerians are among the most widespread of Wiccan traditions around the world. But in my opinion after reading many of the books related to this tradition and also reading some things that debunked him. I came to the conclusion that Gerald Gardner came up with his version of witchcraft so justify his need to be scourged before sex.\n But I think as whole the Pagan belief system if you take out all the \"hookies\" is very beautiful and not so different than Christianity.\n emoticon_xangel",

   "Yes, I've had to abandon my faith based on your presnting such devastating rebuttals based on NO CONFUSION (wink) of persons named Jesus.\n\n What a rash thing to do, montalban! Golly gee, don't do that over something as silly as the idea of a historical Christ. What difference does it make whether something happened historically to your *faith*?\n \n \nIf they don't require evidence, how is it that they are based on science?\n\n Not \"based on science\". I said \"supported by science\". It does not require evidence because it is not based on \"faith\" in anything except life itself.\n \n \nAre you saying 'love' is your god? \n\n That would be an over-simplification. \n \n \nHow do you worship your 'gods' and how do they respond? How did they reveal themselves to you?\n\n Mine is not a religion of \"mysteries\" in the sense of St Paul's Gnosticism or what have you. I do not have \"Gods\" in that sense, as I said. There may be a particular personification of spirit I am trying to connect with and learn from, but I don't believe in a binary spiritual/material world, so everything I want revealed is everywhere in nature. \n \n \nWhy is it that your beliefs are based on contemporary science? What about science of the early 1900s? Did that not prove or explain your gods? What do you do when science changes (as it does)? Will you develop newer gods based on newer science?\n\n The closer science gets to the truth, the more it approaches my beliefs. The more holistic a scientific study, the more it approaches truth. Because we believe in the sacredness of the profane, we can find meaning and \"God\" in the Krebs cycle. \n \n \"Science\" is only a description of a form of study, montalban. Scientists, or the \"scientific community\" has changed over time, because it is made up of people who are therefore influenced and driven by their time and culture. As the \"scientific community\" matures, discoveries are being made which confirm what we have always known- that we are all connected, no creature is \"above\" any other, but we all kill and we all die. So life is a cycle, and in that cycle we can only try to retain the balance between destruction and creation, birth and death, consumption and excretion. \n \n \nIt's almost racist; excluding people who aren't Indian.\n\n Right. So if I wanted to preach a sermon at your church, that'd be okay? \n \n \nI would hope that most Native Americans don't hold the same view as mizzmaxx, and IME, they don't. IMHO it's a terrible way to approach the world and the curiosity/spirituality of others.\n\n Sorry you feel that way, but you should know that this is in fact the consensus from Native ppl. We don't often say so just because of the very response I am getting here. I just hope that despite all of this, those reading will think twice before presuming to jump into some else's sacred traditions.\n \n A quick Google led me to this article, one of many. If you a truly interested in what Native ppl think about this, I suggest you do your own search. Mine was simply \"white Native sweat racism\" or something like that. \n \n This one by Andy Smith is focused on white feminists, but it should go without saying that it applies to any person who is not of a particular community.\n \n \n Indian religions are community-based, not proselytizing, religions. There is not one Indian religion, as many New Ager's would have you believe. Indian spiritual practices reflect the needs of a particular community. Indians do not generally believe that their way is \"the\" way, and consequently, they have no desire to tell outsiders about their practices. A medicine woman would be more likely to advise a white woman to look into her own culture and find what is liberating in it.\n \n However, white women seem determined NOT to look into their own cultures for sources of strength. This is puzzling, since pre-Christian European cultures are also earth-based and contain many of the same elements that white are ostensibly looking for in Native American cultures. This phenomenon leads me to suspect that there is a more insidious motive for white \"feminists\" latching onto Indian spirituality.\n \n When white \"feminists\" see how white people have historically oppressed others and how they are coming to very close to destroying the earth, they often want to dissociate themselves from their whiteness. They do this by opting to \"become Indian.\" In this way, they can escape responsibility and accountability for white racism.\n \n Of course, white \"feminists\" want to become only partly Indian. They do not want to be part of our struggles for survival against genocide; they do not want to fight for treaty rights or an end to substance abuse or sterilization abuse. They do not want to do anything that would tarnish their romanticized notions of what it means to become an Indian.\n \n Moreover, white women want to become Indian without holding themselves accountable to Indian communities. If they did, they would have to listen to Indians telling them to stop carrying around sacred pipes, stop doing their own sweat lodges, and stop appropriating our spiritual practices. Rather, these New Agers see Indians as romanticized gurus who exist only to meet their consumerist needs. Consequently, they do not understand Indian people or our struggles for survival, and thus they can have no genuine understanding of Indian spiritual practices. \n\n \n For a very thorough statement from some Lakota brothers and sisters, see this page.\n \n \nI too have been to a sweat and mingled with the Natives and never been told such things... \n\n Consider yourself educated.\n \n \nSpirituality knows no color or race...\n\n Until you actually know something about my spirituality, please refrain from trying to tell me how to live it.\n \n \nThe tone of that post shows no humanity and it was flat out rude.\n\n I happen to think it was very polite, given the insulting circumstances. But then again I think that even though I'm an angry Indian, I'm still human. How rude of me!\n \n \nFor many years (until the \"whiteman\" became greedy and hateful) the People shared any- and everything with their white/black/red neighbors - even their lodges. It was an unwritten rule, shared by all the clans/tribes.\n\n Thanks, but I'm familiar with North American Native history. All I want is for you to put down Grey Owl and actually start showing some respect for the people whose spirituality you claim to want to worship. \n \n \ntranslated by Lakhota Sioux Chief Yellow Lark, 1887\n\n Please do see the Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, linked above.",

   "Technically I agree with you - however you have divided peoples into those who are capable of being spiritual - the 'first peoples' and all the horrid invaders who just want to 'appropriate' your religious practices.\n\n Your evaluation is completely incorrect. I believe everyone is capable of being \"spiritual\". I just don't feel the need to be \"spiritual\" with everyone. That is my right.\n \n \nyou've separated people not on their understandings of faith, but by some in-built capability that is typical only to your 'race' (insert what ever divisional name you want to call it).\n\n You're grasping at straws. I don't think anybody else is any less able to be spiritual. That is not what this is about, so quit the ad hominem. I have explained my position clearly, read the previous posts again if you are still confused.\n \n \nRegardless about your wish not to preach, you have no wish to let people explore healing through sweats because that's your thing.\n\n Wrong again. Sweats are not just \"my thing\". Many peoples' cultures, North American First Peoples and Europeans, have healing ceremonies which resemble sweats. I fully support all people engaging in their own traditional healing practices. If they do not have sweats, they probably have some other ceremony which will do just as good a job of healing them, and would be more respectfully used.\n \n \nYou seem to be offended by the knowledge I have gained. Why?\n\n Er... I don't know what you're referring to here... Was it because I was uninterested in your paragraph on Native history as you see it? \n \n \nI am sorry you feel that I have exploited the People. But, that's your opinion.\n\n Me? No, I just feel like you were duped into a fake pseudo-spiritual experience. If you are referring to the Lakota Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, then you are probably correct in your interpretation that you have exploited their culture, and they are angry about it.\n \n That you so easily dismiss the opinion of the people whose culture you purport to wish to learn about only further demonstrates the illegitemacy of you so-called spiritual connection to Native culture. Only once you respect Native ppl, and all our opinions- whether they suit you or not- will you be ready to learn from us. \n \n \nI have respect for the \"Old Ways\" only. The \"New\" ideas coming from the younger, angry Native Americans don't appeal to me at all.\n\n Again, that you feel that you can pick and choose which Native ppl to respect according to what suits you is reflective of your lack of respect for all of us. Many of our youth are angry, and they are warriors, but their connection to our ancestors and our elders is what gives them strength. Your attempt to divide us into \"good indians\" (ones that say what you want to hear), and \"bad indians\" (ones that threaten you with their honesty and self-respect), is further evidence of your disrespect of all of us.\n \n BTW, pls stop referring to us as \"The People\". I don't know where you get this term from, but you should know that there are many First Peoples. \n \n \n I don't think militancy is mainstream. I don't think isolationist is mainstream. \n\n I don't think anything Indians do is \"mainstream\". We are excluded from the \"mainstream\", and do not identify with it on the whole.\n \n I don't know what you mean by \"militancy\", but I assure you that the document is not meant to be \"isolationist\", unless to you the converse of \"isolationism\" is globalization or some other colonial scheme.\n \n \nI also read a few of the responses that were sent by others who had read the link, both native and not, that disagreed with its assertions.\n\n However, the vast majority of Native ppl who posted agreed with the statement. Try as you might to ignore or discount this fact.\n \n As well, there were many non-native ppl who agreed with it, such as this woman-\n \nI love the Beauty of Native American spirituality. I believe in the Great Spirit, in the Creator, and I've read many books by Native Americans and about Native Americans. But to this day, and always, I will never incorporate that which is not mine to take into any ceremony, reading, or other spiritual objective that I am involved in. It is not my way, although I stand in agreement with a great deal of it. I respect it, I love it, but I will not steal it. I have been asked, in my capacity as interfaith minister, to help create rites of passage for white people that are Native American inspired. I always politely and firmly refuse to do so, and more importantly, I tell them WHY. I do so out of respect for my Grandfather's teachings and for the living Native American people. I am not Native American. I have no business teaching or conducting ceremony in that capacity. If the white people want to find a Native American individual that is willing to do Ceremony for them, fine, so be it- that's up to THEM, not me.\n\n And this non-native man-\n \nThe bottom line is it is offensive. Thus, it must stop. I encourage all who deeply desire to commune with the earth, with nature, with who they are, to work for their own personal peace the hard way. The hard way is to recognize and celebrate the different ways that others commune without hijacking pieces and parts. The hard way is to develop a personal relationship with nature that is comfortable. Flash and dash is fun, but it is not lasting. Those who are momentarily blinded by the peace they bought will, in the end, revert to their pre-experience self. The better plan is an inward reflection and recognition that will bring about the lasting comfort and peace that we all strive for.\n\n \n \nHowever, I also feel that no one, and IMHO that includes the majority of Native Americans, would deny anyone with an honest and respectful quest for spriritual knowledge that they possess.\n\n Noone \"possesses\" spiritual knowledge. Nor do I (or the Lakota) have any problem with people engaging in their own spiritual practices. \n \n \nI've never run into this exclusivity or contempt for non-natives \n\n It is telling that you interpret my request for respect as \"contempt\". \n \n \nSomeone that honestly wishes to learn from your spirituality in order to better connect with the world isn't a threat to you, they view you as holding answers they seek.\n\n Again, they are barking up the wrong tree if they go looking for people outside of their traditions for \"the answers\". Any answers they need they will find within themselves or not at all.\n \n This is, IMO, exactly the crux of the issue. The people who want the deep connection with nature, but they also want their SUV. They think that they can get this connection in a weekend conference or a few \"sham-on\" experiences. They think they can just find a Native person and we will give them the secret that will make them feel better about their empty lives. That is not how true spirituality works. I am always encouraging of ppl searching for spiritual connection. In this journey, however, there is no quick-fix pill or secret ritual that any Native person can \"deny\" then which might have advanced their healing.\n \n I'll say it again. There is nothing that a Native spiritual experience can give you that you cannot get from your own earth-centred cultural practices. In fact, you will probably find it much more rewarding.

   "\n I don't know what you mean by \"militancy\", but I assure you that the document is not meant to be \"isolationist\", unless to you the converse of \"isolationism\" is globalization or some other colonial scheme.\n \n Noone \"possesses\" spiritual knowledge. Nor do I (or the Lakota) have any problem with people engaging in their own spiritual practices. \n \n It is telling that you interpret my request for respect as \"contempt\". \n \n Again, they are barking up the wrong tree if they go looking for people outside of their traditions for \"the answers\". Any answers they need they will find within themselves or not at all.\n \n This is, IMO, exactly the crux of the issue. The people who want the deep connection with nature, but they also want their SUV. They think that they can get this connection in a weekend conference or a few \"sham-on\" experiences. They think they can just find a Native person and we will give them the secret that will make them feel better about their empty lives. That is not how true spirituality works. I am always encouraging of ppl searching for spiritual connection. In this journey, however, there is no quick-fix pill or secret ritual that any Native person can \"deny\" then which might have advanced their healing.\n \n I'll say it again. There is nothing that a Native spiritual experience can give you that you cannot get from your own earth-centred cultural practices. In fact, you will probably find it much more rewarding. People looking for a quick-fix religious experience will get scammed, and people looking for a true spiritual path with begin with themselves, and so on it goes.\n \n Just because you don't want to believe something does not make it true.

There's a differene there, and one that you clearly don't want to acknowledge. \n \n IMHO the search for sprituality is a journey of learning that comes from exposing yourself and immersing yourself in as many new spiritual experiences as possible. With that continuous knowledge, spirituality that is right for you can be found, and it will form from within. However, without the journey and exposure, how would one ever find what's right for them? Who's to say that what my ancestors did is better for me than what your ancestors did? What if I like parts of A and B? Is that wrong? You seem as though you would like to dictate people's spirituality for them based on their ancestry, that you feel a person cannot learn or become spiritual through an honest journey of exploration. I think that's sad.\n \n It is very telling that you come onto this board in very confrontational manner and tell people to mind their own business and stay out of \"your\" spirituality because everyone is simply looking to scam you and has no sincere interest in Native spirituality. It is very telling that you are somehow unwilling to share the knowledge that is held within it Native spirituality with those that you deem \"unworthy and disrespectful\".\n \n I think it's truly sad that you feel this way Mizmaxx, and I think it's very telling of your personality and outlook on life. I think it's even more sad if in fact a significant number of Native Americans do share your views.\n \n Let me ask you this -\n \n If you held the key that might open the door to someone's happiness, would you give it to them? \n \n I would. \n \n You would tell them to go find their own dang key, this one's yours and you're not sharing. \n \n IMHO, that's reprehensible.\n \n Waxy",

   "Again, I feel you're confusing those with sincerity and respect with the holiday crowd out for an interesting weekend.\n\n If you truly have sincerity and respect, you will sincerely respect Native ppl's wishes. \n \n \nIMHO the search for sprituality is a journey of learning that comes from exposing yourself and immersing yourself in as many new spiritual experiences as possible.\n\n Fine. Native ppl have a different way of viewing spiritual journeys, which has to do with quality, not only quantity and diversity. \n \n Again, noone is saying you shouldn't engage in earth-centred practices, of which their are many that would probably be appropriate for you. \n \n As an example, a friend of mine who is a therapist of sorts used to recommend to some non-native clients that suffered from nightmares that they make a \"dreamcatcher\". Now, instead, she recommends that they make a 'dream pillow' (a tiny fabric pillow filled which lavendar and other calming herbs). She isn't jeopardizing her client's emotional welfare in order to avoid being appropriative. There is no difference whatsoever in the effectiveness of a dream pillow vs a dreamcatcher. \n \n Therefore, go ahead and explore earth-centred practices, by all means. I'm certainly biased, but I consider them much more sensical and spiritual ways of being. However, no spiritual practice that ignores the will of the people who you purport to be following is ever valid, or effective. \n \n \nWho's to say that what my ancestors did is better for me than what your ancestors did?\n\n Geez. You really don't get it, do you?\n \n First Peoples' spirituality has to do with a connection to our communities, and a connection to our land. Our practices remain with us because they work for us in our geography and under our circumstances. If not, they change, as long as they continue to follow the intent of the Greater Laws.\n \n There is no logic to people who have no connection to our land or our communities trying to use our ways. It simply makes no sense. I do not worship the buffalo, because that is not my culture. If I visit sisters and brothers on the Plains, I might like to see some of their spiritual practices, but I would never, ever, presume to be welcomed into their most sacred community practices. It does not make sense for me to worship the Buffalo, although it is a part of the web of nature it is not a food source for me the way fish and berries and deer are. Therefore, to me the fish and berries and deer are expecially sacred. I would not make a tipi, or a longhouse, because that is not the tradition of my ppl. My ppl are not longhouse because where we are from there is an abundance of birch which we use to make wigwams, and the climate is not favourable for agriculture.\n \n Again, (for hopefully the last time) this is how our spirituality works. You may not like it, you may think it's \"sad\" that we don't need to convert ppl to our ways, but this is because you clearly do not understand the first thing about us. Neither do you need to. If you were truly the respectful person you claim to be, our wishes would be enough.\n \n \nIf you held the key that might open the door to someone's happiness, would you give it to them? \n\n I know enough to know that I don't hold the key to anyone's happiness except my own.",

   "Er... I don't know what you're referring to here... Was it because I was uninterested in your paragraph on Native history as you see it?\n\n You think? You did sound interested&#8230;even if it was negatively. My understanding comes largely from what I&#8217;ve read &#8211; I admit that. My first-hand knowledge is lacking and I admit that, but I have no desire to black-kettle any tribe. My feelings and the way I see things are just that. As far as I know there&#8217;s nothing degrading or sinister about it.\n \nMe? No, I just feel like you were duped into a fake pseudo-spiritual experience. If you are referring to the Lakota Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, then you are probably correct in your interpretation that you have exploited their culture, and they are angry about it.\n Of course, if &#8220;if and buts were candy and nuts&#8221;&#8230;\n \n I doubt that a person far removed from their culture and who has never had a hand in exploitation of their culture, who neither abhors nor despises it or threatens it in any way, is a problem for them. I simply respect their culture and would like to learn more about it. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. And, from what I know, they are not that fragile as to be despoiled by the curiosity of this &#8220;whiteman&#8221;.\n \nThat you so easily dismiss the opinion of the people whose culture you purport to wish to learn about only further demonstrates the illegitemacy of you so-called spiritual connection to Native culture. Only once you respect Native ppl, and all our opinions- whether they suit you or not- will you be ready to learn from us.\n\n I have not nor will I ever do such a thing. Where did you get that idea? And, as far as &#8220;demonstrating the illegitimacy of my so-called spiritual connection&#8221;? Let&#8217;s let my actions speak for themselves, shall we? If ever I get the chance to perform any of those rituals it will not be for foreign spiritual connection anyway. It will be to benefit my spirit-man and my body. There are many other things that I would have to do (which I can&#8217;t) before I would even think of getting in touch with the spirits of the People. Remember that I do not want to become them, just wanting to take what they freely offer.\n \nAgain, that you feel that you can pick and choose which Native ppl to respect according to what suits you is reflective of your lack of respect for all of us. Many of our youth are angry, and they are warriors, but their connection to our ancestors and our elders is what gives them strength. Your attempt to divide us into \"good indians\" (ones that say what you want to hear), and \"bad indians\" (ones that threaten you with their honesty and self-respect), is further evidence of your disrespect of all of us.\n\n You&#8217;ve got it all wrong. I don&#8217;t require anything of the People and I will choose among those that I choose based on what I know and would like to know. I have no desire to throw away my life for that way of life, or my progeny for theirs. If you think that then you must think me insane. I surely hope I have not given you that impression.\n If I am drawn to those things that are only done by the Lakhota, then to the Lakhota I will go. If Blackfoot, then towards them I would reach. Or Crow, or some other group. Just because I think I might enjoy taking a dip early of a morning in a frozen stream it would not mean that I was disrespectful to the Apache. Or if I believe that the appearance of the owl is a sign of death I do not offend the Flathead.\n \n And as far as &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad Indians&#8221; go, there are such, no matter how strong their &#8220;medicine&#8221;.\n \nBTW, pls stop referring to us as \"The People\". I don't know where you get this term from, but you should know that there are many First Peoples..\n\n I only use the term out of respect. That&#8217;s what they call themselves.

Maybe we should write a catechism and burn people who disagree with us. Then will we qualify as a religion worthy of your oh-so-valuable esteem?\n \n As I said before, there is no one Native spirituality, but there are certain fundamental principles we all agree on, which we hold in common with all other earth-centred practices. As the earth is sacred, and there is no seperation between ourselves and \"nature\", our spiritual paths are a way of life. We do not simply go to a \"Church\" once a week for \"absolution\", or celebrate generosity every Winter Solstice only to continue hoarding the entire rest of the year. Our spiritualities are not seperate from daily life. Thus, we celebrate by community, but our fundamental principles are shared across nations and around the world.\n \n As with many earth-centred traditions, there are certain ceremonies which only those deeply initiated can partake. A sweat is one example. \n \n I'm beginning to understand that few (any?) of you even have the faintest idea of what a sweat is. For those who are not aware, a sweat is not a regular weekend event, it is not at all like going to the gym and hanging out in a sauna. I don't know about other nations that practice sweats, and I don't know what fake sweats are like, but where I'm coming from is this-\n \n - It is a huge life decision to join a sweat. Like engaging in a \"vision quest\", it is a very profound, sacred ceremony which you should only engage in when you are ready and prepared in many senses. It's seriously not a fly-by-night, I'm-bored-on-a-Wednesday, \"wouldn't it be nifty to commune with the Buffalo\" kinda thing.\n \n \n - Physical issues. A sweat lodge, at least the ones I'm familiar with, are small round huts, only tall enough for most ppl to crawl around in. Usually you go into the lodge naked, and packed in like sardines. It's very dark, very, very hot, and you are all smushed in together for the duration of the ceremony. Not the kind of thing you want to be doing with ppl you don't know and trust very, very much. \n \n - It can be dangerous to go into a sweat unprepared and inexperienced. The only ppl who should be leading sweats are experienced elders, IMO. Because of the nature of the sweat, anything from reliving traumatic experiences to asthma attacks or other medical issues could occur. Even if these \"worst-case scenarios\" don't happen, still the sweat creates an intense vulnerability. It can be described as akin to the state of hypnosis, or a drug-induced state. Again not recommended to engage in with ppl you don't know really, really, well, and you trust absolutely implicitely.\n \n \nI doubt that a person far removed from their culture and who has never had a hand in exploitation of their culture, who neither abhors nor despises it or threatens it in any way, is a problem for them.\n\n So you didn't actually go to the site and read their statement then. So much for your \"interest\" in all things Lakota.\n \n \nIf I am drawn to those things that are only done by the Lakhota, then to the Lakhota I will go. If Blackfoot, then towards them I would reach. Or Crow, or some other group.\n\n Read the part about \"spiritual manifest destiny\". You can't just take from people. That's not how it works. If you are not implicated in a Lakota community, serving the community, you have no business trying to extract \"spiritual knowledge\" from them.\n \n \nI have not nor will I ever do such a thing.\n\n If you don't listen to the people telling you to stop insulting First Peoples with your romantic notions and try to intrude on sacred practices, then you are doing that very thing.\n \n \nI only use the term out of respect. That's what they call themselves. Who am I to argue?\n\n Usually they call themselves Lakota, in my experience. Such as those on the Lakota Declaration of War site. Unless they are Dakota or another Nation. \n \n Many First People's names for themselves translate to \"The People\". Using their name in the Native language is usually considered the most respectful. It's certainly more clear, and doesn't make you sound like you walked out of a Western.\n \n Anyway, about your original posts I responded to:\n Big Orn said- \nI know that the religion of the Lakhota (Sioux) would be considered as blasphemy by some extremists, but to me it was very romantic and mysterious. Whether the onlooker believes or not, their ceremonies are believable.(...) I still need that sweat lodge... Was it as good as the old medicine men say?\n\n \nI don't know, Tink. It's gotta be open range, hot rocks and buffalo hides for me for it to work.\n \n I need to tell you that I'm a hopeless romantic.\n\n \n Just so you know, Big Orn, using the word \"romantic\" to describe your feelings about us, our spiritualities, and our traditions, is pretty universally considered a mega big insult. Very patronizing. You may as well call us \"noble\". You didn't, did you?\n \n You talk about the sweat lodge like it's a rollercoaster or a pizza- \"was it as good as they say?\". You talk about the \"open range\" and \"buffalo hides\"- like you think Native people are still living the way we did before colonisation. Please, have some basic respect for the people you're talking about. They are alive now, find out about them as real people, with real problems, not some romantic \"Dances with Wolves\" perpetual \"Wild West\" time warp.\n \n \nHowever, if you honestly wanted to become a nun and gain that access, you would be welcomed with open arms into a convent where you could learn and be a part of those ceremonies.\n\n Well, if Big Orn became part of a Native community, through adoption or marriage, and implication and acceptance, eventually he might be invited to a sweat.\n \n \nDespite your presumption of speaking on behalf of all Native Americans, (as Monty has pointed out), I can respect your personal opinion (well, kind of). \n\n Actually, I never said I spoke for \"all Native Americans\". And it would be nice if you would respect my opinion, but it's obvious enough that you don't.\n \n \nHowever, your word alone is certainly not enough to discourage me from seeking native wisdom, nor is it enough to convince me that the majority of Native Americans share your sentiments.\n\n I would hazard a guess that it really doesn't actually matter to you how many of us feel this way. If you did care, you would do some research on your own, where you would find that my opinion on this is shared almost universally by First Peoples. \n \n Nonetheless-\n \nIf you stand with Indian people, then you respect their moral right to decide under which circumstances their ceremonies will be \"shared\" with non-Indians. Please read the following statements by Native people. They are spiritual leaders, authors, attorneys, anthropologists, scholars, activists, educators and tribal leaders. Though they represent just a small percentage of those who have spoken out on this issue, the concepts presented will give you some idea of the perspective you are being asked to consider.\n Mariah Jones-http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/native.html\n \n from the same article-\n \nChief Oren Lyons (Onondaga) \"What about the quest for Native spirituality? It is mostly ESCAPIST, and people like Lynn Andrews, and other would-be shamans would rather look to an ideal, romanticized \"Native\" living in never-never land than confront the reality of what being Native means in this society.\n \n Our elders and traditional teachers want to share the beauty of Native cultures, the Native way. But appropriation is not sharing. Appropriation exploits and commercializes Native cultures, and is harmful to innocent people.\" \n\n \n from Indianz forum- \nIts all well in good to want to get away from the major world religions because they seem out of touch, but there are two major concerns that i have for people who go looking for Native Nations' beliefs/practices through the New Age (...)If the people who go in for that **** wanna be left alone and their own personal belief systems, I dont have a problem with that. But if they are going involve us by saying it has something to do with our Nations' practices/beliefs - not fine. Cuz they aint got a clue and they really shouldnt be talking about they dont know the first thing about.\n\n \nTrish, my Metis brother calls that whole sense of entitlement \"spiritual manifest destiny\". If it's yours and we want it, then obviously God meant for us to take it! I guess another equivalent these days would be \"How did OUR oil get under THEIR sand?\"\n\n \n And hes absolutly right. It is a kind of spiritual manifest destiny. And it promotes a very patronizing kind of racism. \n\n \nput it this way--the white folks have taken _eveything_ from us. I mean everything. Our land, our resources, tried to take our language, place us on reservations and took away our self sufficiency, etc...\n \n Are ndn people obligated to \"heal\" every broken soul. We have our own broken souls. Ndn people have the highest mortality rate and the highest rate of suicide. We have an obligation to keep our spiritual beliefs for the healing of our people.\n \n NOW THEY WANT OUR SPIRITUALITY! WHEN IS ENOUGH--ENOUGH?\n\n \n from http://www.bluecorncomics.com/owleagu2.htm\n \nNative American societies can and do suffer the socioculturally debilitating effects of spiritual trivialization and appropriation at the hands of the massive larger Euro-immigrant population which has come to dominate literally every other aspect of our existence. As Margo Thunderbird, an activist of the Shinnecock Nation, has put it: \"They came for our land, for what grew or could be grown on it, for the resources in it, and for our clean air and pure water. They stole these things from us, and in the taking they also stole our free ways and the best of our leaders, killed in battle or assassinated. And now, after all that, they've come for the very last of our possessions; now they want our pride, our history, our spiritual traditions. They want to rewrite and remake these things, to claim them for themselves. The lies and thefts just never end.\" Or, as the Oneida scholar Pam Colorado frames the matter:\n \n The process is ultimately intended to supplant Indians, even in areas of their own culture and spirituality. In the end, non-Indians will have complete power to define what is and what is not Indian, even for Indians. We are talking here about a complete ideological/conceptual subordination of Indian people in addition to the total physical subordination they already experience. When this happens, the last vestiges of real Indian society and Indian rights will disappear. Non-Indians will then claim to \"own\" our heritage and ideas as thoroughly as they now claim to own our land and resources.\n\n \n Here's a fantastic article- http://www.bluecorncomics.com/newage.htm\n \nNative American activists challenge those who sell their \"wisdom\" to the masses, accumulating a following at the sake of bastardizing a religion not truly their own. Below are just a few reasons why such activists are actively fighting against these false prophets and charlatans:\n \n 1. Profiting from Native spirituality goes against most tribal beliefs. It is religious prostitution.\n \n 2. Most information given is derived from false information and stereotypes. Only a person from that particular culture can truly understand and appreciate their own heritage. You cannot gather such knowledge from a handful of books and movies, nor by witnessing a few factual ceremonies and rituals. Such misinformation perpetuates myths, stereotypes and romanticized ideals currently associated with Native people. You cannot construct an authentic Native American anything by employing bits and pieces of ceremonies and traditions, manipulating them into one package and calling it something new. Each ceremony and ritual, and every belief and song hold a specific purpose. You cannot extract certain elements of that ritual or song and use it as your own. Its true meaning is lost.\n \n 3. There is an absence of history. Indigenous people have endured a prolonged and cataclysmic act of genocide against them for over 500 years. Only they feel their past and can appreciate the traditions and ceremonies that stem from their survival. You cannot play Indian. Dressing up as a stereotypical Native American and sending smoke signals to the Great Spirit is not what the culture is about. One must know the oppression, the history, and the heritage. These cannot be learned from books or movies.\n \n 4. It is theft. It is exploitation. It is the interpretation of a self-proclaimed Native \"teacher\" who passes the information on to believers who pay to learn from their \"wisdom.\" A non-Native American teaching Native spirituality contributes to the genocide of the Native nations. Their work often dominates the mainstream audience and continues stereotypes and misinformation plagued by the Native community.\n \n 5. Non-Natives teaching Native spirituality trivializes the true and accurate beliefs of all Native Americans. When non-Natives teach what is not their own, it belittles those who follow that belief. It says that anyone can teach or spiritually lead this culture. This presumption is degrading, arrogant, and racist.\n \n 6. It can be dangerous. If a person conducts a sweat lodge, vision quest, sun dance etc. without the proper education, someone can truly be hurt.\n \n 7. When a person of true Native American ancestry and teaching writes a book or teaches a workshop, their work may play second-fiddle to the flamboyant charlatan.\n \n Excuses...Excuses\n \n Although those who sell Native spirituality to the public have been notified of their wrong-doing - having been told their acts are disrespectful and offensive - they continue to prosper. They have even come up with reasons, or excuses, to validate their abuse. Here are a few verbatim examples:\n \n 1. \"The Native people should share their beliefs with us!\" 2. \"I wasn't raised Indian, but I am Indian in my heart.\" 3. \"There is jealously for those of us who have reached the masses with our work. We are well-respected and well-known. People are envious.\" 4. \"My work is good and from the heart. Those who want to stop me are acting out of hatred.\" 5. \"I have the right to practice any religion I choose.\" 6. \"I have permission to conduct these ceremonies. An elder tribesman taught me.\" 7. \"I accept no money, only donations for my work as a Shaman.\" 8. \"I am preserving an ancient religion that is dying out.\" 9. \"I am honoring Native people and wish to be part of their culture.\" 10. \"I harm no one. I only want to help mankind.\" 11. \"I am 1/8 Cherokee and 1/8 Shawnee. It is my culture.\" (Though they have never met a Cherokee or a Shawnee.)\n \n Even if these false leaders honestly believe they are fostering a sense of community, acting as a guide to those who seek an earthy religion void of harm, it is still wrong.(...)\n \n What's the Answer?\n \n If you really want to honor Native people - do it by showing them respect. Respect their wishes, their opinions and their warnings of who to avoid and their endorsements of who to trust. Learn about the issues that matter most to them - whether it be treaty and fishing rights or the elimination of Indian mascots. Live life with respect, humility, love for Earth and all inhabitants, patience and a strong sense of community - for these are the common threads woven between most tribal traditions. Pray daily, sacrifice yourself to the common good of others, read the writings of those who legitimately speak for Native people, and refuse to listen to any self-proclaimed pseudo-experts hocking Native religion for money.\n \n Spirituality is not something you can buy. It's a feeling of freedom, understanding and balance with the universe. And it's free.\n\n \n \nI HAVE ALWAYS FELT DRAWN TO NATIVE SPIRITUAL TRADITIONS. DOES THAT MAKE ME A WANNABE?\n \n Frankly, unless you have spent substantial time in a Native community, yes.\n \n First, there is no Native Spiritual Tradition. There are hundreds of Native traditions in the Americas, each with its unique practices, rituals and worldview.\n \n Without substantial contact with the culture and fluency in its language, what you feel attracted to is a =stereotype= of that culture--based on books, films, etc. --not the culture itself. In other words, you can't be drawn to something about which you know almost nothing, especially if what you know is inaccurate or incomplete.\n \n Most Native languages have no word for \"religion\" because it is so bound up in everyday life that no separate label is needed. A more accurate term might be \"worldview.\" Without a grasp of this worldview, one hasn't the sense of context to understand the subtle implications of a Sweatlodge, Sundance or other traditional ceremonies.\n \n As the study of General Semantics has shown, language plays a crucial role in shaping the way in which we relate to and think about the world. Much of what we perceive is colored by the way in which it is described in our language. And yet, how many Wannabes bother to learn the language of the people to whom they claim to belong (save for a few nuggets, like \"Tunkasila\" or \"Mitakuye Oyasin\" dropped into their conversation to impress the gullible)?\n \n Unless or until you are ready to devote many years to learning the language and, more importantly, gaining the acceptance of the bearers of that culture so that you can share in their =daily lives=, their spiritual practices can have no relevance for you. A religion isn't in the masks, rattles, songs and drumming, but in the =hearts and minds of the people who use them=. These hearts and minds cannot be understood by dabblers, however well meaning.\nhttp://users.pandora.be/gohiyuhi/articles/art00048.htm\n \n Also see the following websites- \n http://www.hanksville.org/sand/\n http://members.tripod.com/TopCat4/crystal.htm\n \n I particularly recommend\n http://www.plastic-shaman-busters.com/\n \n Clearly, I'm not the only Native person concerned about this, despite Montalban's and other's attempts to paint my perspective as \"marginal\".\n \n \nIn fact, as Mizmaxx claims that there are so many different versions, then who is she to say which are 'genuine' are which are not?\n\n I don't judge for other nations who is \"genuine\" and who is not. Each nation decides this for themselves- therefore, if Big Orn were adopted into a Nation which practices sweats, he would have their approval in joining one if he were evey ready to. \n \n You will find that the fake \"shamans\" like the ones you linked to get easy to spot after a while. For one, they don't identify with a particular First Nation or native community. Here I don't mean \"I studied with a real live Sioux for two months\". I mean live in or are implicated in a community of Native people. \n \n Thus, because each community is unique, I look to see if the community the person claims to be teaching from/about actually accepts that person.\n \n It's clear by your behavior on this and other threads that you just want to attack my beliefs because I dare to not be Christian- oh, and horror of horrors I sometimes critique some Christians (!). Frankly, you're being childish and petty. \n \n Besides, you believe that any spirituality without a written book is \"wishy-washy\" and stands for nothing. You believe that earth-centred religions are superficial and \"fluffy\". You've said so before. So I'm not interested in discussing my beliefs with you.",

   "Thank goodness we have you to fix our \"problems\" for us. Maybe we should write a catechism and burn people who disagree with us. Then will we qualify as a religion worthy of your oh-so-valuable esteem?\n\n \n Is there some kind of prize for most consecutive straw-man arguments. I ask this because you seem to be going for a record. No where have I claimed that I would fix your problems, many though there are.\n \n \nAs I said before, there is no one Native spirituality, but there are certain fundamental principles we all agree on, \n\n \n That is what a catechism would state. So you've been arguing \"No, there's no one commonality... but now there is...\"\n \n \n which we hold in common with all other earth-centred practices. As the earth is sacred, and there is no seperation between ourselves and \"nature\", our spiritual paths are a way of life. We do not simply go to a \"Church\" once a week for \"absolution\", or celebrate generosity every Winter Solstice only to continue hoarding the entire rest of the year. Our spiritualities are not seperate from daily life. Thus, we celebrate by community, but our fundamental principles are shared across nations and around the world. \n\n \n Yet I've cited some Native Americans who aren't as exclusive in their outlook as you. So, when you declare people should stay out of your sweats, rather than qualify this as your opinion, or the opinion of some, you've been declaring this as the notion of all Native Americans. Hence I've pointed out that you're acting as a spokesperson - and other people have picked up on this, but you're so defensive about it and so reluctant to talk about your beliefs - as I joined this forum in September last year and this (series of posts over the last week) is the first time you've actually given anything like a direct answer to my direct questions.\n \n Now suddenly, you show your angry posts (re: a catechism) have been for nothing, because you're quite happy to state a core of beliefs, which is, as I say, what a catechism is... a body of fundamental principles or beliefs.",

   "So you didn't actually go to the site and read their statement then. So much for your \"interest\" in all things Lakota.\n\n Yes, I read their statement. But, that&#8217;s just one group. From what I&#8217;ve read that&#8217;s one of many views. Also, from what I&#8217;ve read, they would prefer to be called Lakhota, not Lakota. To them there is a BIG difference.\n \nRead the part about \"spiritual manifest destiny\". You can't just take from people. That's not how it works. If you are not implicated in a Lakota community, serving the community, you have no business trying to extract \"spiritual knowledge\" from them.\n\n Receiving from any culture/race/people is necessary in order to learn and understand. In doing so one discovers what is required to give in return. Knowledge is the key to understanding&#8230;without it fear flourishes and the ignorance continues.\n \nIf you don't listen to the people telling you to stop insulting First Peoples with your romantic notions and try to intrude on sacred practices, then you are doing that very thing.\n\n Here, you are very, very wrong. Again, turning our backs on our fellow Americans is akin to total abandonment, bordering on treason &#8211; IMHO. Anyway, you must have a different definition of romance than I do. I&#8217;m not talking about the Hollywood &#8220;big screen&#8221; variety, I&#8217;m referring to the type that enhances the desire to learn &#8211; even if it goes beyond the quid pro quo of the greedy, self-indulged. Let me be specific here: I have no hidden agenda.\n \nUsually they call themselves Lakota, in my experience. Such as those on the Lakota Declaration of War site. Unless they are Dakota or another Nation.\n\n Yes, they do call themselves Lakhota when it comes to the specifics, obviously. But, much the same as we call ourselves American (instead of Texans in my case) they do use the term &#8220;People&#8221; when talking about the populace.\n \nMany First People's names for themselves translate to \"The People\". Using their name in the Native language is usually considered the most respectful. It's certainly more clear, and doesn't make you sound like you walked out of a Western.\n\n Okay &#8211; there you go stereotyping/profiling me. I really wish you&#8217;d see the splinter in your own eye before pointing out the speck in mine.\n \nJust so you know, Big Orn, using the word \"romantic\" to describe your feelings about us, our spiritualities, and our traditions, is pretty universally considered a mega big insult. Very patronizing. You may as well call us \"noble\". You didn't, did you?\n\n See my reply about my definition of &#8220;romance&#8221; above.\n \nYou talk about the sweat lodge like it's a rollercoaster or a pizza- \"was it as good as they say?\". You talk about the \"open range\" and \"buffalo hides\"- like you think Native people are still living the way we did before colonisation. Please, have some basic respect for the people you're talking about. They are alive now, find out about them as real people, with real problems, not some romantic \"Dances with Wolves\" perpetual \"Wild West\" time warp.\n\n Without condescension &#8211; how in the world do you really know what I want or what my intentions are? Despite my overwhelming desire to tell you &#8220;to get a life&#8221; &#8211; I honestly feel that you have overlooked my main objective.\n \n If I were to be content with how the People are living, how they are being treated, and displayed any sign of indifference, I could at least grasp your angst of my interest. But, that&#8217;s not the case.\n \n I believe the problem is the lack of knowledge. The only avenue towards education, and eventual understanding, is to thrust ourselves into that arena, whether we, at first, comprehend it or not. You criticize my use of romance, calling it a crutch to support my own crippled life. But, I can assure you that that&#8217;s not the case. If there were more honest &#8220;white men&#8221; approaching the problem instead of donning blinders, many problems not only would be seen, but acted upon.\n \n Mizmaxx &#8211; do you believe that a romantic life can be achieved, or do you substitute that meaning with fantasy? The reason I ask is that in my life I have found that romance is the key to combating many of life&#8217;s most daunting obstacles. If more people could realize that, the easier life would be.

   "In passing, I find this grudge you are holding because I disagree with you on historical issues extremely childish.\n\n People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. When I joined this forum, I was myself quite ignorant about differences between Wicca/paganism - you were happy to point these out. I learn from such things. You don't seem to want to, or you'd do some research on Moslem views of Islam (specifically the Koran, and Muhammad himself).\n You have made many statements on Christian faith - some of which you claim are proofs of some horrid things - and some of which are practices parallelled in Native American society. You made many low attacks on Christianity, if your own culture is just as guilty (by your standards), so be it.\n Your make judgments about Islamic views of Islam that are incorrect. You just need to deal with it.\n \n What do you know about Wicca? #43\n \nI attack your views. I don't have any problem with Christians. I mostly pity Catholics. My grandmother, for instance. She wouldn't be such a miserable old bat if she weren't all catholic-brainwashed.\n\n This here's another of your great anti-Catholic statements. It's not on par with your 'right to hate Catholicism'. Obviously you have a right to hate what you perceive to be an intolerant ideology (even though you also admit you know some good Catholics), but you seem not to apply the same lee-way when it comes to my views on Islam.\n \n Here's something else I dug up from the same thread... I included it to further refute your 'essentialist' arguments about pagan spirituality.\n Actually in \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Seutonius there is several instances of Roman emperors freely practicing sexual deviance. Tiberius had his 'minnows' who used to swim with him and play with him in a giant pool. There is also how he used nursing babies for gratification.\n Seutonius was a pagan.\n \"Slavery is older than recorded human history and probably occurred in some form or another almost everywhere in the world at some time. It was common in ancient Babylon, Persia, Egypt and the Roman Empire. It was found in Asia and Africa.\"\n http://www.friends-partners.org/par.../1998/0124.html\n Ancient Greece and Rome, however, were far worse than Israel in this regard. Infanticide was common to both, and in Greece it was a widely accepted practice for older men to have relations with young boys. Boy brothels flourished in every ancient Greek city. In the Roman Empire, child prostitution was so prevalent that special taxes and holidays were set up specifically for that trade. In the arenas, girls were raped and forced into acts of bestiality. Similar atrocities were prevalent in many other ancient nations. Certainly that had child slavery as well.\n \"Graeco-Roman domestic sexuality rested on a triad: the wife, the concubine and the courtesan. The fourth century BC Athenian orator Apollodoros made it very clear in his speech Against Neaira quoted by Demosthenes (59.122) that 'we have courtesans for pleasure, and concubines for the daily service of our bodies, but wives for the production of legitimate offspring and to have reliable guardians of our household property'. Whatever the reality of this domestic set-up in daily life in ancient Greece,[2] this peculiar type of 'm\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois' pursued its course unhindered into the Roman period: monogamy de jure appears to have been very much a fa\u00e7ade for polygamy de facto.[3] The advent of Christianity upset this delicate equilibrium. By forbidding married men to have concubines on pain of corporal punishment, canon law elaborated at Church councils took away from this triangular system one of its three components.[4] Henceforth, there remained only the wife and the courtesan.\"\n [2]In particular, see the discussion in M. Lloyd, Euripides Andromache (Warminster, 1995), pp. 6 ff. \n [3]P. Salmon, Population et d\u00e9population dans l'empire romain (Bruxelles, 1974), p. 45. \n [4]In particular Canon 87 of the Council in Trullo of 692. See C.J. H\u00e9f\u00e9l\u00e9 and H. Leclercq, Histoire des Conciles, T. III.[1] (Paris, 1909), p. 573. \n \"When Christians finally became rulers, they made concerted efforts to stamp it out...\"Already in 529, Justinian had attempted to put a curb on female child prostitution by penalising all those engaged in that trade, in particular the owners of brothels (CJ 8.51.3). In 535, he invalidated the contracts by which the pimps of Constantinople put to work peasant girls whom they had bought from their parents (Novell. 14). The prostitution of adult women, however, does not appear to have unduly worried the imperial legislator. The punishment inflicted on pimps who ran the child prostitution network, varied according to their wealth and respectability. Paradoxically, Byzantine administration considered the job of Imperial Inspector of the Brothels as eminently honourable, so much so that in 630 the Bishop of Palermo was appointed to this post.\"\n \n All quoted from http://www.ucd.ie/classics/96/Dauphin96.html\n And this site isn't exactly glowing about some Christians!\n \n It's well known that child prostitution continues to this day... It is important to note a very critical point; the difference was in pagan times it was accepted and practiced because of the religious beliefs. In modern times it's practiced in spite of Christian beliefs.\n \n Pagan Aztecs and Celts practiced human sacrifice. Whilst our sources for the former are mainly Spanish (therefore Christian), our sources for the latter are pagan Roman. As well, we have corroboration by the finding of skulls and remains of children at Aztec religious sites. It is possible to suggest the Old Testament might contain such, but they weren't Christian, and therefore is superfluous to this argument.",

   "And the other hundreds of sites on-line which include similar statements from Native ppl? Never mind, you obviously don't bother with what actual Native ppl think, you have your \"romantic\" notions for company.\n\n Please take my &#8220;romantic&#8221; approach off of your &#8220;bad things to do&#8221; list, will ya&#8217;?\n \n Shake it off. How a romantic slant towards anything is wrong eludes me, to be honest. Sometimes getting to the core of things requires us to give it that unadulterated approach. You don&#8217;t have to take my word for it, though, for I realize that our take on it differs.\n \nYou know what \"receiving\" is called when you don't have full consent? Theft.\n\n I can see how you feel that way after the last few threads. If, in fact, you consider receiving knowledge as theft, then lock me up and throw away the key.\n \nEr, okay. Go to a Lakota/Lahkota, Dakota, or any other Native reserve and tell them you find their spirituality \"romantic\". Make sure to include the stuff about the \"wide open plains\" and \"buffalo hides\". We'll see who has a more accurate impression of how \"most Natives\" feel about the issue.\n\n Okay. It&#8217;s time to enlighten you on my use of the term.\n Romantic = Loving, committed, tender, passionate, devoted, caring, idealistic&#8230;\n Maybe you&#8217;re referring to fantastic (as unrealistic). Maybe?\n \nYour use of the term in that response, when I was clearly not specifically speaking about La(h)kota people in particular, was confusing and awkward.\n\n No it was not&#8230;:)\n \nActually, I was responding to your quotes. If you didn't say those things, by all means, let me know.\n\n Not in the way that you have corrupted them.\n \n Tell me, mixmaxx? What is it about wanting to get to the heart of what is good about the People that is wrong? If I cared more about what is wrong (as in standing in judgment) with them, or anyone else for that matter, would it not border on pessimism? I, for one, think there is enough gloominess in the world already &#8211; I&#8217;ve had my fill of it.\n \nAgain, just responding to your words. I think they were pretty clear.\n\n Sadly, I&#8217;m afraid that the meaning is what is lost here, not the words.\n \nWhat \"problem\"? Do you mean your problem? Actually, I provided you with lots of information, and there is much else available should you care to look for it. I think the problem is to do with an unwillingness to learn, rather than a lack of knowledge on your part.\n\n Mizmaxx &#8211; so much resentment!\n \n How dare you presume to question my intentions! Did you know that in your posts, should I care to critique them (which I don&#8217;t) I find that your hatred of the &#8220;whiteman&#8221; is paramount? Are you scared to admit that the ones that obliterated that way of life might find some way to restore it &#8211; might actually be the only ones that can?\n \nActually, such people already exist, and are already working hard to support our struggles. I'm sure you could find them with no problem, were you interested in joining them.\n\n One thing is for sure: Help comes in all varieties. I would venture to say that even I just might be part of the solution &#8211; even with my lowdown, rotten ideals.",

   "Please take my \"romantic\" approach off of your \"bad things to do\" list, will ya'?\n\n Not until it stops.\n \n A short survey of some Native ppl's opinions on the \"romantic\" approach-\n \nThese Indian-based symbols and team names are not accurate representations of Native Americans. Even those that purport to be positive are romantic stereotypes that give a distorted view of the past. These false portrayals prevent non-Native Americans from understanding the true historical and cultural experiences of American Indians.\nhttp://www.darkfiber.com/utcmascot/\n \n \nUnlike Long Lance, Belaney did not make a concerted effort to conceal his true identity; park workers and his adopted family in Ontario knew Grey Owl as Archie Belaney. Instead, a widely accepted paternalism toward Indians in Canada allowed that, so long as Grey Owl was a positive role model for Indians and conformed to romantic white stereotypes, his impostor status could be overlooked and even lauded.\n\n \nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, some flamboyant individuals had chosen to exploit the Indian's romantic appeal for commercial gains by posing as Native Americans.\nhttp://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_011600_fakesandimpo.htm\n \n \nWe are people. Not objects for America's\n amusement. We have been idealized, demonized\n and romanticized by America long enough. It must\n stop. We are NOT 'honored'. We are DIS-honored\n and DISrespected. Treat us as people, not as\n infallible, mighty, powerful, glamorous romantic\n 'warriors' straight out of a hollywood fantasy movie.\n We're just PEOPLE. And we demand to be treated so. \n\n \n \nMost fans have no intention of supporting a racist practice, but intentionally or not, they do perpetuate a romantic stereotype.\n\n Carol Spindel, Dancing at Halftime, 2000. New York: New York University Press, p. 254. As quoted from http://www.retirethechief.org/Archives/issue0204.html\n \n Clearly, the majority opinion by us is that we don't want people to romanticize us, so please stop it.\n \nHow a romantic slant towards anything is wrong eludes me, to be honest.\n\n Because it is inaccurate, stereotypical, and patronizing.\n \n \n If, in fact, you consider receiving knowledge as theft, then lock me up and throw away the key.\n\n You don't mean \"receiving\", you mean \"taking\". Be honest. And taking without consent is theft. \n \n \nOkay. It's time to enlighten you on my use of the term.\n\n I see your condescention knows no bounds. Your description of \"buffalo hides\" and \"wide open plains\" was not loving, committed or anything of the sort. DO you know what the current situation of the Lakota is re: the Buffalo? Do you know their current struggles for their land (ie the \"wide open plains\")? Obviously you don't. Substitute \"wide open plains\" for reserve shack, and \"buffalo hides\" for food stamps, then you might be approaching our realities. We no longer live the way we used to, and the reason is colonization. Unless you accept these realities, you will never even begin to understand anything to do with our lives.\n \n \nWhat is it about wanting to get to the heart of what is good about the People that is wrong?\n\n I'm sure you might feel all warm and fuzzy about this, but we're being jailed and killed for defending our basic rights while you're trying to be \"optimistic\". Open your eyes. Have some respect.\n \n \nHow dare you presume to question my intentions! Did you know that in your posts, should I care to critique them (which I don't) I find that your hatred of the \"whiteman\" is paramount? Are you scared to admit that the ones that obliterated that way of life might find some way to restore it - might actually be the only ones that can?\n\n LOL! Okay, \"whiteman\". Thank spirit you're here to save us, or else we'd get lost trying to get out of our teepees every morning. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n You're getting more and more ridiculous. I have no problem with \"white\" people. It's stupid people I can't stand.\n \n \nHere's something else I dug up from the same thread... I included it to further refute your 'essentialist' arguments about pagan spirituality.\n\n Oh, golly. Roman polytheism is not at all an earth-centred spirituality. You don't have the faintest clue do you?\n \n \nAs well, we have corroboration by the finding of skulls and remains of children at Aztec religious sites. \n\n Now there's a ridiculous argument. You have no idea how those skulls and remains got there, and what their ritual purpose was, and neither do I. However, the Aztecs practised a ritual form of medicine, so for all we know these children could have died while someone was trying to cure them of some disease or injury. Really, presuming that any human remains are proof of ritual sacrifice is dangerous business. Consider this- http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/6581/skull_church.JPG \n This, on the other hand, recently featured in a special edition of Time magazine, is described as a \"bone church\". Found in Prague, Czechoslovakia, it reputedly contains the remains of tens of thousands of victims of the plague.\n",
