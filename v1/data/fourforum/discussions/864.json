I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.\n \n So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?",

   "Yes, I have read these things.\n\n But didn't understand them.\n \nHow can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print, now be eroding only within the last 40?\n\n Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.\n \nAnother way: If we saw a man's print for 100 million years, how can a mere 40 or 50 years clear up the controversy and produce the real dinosaur prints we are convinced that they are?\n\n No one saw a man's track for 100 million years. You told me that you had read the material at the links. Did you lie or is it that you didn't understand any of it? Some of the best \"man tracks\" were found by removing the soil on top of the slab. Some of the tracks were only the shallow impression of the middle part of the tridactyl print. Mr. Carl Baugh claimed these were human tracks. He convinced John Morris of the ICR. After these tracks had been exposed for about 10 years, Glen Kuban invited John Morris back to look again. In some of those tracks the softer infill has since eroded to show clearly the tridactyl nature of the tracks. In others, the infill has changed color by being exposed to the river water. The outline of the entire track is vivible in the stone. John Morris now agrees that there is no track in the river that was made by a human.\n \n I am amazed that you went to visit this river and didn't go inside the Park Headquarters. They have a very nice display that explains the history. Also there are signs at various points of access to the river with signs with information. How is it that you paid attention to none of it.\n \n But you said in your original post, \"The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances, the toes.\" That just isn't true. You didn't see that in the river. Maybe you stopped at Mr. Carl Baugh's \"Creation Evidence Museum\" and saw his carved footprint and his cast of a Pleurocoelus print in which he imagines he sees a human track.

It's hot in Texas and you were having delusions if you saw what you claim in the river.\n\n \n \n No, I did not have the opportunity to view prints in the river bed. The ones I saw were on the bank and, as I said previously, were very clearly human in nature - heels, toes, arches. To the best of my recollection, the visit was done in the early 90s. My wife was with me. We are quite certain of what we saw. Also, in our viewing of the stone, there was absolutely nothing -discoloration, infilling, etc. - to lead us to believe that the prints were in evolution, so to speak, and that what we were viewing would go on to change in any significant matter. \n \n Let me state very clearly again (because I know that others are reading): my wife and I were standing on a bank of the Paluxy River in Texas and viewing large numbers of clear and entire tridactyl prints in stone and intermixed with them were very clear and entire human-like prints. \n \n That was really the point of my first email into this forum - to say that I am an eyewitness of co-existing human and dinosaur prints at the Paluxy in Glen Rose and to open up a challenge to all who disbelieve to investigate the matter themselves before swallowing of all the material to the contrary being disseminated on the internet or elsewhere.\n \n I cannot be sure of what has happened since my visit to cause so much controversy and lead so many to do a 180 regarding the human prints, but I consider it unfortunate, especially to those who can only read and never pay a visit to the site. I suppose what the articles (and you) are saying about erosion is the principle reason, though. The truth is, I simply do not buy it all because I know what I saw. \n \n Yes, I have visited all the sites in Dinosaur Valley State Park as well as the headquarters building. Yes, I have read the assertions they make about the human prints. But I must tell you that I am not one easily persuaded by predisposed thinking, especially by evolutionists. So, in reading their material, I choose to take it all with a grain of salt. \n \n I have written Mr. Kuban and cannot be sure he will reply. However, when I am optimistic, I hope that he will be able to tell me more about what he is seeing and give specifics about the numbers of previously 'human' prints that are in transition. I suspect that some of these scientific papers are being written in such a manner that partial information is put forth as the whole of the matter. What I mean is, I am curious to know how many 'human' prints are not in transition at all and are not being reported to the public. I have asked him other things as well.\n \n Thanks for writing. I know that many who participate in the forum hold your views and are content to let one person do the talking - one who is well-read and seems to know the beginning and end of the matter. I do appreciate your input, really. However, I would like to hear from anyone who might hold my views and why. And, at least for the moment, I am a believer that humans and these early beasts co-existed and that the prints in Glen Rose testify to such.",

As for the truncated algal formations in two of the toe marks, those could be easily explained in that the early man pressed algae into the mud under his step.

   "Glen Kuban has offered a good argument in his efforts to strike down the idea of man-tracks in Glen Rose. He has certainly done his homework and is duty-bound to propound his side of the argument with scientific vigor.\n\n And he has done so. In fact, his scientific pursuit of the argument convinced John Morris of the ICR that none of the tracks that he had claimed were \"man tracks\" 15 years earlier were made by humans. Kuban's scientific pursuit of the argument was good enough to prompt Paul Taylor of \"Films for Christ\", son of Stanley Taylor who produced the movie Footprints in Stone, to withdraw it from circulation. When faced with the physical evidence, Kuban's arguments were sufficient to convince these creationists.\n \nMany times, the weaknesses in these scientific dissertations are not so much in what information is included, but in what has been left out.\n\n Actually, that isn't true of scientific arguments. It is a characteristic of creationists.\n \nI think Glen Kuban faces some real challenges in his continuance to label the elongated Paluxy prints as dinosaurian.\n\n And your expertise is? Glen Kuban has studied dinosaur tracks for more than two decades. James O. Farlow, a paleontologist and a recognized expert on dinosaur tracks from Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne agrees with Kuban.\n \n1. First, he has yet to define clearly his new Cretaceous creature that made these prints or to name it. A bigger problem might be to convince paleontologists that he has stumbled onto a new brand of dinosaur.\n\n At first I thought that you had actually read Kuban's material, since I linked it. Here it is again. The Texas Dinosaur/\"Man Track\" Controversy. If you read Kuban's material you will find that he doesn't claim to have stumbled onto a new brand of dinosaur. If you did read Kuban's material then you are distorting the facts; a liar. Moreover, he did identify it. A tridactyl theropod for most of what are claimed to be \"man tracks.\" But there are at least two other large dinosaur prints found in the Paluxy. One can't be sure from tracks which specific animal made the tracks, but fossils of three likely candidates have been found in deposits of the same age very close to Glen Rose. The tridactyl prints that are the source of the metatarsal impressions are consistant with the theropod, Acrocanthosarus. The sauropod was probably a Pleurocoelus. There are also other tracks in the Paluxy consistant with the ornithopod Iguanodon.\n \n Thus, there is no need to define the creatures or to convince paleontologists. It was the paleontologists that identified the probable makers of the tracks in the first place. Moreover, the identification of a specific creature is a red herring. In essence you are claiming that if Kuban can't name the creature, then they were made by humans. Nonsense. Since you are making the extraordinary assertion, the oblication to provide the evidence is yours.\n \n In fact, Kuban's work first indicated that theropods did in fact make metatarsal prints. That has since been confirmed by paleontoligists at other sites.\n \n2. Second, he has not offered an explanation as to why for a significant number of times that his new creature takes a step, the bottom of its foot makes a curiously human-like print - especially \"toe\" marks (which can either be impressed or raised depending on if suction was present when the foot was lifted from the mud).\n\n Nice ad hoc. I defy you to find a mud pit and stomp around in it. Check to see if any of the toe impressions are raised. How mindless. Further, there aren't a significant number of apparent toe impressions - two or three at most, at least one of those raised. Most \"man tracks\" are merely oval depressions with obvious tridactyl indications (erosion or discoloration).\n \n3. Then, he needs to build and display the bone structure of this unusual foot and answer some hard questions. Some might be\n\n You know? I thought about taking a picture of the display of the tridactyl dinosaur foot in the Park building but I thought no one would be interested. Kuban did explain it but it seems that you didn't read it.\n \na. How does a beast with a tridactyl-style foot at times make an impression where the bone structure in the metatarsals reveal more than three joints?\n\n What? Let me try to 'splain it to you since you seem to be a bit ignorant. Put your hand on the desk in front of you. Now lift it so that only your finger tips touch the desk. That is a digitigrate foot. Horses are a good example, but they have reduced their hands and feet to a single digit. Now press your fingers down without letting your palm touch the desk. That is the semi-plantigrate foot, used by dogs, theropod dinosaurs, cats, and birds. Now let's count the joints from the finger tips. Only your fingers are on the desk, right? OK. One, two three. With me so far? Now lower your hand so that your palm and the heel of your hand touch the desk. That is a metatarsal print. The bones between your wrist and your fingers are the metatarsals. Watch a bird. A long legged wading bird is good. It appears that the bird's knee bends backwards. That's because it isn't the knee but the ankle. The knee is above that.\n \nb. If this large creature lifts its digits at will when walking, so as leave a shallow digit impression or none at all, explain how it maintains balance on such a narrow, elongated foot.\n\n Yet another nonsense objection. How do you maintain balance on your narrow foot? The prints were made in mud and it colapsed back into the track after the dinosaur lifted it's foot. That tended to leave only the central part of the foot as an impression. The metatarsal imprints which are usually claimed to be man tracks are irrelevant. The dinosaur maintained balance on it's feet, not it's metatarsals.\n \nc. Along the lines of b., what would the skeletal structure and weight distribution of this gangly theropod be that planted its weight on its tarsals and metatarsals and only lightly rolled forward on its phalanges as it moved ahead shifting its weight alternately between feet?\n\n What XXXX! Another red herring. This is not claimed to be the common means of walking of these dinosaurs. Metatarsal imprints of theropods are not common, but they are not unusual. Why don't you do a Google search on Acrocanthosaurus and get back to me on the \"gangly\" part. Dishonest.\n \nd. Then what of the tail? With a center of gravity straight above the foot, walking would have to be in an erect fashion and the presence of a suspended tail, so as not to leave its own impressions in the mud, would certainly yank the beast rearward and thus prohibit forward motion.\n\n Theropod dinosaurs are not humans. Just because you are upright doesn't mean that theropods were also. The tail was a counter balance that probably didn't drag on the ground.\n \n Let me try to illustrate. Imagine a dog. It stands on four legs. Now imagine the front limbs as some sort of grasping claw. The grasping claw dog falls on its nose. Now give it a big tail, massive and long. Now the center of gravity of the grasping claw dog is over the hips. But it doesn't have front legs/feet, it has clawed hands. And its tail is huge. And the dog's body is still parallel to the ground.\n \n4. Finally, Kuban has neglected to comment on why the metatarsal and tarsal portions of the elongated prints at times fall obliquely in relation to the motion and direction of the digit impressions in the Cretaceous stone.\n\n They don't.\n \nConcerning the Burdick print, one needs to be aware that for every opinion out there that calls it a fake, there is a counter opinion that asserts its authenticity - and for good reason.\n\n That's not true. The print is obviously not human to all but the profoundly retarded or the completely duped. Did you actually look at it?\n \n And why is it that the Burdick print is so much larger than any of the other claimed \"man tracks?\" The rest are claimed to be 11 1/4\" long.\n \nThe print has been cross-sectioned several times, and each time seems to graphically support the idea that downward pressure from body weight, and not modern carving, left the impression in ancient semi-soft mud.\n\n Only if you don't know what you are talking about or are a dupe. There are algal structures in the rock that terminate at the carved surface and show no sign of compression.\n \n Moreover, it is possible to tell which way is up in the rock. The Burdick print was carved on the underside of the slab. Carl Baugh lied to you and you sucked it up.\n \nAs for the truncated algal formations in two of the toe marks, those could be easily explained in that the early man pressed algae into the mud under his step. As the algae rotted away, it was replaced by fine-textured infilling material which hardened to a less-dense consistency than its mud base. Erosion of this infilling material over time revealed \"holes\" in the toe cavities of the stone print.\n\n It cudda been! I just love \"creation science.\" I'm going to become one. You get to make it up as you go along. Whatever pops into mind. \n [quote=notsofast]More in favor of the Burdick print's authenticity is at http://www.bible.ca/tracks/burdick-track.htm.\n Been there and had a good laugh. But tell me. Do you actually think that the burdick print looks like a human foot print? Do I need to wade in mud so that you can compare the two? Smack yourself up the side of the head and look at it. Where is the arch? Where did you ever see a foot with toes like that?",

The dinosaur maintained balance on it's feet, not it's metatarsals.\n \n What XXXX! Another red herring. This is not claimed to be the common means of walking of these dinosaurs. Metatarsal imprints of theropods are not common, but they are not unusual. Why don't you do a Google search on Acrocanthosaurus and get back to me on the \"gangly\" part. Dishonest.\n \n Theropod dinosaurs are not humans. Just because you are upright doesn't mean that theropods were also. The tail was a counter balance that probably didn't drag on the ground.\n \n Let me try to illustrate. Imagine a dog. It stands on four legs. Now imagine the front limbs as some sort of grasping claw. The grasping claw dog falls on its nose. Now give it a big tail, massive and long. Now the center of gravity of the grasping claw dog is over the hips. But it doesn't have front legs/feet, it has clawed hands. And its tail is huge. And the dog's body is still parallel to the ground.\n \n They don't.\n \n That's not true. The print is obviously not human to all but the profoundly retarded or the completely duped. Did you actually look at it?\n \n And why is it that the Burdick print is so much larger than any of the other claimed \"man tracks?\" The rest are claimed to be 11 1/4\" long.\n \n Only if you don't know what you are talking about or are a dupe. There are algal structures in the rock that terminate at the carved surface and show no sign of compression.\n \n Moreover, it is possible to tell which way is up in the rock. The Burdick print was carved on the underside of the slab. Carl Baugh lied to you and you sucked it up.\n \n It cudda been! I just love \"creation science.\" I'm going to become one. You get to make it up as you go along. Whatever pops into mind. \n [/url]\n Been there and had a good laugh. But tell me. Do you actually think that the burdick print looks like a human foot print? Do I need to wade in mud so that you can compare the two? Smack yourself up the side of the head and look at it. Where is the arch? Where did you ever see a foot with toes like that?\n\n \n \n Thanks for your attempt to answer my queries. I really did not expect that, because I did not feel that any participants in the forum would be qualified to do so. I put forth these thoughts just to make a point anyway. In big issues like this, there is a lot more than meets the eye, whether in stone or in a scientific thesis. More thought is to be given and discovery to be made yet regarding the Paluxy prints. Plus, I believe additional footprints are forthcoming. By the way, above the Burdick paragraph, I never called the prints \"human.\" If you gathered that from my statements, you were incorrect. I only stated that Kuban's stance that they are dinosaurian will be problematic. Also, the term \"erect\" is not synonymous with \"human.\" As well, if you read back over the Burdick paragraph, you will note that I carefully chose my words in such a way that I did not commit myself to an opinion either way on that print either. Thanks just the same.",

   "Let me get this straight. There are two opinions of the tracks in the Paluxy: 1) dinosaur tracks, 2) dinosaur and human tracks. So when you entered the debate you and disagreed with opinion 1 you were not taking up opinion two, even though you included the Burdick print in your discussion? So you are maintaining a third opinion - 3) none of the above.\n \n I'm wondering since you are disagreeing with experts in dinosaur tracks who have studied these things for years both at Paluxy and other locations and all of whom hold opinion 1, have you ever been to Glen Rose and seen the tracks?",

   "ok. maybe the crack about evolutionists was risky and foolish. my apologies. But I know what I saw and I took take anyone to the place except that it is not open to the public anymore. However, I made it there recently in a round about way. it is a popular site (or at least, was). Im sure you have been there. more later\n\n \n I'll bet you were at the Al West property! Would love to view it because you will notice that Glen Kuban calls these the best human-like prints he found. Then, Mr. Kuban falls unusually (almost suspiciously) silent concerning the property and its prints - for that reason alone, I would like to see these. Only speculation, but could it be that they do, as you have said, contain toe, heel and arch impressions that have caused consternation within the dissenting crowd? Would love to see them. But cheer up, there are an abundance of human prints that have been discovered at various locations of the world in \"places where they should not have been found,\" in statas too old for man to have left a mark. If the Paluxy falls short, the paleo and archeo communities are not in short supply when it comes to very old human tracks. And the body of evidence is mounting that humans like us existed from the womb of time.",

   "Doubtful that it was the West trail that rspeir01 saw. If so, then he is the only person to have seen clear toe and heel marks at that site. Baugh ignores the site, and West has said that he is puzzled by that. Morris mentioned it in his book but had never visited it until Glen Kuban took him there. What the West site shows is dinosaur tracks of varying quality. Among the digitigrade tracks are others that are metatarsal dinosaur tracks, clearly. Some of them show indistinct (mostly mud-collapsed) metatarsal tracks that appeared more humanlike. But all of these tracks are clearly part of the dinosaur track trails. And that explains why Baugh ignores it.\n \n Kuban used the site as a primer on dinosaur tracks for the people from the ICR, John Morris among them, and Paul Taylor of Films for Christ. After viewing the West site and then the Taylor trail, it became clear to Morris that the Taylor trail didn't contain any human tracks either. Morris said so in an impact article and Taylor withdrew his father's film, Footprints in Stone.\n \n It is also interesting that the tracks, both the Taylor site, the McFall site and the tracks on State Park Ledge, all of which were claimed to be \"giant man tracks\", were studied by creationists scientists from Loma Linda University in 1970, even before the Taylor film. They conclluded that the Taylor tracks and The McFall tracks were dinosaurian in origin and that the \"man tracks\" on State Park Ledge weren't tracks of any kind. Other creationists to visit the sites, such as Dr. Ernest Booth of Outdoor Pictures, Inc., and Wilbert Rusch, president of the Creation Research Society, expressed skepticism about the \"man track\" claims.\n \n So I think that rspeir01 saw the Taylor trail and applied a bit of imagination to see what he wanted. And of course, the illogic of the nature of the tracks can always be fixed by application of \"creation science,\" i.e., an ad hoc just so story based on fantasy, like, \"...especially \"toe\" marks (which can either be impressed or raised depending on if suction was present when the foot was lifted from the mud).\" That's what makes \"creation science\" so much fun. You get to make it up as you go.",
