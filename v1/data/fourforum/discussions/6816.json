   "Jordan. Severe yesterday's night blasts in three hotels committed by suicide bombers caused death of at least 67 people and 300 wounded. Now I don't see the idea why Jordanian officials name militants in neighboring Iraq as \"prime suspects\".... What's the reason I ask you? Don't they see the three terror acts were of Chechenian style? And can it be a mere coincident that only a few hours prior the blasts 6 Islamic militants had been sentenced long in Jordanian court (it was a really tough experience for Jordanian judge indeed as the 12 sentenced militants were highly aggressive bawling against the prosecutor and the judge). However, the sentenced Islamists were no Chechens, but no doubt they must have been in sort of connected to Hattab's terrorist gang that used to fight in Chechnya. I only wish the UN SC finally arrive at the right decision concerning Chechen terrorists to make them know their place!",
