   "After three weeks in the Garden of Eden, God came to visit Eve. 'So, how is everything going?' inquired God. \n \n 'It is all so beautiful, God,' she replied. 'The sunrises and sunsets are breathtaking, the smells, the sights, everything is wonderful, but I have just one problem. \n \n It's these breasts you have given me. The middle one pushes the other two out and I am constantly knocking them with my arms, catching them on branches and snagging them on bushes. They're a real pain.' \n \n And Eve went on to tell God that since many other parts of her body came in pairs, such as her limbs, eyes, ears, etc She felt that having only two breasts might leave her body more 'symmetrically balanced'. \n \n 'That's a fair point,' replied God, 'But it was my first shot at this, you know. I gave the animals six breasts, so I figured that you needed only half of those, but I see that you are right. I will fix it up right away.' \n \n And God reached down, removed the middle breast and tossed it into the bushes \n \n Three weeks passed and God once again visited Eve in the Garden of Eden. \n \n ' Well, Eve, how is my favorite creation?' \n \n 'Just fantastic,' she replied, 'But for one oversight. You see, all the animals are paired off. The ewe has a ram and the cow has her bull. All the animals have a mate except me. I feel so alone.' \n \n God thought for a moment and said, 'You know, Eve, you are right. How could I have overlooked this? You do need a mate and I will immediately create a man from a part of you. Let's see....where did I put that useless boob?'",

   "What a nightmare Sandy!\n Are there any jobs out there?\n I hope so. I'm an office manager at a nursery (plants not babies) so, I'm thinking my skills (such as they are) can be applied to most other businesses.

Let's see....where did I put that useless boob?'\n\n \n Hah! This is one of my favorite takes on the Garden of Eden story: \n \n \nIn the beginning there was absolutely nothing, & I mean nothing. But nothing implies something, just as up implies down & sweet implies sour, as man implies woman & drunk implies sober & happy implies sad. I hate to tell you this, friends & neighbors, but we are teensy-weensy implications in an enormous implication. If you don't like it here, why don't you go back to where you came from?\n \n The first something to be implied by all the nothing was in fact two somethings, who were God & Satan. God was male. Satan was female. They implied each other, & hence were peers in the emerging power structure, which was itself nothing but an implication. Power was implied by weakness.\n \n God created the heaven & the earth. & the earth was without form, & void, & darkness was upon the face of the deep. & the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Satan could have done this herself, but she thought it was stupid, action for the sake of action. What was the point? She didn't say anything at first.\n \n But Satan began to worry about God when he said, \"Let there be light\" & there was light. She had to wonder, \"What in heck does He think He's doing? How far does He intend to go, & does He expect me to help Him take care of all this crazy stuff?\n \n & then the XXXX really hit the fan. God made man & woman, beautiful little miniatures of Him & Her, & turned them loose to see what might become of them. The Garden of Eden might be considered the prototype for the Coliseum & the Roman Games.\n \n Satan couldn't undo anything God had done. She could at least try to make existence for His little toys less painful. She could see what He couldn't: to be alive was to be either bored or scared stiff. So she filled an apple with all sorts of ideas that might at least relieve the boredom, such as rules for games with cards & dice, & how to XXXX, & recipes for beer & wine & whiskey, & pictures of different plants that were smokable, & so on. & instructions on how to make music & sing & dance real crazy, real sexy. & how to spout blasphemy when they stubbed their toes.\n \n Satan had a serpent give Eve the apple. Eve took a bite & handed it to Adam. He took a bite & then they XXXXed.\n \n Granted some of the ideas had catastrophic side effects for a minority of those who tried them. All Satan wanted to do was help, & she did in many cases. & her record for promoting nostrums with occasionally dreadful side effects is no worse than that of the most reputable pharmaceutical houses of the present day.\n \n -Kurt Vonnegut, Timequake\n",
