   "emoticon_xgood \n \n Dear Friend,\n \n I want to let you know about an important new campaign to get Ralph Nader into the presidential debates. (see letnaderdebate.org). Your support for this effort is important even if you do not intend to vote for him.\n \n We are at a critical juncture in our country's history. I believe that we are facing a crisis in democracy where increasingly the views of ordinary Americans are not only not reflected in public policy but are barely even heard through \"normal\" channels. I am personally very concerned about the dangerously narrow perimeters of \"debate\" on every issue facing us from the war in Iraq to education and healthcare to same day voter registration. \n \n From Lincoln-Douglas to Kennedy-Nixon to Clinton-Bush-Perot, the presidential debates have been an important forum for a national dialogue on the critical issues of our day. I would love to hear serious, perhaps sometimes contentious rather than scripted debate about our national priorities. Nader's inclusion would help to ensure that we have that kind of debate in 2004. \n \n Personally, I am motivated by the issue of the War in Iraq. Polls show that the majority of Americans are critical of the conduct of the war, yet there is virtually no difference in the positions of President Bush and Senator Kerry a point that has been made by many commentators at this point.\n \n In a political culture where partisan interests and corruption have become so dominant, it is important that we, as ordinary citizens, take responsibility and speak out. Please join me in an appeal to a fair and open debate by including Nader, a nationally known and respected independent presidential candidate. Without his inclusion, there will be no real dialogue.\n \n To sign the open letter to President Bush, go to  LetNaderDebate.org. \n You can also join me by giving a donation to this grassroots effort, and by \n emailing your friends and contacts about it to get the word out.\n \n Thanks!\n Gwen",

   "How does one \"steal\" votes? How did Kerry become entitled to these votes (In my opinion, he certainly hasn't earned them by anything he's done or said)It's amazing how organized we are to believe that because the two parties put up two losers, and tell us that we have to vote for the lesser of two evils, that we capitulate in a minute - That bind has only given us bigger and bigger \"evils\" and at this particular point in time, I think we really have to think more developmentally about how we're going grow as a country - Otherwise, we're in a world of trouble!",
