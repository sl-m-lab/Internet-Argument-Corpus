   "I know this is a bit off topic, but human technology - ranging from genetic manipulation to artificial intelligence - is slowly approaching the point where it is conceivable that within this century humans could be capable of creating an entirely new life form. \n \n I'm not talking only clones or hybrids - which have already been achieved at various levels - but engineering a new living being from scratch by synthesizing DNA in the full \"design\" that one would desire. Outside of biological designs of this sort, the question also arises whether artificial intelligence could ever advance to the point that one would create a sentient electro-mechanical \"living\" being - where the question would also arise as to what constitutes \"life\". Any such technology is still quite far away but it does bring up interesting moral issues of humans dangerously \"playing God\". Already moral questions of human - animal hybrids or human clones have started to become relevant since the technology seems to be just around the corner. \n \n If anybody is interested in these issues, this forums seems as good a a place as any to discuss them.

How many molecular biologists do we have on this forum after all? And was the OP directed only at them? I also notice that all of those who condemn and insult me for giving my opinion as gibberish offered absolutely nothing to the debate at all, only insults.\n \n As to your link though, I read the whole article and need some clarification as to what kind of life it believes we are close to creating. I ask this because the OP is pretty clear about suggesting the creation of synthetic artificial life within the century in the full design that one would desire. That is what I was speaking to not ever happening in the post above. The rest of the part you quoted was not about the end result being a functional new animal of any design, or of an intended design by its human makers. I maintain that will never successfuly happen, and your article doesn't imply that will ever happen either. If I'm wrong, please correct me. \n \n Remember, Another opinion wasn't speaking about Designing a new organism from scratch, but a functioning new animal from scratch with all parts where they should be, based totally on human design.\n \n \n I know this is a bit off topic, but human technology - ranging from genetic manipulation to artificial intelligence - is slowly approaching the point where it is conceivable that within this century humans could be capable of creating an entirely new life form. \n \n I'm not talking only clones or hybrids - which have already been achieved at various levels - but engineering a new living being from scratch by synthesizing DNA in the full \"design\" that one would desire. \n\n \n \n Once membranes are present, cells can create a barrier against \"bad\" molecules, keep the \"good\" ones in, and multiply. Bedau believes that the other two major obstacles facing scientists in this field are,\n \n (1) getting the nucleotides, or \"blocks of DNA\" to form a working genetic system, and \n \n (2) establishing the proper cell metabolism. Creating a working genetic system would enable the cells to function, to reproduce and to change in accordance with their environment. Establishing a functioning metabolism would allow cells to extract raw materials from the environment and convert them to food and energy.\n \n Jack Szostak, of the Harvard Medical School, believes that consistently being able to create membranes will not be \"a big problem\" within six months. Scientists are using fatty acids to achieve this goal, he says, and is also optimistic about labs producing artificial genetic systems, as described by Bedau, within the near future. Once the membranes are produced, scientists can add nucleotides in the right proportions and, reasonably, Darwinian evolution could take over.\n \n \"We aren't smart enough to design things, we just let evolution do the hard work and then we figure out what happened,\" said Szostak.\n \n There is more than one approach to solving these problems, however. Steve Benner, a biological chemist at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, is going down a different avenue of thought. Normal DNA consists of four bases -- adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine -- pairing up to create genetic codes. Benner is attempting to add eight entirely new bases to the chemical equation, and working from there, produce new life.\n \n While there are legitimate concerns about the far-reaching consequences of creating artificial life, Bedau assures the public that it will be a \"long time\" before cells running \"amok\" is even a possibility. \"...it'll be a huge achievement if you can keep them [artificial cells] alive for an hour in a lab. But them getting out and taking over, never in our imagination could this happen.\"\n \n\n \n Please correct me if I'm wrong but this article doesn't imply what the OP is suggesting at all is it? Isn't this article clearly suggesting that \"...it'll be a huge achievement if you can keep them [artificial cells] alive for an hour in a lab. So I stand by my belief that to be able to structure DNA artificially to grow into a working animal is not something that Man will succeed at accomplishing. \n \n Or as Jack Szostak said: \"We aren't smart enough to design things, we just let evolution do the hard work and then we figure out what happened,\" said Szostak. It seems he agrees with me.",

   "Just to clarify the intention of my opening post, it was meant to imply that, within this century, we might be capable of designing life from scratch - not just hybridization (essentially cutting and pasting of existing pieces of naturally made DNA) or cloning. However, this does not mean that it need be a complex life form such as a mammal or even, for that matter, a multi-celled organism. \n \n We would have to start from the very simple life forms - such as a microbe - and progress from there. Since carbon based biological lifeforms are what we are most familiar with, any new life form we create would essentially copy the methods of nature and use the knowledge of metabolisms and general organic functions that we already see in nature - just custom picked for our own design purposes. Demon38's excellent article does suggest that we are quite close to creating that first very simple life-form. The fact that it would not last long in the lab is a secondary issue - creating life is one thing, keeping it alive is another further step. \n \n Synthetic biology is a field that combines science and engineering in order to design and build (\"synthesize\") novel biological functions and systems. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology :\n \nThere are several key enabling technologies that are critical to the growth of synthetic biology.\n \n Sequencing\n Synthetic biologists make use of DNA sequencing in their work in several ways. First, large-scale genome sequencing efforts continue to provide a wealth of information on naturally occurring organisms. This information provides a rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and devices. Second, synthetic biologists use sequencing to verify that they fabricated their engineered system as intended. Third, fast, cheap and reliable sequencing can also facilitate rapid detection and identification of synthetic systems and organisms.\n \n Fabrication\n A critical limitation in synthetic biology today is the time and effort expended during fabrication of engineered genetic sequences. To speed up the cycle of design, fabrication, testing and redesign, synthetic biology requires more rapid and reliable de novo DNA synthesis and assembly of fragments of DNA.\n \n In 2002 researchers at SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing the 7741 base poliovirus genome from its published sequence, producing the first synthetic organism. This took about two years of painstaking work.[3] In 2003 the 5386 bp genome of the bacteriophage Phi X 174 was assembled in about two weeks.[4] In 2006, the same team, at the J. Craig Venter Institute, has announced and patented plans to produce a synthetic genome of a novel minimal bacterium, Mycoplasma laboratorium.[5]\n \n In 2007 it was reported that several companies were offering the synthesis of genetic sequences up to 2000 bp long, for a price of about $1 per base pair and a turnaround time of less than two weeks.[6]\n \n Modeling\n Models inform the design of engineered biological systems by allowing synthetic biologists to better predict system behavior prior to fabrication. Synthetic biology will benefit from better models of how biological molecules bind substrates and catalyze reactions, how DNA encodes the information needed to specify the cell and how multi-component integrated systems behave.\n \n Measurement\n Precise and accurate quantitative measurements of biological systems are crucial to improving understanding of biology. Such measurements often help to elucidate how biological systems work and provide the basis for model construction and validation. Differences between predicted and measured system behavior can identify gaps in understanding and explain why synthetic systems don't always behave as intended. Technologies which allow many parallel and time-dependent measurements will be especially useful in synthetic biology. Microscopy and flow cytometry are examples of useful measurement technologies.\n\n \n The references relating to synthesizing DNA of microbe-level complexity do suggest that we are already at the begining of being able to custom design DNA for very simple organisms. At the impressive speed at which genetic science has progressed over the last decades and, given the amount of effort put into the general field, I have little doubt that genetic technology will continue to make great strides to produce even more complex organisms and fully viable synthetic life within the following decades. It will be an interesting process to watch but one which we also need to discuss with respect to issues of safety, social implications, etc.\n \n Even at the level of the very simple synthetic organisms addressed by the field of synthetic biology, some of the concerns include (from the same web page):\n \nIn addition to numerous bioscientific challenges, the vast potential of synthetic biology to play a formative role in contemporary human life raises new questions for bioethics, biosecurity, biosafety, health, energy and intellectual property. To date considerable focus has been given to the so-called dual-use challenge. For example, while the study of synthetic biology can lead to more efficient ways to produce cures (e.g. against malaria), it may also lead to synthesis or redesign of harmful pathogens (e.g., smallpox). In addition, scientists, funders, policymakers, ethicists and others have recognized challenges presented by a post 9/11 political milieu. A new range of potentially malicious actors and actions (i.e., terrorists/terrorism) must now be taken into account by those seeking to govern scientific domains; and the internet and other new media provide global access to technological know-how and scientific knowledge. Such global access cannot be addressed using existing models of nation-specific regulation. (New Scientist, November 12, 2005). Some detailed suggestions for licensing and monitoring the various phases of gene and genome synthesis are beginning to appear. There is also an ongoing, comprehensive, and open discussion of so-called \"societal issues\" online at OpenWetWare.\n\n \n As this general field progresses farther, even more ethical issues will come into play to discuss. Either way, it is a fasciniating field to discover, follow and discuss.",

However, this does not mean that it need be a complex life form such as a mammal or even, for that matter, a multi-celled organism. \n \n\n \n I'm not clear on the hybridization point. Clearly designing life utterly from scratch is well beyond our current means. Any life we create in the near future would be as similar to existing life as any given cell is to any other; things like structure, metabolic pathways, etc would all be pretty much the same. Given that, the simplest method for creating \"new\" life would be to take the genome of an existing organism, a bacteria for example, get rid of the genes we don't want, add the genes we do, and then synthesize it. I'm not talking about cutting and pasting genes into an existing strand of DNA, but rather using the information from an existing strand to design a new strand, and making that from scratch.

Would that count as hybridization to you?\n\n By hybridization, I mean combining naturally-made portions of DNA as opposed to synthesizing the DNA from scratch - without using natural DNA to make it. Basically, it is harder to make a DNA molecule from scratch without using pre-existing self-replicating natural DNA molecules as building blocks.\n \n If, as you mention, you would make a new strand of DNA from scratch without using natural DNA to physically make it , then I would not call that hybridization. However, just because you don't use natural DNA to make the synthetic DNA doesn't mean you wouldn't use the same types of designs that nature uses in existing DNA. I would think that using design knowledge gained from studying existing DNA would be necessary for the first range of life-forms. As an analogy, if you put together a car from various parts of other cars, then you have not made a car from scratch. You would have to make all the car parts separately anew to say that you have created an entirely new car. However, you are obviously going to learn how to design a car by looking at existing cars so, from that point of view, you are using information from the other cars - just not any physical parts from them. Of course, car parts do not self replicate so this is not a perfect analogy. \n \n The bottom line is that it is more impressive if you make new DNA from scratch without using any existing DNA than if you only cut and paste self-replicated pieces of existing DNA. It is just harder to claim that one created new life from scratch if one used existing life to make it.

We wouldn't be able to claim that we truly had created new life until our technology would become independent from using natural life in the creation process.

That would imply that your weren't a dupe of your creationist master. You just accept anything from your creationist guru without question. Above you claimed that you didn't take the quote out of context and now you admit that you did, due to you own ignorance. Yep! You are a christian.\n \nI like that he was speaking against slavery in it and it makes a worthy statement in my opinion.\n666) Then why are you taking the quote out of context in an effort to make a point that Jefferson never intended?

   "Fairly long pieces of DNA (oligonucleotides) are already fairly cheap and easily available. Several labs have accomplished the larger feat of synthesising entire viral genomes (polio and smallpox) from scratch. Microbial genomes are only a year or three away. This technology is virtually here.\n \n Designing a totally novel organism from scratch, with completely unprecedented metabolic systems and enzymes, would be a much more difficult feat to accomplish, and I wouldn't anticipate that for decades yet. However, engineered organisms with wholly new functions and features aren't nearly as improbable. Genetically engineered organisms with minor modifications are already agriculturally, industrially and medically important; examples with more extensive modifications should be coming soon.\n \n The problem with religious zealots is they keep themselves deliberately ignorant of science, which is why they rarely have a clue what it is or isn't capable of accomplishing. But they never miss a chance to tell scientists that they know better than scientists do.\n\n \n On the other hand its is often the case that examining and reverse engineering existing devices provides enormously rapid progress in our capabilities!

Or maybe you will take notice of the content of what they say and actually learn something.\n\n The fact that you didn't actually make the page is no excuse. You are presenting it as accurate.\n \n I took a look at the first small handful and wasn't the least bit surprised by the blatant creationist dishonesty we've all come to know and love and to expect from you, Archie.\n \n Regarding Albert Fleischmann and \"Dr. Etheridge\":\n http://members.cox.net/ardipithecus/evol/lies/lie029.html\n \n Your source is full of carp.\n \n \nDr George Wald - winner of the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize for Science.\n\n There is no \"Nobel Peace Prize for Science.\" There's not even a \"Nobel Prize for Science.\" Your source is clearly more interested in being convincing than in being correct. (In other words, your source is full of carp.)\n \n Let's look at the rest of Wald's quote:One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible. Yet here we are -- as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation. It will help to digress for a moment to ask what one means by \"impossible.\" [Emphasis added.]\n \n When one has no means of estimating the probability beforehand, it must be determined by counting the fraction of successes in a large number of trials.\n \n Our everyday concept of what is impossible, possible or certain derives from our experience: the number of trials that may be encompassed within the space of a human lifetime, or at most within recorded human history. In this colloquial, practical sense I concede the spontaneous origin of life to be \"impossible.\" It is impossible as we judge events in the scale of human experience.\n \n We shall see that this is not a very meaningful concession; For one thing, the time with which our problem is concerned is geological time, and the whole extent of human history is trivial in the balance.\n \n ....\n \n When we consider the spontaneous origin of a living organism, this is not an event that need happen again and again. It is perhaps enough for it to happen once. The probability with which we: are concerned is of a special kind; it is the probability that an event occur at least once. To this type of probability a fundamentally important thing happens as one increases the number of trials. However improbable the event in a single trial, it becomes increasingly probable as the trials are multiplied. Eventually the event becomes virtually inevitable.\n \n ...\n \n The important point is that since the origin of life belongs in the category of at-least-once phenomena, time is on its side. However improbable we regard this event, or any of the steps which it involves, given enough time it will almost certainly happen at least once. And for life as we know it, with its capacity for growth and reproduction, once may be enough.\n(source)So, your source is full of carp.\n \n I also happened to see this one as I scanned to see how long this \"list\" is.\n \nErnst Mayer, evolutionist declares \"there is no evidence for the gradual emergence of any evolutionary novelty (something new) by the accumulation of small adaptive modifications.\"\n\n The name is Ernst Mayr. If your source can't even get the name correct, why would we expect the quote to be accurate? Mayr was one of the foremost proponents of evolution, and you'd be awfully hard pressed to make the case that he thought it was a crock.\n \n Nobody believes you, Archie, because you're full of carp. (Although, comparing your intellect to that of a dolphin is sure to offend an entire aquatic species...)\n \n Archie, considering you've presented this page as \"good\" evidence of dissent, and it turns out that it's nothing of the sort, do you accept that the vast majority of the scientific community -- particularly those with training in biology -- accept evolutionary theory? Or will you continue your denial, your willful ignorance, and your lying?\n \n Let us also expose your quackery of designating these people as \"evolutionists and agnostics\" as if people who accept evolutionary theory as true are necessary of any particular religious belief system.\n \n Say hi to jyoshu for me, Archie. According to you and marc, he doesn't exist.\n \n Maybe you'll take notice of the content of my post and actually learn something.\n Oh, wait, you pretend to have me on ignore so that you have an \"excuse\" for not being able to address the quackery of yours that I expose.",

   "Well, they would be cheap for a government to make, but almost impossible for your average terrorist. Making a viable new life form is a lot harder than making a nuke. But I can see the problem if a rouge nation wanted an easy to deploy weapon of mass destruction. It's much easy to sneak a test tube into a city than it is to launch a missle.\n \n I guess when it comes to issues like this I tend to take the pragmatic approach. If a technology can be developed, it almost certainly will, by someone eventually. If \"we\" can do it now, anyone will probably be able to within our life times, regardless of whether or not we move ahead with our research. Our inaction would only delay things, not halt them. Given the huge benefits possible from this line of research I wouldn't halt it just because someone could misuse it. And there's also the point that if someone wanted a biological weapon, it would be much easier at this point to use an existing pathogen, rather than creating a new one from scratch. Nature has millions of years of experience at creating germs that kill people, I doubt we'll be that good for some while yet. But, as you noted, I do tend towards optimism. :)\n\n I'm not completely sure if existing pathogens would be more dangerous than new ones. After all, we have evolved with the existing pathogens and are sufficiently imune to the great majority of them. The ones that are very lethal often, such as Ebola, tend to kill off the small group that gets exposed before they can spread the virus. Evolution would leave us completely unprepared for any completely new pathogen - a pathogen that is lethal but at a rate that also allows it to spread widely from a small sample. \n \n I agree that once the technology is developed or nearly developed, it is hard to control it completely. However, I bemoan the fact that there isn't more public discussion on the safety and societal issues surounding these new technologies - discussion that can spur government action at properly controlling the emergence or use of the genetic technology. Granted, many people who are unwilling or unable to educate themselves on the issues of genetic technology might take an all or nothing approach in wanting to ban it completely - so I would admit that pushing it into public debate might have its pitfalls. However, this is such an important advance in technology that having practically no public debates also seems dangerous. I was glad to hear that there are some people who try to push some of these issues into debate. For example, Stuart Newman tried to patent a human chimp hybrid in order to get the patent office to think about and address these issues. From http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2005/02/patent-for-humanchimpanzee-hybrid.html :\n \nThe United States Patent Office has denied a patent for the creation of a human/chimpanzee hydbrid animal. This is depicted as something of a defeat for Stuart Newman, the \"inventor\" of this still unmade chimera. But it is really a victory. Newman is engaged in a very creative effort at public policy advocacy to prevent the creation of hybrid humans. He will most likely now sue the patent office for denying the patent. As I understand his approach, in the end he hopes to obtain a ruling that no patents over human life can ever be issued. That would doom \"therapeutic cloning.\" Moreover, Newman's advocacy should stimulate an important conversation to determined how much human DNA can be put into animals (transgenic animals) to obtain useful information or substances for making medicines (called \"pharming), before it becomes too much humans in animals. \n\n (On edit: The quoted blog got its information from this Washington Post site: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19781-2005Feb12.html )",

Meanwhile, as you say, the military has developed a wide range of super-bugs. Hopefully, it has developed anti-viral drugs to combat the created pathogens so that, were some to be let loose, our ENTIRE species would not be decimated. These are the topics of occasional movies over recent years. I only hope that no group - terrorist or otherwise - gets it into their head to develop an uncontrollable virus. \n \n These are some of the reasons why I am always wary of the development of novel potentially vastly harmful technologies - it could be too easy to lose control of them. I am always impressed by the creativity behind new technologies but one cannot bound forward in scientific progress without occasionally stepping back and looking at the potential risks. After all, we are a far from perfect species, often very illogical, who are in some ways too \"young\" to possess some of these technologies. Very serious thought needs to be given as to how to control these technologies to absolutely reduce the risk of inadvertent (or purposeful) harm. \n \nTherein lies the rub.

   "Here is another interesting article - \"I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer\" (from the Guardian, dated October 6, 2007 ) - on the progress in creating a new artificial life. From http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/06/genetics.climatechange :\n \nThe Guardian can reveal that a team of 20 top scientists assembled by Mr Venter, led by the Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith, has already constructed a synthetic chromosome, a feat of virtuoso bio-engineering never previously achieved. Using lab-made chemicals, they have painstakingly stitched together a chromosome that is 381 genes long and contains 580,000 base pairs of genetic code.\n \n The DNA sequence is based on the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium which the team pared down to the bare essentials needed to support life, removing a fifth of its genetic make-up. The wholly synthetically reconstructed chromosome, which the team have christened Mycoplasma laboratorium, has been watermarked with inks for easy recognition.\n \n It is then transplanted into a living bacterial cell and in the final stage of the process it is expected to take control of the cell and in effect become a new life form. The team of scientists has already successfully transplanted the genome of one type of bacterium into the cell of another, effectively changing the cell's species. Mr Venter said he was \"100% confident\" the same technique would work for the artificially created chromosome.\n \n The new life form will depend for its ability to replicate itself and metabolise on the molecular machinery of the cell into which it has been injected, and in that sense it will not be a wholly synthetic life form. However, its DNA will be artificial, and it is the DNA that controls the cell and is credited with being the building block of life.\n",

Very broadly speaking, the ignorant were against it, the somewhat educated for it, and the well educated against it. At the low end people were worried about armies of clones, or clones grown just for their organs, or people acheiving immortatlity by leaving their estates to their clones. With a little education people found out how silly those concerns were and said \"sure, why not?\" With a bit more education you find out how many attempts it takes to make a viable clone, and how the failures often gave rise to birth defects, gigantism, or other problems. The birth defect issue was real and important, but you didn't hear about it much because most people were arguing about \"organ banks\" instead. \n \n I agree with your concerns, but I don't see any solution. Business will most likely do whatever makes them money, scientists will generally (though not always) do the research without worrying too much about how it can be misused, and the public (and by extenstion politicians) often can't be bothered to fully understand the issues involved. Public debate is quite likely to center around easy to grasp misconceptions rather than complicated realities. Your panel of unbiased experts sounds like a good plan, but even if they could be found in the end all they could do is advise the politicians, who would just as likely listen to the polls and lobbyists instead of the pros.\n \n Ok, maybe I'm not always an optimist. :)",

The next challenge was to insert that synthetic DNA into a living cell in order to have it function using that new DNA. The challenge apparently lay in having that new cell not reject foreign DNA. That trick has now been accomplished, though not yet with purely synthetic DNA. It is a stepping stone toward that goal. From BBC NEWS | Science & Environment | A step closer to 'synthetic life' :\n \nA step closer to 'synthetic life' \n By Victoria Gill \n Science reporter, BBC News \n \n In what has been described as a step towards the creation of a synthetic cell, scientists have created a new \"engineered\" strain of bacteria.\n \n A team successfully transferred the genome of one type of bacteria into a yeast cell, modified it, and then transplanted into another bacterium. \n \n This paves the way to the creation of a synthetic organism - inserting a human-made genome into a bacterial cell. \n \n The team describe the work in the journal Science. \n \n This advance, the researchers say, overcomes the obstacle of making a new inserted genome work inside a recipient cell. \n \n The experiment was carried out by a team that included scientist J Craig Venter, a leading figure in the controversial field of synthetic biology. \n \n Sanjay Vashee, a researcher at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, in the US, was one of the authors. \n \n The resulting cell he and his team created went on to undertake multiple rounds of cell division, to produce a new strain of the modified bacteria. \n \n Dr Vashee explained to BBC News that the work overcame a hurdle in the quest to create a fully synthetic organism. \n \n \"Bacteria have 'immune' systems that protect them from foreign DNA such as those from viruses,\" he explained. \n \n He and his colleagues managed to disable this immune system, which consists of proteins called restriction enzymes that home in on specific sections of DNA and chop up the genome at these points. \n \n Bacteria can shield their own genomes from this process by attaching chemical compounds called methyl groups at the points which the restriction enzymes attack. \n \n The scientists modified the original genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides, whilst it was inside the yeast cell. Then they either attached methyl groups to it, or inactivated the restriction enzyme of the recipient bacterium, before transplanting the genome into its new cell. \n \n One of the team's ultimate aims is to transplant a fully synthetic genome into a bacterial cell - creating bacteria that can be programmed to carry out specific functions - for example, digesting biological material to produce fuel. \n \n Race for life\n \n Researchers at the same institute have already synthesised the complete genome of a bacterium they have called Mycoplasma genitalium. Dr Vashee described this work as a \"logical extension\" of that. \n \n He told BBC News that attempts to create a synthetic bacterium by transplanting M. genitalium into a cell were \"ongoing\". \n \n \"We have as of yet no conclusive proof that we have obtained M. genitalium cells after its genome has been put into various recipient cells,\" he said. \n \n \"[But this] is a major advance in our effort to create a synthetic cell.\" \n \n Dr Vashee continued: \"We were very concerned that the differences between the modifications in... bacterial DNA and [yeast] DNA might be an insurmountable barrier, preventing transplantation into bacteria of genomes that were passed through yeast. \n \n \"Now we know how to do this.\" \n \n Critics have expressed reservations about synthetic biology, and the aim to create what has been widely referred to as artificial life. \n \n Many are concerned that the technology to engineer organisms could end up in the wrong hands. \n \n Dr Vashee concluded: \"Dr Venter and the team at JCVI continue to work with bioethicists, outside policy groups, [politicians], and the public to encourage discussion and understanding about the societal implications of their work and the field of synthetic genomics.\" \n",

As outlined in the BBC article - BBC News - 'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists - Dr Craig Venter and his colleagues have created a bacterial cell that is the first life form to be entirely controlled by synthetic DNA. These particular cells are just copies of existing or \"wild type\" bacteria and the synthetic DNA is not being inserted into synthetic cells but replacing the natural DNA of natural cells. However, this research shows that making a living cell with a synthetic chromosome is possible - a major step towards purely synthetic life and highly significant in its own right. The researchers hope to use this technology to design new bacteria from scratch - cells that could carry out useful functions. However, there are potential risks...\n \n'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists\n By Victoria Gill \n Science reporter, BBC News\n \n Scientists in the US have succeeded in developing the first living cell to be controlled entirely by synthetic DNA. \n \n The researchers constructed a bacterium's \"genetic software\" and transplanted it into a host cell. \n \n The resulting microbe then looked and behaved like the species \"dictated\" by the synthetic DNA. \n \n The advance, published in Science, has been hailed as a scientific landmark, but critics say there are dangers posed by synthetic organisms. \n \n Some also suggest that the potential benefits of the technology have been over-stated. \n \n But the researchers hope eventually to design bacterial cells that will produce medicines and fuels and even absorb greenhouse gases. \n \n The team was led by Dr Craig Venter of the J Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in Maryland and California. \n \n He and his colleagues had previously made a synthetic bacterial genome, and transplanted the genome of one bacterium into another. \n \n Now, the scientists have put both methods together, to create what they call a \"synthetic cell\", although only its genome is truly synthetic. \n \n Dr Venter likened the advance to making new software for the cell. \n \n The researchers copied an existing bacterial genome. They sequenced its genetic code and then used \"synthesis machines\" to chemically construct a copy. \n \n Dr Venter told BBC News: \"We've now been able to take our synthetic chromosome and transplant it into a recipient cell - a different organism. \n \n \"As soon as this new software goes into the cell, the cell reads [it] and converts into the species specified in that genetic code.\" \n \n The new bacteria replicated over a billion times, producing copies that contained and were controlled by the constructed, synthetic DNA. \n \n \"This is the first time any synthetic DNA has been in complete control of a cell,\" said Dr Venter. \n \n 'New industrial revolution' \n \n Dr Venter and his colleagues hope eventually to design and build new bacteria that will perform useful functions. \n \n \"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said. \n \n \"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\" \n \n Dr Venter and his colleagues are already collaborating with pharmaceutical and fuel companies to design and develop chromosomes for bacteria that would produce useful fuels and new vaccines. \n \n But critics say that the potential benefits of synthetic organisms have been overstated. \n \n Dr Helen Wallace from Genewatch UK, an organisation that monitors developments in genetic technologies, told BBC News that synthetic bacteria could be dangerous. \n \n \"If you release new organisms into the environment, you can do more harm than good,\" she said. \n \n \"By releasing them into areas of pollution, [with the aim of cleaning it up], you're actually releasing a new kind of pollution. \n \n \"We don't know how these organisms will behave in the environment.\"\n Dr Wallace accused Dr Venter of playing down the potential drawbacks. \n \n \"He isn't God,\" she said, \"he's actually being very human; trying to get money invested in his technology and avoid regulation that would restrict its use.\" \n \n But Dr Venter said that he was \"driving the discussions\" about the regulations governing this relatively new scientific field and about the ethical implications of the work. \n \n He said: \"In 2003, when we made the first synthetic virus, it underwent an extensive ethical review that went all the way up to the level of the White House. \n \n \"And there have been extensive reviews including from the National Academy of Sciences, which has done a comprehensive report on this new field. \n \n \"We think these are important issues and we urge continued discussion that we want to take part in.\" \n \n Ethical discussions\n \n Dr Gos Micklem, a geneticist from the University of Cambridge, said that the advance was \"undoubtedly a landmark\" study. \n \n But, he said, \"there is already a wealth of simple, cheap, powerful and mature techniques for genetically engineering a range of organisms. Therefore, for the time being, this approach is unlikely to supplant existing methods for genetic engineering\". \n \n The ethical discussions surrounding the creation of synthetic or artificial life are set to continue. \n \n Professor Julian Savulescu, from the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, said the potential of this science was \"in the far future, but real and significant\". \n \n \"But the risks are also unparalleled,\" he continued. \"We need new standards of safety evaluation for this kind of radical research and protections from military or terrorist misuse and abuse. \n \n \"These could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable. The challenge is to eat the fruit without the worm.\" \n \n The advance did not pose a danger in the form of bio-terrorism, Dr Venter said. \n \n \"That was reviewed extensively in the US in a report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Washington defence think tank, indicating that there were very small new dangers from this. \n \n \"Most people are in agreement that there is a slight increase in the potential for harm. But there's an exponential increase in the potential benefit to society,\" he told BBC's Newsnight. \n \n \"The flu vaccine you'll get next year could be developed by these processes,\" he added. \n",
