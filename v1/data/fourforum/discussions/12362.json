   "Apparently, the NAACP doesn't know that President's Day was created to consolidate the celebration of the birthdays of two great Presidents...Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. It is not to honor all Presidents. It is not to honor Presidents that have not proven themselves to be great leaders.\n \n Be careful! Anything and everything said or done to indicate lack of acknowledgment of BHO's greatness will be considered RACISM.\n \n \n \n Obama's picture removed from Peterson's President's Day sign | presidents, obama, commissary - Top Stories - Colorado Springs Gazette, CO\n \n President Barack Obama's picture was removed this week from a Presidents Day sign at the Peterson Air Force Base commissary after customers complained that the image did not fit the holiday commemorating the birthdays of past presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n \n The head of the local NAACP and a commissary employee say it was blatant racism.",
