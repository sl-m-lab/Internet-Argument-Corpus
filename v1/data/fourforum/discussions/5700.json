Having said that I would never gratuitously kill an ant or any living being - not so much its value as a sense that it encourages a sense of inhumanity and a sort of sadism and power-trip...\n\n \n What I have in bold and italic is my exact question. Why doesn't anyone care about an ant dying? If someone wants to perform an abortion, everyone will fight to stop it. If someone like Schiavo requested to die, no one wants her to. They don't know her, they don't know the fetus, and they don't know the ant. Here are my thoughts on the issue.\n \n \n Basically a long time ago we didn't have any laws and it was complete anarchy (this is an assumption). We would fight each other for food, shelter, clothes, and other necessities. Finally we got the idea that if we just worked together we could provide for everyone and not worry about dying (we are also assuming that everyone has an instinct to want to be alive themself). So we decided to set laws saying that no one could kill the others, so murder became wrong. Likewise, the same sort of things happened with stealing, rape, and any other crime. They became wrong because if we did them other people would do them to us so we agree to stop so they will stop. Since we can't communicate with animals such as ants we don't have an agreement with them. If we kill an ant there is no consequence, so we don't think twice. So now after all these millions of years like that with no killing we have ingrained in our heads \"MURDER IS WRONG\". Vengance is still an instinct however so it sort of overrides the murder thought when the death penalty comes in for some people. Because of the reasoning behind our agreement, people decided that the reason they don't kill is they wouldn't want to be killed. So they think of if they were the fetus and they think \"I would want to live\" so they are against abortion. Not many people can put themselves in the shoes of the ants, but we still have some who would never hurt a fly or an ant. This is my theory anyway.\n \n And I would like to hear what your opinion is even if it's not an option on the poll.",

   "Modern_Republic: I think you're missing Adept's point about counters. In this case he's using a counter-argument called \"reductio ad absurdem\", a reduction of an argument to absurdity by proposing a formally equivalent but contradictory statement. \n \n The problem with your argument (rhetorical question really) is that it appeals to an intuition, that we care more about a human baby than two mice. Adept's counter-argument appeals to an intuition as well, that we care more about a favoured dog than a convicted rapist. Your implied conclusion, that a human life is more valuable than an animal's, contradicts Adept's implied conclusion that an animal's life is more valuable than a human's. \n \n Adept's got an interesting point about moral proximity, particularly with regards to the ethic of care as it is discussed here in terms of abortion. The idea of moral proximity is the more distant an action is from us, the less we care about it. Conversely the closer an action is to us, the more we care about it. Many people find this intuitively appealing because they have the intuition that you should treat those closest to you best, that you should accord your comrades a status of moral priviledge. \n \n This moral proximity seems to make sense if we assume, for example, that it is true that you should feed your own starving children first. Obviously there's a problem here if it's to be used to answer the question: \"Why is abortion worse than killing any other living thing?\", because to many people abortions are far more abstractly related to their lives than their pets are. In order to say abortion is worse than killing any other living thing, we need an explanation that doesn't turn on whether we care about things in order to explain their objective value.",

Constitutional rights specifically are almost exclusively developped as a reaction to abuses of power.\n \n Two little curiosities: \n \n In Ancient Rome, right of life was not absolute. The Pater familias had the right to execute his slaves and children and even wives vitae necisque potestas. Even so, the society thrived and the right was rarely used.\n \n In Ancient Rome, you had the provision demanding the execution of deformed children.

It would obviously be the case that those humans that killed other humans adopted the following view of life:\n...the value of a life is subjective, so there is no actual value of a human.\n\n Thus, those humans that killed other humans determined that it was of higher value to rid the world of that particular human than to keep them around. Why should we fault them for making this decision? After all, \nyou can't make a subjective statement that the human's life is worth more than the dog's life.\n\n And neither can you make the subjective statement that a human is better off alive than dead or has a right to remain alive when others wish him to be dead.\n \n \nNot just he thinks, it's fact.

If we are becoming more and more overpopulated by the day (as the question-begging claim you made stated), it wouldn't be because we are gaining one or two more humans than are dying; it would be because we are gaining thousands or tens of thousands more people than the amount that are dying. Thus, feeding one infant to the dogs will do nothing to help the fanciful overpopulation problem you think factually exists.\n \n I will suggest one (actually the only) plausible way to solve the purported (though incorrect) overpopulation problem. We can set some factors that would encompass vast amounts of people (such as skin-color, nationality, eye-color, etc.), gather all who possess these factors into centralized locations, and starve, gas, and burn them to death. This would most certainly solve the population crisis we face today as it would rid the world of millions, tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of resource-taking human beings. This would certainly bring the birth-rate-to-death-rate ratio back into balance. In short, one citing that he saved a puppy instead of a human infant in order to decrease the surplus population is flat out stupid.\n \n When one wishes to save a puppy over a human infant, he shouldn't try to hide behind some false justification. He should just tell us the real reason why he would save the puppy over the human infant. Instead of saying \"I was just trying to help out the overpopulation problem,\" he should say \"Human beings have no value whatsoever, and thus, a human being does not deserve to be treated any better than a dog. Since a human being doesn't have any value, (and certainly no more than a dog) I chose to save the puppy rather than the human because I needed a pet, not a child.\"",
