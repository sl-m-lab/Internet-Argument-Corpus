This is 100% legal. Look in your local paper. If there are guns listed for sale, odds are that you don't need a background check to buy it, unless it is from a dealer. \n \n The proposal to \"close the loophole\" would require that private individuals who sell guns at gun shows do background checks. The legislation that has been attached to the current bill would require that every individual at the show be advised of the brady law and the selling requirements.",

The unlicensed dealers are the ones who sell clothing, videos and other such, and a few of them are private collectors who might sell off a half dozen old guns from their own collection; the type that criminals have no interest in getting since they don't hold enough ammo or aren't made of polymers.\n \n Unlike most people I've actually been to gun shows, I know how they're run and I can tell you that there ARE fully licensed dealers at these events, and there ARE police there too.\n \n The so called \"gun show loophole\" is the fact that there's never been any federal law that keeps private citizens from selling between themselves without involving an FFL dealer or any tracking paperwork. They don't like this because it makes guns impossible to trace between private sales. They want it ended so all guns have to be registered somewhere with someone or another.",
