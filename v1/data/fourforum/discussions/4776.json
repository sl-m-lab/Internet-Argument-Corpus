   "The liberals and certain minorities in Memphis are trying to change the name of Forrest Park and two other Confederate parks in Memphis. The Center City Commision is spear-heading this attempt at re-writing history. They have tried this in the past but always met with failure. Let us hope that these liberal vermin fail again. You cannot change the truth of the past by trying to change the name of a few parks. It is also interesting to note that General Forrest and his wife are buried in Forrest Park under a wonderfull statue of the General on his horse. If you ever come to Memphis, and I don't advise it, you must visit Forrest Park. I have an idea, lets create a museum for liberals. We could call it: The Museum of Left-wing Lunacy.",

He was by the standards of his days one Hell of man. He totally financed his cavalry with personal funds, and never lost a major battle. His brilliant military tactics are studied to this day. He was not a hater of humanity but only did what was required of him. He never allowed his men to slash, burn, pillage and rape like General Grant did. I am convinced that had the South had a few more leaders of his caliber that the outcome of the war of Northern Agression would have been quite different. General Forrest had 13 horses shot out from under him because he was always in the thick of the battle leading his men to victory after victory. He did not die without funds. He had a large plantation in Miss. to tend to after the war was over. The vast majority of his freed slaves chose to remain with him because they loved and respected him.\n Some un-informed people question why the people of the South have so many statues to our heroes of the war of Northern Agression. The answer is quite simple; they fought with valor, honor and great conviction.\n I can assure you that had the South won the war, there would be no Jesse Jacksons, Al Sharptons or other asundry trash stirring up problems in this great nation. There would be no rap/**** music corrupting the morals of our children. There would be NO illegal Mexican immigration problem in America today had the South won.

And I am sorry - but rap hardly holds the dance card on the objectification of women in their music. I rarely see more fashion models than I do in country western and rock videos - at least the rappers have some women who look REAL (you know variety of shapes, sizes and colors). \n \n If you want high standards when it comes to music - you would be hard pressed to do better than Outkast's last album - it is a brilliant fusion of jazz, hip hop, and rap. Or the Black Eyed Peas. \n \n If you are looking for good lyrics - go find a poet (Springsteen, Bono, Dylan) - but if you want music - well that's another matter. Look at Prince - one of the lamest lyricists to walk this planet - but current artists are still trying to catch a piece of the groove he laid out 20 years ago - he is absolute brilliance and I have never seen a better guitar player in my life (granted I have never seen Jimmy Page live). The Red Hot Chili Peppers have some of the raunchiest lyrics to be found - but I could spend my whole life playing their stuff and never get Flea's bass lines right. Oh yummy. Lyrics Schmyrics.

He was a man of great honor and tradition.\n Why don't you read about the battle of Brice's Crossroads, it was one of his greatest victories, just one of many.

Van Horn, an officer of Colored artillery, contained in the Federal Official Records that documented that Union Lt. John D. Hill fired the barracks under orders of the Union commanding officer.

(Mistaking personal opinion for fact.) There are plenty of talented musicians in rap. And you are wrong about what it is. It is voice applied rythmically rather melodically (which is what voice usually is in music). I have heard incredible drums, bass and guitar in rap, and some of the poetry is pretty amazing. I mean, FLEA worte the bass line for \"Bust a Move\" (dumb song) - but what a line. WHen I get that bass line right I will truly consider myself a bass player. sigh...\n \n However, there is planty of garbage in rap, too.\n \n Same as every other musical genre.

   " There was NO massacre at Fort Pillow. \n\n \n \n\n Confederate Gen. Nathan Forrest stormed and captured Fort Pillow on Apr. 12, 1864, killing many African-American defenders. Often called the Fort Pillow Massacre, it became one of the greatest atrocity stories of the Civil War. Charged with ruthless killing, Forrest argued that the soldiers had been killed trying to escape; however, racial animosity on the part of his troops was undoubtedly a factor.\n\n \n \n\n On April 12, 1864, men under the command of General Nathan Forrest, the first leader of the Klu Klux Klan, recaptured Fort Pillow. The fort was occupied by 262 African American and 295 white soldiers. Despite the fact that these men surrendered, Bedford's men massacred the Union soldiers in cold blood burning and burying some alive. President Abraham Lincoln condemned the incident.\n\n \n Hmmm...two encyclopedias state there was a massacre, Hunter claims there wasn't.

If you read the words of the first encyclopedia entry carefully, its very apparent that there wasn't much evidence suggesting a masscre, just a biased opinion that there was one.\n\n \n Well I'll keep quoting encyclopedic sources. How about the esteemed Encyclopedia Britannica:\n \n \n \n \n Fort Pillow Massacre \n \n (April 12, 1864)\n \n In the American Civil War, Confederate slaughter of black Federal troops stationed at Fort Pillow, Tenn. The action stemmed from Southern outrage at the North's use of black soldiers. From the beginning of hostilities, the Confederate leadership was faced with the question of whether to treat black soldiers captured in battle as slaves in insurrection or, as the Union insisted, as prisoners of war. In 1864 Confederate Colonel W.P. Shingler ordered those in his command to take no more black prisoners. \n \n In what proved the ugliest racial incident of the war, Confederate forces under General Nathan B. Forrest captured Fort Pillow on April 12, 1864, and proceeded to wipe out the black troops within; some were burned or buried alive. A Federal congressional investigating committee subsequently verified that more than 300 blacks, including women and children, had been slain after the fort surrendered. After the incident, black soldiers going into battle used the cry \"Remember Fort Pillow!\" Later in the year, the South agreed to treat blacks as prisoners of war. \n\n \n Not to your liking yet? Could it be it is you who carries the bias?\n \n Ask yourself, why did the South change its policy after the massacre? Perhaps they were shamed into it?",

The attack on the fort was for criminally base reasons only: It was peopled by fellow Tennesseeans against the secession, both white neighbors and former black slaves, who were personally known by many of the Rebels. During the slaughter, unarmed Union soldiers on their knees begging for their lives were called out by name, ordered to stand up, and then summarily shot (I guess it wasn't honorable in Forrest's cavalry to shoot a kneeling prisoner). This was payback time for those who disagreed with the Southern cause, and for the black man-especially the black soldier--who had the temerity to fight for his freedom, nothing more.\n \n During the siege, taunting and racial epitaphs spewed from the Confederate side. Forrest claimed he wasn't aware of the animosity of his troops. This is pure garbage. It was the sole reason for being there and IMO the unbounded hatred came from the top down. Lincoln biographer Carl Sandberg described the breeching of the wall and the subsequent massacre this way:\n \n \"Forrest's men were no longer fighting a battle in a war between civilized nations; they were sharing in a race riot, a mass lynching, and the event became an orgy of unleashed primitive human animals riding a storm of anger and vengeance.\"\n \n Apologists for Forrest try to distance him from the carnage by placing him a quarter mile away. It won't do. \n \n Both armies abided by the white flag of truce in order to send messages to the respective commands. A strict code of conduct was to be followed when displaying the flag, including no troop movements during the period. Forrest clearly violated those rules by positioning troops along the riverbank (one of the main objectives of the assault) while flying the flag, and those troops were perfectly positioned to take part in the ensuing massacre.\n \n Forrest's message to the commander of the Union forces was specious. Here it is in full:\n \n Major Booth, Commanding United States Forces, Fort Pillow: Major,--- The conduct of the officers and men garrisoning Fort Pillow has been such as to entitle them to being treated as prisoners of war. I demand the unconditional surrender of this garrison, promising you that you shall be treated as prisoners of war. My men have received a fresh supply of ammunition, and from their present position can easily assault and capture the fort. Should my demand be refused, I cannot be responsible for the fate of your command. Respectfully,\n N.B.Forrest\n \n First, the offer to be treated as prisoners of war did not extend to the black troops, as we have already established in this thread. Secondly, he most certainly MUST be responsible for the fate of their command and his own troops. He cannot relieve himself of that duty. It is this carte blanche statement I believe that turned a blind eye to the ensuing slaughter he knew would occur, and makes him fully responsible.\n \n Fort Pillow may have fell to Forrest, but the war was lost in some part because of it IMO. It so enraged the North that full prosecution of the war was ensured. Lincoln's reelection can be attributed in part to the idiotic, useless assault on the fort. Southern command began to believe they had a loose cannon on their hands in Forrest. It was purely personal motives on Forrest's part to attack: He wished to gain more recruits and thus more glory. The overall Southern strategy was subordinated to that end. All in all, a very poor decision on Nathan Bedford Forrest's part, and which cost the South dearly.\n \n But it matters not.

They had the opportunity to surrender and failed to do so. Your whack and paste job attempting to besmirch General Forrest is just that, a failed attempt.

There is no evidence I am aware of about his thinking on the matter and will gladly stand corrected.\n \n \n Your whack and paste job attempting to besmirch General Forrest is just that, a failed attempt. \n\n \n Could you tell me EXACTLY what you mean by that? What was whacked and pasted specifically?\n \n \nHave you ever even been to Fort Pillow?\n\n \n That has nothing to do with our discussion.\n \n \nI concede only that the War of Northern Agression was won by the Yankees, for now. Your freed slaves.....................never mind, whats the use.\n\n \n Who won the war isn't the topic. Neither is your threat to rekindle it. \n \n From your silence on the issues presented so far, we can assume that you agree:\n \n The fort was of no military use, the attack was a personal vendetta. His men were whipped to a frenzy by the undisguised hatred coming from Forrest himself.\n \n Unarmed men were slaughtered, particularly blacks, and Forrest is fully responsible.\n \n He violated the military code regarding the white flag.\n \n His decision to attack the fort was idiotic, at a huge cost to the Southern war effort.",

   "Billsco, exactly what are you inferring regarding my state of mind? The \"horrid past\" you speak of is America's history, no one can change it and people of your ilk should not try to re-write it.\n Your Freudian slip of calling Gen. Forrest a homophobe could be very interesting, it makes me wonder about you and your mind-set.\n \n \n Here we go again. The allegations against Gen. Forrest and his men concerning a massacre and the shooting of un-armed Federal troops at Fort Pillow was investigated by congress and Gen. Sherman. They were all former enemies of the South and yet, after carefully examining the evidence, found the charges against Gen. Forrest and his men to be without merit. Case closed.\n \n It is important to note that about 80 Colored Federal troopers were captured by men of Gen. Forrest's cavalry and by order of Gen. Forrest, were disarmed and released. Does that sound like a massacre? I think not. Common sense leads me to believe that if Gen. Forrest was the great racist that you are trying to portray him as, he would have immediately killed them, not released them.\n Pardner, you are completely wrong on this issue. Congress has already proven you to be wrong. If the charges against Gen. Forrest and his cavalry were true, I can assure you that Gen. Sherman would have prosecuted them to the fullest extent of the law, not released them.\n Quit trying to re-write history. The facts do not support your position.",

Men like Forrest and Lee felt the states should be allowed to decide issues like slavery on their own. Did you know that Lee was asked by the Union to be the top general before Grant? He didn't turn it down because he was pro-slavery; he turned it down because he felt he needed to serve his state of Virginia. It's hard to understand this today because we think in much more nationalistic terms than they did. But they were very loyal to their states.

Miss Lou Lewis was introduced to General Forrest then presented him with a bouquet of flowers and said: 'Mr. Forrest - allow me to present you this bouquet as a token, of reconciliation, an offering of peace and good will.' \n \n \"General Forrest received the flower with a bow, and replied: \n \n  'Miss Lewis, ladies and gentlemen - I accept these flowers as a token of reconciliation between the white and colored races of the South. \n \n \"All that slave trading by me, and all those mass murders of you blacks done by my men in the Civil War, and that KKK thing-poof!-gone with these flowers.\" \n \n  I accept them more particularly, since they come from a lady, for if there is any one on God's great earth who loves the ladies, it is myself.\n \n Okay. Two sentences into this and he's hitting on the black hostess. Guess he really does love the blacks, hey?\n \n  This is a proud day for me.\n \n (\"Down little Forrest! Get down!\")\n \n  Having occupied the position I have for thirteen years, and being misunderstood by the colored race, I take this occasion to say that I am your friend.\n \n It was a misunderstanding! All those late night KKK raids? Wrong house!\n \n  I am here as the representative of the Southern people - one that has been more maligned than any other.\n \n \"Yes, us Southern boys have been very repressed, but you coloreds wouldn't understand any of that.\" \n \n  I assure you that every man who was in the Confederate army is your friend.\n \n Where is my barf bag?\n \n  We were born on same soil, breathe the same air, live in the same land, and why should we not be brothers and sisters. \n \n \"Just don't you people use the toilet down the hall, I'll need to use it before I go, mmmkay?\" \n \n  When the war broke out I believed it to be my duty to fight for my country, and I did so.\n \n \"I believed it was my duty to keep my slave trading business in the money.\" \n \n  I came here with the jeers and sneers of a few white people, who did not think it right.\n \n Those stupid Northerners.\n \n  I think it is right, and will do all I can to bring about harmony, peace and unity.\n \n \"Oops! Forget that last sentence about the jeers and sneers. HAHA!\"\n \n  I want to elevate every man, and to see you take your places in your shops, stores and but I want you to do as I do - go to the polls and select the best men to vote for.\n \n \"I'll leave you with this list of white men to vote for.\" \n \n  I feel that you are free men, I am a free man, and we can do as we please. I came here as a friend and whenever I can serve any of you I will do so.\n \n This would be a good place for Hunter and Jyoshu to insert all that Forrest did for the blacks after uttering that statement. We will patiently wait.\n \n  We have one Union, one flag, one country; therefore, let us stand together.\n \n \"Me, in front. You people in back. Waaayyy back.\"\n \n  Although we differ in color, we should not differ in sentiment.\n \n \"Just do it my way and I'll call off the KKK.\"\n \n  Many things have been said in regard to myself, and many reports circulated, which may perhaps be believed by some of you, but there are many around me who can contradict them. \n \n Huh?\n \n  I have been many times in the heat of battle - oftener, perhaps, than any within the sound of my voice.\n \n \"You lucky people! We didn't allow you to carry guns and serve. Nuthin' skeert me more that a black man totin' a gun.\"\n \n  Men have come to me to ask for quarter, both black and white, and I have shielded them.\n \n \"Luckily, none of you were there to see the massacre of blacks at Fort Pillow or Brice's Cross Roads.\" \n \n  Do your duty as citizens, and if any are oppressed, I will be your friend.\n \n \"My name is Barney and I'm purple.\" \n \n  I thank you for the flowers, and assure you that I am with you in heart and hand.'\"\n \n \"Oh, Miss Lewis, I'm staying in room 12.\"\n \n \n \n *Mystery Science Theater 3000 was a '90's late night show which played old movies and featured silhouetted aliens in the front row adding one-liners and zingers.",

   "I still stand by my assessment, even for the chaotic command structure of that era the situation at fort Pillow shows a breakdown in the control forrests command had over his troops. Tactically Forrest was a good general, especially considering his military training (or lack thereof). He understood manuever warfare even during its infancy, and like Buford of the North used dismounted cavalry to devastating effect. At the same time however, the man was not flawless and his decision to attack the fort, (even using the reasoning that he was discouraging northern recruiting in the region, and promoting his own.) was ultimately the greatest faux pas (sp) of his career.\n As far as his involvement in the kkk one article I found actually states that he ordered it disbanded but it was out of control at that point. Other accounts are also presented that hint both ways. Regardless it is a historically contested issue and therefore I don't believe I can draw an absolute conclusion in his involvement. The only conclusion I can come to is that Forrest was fairly in line with the political and social views with the majority of southerners at that time (and many northerners), and that indicates at least some level of racism and prejeduce toward blacks. Should the park change its name? I don't believe so as it is his resting place but at the same time any museum or memorial should present his history as unbiased and show both his merits and flaws.",

It's more than we can say for the Democrat's 'honorable' senator Robert Byrd, whom would have to have the same stones thown at him that you are throwing at Forrest if consistency means anything to you . . . (Ahem)\n \n People make mistakes--even you I'm sure. Welcome to the human race.\n\n \n Forrest instilled in the KKK his personality: a rabid hatred of blacks. You should read this thread, and if I'm wrong refute it.\n \n And why you think I'd defend Byrd or why you make the erroneous assumption that I'm a Democrat is beyond me. Your falling for Hunter's contribution to this thread, which can be summarized as this: Damned liberals.",

   "I still stand by my assessment, even for the chaotic command structure of that era the situation at fort Pillow shows a breakdown in the control forrests command had over his troops. Tactically Forrest was a good general, especially considering his military training (or lack thereof). He understood manuever warfare even during its infancy, and like Buford of the North used dismounted cavalry to devastating effect. At the same time however, the man was not flawless and his decision to attack the fort, (even using the reasoning that he was discouraging northern recruiting in the region, and promoting his own.) was ultimately the greatest faux pas (sp) of his career.\n\n \n I would say the greater point here is that NO one is flawless, and it's easy to pick and choose moments of mistake in an historical figure's life and claim he was a monster when he was probably, at most, a human being conflicted about his feelings as so many people were at that time. Again, take Sen. Robert Byrd of today--if one man's life is going to be totally judged as akin to that of the worst terrorist in the world because of KKK involvement, people should be banging down the doors of Congress to have Sen. Byrd removed. One of the halmarks of the human race is that we do understand people make bad judgements at times in their lives. Both Sen. Byrd of today and Gen. Forrest of the 19th century gave indication they regretted their attributions to the KKK. I see no reason why we should only forgive one and not the other, even if Forrest died many years ago.\n \n I think the real problem here is that people like Bilsco and Georged like to take their prejudice and bigotry against southerners and wrap it in faux indignation, as if their motivation was really to be appalled by a past racist general instead of taking a shot at southerners. Of course Forest was racist--few people were not racist back then. Heck, the same still applies today in many cases.",

Most of the people of that era are either dead or elderly and I see a big movement away from the point of view that they held. \n The fact remains however that racism is very interwound with the history of the Souths institutions (moreso than the north, though we have our share of shame as well.) and no ammount of revision from either side should try to downplay or overexaggerate it.",
