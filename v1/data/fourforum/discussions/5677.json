   "Creationists can never succinctly define what they mean when they sue the word \"kind\" as in a Biblical \"kind.\"\nIt isn't that they can't, they usually go to extremes to duck the question. However, various creationist sources have defined \"kind\" as equivalent to the biological classification of species, genus, and sometimes even family. Most educated creationists have realized that the definition of \"kind\" at the most intuitive level, the species, turns the story of the ark to nonsense, and start moving the definition up to higher taxonomic levels.\n \nThey say that there can even be variation within a kind, a sort of Biblical evolutionary theory, whereby species develop within the broader \"kind\" classifiacation.\nYes. But that means that the cat \"kind\", a single pair, produced 4 genera with 36 species in, at most, a couple hundred years. And that doesn't even include domestic cats. It makes the head of any evolutionary biologist spin! Creationists who wish to deny evolution invoke hyperevolution for thousands of \"kinds\" to yield millions of species in hundreds of years. And yet, they deny evolution.\n \nI'm sure this has been asked before, but are humans of the ape kind or are apes of the human kind?\nWell, man has been called the third chimpanzee. Cladistics is some decades old now, and it has suplanted the old Linean system. While discoveries are still assigned genus and species names, evaluation of morphological charisteristics by computer yield much more realistic evolutionary trees.\n \nIn Genesis, humans are created seperately from all other creatures, but apes and monkeys are not specifically mentioned.\nBut on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document.

Did 5000 kinds that subsequently underwent rapid evolution? Did the gorillas come from the line of Shem, orangs from the line of Ham, and chimps from the line of Japheth? It had to be that way. \n \n Antedeluvian humans (of the more general human kind) were a lot more hairy then and very huge and strong (strong enough to build the titanic ark).

They will say there is a canine kind, to which dogs and wolves belong, and maybe one or two other obvious ones like felines, but that's the greatest commitment I've ever seen.\nActually, the debate on this one was hard to miss 8 or 9 years ago. John Woodmorappe, in his book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, Inst for Creation Research (July 1, 1996), 298 pp., ISBN: 0932766412 did exactly that. Essentially Woodmorappe equated \"kinds\" to genus in most cases, with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he couldn't make all of them fit. Woody came up with 15,754 \"kinds\", and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them. He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size. Of course, he leaves off all plants, arthropods, mollusks, fish, and aquatic mammals. I don't recall if he included the dinosaurs, but Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark.\n \n You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a \"dog king\" and a \"cat kind\" from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood. Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera, not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred. In order to cram all the \"kinds\" on the ark, creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds (without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year), and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy, calling it \"variation in kind.\"\n \n It should also be noted that \"John Woodmorappe\" is a pen name of Jan Peczkis, a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science. Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe, Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature. At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity (one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department. Radiometric Dating, Paleosols and the Geologic Column). If he consulted a lawyer, I'm sure that he was laughed out of the office, since you can't sue someone for slander if what they say is true.\n \n A review of Woodmorappe's book and other interesting links can be found at Talk Origins. You can buy the book at amazon.com for $44.50.\n \nIf anyone claims to be a Scientific creationist I bring this up, and ask why no one has done the science of actually sorting out the kinds. This doesn't make them happy.\nI'm surprised that no one has ever mentioned the book before. Even though there is nothing but ad hoc answers to the questions, creationists touted the book as \"proof\" that Noah's ark was possible. They never seem to notice that no one has ever tried to build and float an ark. They prefer to put the money into creation museums and amusement parks.",
