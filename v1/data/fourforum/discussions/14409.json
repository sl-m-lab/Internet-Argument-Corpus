   "Quote:\n Aug. 1, 1966: Charles Whitman \n \n\n \n Would have been a lot worse if everyone had of been disarmed. Back then everyone had a selection of guns. I was there slipping bullets through the holes used to drain the parapet. On the way back to college for two a days (football practice that the best I recall started about the 4 of August)..had an old model 8 Remington automatic in .32 caliber.\n \n Lots of others joined in and kept him pinned down when it was figured out what was going on and where he was.\n \n Back then the cops were armed mostly with just handguns and that firepower provided by armed citizens was an immense help. That guy was an Marine with a brain tumor and other psychological problems. Believe me, the cops were happy for the extra help from armed citizens. That was also before the GCA of '68 was passed supposedly as a \"presidential protection act\" which didn't amount to much except an attempt in the mid 1970s to \"register purchase of ammo\" which didn't amount to a hill of beans and was quickly dropped as being useless. It was about this time that hucksters like yourselves found out they could make a buck from the unwitting people who actually believed all the lies and propaganda. The guy that started it was a fraud and huckster who previously promoted some wildlife protection of wolves but went to easier pickings of gun control after a pet wolf of his nearly ate his face off on a national t.v. fundraiser promotion. I can think of no one involved in these early charades who weren't fakes, frauds and phoney and even some like twice convicted felon, Mario Biaggi. It hasn't changed much over the years.\n \n Now, their worst dream has come to pass and the last hanger ons keep puking up the rotten mantra they have always used. The only reason they preyed on ignorant folks was to make a quick buck...those days are over and so are you.\n \n The only foks who support wildlife is hunters, people with guns who voted themselves for a 10% and 11% tax on hunting supplies, guns and ammo and archery which is collected and divided amoung the States for wildlife habitat and hunting. The bird watchers don't pay doodly squat to enjoy what the hunters and gun purchasers provide for wildlife habitat. They collect fees from unsuspecting people who do not know it is hunters who support land aquisitions, parks and wildlife management from hunting license and guns, ammo and archery supplies. What is collected from the 'save the blank' goes into someones' pockets never to be seen again. The Pittman-Robertson and Pope and Young taxes are payments collected at a federal level and returned to the States. It was never intended for your jogging enjoyment or some park to take over and promote your agenda which you contribute nothing to! They rightly belong to the gun owners and hunters which paid for them.\n \n Believe me, no one will suffer when things return to normal before the first GCA was passed, in fact it will be much better. It is a serious crime to deprive some one of their rights, civil rights that you have proudly championed. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!",

That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society.

   "Interesting....confirms everything I learned on \"The Wire\" haha.\n\n \n Like Bellesiles, you find what you look for :)\n \n \nCCW in Texas: 10 years later \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Concealed Handgun Law: Ten Years Later \n \n Published: 1/6/2006\n \n By Commissioner Jerry Patterson\n \n When the Texas Concealed Handgun Law took effect in 1996, pundits and naysayers predicted anarchy. Any minute, there would surely be mass violence as armed Texas citizens began roving the streets settling arguments with gunfire. Certainly, several proclaimed, within a year there would be blood in the streets as Texas returned to the days of the Wild West. \n \n Ten years later the facts paint a different picture. Texas under the Concealed Handgun Law isn't the Wild West, but the Mild West. No recurrent shootouts at four-way stops, no blood in the streets. Quite the contrary, Texans are safer than before.\n \n But why are we safer? Why did the fears of the naysayers fail to materialize?\n \n One of the reasons I authored Senate Bill 60, the Concealed Handgun Law, was because I trust my fellow Texans. Contrary to opinions expressed on almost every editorial page across the state, I knew that when law-abiding Texans' constitutional right to keep and bear arms was restored with the passage of S.B. 60, they would exercise good judgment and behave responsibly.\n \n Ten years later, and the statistics continue to prove the point.\n \n Since the passage of the Concealed Handgun Law, the FBI Uniform Crime Report shows an 18% drop in handgun murders, down from 838 in 1995 to 688 in 2004. And a 13% drop in handgun murders per 100,000 population, down from 4.5 murders per 100,000 Texans in 1995 to 3.95 per 100,000 in 2004.\n \n In 2000, on the fifth anniversary of the Concealed Handgun Law, the National Center for Policy Analysis issued a report that indicated Texans with concealed carry permits are far less likely to commit a serious crime than the average citizen.\n \n According to the report, the more than 200,000 Texans licensed to carry a concealed firearm are much more law-abiding than the average person. \n \n The report illustrated that Texans who exercise their right to carry firearms are 5.7 times less likely to be arrested for a violent offense. They are 14 times less likely to be arrested for a non-violent offense. And they are 1.4 times less likely to be arrested for murder.\n \n H. Sterling Burnett, a senior policy analyst at the NCPA and the author of the report, concluded:\n \n \"Many predicted that minor incidents would escalate into bloody shootouts if Texas passed a concealed-carry law. That prediction was dead wrong,\" Burnett said.\n \n With 247,345 concealed handgun licenses active in Texas as of December 2005, the number of law-abiding licensees has had a positive effect on the crime rate. \n \n Texas Department of Public Safety Uniform Crime Report indicates the overall crime rate in Texas has continued to drop over the past 10 years. In 1997, DPS reported 5,478 crimes per 100,000 Texans, based on a population of 19,355,427 Texans. In 2004, with almost 3 million more Texans, the crime rate is 5,032 per 100,000.\n \n The effect of the Concealed Handgun Law has been so positive, it has converted some of its most outspoken initial critics.\n \n John Holmes, former Harris County district attorney, wrote to me several years after the passage of the law.\n \n \"As you know, I was very outspoken in my opposition to the passage of the Concealed Handgun Act. I did not feel that such legislation was in the public interest and presented a clear and present danger to law abiding citizens by placing more handguns on our streets,\" Holmes wrote. \"Boy was I wrong. Our experience in Harris County, and indeed state-wide, has proven my initial fears absolutely groundless.\"\n \n Glenn White, president of the Dallas Police Association, shared this view. \"I lobbied against the law in 1993 and 1995 because I thought it would lead to wholesale armed conflict. That hasn't happened,\" White told the Dallas Morning News. \"All the horror stories I thought would come to pass didn't happen. No bogeyman.

The article, found here, concludes that such laws are generally beneficial.\n \n The article, written by Carlisle Moody and Thomas Marvell, rebuts the 2003 article in the Stanford Law Review by Ian Ayres and John Donohue.

Here is what the facts are. It was highly reported that their were 250 million guns in the U.S. Citizens hands before the implementation of the Brady Background checks started. \n \n Since then,  Total NICS Firearm Background Checks -- November 30, 1998 - June 30, 2010 \n Total = 116,108,699 \n\n That equals a lot more guns in American Citizen's hands. \n \n The USDOJ reports   Serious violent crime levels declined since 1993. see graph. \n   Key Facts at a Glance Violent crimes\n 1993 = 4,190,000 \n 2007 = 1,613,100 \n\n   Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008 \n 1991 Violent crime rate = 758.2 Murder rate = 9.8 \n 1999 Violent crime rate = 523 \n 2007 Violent crime rate = 466.9 \n 2008 Violent crime rate = 454.5 Murder rate = 5.4 \n\n   For Release May 24, 2010 \n Preliminary figures indicate that, as a whole, law enforcement agencies throughout the Nation reported a decrease of 5.5 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention for 2009 when compared with figures reported for 2008.   New decline in our Murder rate = -7.2  \n\n So what we can clearly say is that the large increase in the number of guns in citizens hands, and the large number of Concealed Carry permits in the hands of citizens, did not lead to an increase crime! \n \n \nAnswer that and ask this same question in the next post and I'd be happy to answer.\n\n Also, while you are at it, please tell us what this means. \n I'm actually all for gun ownership \n \n I was once told by an extreme Anti-gunner that she believed in the 2nd Amendment.

Restricting where you can use guns is constitutional and I agree again (for example restricting it from school grounds). Things like waiting periods, number of guns you can buy at a time, registration, etc are questionably constitution in my mind...mainly because I haven't researched it much.

MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.

These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time. .\n\n Not that I want a grenades, but I wonder how they are going to reconcile Miller with our Incorporated, Inalienable Right.",

   "Lott also fabricated data in his book, More Guns Less Crime:\n \n \nLott claimed that 98% of defensive gun uses required only brandishing the gun, originally citing national polls. Lott later cited Gary Kleck as his source. In 2000, Lott later claimed that the number was based on his own survey, not Kleck. Lott claimed the survey was done over three months in 1997, but he first cites it in February 1997. Lott also failed to mention his study when asked by a reporter about it in 1999.\n \n Lott cannot provide details of the survey, saying he lost all his data in a hard drive crash. When asked for funding records or other evidence, Lott said he paid for the project himself, used volunteers students, had them make calls from their own phones, and did not discuss the survey design with anyone else. Lott says he can't remember the names of the volunteers. Meanwhile, nine published surveys showed between 21% and 67% of gun uses required shooting (far more than the 2% Lott suggests).\n \n In fact, the only evidence Lott can provide is that a couple colleagues vaguely remember him mentioning such a survey.\n \n All this has led even extreme conservatives like Michelle Malkin to suggest Lott never conducted the survey. But even if Lott did conduct such a survey, it was unethical of him to cite other sources for the number and continue to publicly cite its results after all of the original evidence had been lost.\n \n\n John Lott - SourceWatch",

   "This guy gets it, why doesn't Doc?\n The American Spectator : More Handguns, Less Crime -- or More?\n \n \nIn 2004, a National Academy of Sciences panel -- which included econometrics superstar Steven Levitt -- similarly failed to find convincing evidence that right-to-carry laws or other forms of gun control either reduce or increase crime. (Panelist James Q. Wilson dissented.)\n .......\n And where does the debate about the more-guns-less-crime theory stand today? Right where it was five, maybe even ten or more years ago. Half the time, not even the names have changed. Ayres and Donohue released a paper just last year called \"More Guns Less Crime Fails Again\" (pdf). Ludwig, frequently with co-author Philip Cook, still writes about how guns don't make crime go down. And of course, the new material in Lott's third edition includes another round of responses to his critics. He says that no peer-reviewed study has found an increase from RTC, but even he [Lott] concedes the following: \"Not too surprisingly, depending on the precise methods used and the exact data set, the results have varied. Some claim no effect from these laws.\"\n \n With the econometricians still going back and forth after more than a decade, there's really no way for everyday citizens to choose sides -- as much as we may want to, and as much as activist organizations might urge us to. And as the National Academies panel suggested, it may be that econometric techniques are not precise enough to settle this debate, no matter how long we let the professionals fight it out. \n .....\n  The results Lott presents for Chicago are no more conclusive. Chicago banned guns in 1983, yet its murder rate held remarkably steady for six years before and after that point -- about three times the national average from 1977 through 1989. There was a spike in 1990, after which point the rate settled at about four times the national average -- murder fell in Chicago in the 1990s, but not as much as it did in the rest of the country (most notably Giuliani's New York). Again, there's no evidence that the ban had any dramatic effect in either direction.\n \n Regarding Ireland and Jamaica, Lott presents only raw murder-rate data, with no comparisons to similar countries. Both banned guns in the early '70s, and both experienced significant increases in murder thereafter, but because crime rose in many countries in the '70s, it's hard to prove a cause-effect relationship.\n \n It's also worth noting that the international gun-ban comparisons Lott has used most often in the past -- Great Britain and Australia -- are downplayed here. Great Britain's 1997 handgun ban gets a mention; Lott notes that gun-crime-related deaths and injuries skyrocketed from 1998 to 2005 and asserts that \"rates of serious violent crime, armed robberies, rapes, and homicides have soared.\" He does not note that last year, the murder rate for England and Wales hit a 20-year low.\n \n Meanwhile, Australia banned most firearms in 1996, and Lott in the past has noted (pdf) that violent crime -- not so much murder, but especially armed robbery -- rose thereafter. But the country's name appears nowhere in the new material or the index here, and for good reason: Homicide is at near-record lows there, and armed robbery has come down significantly since its peak at the turn of the century, suggesting that the previous increase may have been a natural fluctuation, not an enduring result of the gun ban.\n \n If gun bans do anything to increase or decrease crime, the effect isn't dramatic enough to show up in these overall trends. \n \n",

   "Correlation is what matters and that doesn't exist. I can name numerous things that happened during that same period, it doesn't mean they related. I've posted numerous studies and the most recent and convincing arguments show more guns doesn't equal less crime. The stats on Conceal and Carry for Texas are very convincing IMO. Crime went down but less than the national average and LESS than states that DID NOT have conceal and carry. Furthermore, an independent panel refuted Lott's, at least 6 other researchers refuted Lott's, even Lott's now admits the data is not totally conclusive. Any conclusion beyond \"it isn't conclusive either way\" (towards less crime that is) is just delusional at best.\n\n \n What exactly leads you to conclude six other reasearchers 'refuted Lott\"? Cook and Ludwig were hired to do a hit job and came to a startling conclusion that Lott was right that DGUs exist maybe even more than Lott suggested. Kleck and Gertz also had vindicating conclusions. The DOJ also had pleasant news. If you were honest, you wouldn't be searching for biased material in the first place to try to diminish an unalienable right. Your attempt to curry favor and an audience by the pretense of being \"one of us\" has just reached the end for you. Trying to qualify attacks on me is simply a mark of your bias and vindicativeness and only makes you that much smaller. :)\n \n Levitt made the claims common to the gun grabber .orgs about \"Mary Roush\" and Lott's material being printed without peer review in a magazine. Lott successfully sued Levitt when it turned out he was part of the review panel.\n \n There is not one study that dismisses DGUs. They only vary in number between 100,000 and 2.5 million per year. It is unnecessasary to address star gazers two cents that the results must equal 100% to be valid. \n \n [QUOTEOh good grief, I thought you were different from Doc. Can you show me the panel for the National Academy of Sciences are anti-gun?[/QUOTE]\n \n That panel was hand picked and nominated by Clinton who was then President. I suppose he got a surprise :)\n \n \nCan you show the numerous studies on the subject being biased by anti-gunners, what about our friend from The American Spectator? Honestly, get a better argument than that. A smell a \"guilt by association\" fallacy coming on...don't let it happen.\n\n \n Isn't that the same arguement anti gun orgs use to try to define Lott since he is funded by the Olin Foundation? Then you claim .orgs funded by the anti gun Joyce Foundation have no bias? I expected better from you.\n \n \nThe truth is, studies show no correlation. THAT is true science. you've seen the studies, you've seen the stats. NO CORRELATION EXISTS.\n\n \n NVCS AND NDCS do not dispute the DGU correlation. The difference in the questions asked and method of counting are the only thing in dispute. Same applies to the sudies, of which none have been done save the new book out by John Lott. Your own source certifies his availability of research methods and sharing of all data by anyone who asks. If you are still in dispute on DGUs you are not in good company. \n \n \nHonestly, I wasn't going to bring this up but since you keep pushing it...the question is loaded. \"recent studies in some states have\n already reflected?\". Come on...can nobody see this objectively? And who cares anyway if 100% of police chiefs feel that way. It still doesn't make it true. We call that an appeal to authority fallacy. You quoted me where I said \"science\" and \"stats\" meaning true evidence. What you present is opinion with no evidence.\n\n \n So your appeal to the panels authority by qualifying it is loaded is not biased? Again, you gripe about the outcome of a couple of Supreme Court cases identifying the individual and fundamental right to keep and bear arms not withstanding 35 other Supreme Court rulings on the subject and you are still in the stone age trying to ressurect survey materials as if they have any context at all? That blows you correlation theory to bits! You and star gazer are stuck hopelessly in the stone age.\n \n \nIf I'm found correct than it makes gun supports like Doc seem like liars and thus less credible. If someone was going around saying conceal and carry causes substantially MORE crime would it be ok for them to do that because it advances the anti-gun agenda? That is basically what you are arguing.\n\n \n The fact you are still here is evidence you didn't try to kick in any doors last night as challenged so who is the liar? You don't even buy your own poop. You haven't been vindicated...NO. There is no credible study focusing on DGUs that dispute their existence nor that a gun or any weapon increases your odds against crime and rape. The panel comes down pretty hard on the Kellerman claims. That alone takes one of the 3 options of you being correct away from your claims of validation :) \n \n \nI'm saying stick with the facts.\n\n \n The facts are that 48 States have adopted a form of carry by citizens. The Court reaffirmed this right. You can make claims till the world ends and call them facts but I doubt you will alter the Constitution.\n Oh, and thanks for discussing the articles from CDC and NAS which shows NO BENEFIT in any gun control laws, that is the fact.",

In other words, Lott (from the research prior to 2004 at least) was wrong to conclude as he did. More Guns = Less Crime is not true as you claim. \n \n \nMAJOR CONCLUSIONS\n \n Empirical research on firearms and violence has resulted in important findings that can inform policy decisions. In particular, a wealth of descriptive information exists about the prevalence of firearm-related injuries and deaths, about firearms markets, and about the relationships between rates of gun ownership and violence. Research has found, for example, that higher rates of household firearms ownership are associated with higher rates of gun suicide, that illegal diversions from legitimate commerce are important sources of crime guns and guns used in suicide, that firearms are used defensively many times per day, and that some types of targeted police interventions may effectively lower gun crime and violence. This information is a vital starting point for any constructive dialogue about how to address the problem of firearms and violence.\n \n While much has been learned, much remains to be done, and this report necessarily focuses on the important unknowns in this field of study. The committee found that answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods, however well designed. For example, despite a large body of research, the committee found no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime, and there is almost no empirical evidence that the more than 80 prevention programs focused on gun-related violence have had any effect on children's behavior, knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs about firearms. The committee found that the data available on these questions are too weak to support unambiguous conclusions or strong policy statements.\nFirearms and Violence: A Critical Review",

In particular, a wealth of descriptive information exists about the prevalence of firearm-related injuries and deaths, about firearms markets, and about the relationships between rates of gun ownership and violence. Research has found, for example, that higher rates of household firearms ownership are associated with higher rates of gun suicide, that illegal diversions from legitimate commerce are important sources of crime guns and guns used in suicide, that firearms are used defensively many times per day, and that some types of targeted police interventions may effectively lower gun crime and violence. This information is a vital starting point for any constructive dialogue about how to address the problem of firearms and violence. BREAK\n \n That takes away your claim that firearms are not used for DGUs and that indeed the police interventions \"may\" lower gun crime? and violence. This isn't a biased statement by differential separation of just gun crime vs. any crime but includes violence? It reeekssssss but they still have noted that DGUs are used defensively many times a day. It was noted by myself that the fact was evident, the arguement was exactly how many :) ...and you are po'd because John Lott is right :)\n \n \n Back to the quote that didn't show up on the quote reply below:\n \n While much has been learned, much remains to be done, and this report necessarily focuses on the important unknowns in this field of study. The committee found that answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods, however well designed. For example, despite a large body of research, the committee found no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime, and there is almost no empirical evidence that the more than 80 prevention programs focused on gun-related violence have had any effect on children's behavior, knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs about firearms. The committee found that the data available on these questions are too weak to support unambiguous conclusions or strong policy statements. \n \n Although they acknowledged that DGUs happen MANY times each day. :) Uh, huh...so carrying a concealed gun all the time would increase the interval level of DGUs or decrease it? If you don't see the brass in this crud you don't have no eyes.\n \n You know something stevie, you could do a better job in a nice cool place than keep beating yourself up here in front of the whole membership of this board by seeking seclusion and arguing with yourself. You would most likely be a lot happier than to keep taking the lumps :) Your choice.",

First this is all old data, even long before Heller was decided. Now since McDonald incorporated and appled that right of \"shall not be infringed\" to the States and local governments as soon as the opinion was released, your point (whatever it may be) is mute, it is over the decision is final.

It no longer applies as it is a DEAD ISSUE.\n \n It is insane to pretend that people do not have a right to any gun or as much ammo as they want. More guns is the law of the land. Even last year a Sacremento Sheriff confirmed the importance of more guns to protect against crime. You would like to ignore the police opinions and sheriffs' opinions but you can't ; you dispise any authority even from your own professors and I don't plan on beating a dead horse with you, already done that and your own quotes are against you. You are more like a grade school kid standing arguing with another kid saying \"did so\" and the other saying \"did not\". I do not plan on building your self esteem, you are not worthy of debate and you have proved it. What you desire you will not get from me; your low self-esteem is noxious and without merit. I have spent 3 days disputing everything you said with your own \"proof\". People will judge this thread and your positions and \"proof\". You are admitting defeat and want to continue by trying to modify your position and avoid previous mistakes. Pound Sand.\n \n The Sheriff said this last year: \n \nMore Concealed Weapon Permits Possible - Sacramento News Story - KCRA Sacramento\n \n \n Faced with the potential loss of 300 deputies due to budget cuts, the Sacramento County sheriff may consider issuing more concealed weapons permits.... \n \n \"With the anticipated decrement in patrol staffing, and the resultant potential for inadequate patrol officer staffing, I will have to reconsider the criteria for issuance of CCWs [concealed weapons permits]. Nothing is etched in stone, but as circumstances change, we need to address public safety in an environment with too few patrol officer positions to meet traditional expectations,\" [Sacramento County Sheriff John] McGinness said in a statement.\n \n Currently, only about 260 people in Sacramento County carry concealed weapons and their required permits.\n \n \"I have to be open to the potential that there will be more people in need of the ability to protect themselves as individuals,\" McGinness said....\n \n It doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement of concealed carry by citizens - but it does sound like an acknowledgment that people may need guns in public when the police aren't there to help them. And it of course raises the question: Even if no police officer is laid off, wouldn't there still be plenty of \"people in need of the ability to protect themselves as individuals\" for those times when they're attacked and no police officer is present?\n \n\n \n You lay it open and let everyone else roll you up in a soccor ball and kick you around. I'm embarassed by your behavior and unrealistic claims bordering on the ridiculous. You are shotgun wadding now and there is little left to be said :)",

That appears to be what is going on with a Clinton administration-inspired National Academy of Sciences study Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review bearing the innocuous title of \"Improving Research Information and Data on Firearms,\" which opens its formal hearings on Thursday\n\n \n \nAccording to the NAS, \"The goals of this study are to\n \n 1.) assess the existing research and data on firearm violence; \n 2.) consider how to credibly evaluate the various prevention, intervention and control strategies;\n 3.) describe and develop models of illegal firearms markets; and \n 4.) examine the complex ways in which firearms may become embedded in the community.\" \n \n Conspicuously absent from these goals is any research into the benefits of firearms becoming \"embedded\" in communities, as demonstrated by the research of scholars like John Lott of the American Enterprise Institute and Gary Kleck of Florida State University.\n \n Most of the people selected for the panel have reputations as good scholars, but none of them have specialized in firearms policy. Most of them have reputations as being antigun. Steven Levitt, has been described as \"rabidly antigun.\"\n \n The panel also includes former Jimmy Carter Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti - a long-time antigun advocate, and a strong supporter of America's leading gun-prohibition group, Handgun Control, Inc. (formerly known as \"the National Council to Control Handguns,\" and recently renamed \"The Brady Campaign\"). \n \n The closest that anyone on the panel gets to not being entirely antigun is James Q. Wilson - a distinguished scholar (but no specialist in gun policy), who has said that most gun control doesn't work, but who expresses almost no concern for the rights of legitimate gun owners who are harmed by ineffective laws, and who supports high-tech spy cameras to find people carrying guns. (Notwithstanding the fact that handgun carrying is legal in 33 states by statewide law, and is allowed in many of the rest, on a county by county basis.)\n \n The NAS study will receive $109,000 from the prohibitionist Joyce Foundation, which lavishly funded the Chicago-Kent Law Review's one-sided anti-Second Amendment symposium last year, and which has contributed generously to gun-prohibition groups. It is a fair inference that the Joyce Foundation thinks that the panel is very likely to produce results that will advance its mission. Other funders are the Centers for Disease Control (which was the main funder for antigun junk science, until Congress cut off funding in 1995), and the David & Lucile Packard Foundation, which is also a contributor to antigun groups. Just imagine what gun-control advocates would say if a government study were funded by the NRA or the Scaife Foundation.\n \n The panel is supposed to propose \"new...control strategies.\" The idea of repealing \"control strategies\" which social scientists have proven to be failures isn't on the agenda. Nor is there any agenda for \"strategies\" to improve public safety by fostering gun ownership and carrying by law-abiding people - even though social-science data from John Lott and others overwhelmingly show that this strategy really does reduce crime.\n \n The reading packets which have been prepared for the committee are rife with antigun junk science. The committee members find material applauding the study claiming that Seattle and Vancouver are demographically similar (although the latter has virtually no blacks or Hispanics) and that gun control is the reason for Vancouver's lower homicide rate (even though Seattle whites have a lower homicide rate than Vancouver whites, and difference in homicide rates between the two cities is strongly correlated to Seattle's black and Hispanic population).\n \n The committee reading packets contain fulsome praise not only for the Dr. Arthur Kellermann's Seattle/Vancouver junk-science article, but for many of the rest of his junk-science productions, like the claim that owning a gun triples the risk of being murdered (even though hardly any of Kellermann's murder victims were killed with a gun from their own home, and a significant number of the murder \"victims\" were lawfully killed by police, and the whole factoid disappears once you account for the true rates of gun ownership among the \"control group\" of people who weren't murdered).\n \n Or the ludicrous study claiming that Washington, D.C.'s 1976 handgun ban reduced homicide - [U]even though homicide in the soared to national record levels after the ban was enacted, while nearby Baltimore (which didn't ban handguns) had no such catastrophic increase[U]. It turns out the \"decline\" in D.C. homicides was created by pretending that the low-homicide years of 1975-76 were the products of the 1976 handgun ban, which was put into place in the last quarter of 1976 through February 1977. \n \n Not one sentence in any of the official materials prepared for the committee criticizes any gun-control law. The committee members were not given even one of the many social-science articles detailing the failures of various gun-control laws.\n \n **The NAS study was originally planned during the Clinton administration, and the study outline and panel makeup ensure that it will produce a properly Clintonian outcome - just in time for the Democrats to use against President Bush in the 2004 elections.** Rather than go along with this time-bomb strategy, President Bush should send the NAS back to the drawing board, to come up with a study that also examines the benefits, not just the costs, of firearms, and that does so with a panel containing scholars on all sides of the issue. There is no reason to allow the National Academy of Sciences to be hijacked to advance a partisan political agenda through a stacked panel that will address artificially narrow subjects. \n \n If the Bush administration and the National Academy of Sciences value honest research, and value the reputation of the National Academy, they will see that this study is either canceled, or reconstituted in a fair and balanced fashion, so that scholars can challenge each other. The panel should still include scholarly gun-control advocates like Levitt, **but there's no reason for the panel to include people like Civiletti, who have no social-science expertise. And the funding for a National Academy of Sciences study ought to come exclusively from the federal government, not from prohibitionist foundations.**\n \n The first meeting of the proposed study group is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday, August 30-31. After that, it will become increasingly difficult to change the course of this study, however ill conceived.\n \n \n\n \n \n \n DOJ, Justice Department: Gun Violence Falls 63%\n By Jim Kouri, CPP\n MichNews.com\n Mar 17, 2005\n \n \n \n \n \nFirearms Violence 200% Higher for Blacks Than For Whites\n \n In spite of all the hoopla regarding gun violence in America, a study by the US Department of Justice appears to dispel claims of rising gun deaths. The government study received minimal if any mainstream media attention.\n \n Estimates from the National Crime Victimization Survey indicate that between 1993 and 2001 approximately 26% of the average annual 8.9 million violent victimizations were committed by offenders armed with a weapon. About 10%, or 846,950 victimizations each year, involved a firearm.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n NONE of the studies included Kleck's exhaustive studies in the area of benefits of gun ownership and use:\n \n GUNS AND PUBLIC HEALTH: EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE OR PANDEMIC OF PROPAGANDA?\n \n \n \n \n\n \n B. Fraudulent Suppression of the Decline\n in Accidental Child Gun Death\n To help promote their gun control agenda, health advocate sages have long harped on the emotionally charged issue of child death by gun accident.[224] Multiple reasons dictate their failure to acknowledge the steep decline in such tragedies. Admitting the decline would, in and of itself, undercut their political agenda. Worse, it could hoist health sages on their own emotional petard. What if someone were inspired to ask whether the proposal to ban handguns might reverse the decline and cause many more children to die in gun accidents? Finally, by suppressing any mention of the decline, health advocate sages leave themselves free to continue fabricating statistics to exaggerate the number of child deaths--falsehoods which, but for their tragic subject matter, would be comic in their wild inconsistency.[225]\n \n Using exaggerated figures allows health advocate sages to capitalize on the emotionalism of childhood fatalities and thereby evade legitimate questions about their proposal to ban and confiscate handguns as a means of reducing such (p.570)tragedies. We offer the following questions which, of course, are never mentioned in the health advocacy literature on children and guns: If so sweeping a measure as confiscating 230 million firearms is justified because some 273 children under age fifteen die in firearm accidents annually, is the less intrusive measure of banning child bicycles justified by the death of three times as many children in bicycle accidents annually?[226] If confiscating over 80 million handguns is justified because approximately fifteen children under age five die in handgun accidents annually, is a ban on cigarette lighters justified by the fact that four times as many children in that age group die from playing with then annually?\n \n Consider the fact that over 400% more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents;[227] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents.[228] Few people need a bathtub (as opposed to a shower stall) or a swimming pool. If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns, or all of the more than 230 million firearms, do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they \"truly need\" a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them?[229]\n \n C. Fraudulent Suppression of Gun\n Ownership-Homicide Comparison Data\n Since the mid-1960s, the total American gunstock has massively increased.[230] To some extent this increase may represent no more than the (p.571)increase in disposable income that has massively spurred sales of consumer products generally. But the enormous increase in handguns particularly seems to reflect a widespread fear of crime. This is not to say that handgun sales can be correlated with crime rates which, since the mid-1960s, have risen and fallen erratically and inconsistently in various states and cities, and in the nation as a whole. There is no reason to think that gun buyers are motivated by, or even aware of, changes in homicide rates as such, much less changes in the rates of rape, robbery, and burglary, which have risen and fallen with no consistent relationship to each other or to homicide statistics. What ordinary people are aware of are the crimes that underlie the statistics. For instance, as of 1980 the burglary rate was such that about one in ten houses was burglarized each year.[231] Even assuming that the burglary rate had decreased to one in twenty over the ensuing decade (which it did not), many people who know nothing about the rate might nevertheless be impelled to buy handguns as a result of the experience of being burglarized or knowing others who had been burglarized. Of course, fears that impel firearms purchases may be prompted by media sensationalism in the reporting of individual crimes, even in comparatively low crime areas.\n \n In sum, while the demand for guns to be used for protection is stimulated by generally high crime rates, it does not vary greatly in response to changes or trends in the crime rate. If crime rates remain generally high, many potential victims will want guns for protection, regardless of whether crime rates are modestly rising or modestly falling or remaining steady on a year-to-year basis or over a period of years.(p.572)\n\n \n \n\n \n In sum, over a twenty year period of unparalleled increase in guns, homicide rates were erratic, unpatterned, and completely inconsistent with the shibboleth that doubling the number of guns, especially handguns, would increase homicide rates. Geographic and demographic studies of homicide are equally inconsistent with the health advocacy shibboleth.[248] For instance, studies trying to link gun (p.574)ownership to violence rates find either no correlation or a negative one.[249] Once again, these are facts that readers who rely solely on health advocacy literature will never learn. Nor will they be exposed to the following:\n \n When used for protection, firearms can seriously inhibit aggression and can provide a psychological buffer against the fear of crime. Furthermore, the fact that national patterns show little violent crime where guns are most dense implies that guns do not elicit aggression in any meaningful way. Quite the contrary, these findings suggest that high saturations of guns in places, or something correlated with that condition, inhibit illegal aggression.[250] GUNS AND PUBLIC HEALTH: EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE OR PANDEMIC OF PROPAGANDA? \n \n \n \n \n * For nonfatal violent crimes, offenders were more likely to have a firearm than a knife or club. From 1993 to 2001 the rate of firearm violence fell 63%[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n \nThe study's authors make a tacit assumption by consistently using of the word \"victim,\" and by asserting that \"violent crime in the home\" is being considered.[326] The authors assume that the victim of the crime and the victim of the homicide are the same person. However, the deceased may actually have been the attacker, and thus the homicide should have been considered a benefit rather than a risk. The cases in which the \"offender\" is listed as \"Police officer\" seem likely to fall under this misleading classification, as does even the categorization of \"Police\" as \"offender.\"[327](p.588)\n\n \n \n Your duty, should you decide to accept, is to counter each and every statement and provide proof by link to reputable folks that disprive each and every one including the rest of this article including the DOJ and FBI as well as the scholars who challenged the \"claims\" with actual proof.\n \n Have a nice day :)",

They were not tasked with finding Constitutional rights a benefit.\nI haven't seen where Clinton appointed them, even your link notes they are \"good scholars\"...nor does it prove they were biased even if they were selected by Clinton. Not only that, I'm not arguing anything about the effectiveness of gun control laws (geesh, said this a lot already), I'm arguing that more guns does not mean less crime. \n \n \nNotice his admission of his lie you relied so heavily on\nUmm, there is nothing in there I relied upon. Another strawman?\n \n \nAppears you don't have any facts, just claims. Uninformed ones at best. Notice the complete absence of the presence of Lott, Kleck or other pro rights members to present evidence to the contrary. Here are some real facts:\nI find it disturbing that you will only believe \"pro guns rights\" folks. So much for neutrality. \n \n Anyway, From your article only TWO members were mentioned as being \"anti-gun\" (whatever that means). Of course if you shouldn't be on the panel if you are anti-gun should you be on it if you are pro gun? If we are not to believe something that comes from an \"anti-gunner\" because they are not objective than shouldn't you also not believe something from a pro-gunner...say John Lott? This article is critical of not having enough persons with experience in firearms policy and then turns around and says basically anyone critical of guns is biased and shouldn't have been on the panel. Gee, trying to stack the deck? Truth is, the panel, which was much more than 3 members, came to a conclusion where only ONE person dissented. \n \n \n\n DOJ, Justice Department: Gun Violence Falls 63%\n By Jim Kouri, CPP\n MichNews.com\n Mar 17, 2005\nA report about how changes in gun laws haven't resulted in increased murders year to year. Great! Never claimed they did. You wanna know what that DOJ report didn't conclude?? That more guns = less crime. \n \n \nNONE of the studies included Kleck's exhaustive studies in the area of benefits of gun ownership and use:\nAwesome, yet another claim I'm not concerned about. I'm not sure what you are on but the only logical reason why you post these articles, that I can think of, is that when I say \"more guns doesn't equal less crime\" you think I believe every anti-gun thing ever said. Perhaps I am wrong there but that is the perception.\n \n So tell me how either one of these shows more guns equals less crime.\n \n\n Your duty, should you decide to accept, is to counter each and every statement and provide proof by link to reputable folks that disprive each and every one including the rest of this article including the DOJ and FBI as well as the scholars who challenged the \"claims\" with actual proof.\nNo, your duty is to actually prove your claim and stop diverting.

The 110.2% increase in handgun ownership in the twenty year period 1973-1992[236] might not have resulted in a full 110.2% increase in murders, but if guns really were the \"primary cause\" of murder,[237] or just \"one of the main causes,\" the 110.2% increase in handguns, and the 73.3% increase in guns of all types, should have been accompanied by a consistent, marked increase in murders as predicted by health advocacy sages who bewailed those increases in gun ownership.\n \n At the very least, the murder rate should have increased somewhat. However, there was no consistent and marked increase in the murder rate. In 1973, the American firearm stock totaled 122 million, the handgun stock was 36.9 million, and the homicide rate was 9.4 per 100,000 people.[238] At the end of 1992, twenty years later, the firearm stock had risen to 221.9 million, the handgun stock (p.573)had risen to 77.6 million, but the homicide rate was 8.5--or 9.5% lower than it had been in 1973.[239] The percentage of murders committed with firearms decreased as well. In 1973, 68.5% of murders were committed with guns.[240] Fifteen years later, after Americans had purchased almost as many new firearms as they had in the preceding seventy-three years, 62.8% of homicides were committed with guns.[241]\n \n Note that we are not suggesting, as pro-gun fanatics might, that increased gun ownership caused reduction in homicide or other violence. Our focus is the health advocacy shibboleth that guns are the primary cause of murder, and that more guns, particularly more handguns, mean more murder. The data examined so far do not bear this out. Is it just a coincidence that the gun ownership-murder rate comparative data are never mentioned in the health advocacy literature, or that its implications are never discussed there? Or does this nondisclosure reflect the implications of the criminological conclusion we noted earlier that gun ownership by noncriminals does not cause crime, and is not a source of social harm, even though firearms in the hands of criminals do facilitate crime?[242]\n \n In presenting the 1973-1992 data, we are not suggesting that the homicide rates steadily declined during that period. In the years 1973 to 1977 the homicide rate first rose to 9.8 per 100,000 people in 1974, then dropped to 8.8 in 1977.[243] The rate then steeply rose to its highest point ever, 10.2 in 1980.[244] Five years later, in 1984, it had dropped 22.5% to 7.9.[245] Then in 1986, it began rising again with some fluctuation, to its 1992 level of 9.3.[246] As for homicides committed with guns, over the twenty year period they fell as low as 58.7% in 1985, but then rose back to 68.5% by 1992.[247]\n \n In sum, over a twenty year period of unparalleled increase in guns, homicide rates were erratic, unpatterned, and completely inconsistent with the shibboleth that doubling the number of guns, especially handguns, would increase homicide rates. Geographic and demographic studies of homicide are equally inconsistent with the health advocacy shibboleth.[248] For instance, studies trying to link gun (p.574)ownership to violence rates find either no correlation or a negative one.[249] Once again, these are facts that readers who rely solely on health advocacy literature will never learn. Nor will they be exposed to the following:\n \n When used for protection, firearms can seriously inhibit aggression and can provide a psychological buffer against the fear of crime. Furthermore, the fact that national patterns show little violent crime where guns are most dense implies that guns do not elicit aggression in any meaningful way. Quite the contrary, these findings suggest that high saturations of guns in places, or something correlated with that condition, inhibit illegal aggression.[250]\n \n XII. Shibboleth Diverts Attention from Actual Causes\n Likewise never discussed in the health advocacy literature against firearms is the fact that the homicide rate among whites has steadily fallen since 1980.[251] The apparent increase in American homicide from the mid-1980s to the present is due to a steady fall in white homicide being offset by a vast increase in homicide in drug-ridden, poverty-stricken inner cities. Inner city and minority youth homicide is a regular theme in the anti-gun health literature.[252] Of course, (p.575)health sages never acknowledge that per capita gun ownership is far lower among African Americans than among whites.[253] Mentioning that fact would both discredit their shibboleth that gun availability causes homicide and support the leading English criminological analyst's pessimistic view that \"in any society the number of guns always suffices to arm the few who want to obtain and use them illegally.\"[254]\n \n In sum, increased firearm availability to honest, responsible people--of any race--does not cause increased violence. Neither is lower firearm availability to such people associated with lower violence. Taken together or separately, data on firearm availability for the nation as a whole, and for discrete geographic or demographic sub-populations, discredit the shibboleth that the possession of guns is the primary cause of murder. The actual causes of murder--other than competing in the murderous drug trade--are hopelessness, poverty, and a lack of substantial employment opportunities. Studies suggest that rates of homicide and other violence among blacks are no greater than those of similarly situated whites.[255] In that connection, consider the following: \"Fixating on guns seems to be, for many people, a fetish which allows them to ignore the more intransigent causes of American violence, including its dying cities, inequality, deteriorating family structure, and the all-pervasive economic and social consequences of a history of slavery and racism.\"[256] In this context, we note a Marxist criminologist's (p.576)suggestion that the function, or at least the effect, of gun control advocacy is diverting attention from urgently needed social and political change.[257]\n \n XIII. A Critique of Overt Mendacity\n A 1989 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association approvingly quoted a CDC official's assertion that his work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention involved \"systematically build[ing]a case that owning firearms causes death.\"[258] The CDC official later claimed that JAMA had misquoted him and offered the only repudiation of the anti-gun political agenda we have found in a health advocacy publication, characterizing it as \"anathema to any unbiased scientific inquiry because it assumes the conclusion at the outset and then attempts to find evidence to support it.\"[259]\n \n Unfortunately, that is precisely what CDC is doing. Indeed, this has subsequently been avowed by the prior official's successor.[260] Even more unfortunately, CDC and other health advocate sages build their case not only by suppressing facts, but by overt fraud, fabricating statistics, and falsifying references to support them.[261] The following are but a few of the many examples documented in a recent paper co-authored by professors at Columbia Medical School and Rutgers University Law School.\n \n The first instance represents a lamentable exception to our generalization that comparisons of gun ownership and murder rates through the 1970s and 1980s find no place in the health advocacy literature.[262] Some health sages go so far as to overtly misrepresent that murder rates increased over that period, and then correlate this misrepresentation with the same period's steadily increasing gun ownership so as to lend spurious support to their more-guns-mean-more-murder shibboleth. Thus, a 1989 Report to the United States Congress by the CDC stated that \"[s]ince the early 1970s the year-to-year fluctuations in firearm availability has [sic] paralleled the numbers of homicides.\"[263] We leave it to the readers of (p.577)this Article to judge how a 69% increase in handgun ownership over the fifteen year period from 1974 to 1988 could honestly be described as having \"paralleled\" a 14.2% decrease in homicide during that same period.[264]\n \n Understandably, the CDC Report offered no supporting reference for its claim of parallelism. However, the inventive Dr. Diane Schetky, and two equally inventive CDC writers--Gordon Smith and Henry Falk--in a separate article actually do provide purportedly supporting citations for the claim that \"[h]andguns account for only 20% of the firearms in use today, but they are involved in the majority of both criminal and unintentional firearm injuries.\"[265] The problems with this claim are that the claim is false in every respect and that the citations are fabrications. The purpose of the claim is to exaggerate the comparative risks of handguns vis-a-vis long guns so as to fortify the cause of handgun prohibition and avoid admitting the major problem we have already addressed--that, because handguns are innately far safer than long guns, if a handgun ban caused defensive gun owners to keep loaded long guns instead (as handgun ban advocates and experts concur would be the case), thousands more might die in fatal gun accidents annually.[266]\n \n The only citation given by either Schetky or Smith and Falk to support their claim that handguns comprise only 20% of all guns, yet are involved in 90% of gun accidents and crime, is the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.[267] Understandably, no page citations are given, because the citations are simply falsified. As anyone familiar with the Uniform Crime Reports knows, they provide no data on gun ownership, and thus no comparative data on handgun versus long gun ownership. Nor do the Uniform Crime Reports provide data on accidents in general, thus no data on gun accidents, and thus no comparative data on the incidence of handgun accidents versus long guns accidents. Schetky, Smith, and Falk could have found data on these matters in the National Safety Council's Accident Facts, but those data would not have suited their purpose because these statistics do not support the point they sought to make.(p.578)\n \n Furthermore, the Uniform Crime Reports give no data on the number of persons injured in gun crimes or the number of such injures in handgun crimes versus long gun crimes. They do give such data for gun murders, but even those data do not support Schetky's claim that 90% are committed with handguns.[268] Every one of the other purported statistics given by Schetky, Smith, and Falk is not only wrong, but wrong in only one particular direction. Each false statistic errs in supporting their point, whereas an accurate rendition of the statistic would not have done so. It is, of course, elementary that innocent mistakes tend to be random and to balance each other rather than all erring in favor of the position for which they are presented.\n \n Another instance of overt mendacity involves the remarkable Dr. Sloan. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, we classified other mischaracterizations by him as gun-aversive-dyslexia. It strains even that generous category, however, to so classify an inability to accurately read and describe one's own articles. The gravamen of the Sloan two-city comparison discussed previously was that the strict 1978 Canadian gun law caused Vancouver to have less homicide than Seattle, where any responsible adult can buy a handgun.[269] But as an NRA representative pointed out in a critical letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, the authors had made no effort to determine how Canadian homicide had changed since adopting the law.[270] In fact, the homicide rate had not fallen, but rather it had risen slightly, with handgun use unchanged at about one-eighth of homicides. Sloan tried to extricate himself from this embarrassment by mendaciously asserting that the \"intent of our article was not to evaluate the effect of the 1978 Canadian gun law.\"[271] Readers may judge for themselves how well that squares with the article's actual conclusion: \"[R]estriction of access to firearms ... is associated with lower rates of homicide.\"[272] Health advocate readers have certainly understood the significance of the article to be that it \"demonstrated the beneficial effect of [Canada's] tighter regulation\" of firearms.[273]\n \n It is misleading to suggest that, heavily politicized though it is, the anti-gun health advocacy literature commonly exhibits overt mendacity, as opposed to fraudulent misleading by half-truth and suppression of material facts. Overt (p.579)mendacity is not infrequent, however, and numerous examples will be documented in the next section and in the balance of this Article.\n \n XIV. The Myth That Murderers\n Are Ordinary Gun Owners\n The case for reducing firearm availability to ordinary people rests on two interrelated myths endorsed explicitly and implicitly in the health advocacy literature on firearms. First is the myth that \"most [murderers] would be considered law-abiding citizens prior to their pulling the trigger.\"[274] Second is the myth that \"most shootings are not committed by felons or mentally ill people, but are acts of passion that are committed using a handgun that is owned for home protection.\"[275] From these myths other falsehoods follow: that firearms availability to ordinary citizens is the \"primary cause\" of murder,[276] that murder would radically decrease if ordinary citizens were deprived of those guns, and that it is unnecessary to worry much about the enforceability of gun bans because, even if criminals will not disarm, the law abiding will--and they are the ones committing most murders.\n \n The problem is that it simply is not true that previously law abiding citizens commit most murders or many murders or virtually any murders. Thus, disarming them would not, and could not, eliminate most, many, or virtually any murders. homicide studies show that murderers tend not to be ordinary law-abiding citizens, but rather extreme aberrants.[277] The great majority of murderers have life histories of violence, felony records, and substance abuse.[278] These facts are so firmly established that they even appear in medico-health discussions of violence,[279] yet they are never discussed in connection with the health (p.580)advocate sages' mythology about ordinary citizens murdering relatives and acquaintances with guns.\n \n Looking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records,[280] and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests.[281] These studies also found that when the murder occurred \"[a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release\"--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense.[282]\n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles.[283] Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers (p.581)to have extensive serious criminal records. \"The research literature on characteristics of those who murder yields a profile of offenders that indicates that many have histories of committing personal violence in childhood, against other children, siblings, and small animals.\"[284] Though juvenile criminal records are not generally available, they occasionally become known in connection with some high-profile cases. In one recent case which generated nationwide publicity, a five-year-old boy was thrown from a fourteenth story window by two other boys because he had refused to steal candy for them.[285] Police revealed that both killers, ages ten and eleven, had prior arrests for theft, aggravated battery, and unlawful use of a weapon.[286] At the time of the murder, one of the perpetrators was supposed to be confined to his home on a weapons conviction.[287]\n \n The anti-gun health advocacy literature avoids the fact that murderers tend to be extreme aberrants by just falsifying the facts. A truly startling example, because it contradicts his own writings, is that of the CDC's point man for gun prohibition, Dr. Mark Rosenberg.[288] Dr. Rosenberg, director of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, recently extolled the CDC's hope to create a public perception of firearms as \"dirty, deadly--and banned.\"[289] To mislead readers into blaming firearms for crime rather than criminals, Dr. Rosenberg actually goes so far as to claim that \"most of the perpetrators of violence are not criminals by trade or profession. Indeed, in the area of domestic violence, most of the perpetrators are never accused of any crime. The victims and perpetrators are ourselves--ordinary citizens, students, professionals, and even public health workers.\"[290] A comparison of this statement to Dr. Rosenberg's other statements reveals its falsity. In the same work, Dr. Rosenberg stated: \"Violence is foreign to the lives of most public health professionals.\"[291] In another article, Dr. Rosenberg recognized that \"[m]ost family homicides involve spouses and occur after a series of prior assaultive incidents.\"[292](p.582)\n \n We do not suggest that all statements promoting this mythology in the health advocacy literature constitute conscious misrepresentations. Some reflect only a combination of ignorance and intellectual confusion. For instance, Jeremiah Barondess comments in JAMA:\n \n In relation to the contention that homicide by firearms is carried out by established felons, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported that of the 15,377 reported firearm-related murders in 1992, a total of 7505 fell under the category of \"other than felony type,\" such as \"romantic triangle, arguments over money or property, other arguments\"; thus, many who kill for the first time are not felons until they commit the act.[293]\n \n \n\n \n Whoops, looks like you got caught in a monumental whopper :) emoticon_xgood",

   "Jacob Sullum takes apart Justice Stevens' reasoning in Chicago Gun Ban case \n This argument by Stevens is actually fairly similar to arguments that Richard Posner made. The core of Sullum's argument is here: Gun Shy - Reason Magazine\n \n \n In their dissenting opinions, Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer (joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor) worry that overturning gun control laws undermines democracy. If \"the people\" want to ban handguns, they say, \"the people\" should be allowed to implement that desire through their elected representatives.\n \n What if the people want to ban books that offend them, establish an official church, or authorize police to conduct warrantless searches at will? Those options are also foreclosed by constitutional provisions that apply to the states by way of the 14th Amendment. The crucial difference between a pure democracy and a constitutional democracy like ours is that sometimes the majority does not decide.\n \n Likewise, Stevens defends \"state and local legislatures' right to experiment,\" while Breyer is loath to interfere with \"the ability of States to reflect local preferences and conditions-both key virtues of federalism.\" Coming from justices who think Congress can disregard state decisions about the medical use of marijuana because a plant on the windowsill of a cancer patient qualifies as interstate commerce, this sudden concern about federalism is hard to take seriously.\n \n Another reason to doubt the dissenters' sincerity: They would never accept federalism as a rationale for letting states \"experiment\" with freedom of speech, freedom of religion, or due process protections. Much of their job, as they themselves see it, involves overriding \"local preferences\" that give short shrift to constitutional rights.\n \n Second Amendment rights are different, Breyer says, because \"determining the constitutionality of a particular state gun law requires finding answers to complex empirically based questions.\" So does weighing the claims in favor of banning child pornography or depictions of animal cruelty, relaxing the Miranda rule, admitting illegally obtained evidence, or allowing warrantless pat-downs, dog sniffs, or infrared surveillance. . . .",

   "That is all I'm pushing. It isn't true that more guns = less crime.\n\n But yet again, you want to make statements that you have no proof for! You also completely take the position that the statement more guns = less crime is false just because you found someone who agrees with what, you want to be true. Neither the CDC nor the NAS was willing to say that, because no conclusive proof either way has been given either way! Your very own National Academy of Sciences study which you first quoted in the article says. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed but you want to totally say they are wrong too. How can that be?\n \n \nemoticon_frazzled Not everything has to be certified by the NAS or CDC...in fact, most studies are not. \n\n So you think that works in your favor? Most studies were not even found to be credible enough to even be considered. emoticon_smile  The CDC study says  \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n\n \n You like to be perched out on a limb. Kind of like the fact that you think that   60% of Police Chiefs who say Concealed Carry will reduce crime in their cities, are totally wrong. You are equally out on a limb on this one too!

   "I'm not to worried about whether or not John Lott lied about anything..I doubt he did. The problem with John Lott is that his study does not withstand the test of time as shown by numerous different researchers. John Lott, from his last book, appears to concede that the data can be interpreted various ways so I suspect it will be common knowledge even by gun activists that more guns doesn't equal less crime and if anything has no effect or no correlation. The argument should then become \"it doesn't increase crime\" which is obviously a valid claim\nI think you're too generous with Mr Lott.\n \n The Rosh-Huntress Files : Deltoid",

Looks like this was no different since the shooter had run out of ammo.\n \n \nWe should not downplay the role of Bridges, an armed deputy, in apprehending the shooter, but he did not stop the shooting.

   "You can try to prove your point. The only way to do that is to deny that DGUs exist;\nThis just isn't true and I've shown you an example of why. In fact, no one is even claiming what you are claiming. You like to quote the NAS panel but fail to address their conclusion about no evidence showing a reduction in crime. If you logic is true than it would have been very easy for them to conclude that more guns = less crime, yet they didn't. \n \n \nBut we do know, you just want to ignore it! \nYeah, I agree, and it isn't that more guns = less crime.\n \n \n Your false delimma is built on the mere assumption that we have to accept youR choice because it is the correct one.\nOk, you can just admit you don't know what a false dilemma is. \n \n A false dilemma fallacy is where you claim only 'x' options exist when in reality these are not the only options. I stated four options so for there to be a false dilemma you have show other options exist.\n False dilemma - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nYour claim not mine. \nIt is your claim that More Guns = Less Crime. No matter how much you deny it, you said it and that is what I have repeatedly refuted. \n \n \nYou have no idea what it would be if DGUs didn't happen every day.\nNeither do you\n \n \nRidiculous, what about my explanation of Sammy Long? The tower shooter? The concealed handgun instructor in Tyler, Texas that was awarded the highest reward available for giving his life to save lives. All DGUs and I can provide many more every day.\nYou keep ranting about DGUs as if that means anything. Let's say in a small town people of 100,000 people you have five people robbed at gun point and these are the only crimes. The stats are as follows:\n \n Violent Crime:\n 5 per 100,000\n DGU = 0\n AKA the crime rate is 5 per 100,000\n \n Now, let's say that ton now has conceal and carry. The town have three people robbed at gun point and 3 attempted robbers at gun point but the person being mugged pulled out a gun on them. \n \n Violent Crime:\n 6 per 100,000\n DGU = 3\n Crime rate went up. Even if those 3 attempts were not reported, they should have been and that counts as a crime stat. It turns out that unreported crimes thwarted by the victim is irrelevant since it would only help your stance. \n \n To combat this researchers develop models for how laws effect crime rates. Lott created a model but it was considered flawed when data was expanded. Donohue and Ayers created a \"hybrid\" model for looking at the effects of conceal and carry laws and conclude that it actually increases some crime. Others researchers have tried to use these models or modify them. \n \n If it was as easy as seeing there is one DGU and concluding crime is down than I doubt you would see so much research saying that, at best, there is no evidence to support more guns = less crime.\n \n \nLike heck I can't. The last study was done in 2004 by the DOJ. \nemoticon_frazzled Those conclusions were beyond 2004.\n \n \nYES THEY DID AND MR. WILSON BROUGHT IT UP IN THE BODY AND ALSO THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH NOTED \"MANY DGUs EACH DAY\".\nIn other words you can't refute those conclusions?\n \n \nWhere you already have your buddies (both of them?) lined up that have about half as much sense as you? ha ha ha ha ha!\n \nWe have to agree on the judges.

We have been over this. His articles have been peer reviewed.\n \n Great, unrelated to anything about more guns = less crime. \n \n You still refuse to address anything I've said...you just parrot the same thing!

You don't refute any of it!\n\n \n You put great reliance on Ayers and Donahue. You should well know and have admitted as much, that their claim was MORE GUNS = MORE CRIME.\n \n You are all over the board with claims that you can't support, refuse to admit the plain truth in your own \"evidence\" which is diametrically opposed to your claimed position and keep spamming the board with nothing that discredits Lott's evidence nor my claim that DGUs are clear evidence that they are absolute proof that guns do indeed prevent crime which would mean less crime.

   "This just isn't true and I've shown you an example of why. In fact, no one is even claiming what you are claiming. You like to quote the NAS panel but fail to address their conclusion about no evidence showing a reduction in crime. If you logic is true than it would have been very easy for them to conclude that more guns = less crime, yet they didn't.\n \n \n I did address their conclusion, all of it unlike you. You would like to write out the part in that conclusion that states firearms are used for self defense many times a day! \n \n \nYeah, I agree, and it isn't that more guns = less crime.\n\n \n Show me where they even addressed the positive effects of any mode of carry by citizens.\n \n \nOk, you can just admit you don't know what a false dilemma is. \n \n A false dilemma fallacy is where you claim only 'x' options exist when in reality these are not the only options. I stated four options so for there to be a false dilemma you have show other options exist.\n False dilemma - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n Which is AGAIN the same thing you attempt to prove by insisting that we accept only one conclusion which is your choice. No beneficial use of firearms is considered other than Mr. Wilson's observation. What they found was none of the gun control laws had any benefits. You would like to pretend they studied gun rights...they didn't. Your attempt to assert your claim that they studied if a right, a civil right now, had any benefits. They didn't and WE do not have to prove a darn thing...you do but you keep dodging, running and hiding pretending you want to debate. When are you gonna start?\n \n \nIt is your claim that More Guns = Less Crime. No matter how much you deny it, you said it and that is what I have repeatedly refuted.\n \n \n Yep, that is my claim and I offer proof of DGUs which you can't deny to prove your claim that there is no benefit from someone saving/protecting themselves, property and others. \n \n \nNeither do you\n\n \n I don't have to, you do.\n \n \nYou keep ranting about DGUs as if that means anything. Let's say in a small town people of 100,000 people you have five people robbed at gun point and these are the only crimes. The stats are as follows:\n \n Violent Crime:\n 5 per 100,000\n DGU = 0\n AKA the crime rate is 5 per 100,000\n \n Now, let's say that ton now has conceal and carry. The town have three people robbed at gun point and 3 attempted robbers at gun point but the person being mugged pulled out a gun on them. \n \n Violent Crime:\n 6 per 100,000\n DGU = 3\n Crime rate went up. Even if those 3 attempts were not reported, they should have been and that counts as a crime stat. It turns out that unreported crimes thwarted by the victim is irrelevant since it would only help your stance. \n \n \n That is the point and a very valid one. Do you argue to protect criminals or is it your objection as a cop that this is vigilantism? It isn't! It is provided by law, it is a public duty and required by law and you can't dismiss it. In Texas,it is found in Chapter 9 of the Penal Code and is LAW.\n \n This is further proof that you buy Ayers and Donoho's drivel about MORE GUNS = MORE CRIME. You even put it in numbers. That is what you keep trying to prove but it doesn't work that way no matter how you would like to count a DGU as a crime.\n \n \nTo combat this researchers develop models for how laws effect crime rates. Lott created a model but it was considered flawed when data was expanded. Donohue and Ayers created a \"hybrid\" model for looking at the effects of conceal and carry laws and conclude that it actually increases some crime. Others researchers have tried to use these models or modify them.\n \n \n Ayers and Donoho completely ignored the law on self defense and DGUs. No matter how bad you would like to ignore or dismiss them you cannot.\n \n If it was as easy as seeing there is one DGU and concluding crime is down than I doubt you would see so much research saying that, at best, there is no evidence to support more guns = less crime.\n \n \nemoticon_frazzled Those conclusions were beyond 2004.\n\n \n Which study are you talking about? The \"conclusions\" we were discussing were the CDC and NAS studies.\n \n \nIn other words you can't refute those conclusions?\n\n \n Why would I want to refute a conclusion that gun control laws do not work?\n \n The benefits of citizen carry was not studied and Kleck made many complaints about that I have posted on this board. You are trying to claim something that didn't occur, that is the study of the benefits of \"embedded guns\" for citizen carry and DGUs. You would like to lump them in too but the panel had no such study before them.\n \n \nWe have to agree on the judges. Come on, put your money where your mouth is. Why won't you debate me on the formal debate forum?\n\n \n I reckon this will do just fine. Folks can judge it right here despite your attempt at a set up. BTW, you aren't doing very well wordsmithing and lack of evidence. You have tried unsuccessfully to claim a victory but it too is hollow. :) emoticon_xbouncer",

   "The NAS study will receive $109,000 from the prohibitionist Joyce Foundation, which lavishly funded the Chicago-Kent Law Review's one-sided anti-Second Amendment symposium last year, and which has contributed generously to gun-prohibition groups. It is a fair inference that the Joyce Foundation thinks that the panel is very likely to produce results that will advance its mission. Other funders are the Centers for Disease Control (which was the main funder for antigun junk science, until Congress cut off funding in 1995), and the David & Lucile Packard Foundation, which is also a contributor to antigun groups. Just imagine what gun-control advocates would say if a government study were funded by the NRA or the Scaife Foundation.\n \n The panel is supposed to propose \"new...control strategies.\" The idea of repealing \"control strategies\" which social scientists have proven to be failures isn't on the agenda. Nor is there any agenda for \"strategies\" to improve public safety by fostering gun ownership and carrying by law-abiding people - even though social-science data from John Lott and others overwhelmingly show that this strategy really does reduce crime.\n \n The reading packets which have been prepared for the committee are rife with antigun junk science. The committee members find material applauding the study claiming that Seattle and Vancouver are demographically similar (although the latter has virtually no blacks or Hispanics) and that gun control is the reason for Vancouver's lower homicide rate (even though Seattle whites have a lower homicide rate than Vancouver whites, and difference in homicide rates between the two cities is strongly correlated to Seattle's black and Hispanic population).\n \n The committee reading packets contain fulsome praise not only for the Dr. Arthur Kellermann's Seattle/Vancouver junk-science article, but for many of the rest of his junk-science productions, like the claim that owning a gun triples the risk of being murdered (even though hardly any of Kellermann's murder victims were killed with a gun from their own home, and a significant number of the murder \"victims\" were lawfully killed by police, and the whole factoid disappears once you account for the true rates of gun ownership among the \"control group\" of people who weren't murdered).\n \n Or the ludicrous study claiming that Washington, D.C.'s 1976 handgun ban reduced homicide - [U]even though homicide in the soared to national record levels after the ban was enacted, while nearby Baltimore (which didn't ban handguns) had no such catastrophic increase[U]. It turns out the \"decline\" in D.C. homicides was created by pretending that the low-homicide years of 1975-76 were the products of the 1976 handgun ban, which was put into place in the last quarter of 1976 through February 1977. \n \n Not one sentence in any of the official materials prepared for the committee criticizes any gun-control law. The committee members were not given even one of the many social-science articles detailing the failures of various gun-control laws.\n\n \n Don't let the truth stand in the way of a good lie though.

   "the innocent!\n \n \nIn sum, over a twenty year period of unparalleled increase in guns, homicide rates were erratic, unpatterned, and completely inconsistent with the shibboleth that doubling the number of guns, especially handguns, would increase homicide rates. Geographic and demographic studies of homicide are equally inconsistent with the health advocacy shibboleth.[248] For instance, studies trying to link gun (p.574)ownership to violence rates find either no correlation or a negative one.[249] Once again, these are facts that readers who rely solely on health advocacy literature will never learn. Nor will they be exposed to the following:\n When used for protection, firearms can seriously inhibit aggression and can provide a psychological buffer against the fear of crime. Furthermore, the fact that national patterns show little violent crime where guns are most dense implies that guns do not elicit aggression in any meaningful way. Quite the contrary, these findings suggest that high saturations of guns in places, or something correlated with that condition, inhibit illegal aggression.[250] GUNS AND PUBLIC HEALTH: EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE OR PANDEMIC OF PROPAGANDA? \n \n \n \n \n * For nonfatal violent crimes, offenders were more likely to have a firearm than a knife or club.

   "But that is not anywhere near the truth!\n ....\n Once again you make claims that are opposed to the truth, far removed from the truth. Reliance on your own statements as to what you wish had transpired is a grave error and hoping if you keep repeating it that error will transform into truth.\nFirearms and Violence: A Critical Review\n \n In response to \n \n \nIt wasn't [included; The 1995 study in question] because the Lott study was really the big one at the time.\n\n \n This is directly from the study:\n \n \n\n 6\n Right-to-Carry Laws\n \n This chapter is concerned with the question of whether violent crime is reduced through the enactment of right-to-carry-laws, which allow individuals to carry concealed weapons.1 In all, 34 states have right-to-carry laws that allow qualified adults to carry concealed handguns. Proponents of these laws argue that criminals are deterred by the knowledge that potential victims may be carrying weapons and therefore that the laws reduce crime. However, it is not clear a priori that such deterrence occurs. Even if it does, there may be offsetting adverse consequences. For example, increased possession of firearms by potential victims may motivate more criminals to carry firearms and thereby increase the amount of violence that is associated with crime. Moreover, allowing individuals to carry concealed weapons may increase accidental injuries or deaths or increase shootings during arguments. Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether allowing individuals to carry concealed weapons generates net social benefits or net social costs.\n \n The statistical analysis of the effects of these laws was initiated by John Lott and David Mustard (1997) and expanded by Lott (2000) and Bronars and Lott (1998) (hereinafter referred to simply as Lott). Lott concludes that the adoption of right-to-carry laws substantially reduces the prevalence of violent crime. Many other researchers have carried out their own statistical analyses using Lott&#8217;s data, modified versions of Lott&#8217;s data, or expanded data sets that cover the more recent time period not included in the original analysis.2\n \n Because the right-to-carry issue is highly controversial, has received much public attention, and has generated a large volume of research, the committee has given it special attention in its deliberations. This chapter reviews the existing empirical evidence on the issue. We also report the results of our own analyses of the data. We conclude that, in light of (a) the sensitivity of the empirical results to seemingly minor changes in model specification, (b) a lack of robustness of the results to the inclusion of more recent years of data (during which there are many more law changes than in the earlier period), and (c) the imprecision of some results, it is impossible to draw strong conclusions from the existing literature on the causal impact of these laws. Committee member James Q. Wilson has written a dissent that applies to Chapter 6 only (Appendix A), and the committee has written a response (Appendix B).\n",

   "Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review\n \n Recall Mr. Wilson is the only truely objective member of the committee .\n \n He could care less about guns and it is in his biography but he is a scholar and not biased.\n \n \nThe committee has confirmed this finding as is evident in its Tables 6-1, 6-2, 6-5 (first row), 6-6 (first row), and 6-7 (first two rows). This confirmation includes both the original data period (1977-1992) used by Lott and data that run through 2000. In view of the confirmation of the findings that shall-issue laws drive down the murder rate, it is hard for me to understand why these claims are called \"fragile.\"\n \n The only exceptions to this confirmation are, to me, quite puzzling. Tables 6-5 and 6-6 suggest that RTC laws have no effect on murder rates when no control variables are entered into the equations. These control variables (which include all of the social, demographic, and public policies other than RTC laws that might affect crime rates) are essential to understanding crime. Suppose Professor Jones wrote a paper saying that increasing the number of police in a city reduced the crime rate and Professor Smith wrote a rival paper saying that cities with few police officers have low crime rates. Suppose that neither Jones nor Smith used any control variables, such as income, unemployment, population density, or the frequency with which offenders are sent to prison in reaching their conclusions. If such papers were published, they would be rejected out of hand by the committee for the obvious reason that they failed to supply a complete account of the factors that affect the crime rate. One cannot explain crime rates just by observing the number of police in a city any more than one can explain them just by noting the existence of RTC laws.\n \n It is not enough to say that it is hard to know the right set of control variables without calling into question the use of economics in analyzing public policy questions. All control variables are based on past studies and reasonable theories; any given selection is best evaluated by testing various controls in one's equations.\n \n In addition, with only a few exceptions, the studies cited in Chapter 6, including those by Lott's critics, do not show that the passage of RTC laws drives the crime rates up (as might be the case if one supposed that newly armed people went about looking for someone to shoot). The direct evidence that such shooting sprees occur is nonexistent. The indirect evidence, as found in papers by Black and Nagin and Ayres and Donohue [cited in Chapter 6], is controversial. Indeed, the Ayres and Donohue paper shows that there was a \"statistically significant downward shift in the trend\" of the murder rate (Chapter 6, page 135). This suggests to me that for people interested in RTC laws, the best evidence we have is that they impose no costs but may confer benefits. That conclusion might be very useful to authorities who contemplate the enactment of RTC laws.\n Finally, the committee suggests that extending the Lott model to include data through 2000 may show no effect on RTC laws on murder rates if one analyzes the data on a year-by-year basis (Table 6-7, rows three and four). I wish I knew enough econometrics to feel confident about this (MORE)\n \n",

   "\n Recall Mr. Wilson is the only truely objective member of the committee .\n \n\n The committee found that when more recent data was used in Lott's model, claims about a reduction in crime were unsubstantiated. As for Donahue and Ayres, they didn't take a position on their research. But we should ignore that because we all know that the other members of the NAS committee (besides Wilson) such as Steven D. Levitt (the guy who Lott filed his frivolous defamation lawsuit against) were \"rabidly anti-gun.\" Never mind that Levitt himself says that he loves \" 'to shoot guns and would own them if my wife would let me.' \"\n \n But who was the source for the claim that Levitt is \"rabidly anti-gun\"?\n \n \"However, Tim Lambert, a computer scientist in Australia who maintains an anti-Lott blog, has said on his blog that Levitt told him he was nearly certain that Lott was the source.\n \n \"In March 2003 Lott published another book, The Bias Against Guns. In it he wrote, 'Steve Levitt, an economist, has been described in media reports as being \"rabidly anti-gun.\" ' (If Lott actually was the original source of this quote, he deserves some kind of medal for audacity.)\"\n The Shootout - Chicago magazine - August 2006 - Chicago\n \n Yes, we've seen Lott play that game before- attribute something he fabricated to other sources. He did that with a survey about defensive gun use in his book- More Guns Less Crime.\n \n An excerpt from one of Levitt's books:\n \nConsider the parents of an eight-year-old girl named, say, Molly. Her two best friends, Amy and Imani, each live nearby. Molly&#8217;s parents know that Amy&#8217;s parents keep a gun in their house, so they have forbidden Molly to play there. Instead, Molly spends a lot of time at Imani&#8217;s house, which has a swimming pool in the backyard. Molly&#8217;s parents feel good about having made such a smart choice to protect their daughter.\n \n But according to the data, their choice isn&#8217;t smart at all. In a given year, there is one drowning of a child for every 11,000 residential pools in the United States. (In a country with 6 million pools, this means that roughly 550 children under the age of ten drown each year.) Meanwhile, there is 1 child killed by a gun for every 1 million-plus guns. (In a country with an estimated 200 million guns, this means that roughly 175 children under ten die each year from guns.) The likelihood of death by pool (1 in 11,000) versus death by gun (1 in 1 million-plus) isn&#8217;t even close: Molly is roughly 100 times more likely to die in a swimming accident at Imani&#8217;s house than in gunplay at Amy&#8217;s.\n\n Chapter 5 Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics\n \n A person who is \"rabidly anti-gun\" wrote this???",

   "I support Heller and McDonald but your understanding of \"strict scrutiny\" is flawed.\n\n \n I'm failing to see the flaws here.\n \n Strict scrutiny: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from Answers.com\n \n Is the standard under the Equal Protection Clause that federal courts use to assess the constitutionality of governmental classifications based on race as well as those that impinge on fundamental constitutional rights. Until the mid&#8208;1970s, strict scrutiny also applied to classifications based on alienage (see Graham v. Richardson, 1971).\n \n To pass muster, a challenged governmental action must be &#8220;closely&#8221; related to a &#8220;compelling&#8221; governmental interest. As such, strict scrutiny is the most rigorous of the three levels of scrutiny that courts have formulated. Ordinary (minimum) scrutiny applies to most bases on which government classifies people and their activities&#8212;for example, economic and social considerations such as wealth (or the lack of it). This test merely requires government to show that the classificatory scheme &#8220;reasonably&#8221; relates to a &#8220;legitimate&#8221; governmental interest. An intermediate level, called &#8220;heightened scrutiny,&#8221; applies to classifications based on gender and illegitimacy. Here, the governmental action must be &#8220;substantially&#8221; related to an &#8220;important&#8221; governmental interest (see Intermediate Scrutiny).\n \n In contrast to ordinary scrutiny, where courts presume that the legislation or challenged governmental activity is constitutional and the plaintiff has the burden of showing a constitutional violation, strict scrutiny assumes that it is unconstitutional and the government has the burden of demonstrating its compelling interest. Courts must focus on government's purpose rather than merely on the effect of governmental action to determine the validity of a challenged law or regulation. The Court held in Washington v. Davis (1976) that, to be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination must be intentional.\n \n The difference between a &#8220;close&#8221; and a &#8220;substantial&#8221; relationship and the difference between a &#8220;compelling&#8221; and a &#8220;substantial&#8221; governmental interest are not delineated by a bright line. The Court has indicated, however, that a close relationship is one that adheres to the &#8220;least restrictive&#8221; or &#8220;least intrusive&#8221; means of regulation, and the likelihood that an interest is compelling is greater if it pertains to public health or safety than if it concerns mere administrative convenience or fiscal considerations. There are few cases in which a challenged statute has passed the test of strict scrutiny.\n \n I'm not seeing how government has any compelling interest in a lot of the firearm regulations that have been passed. Nor do I see how they would even feasibly achieve such \"interests\" with overly broad, intricately complex and utterly confusing laws that would require a law degree simply to navigate through.\n \n Seriously. Does the California government really have a \"compelling interest\" in knowing exactly who owns what gun in the state? They're in the middle of one of the worst budget crises to ever be seen, and they think the most important thing to worry about is making people register their hunting rifles with the government?",

   "Yes of course, all felonies.\n\n \n So private transactions are felonies? You can go to prison for years for not going through an FFL dealer?\n \n Is that what you consider \"reasonable regulations\"?\n \n \nLack of uniformity of regulations between states is a problem.\n\n \n No, California's isolationist stance is the problem. It's why DC and Chicago's laws were such utter failures, they were surrounded by the rest of the states that chose no to follow.\n \n If California wants uniformity of law then they should change their laws to reflect the rest of the country, rather than demanding the rest of the country change to meet their hysterical demands.\n \n You've already agreed that out of state transactions are occurring despite California's own laws, allowing foreign guns to reach domestic soil. So their continued demand for paper trails is useless and pointless, and a waste of taxpayer money. So why support a broken system that does no good? Are you so desperate that you'll spend millions to billions of dollars just in the hopes that you might catch one or two for violating an inane law?\n \n \nThe point is that a stop sign effectiveness in controlling traffic and reducing accidents isn't reflected in how many tickets are written for running it.\n\n \n Doesn't matter if that's the point or not. They're still not comparable. \n \n \nSomeone selling regularly to criminals won't be filing insurance claims.\n\n \n Selling regularly. As in making it a business to commit crimes. In other words you're talking about professionals, people who know the ins and outs. You really expect the threat of a misdemeanor to stop them?\n \n \nWhat would police think of someone who fails to report multiple times and their guns keep turning up on criminals or at crime scenes?\n\n \n It doesn't matter what the police think, it's what the evidence would support. If the evidence supports the claim that it was stolen then the police can do nothing about it. They can't just go to court and say that the evidence is wrong. Even if the person in question makes 100 separate reports of their guns being stolen, if the evidence is strong enough to support their claim then you've got absolutely nothing more than wasted taxpayer dollars.\n \n You see in this country, to make a case you need things like evidence, probable cause, motive means and opportunity, and eyewitnesses. You know, proof that would stand up in court to show a crime actually took place. Officer's intuition isn't sufficient and would never make a case.\n \n And can you show just how many guns have been recovered from crime scenes, that can be traced back to a licensed owner in California? Anything that would support the need for this law?\n \n \nCouldn't say for sure. Same for how many might be deterred from trafficking.\n\n \n So the federal standard, 10 years in prison for each gun trafficked, isn't enough to deter the illegal practice of firearms trafficking, but a 90 jail sentence and minor fine will be more than enough to stop them?\n \n \nI've seen it done for nearly everything you mention. Ever been to an exclusive club or concert?\n\n \n That has more to do with stopping pirate recordings from taking place, than it does with politically motivated lack of support for a person's constitutional rights. They're not comparable.\n \n \nThey do in many places under existing laws I don't support.\n\n \n You said commercial establishments can't discriminate. Now you're saying they can?\n \n \nI don't share your fear here. Consumer product safety testing is routine for many, many products. A firearm is a product.\n\n \n And who was it that made it necessary to ship kitchen knives with rubber covers? The consumer product safety people. They're the ones that require people to put warnings on things anyone with a brain would know is dangerous to mishandle. They're basically saying \"You're too stupid for your own good and you'd die if we weren't here to tell you when to blow your nose and when to wipe your butt.\"",

You cannot STOP, because you cannot accept the fact that we have guns, and the Constitution protects our Rights!\n ...\n Everything you do from now on, is a Scam against our Constitution, and a scam against a Right that is considered Fundamental to our Republic!\n\n Why am I so adamant, and NOW intolerant?

The Antis simply cant be trusted! \n The ( CDC) reviewed: Link   51 of the best gun control studies the WORLD had to offer  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n What did the CDC study?\n Bans on specified firearms or ammunition.\n Restrictions on firearm acquisition.\n Waiting periods for firearm acquisition.\n Firearm registration and licensing of owners\n Child access prevention laws.\n Zero tolerance laws for firearms in schools\n \n Academy of Sciences studies. Link   who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n Allow me to remind everyone about all of the Federal gun laws passed during the Gun HATING Clinton Administration.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8.

What other Constitutional Amendment has such a commitment to enforcement? The U.S. Government bent over backwards to accommodate the wishes of you Anti-gunners!\n \n But none of all of that which has been done to accommodate your wishes, is ever good enough for you guys! You always want more. \n \n Will your laws go any good? We have drugs pouring over our boarders like water from a broken dam!

Let's take a look 10 years after the what is called the most restrictive gun control in the Western World!\n \n English gun study\n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n Australian Gun Study\n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n\n All Illegal Guns!\n \n \nMaybe you have a list of \"reasonable\" gun regulations. \n\n \n I am confused here. If you mean what gun laws I think are reasonable, I have not advocated the repeal of any of our current gun laws as of yet. I like just about all of the stuff before 1968. About 22 thousand laws! Personally I don't mind the the 1934 act as I have no desire to own a fully auto Actual Assault weapon, all of which requires a license and a one time tax. Although the licensing requirement may go by by, as indicated by Scalea in Heller. Others might be better to speak on that portion of those laws than I. \n \n If you are asking me to add more gun laws, I have to say, Gun laws? What? After the 2 most exhaustive studies ever done on the effectiveness of gun control you want me to suggest more gun laws? :)\n \n \nMaybe you could admit that not everyone who might is out to abbrogate the Constitution. I won't hold my breath.\n\n Yeah, at one time I could, but that train left the station about 8 Federal gun laws ago, the CDC study, and the National Academy of Sciences study ago. That should have been all of the proof any rational man would have needed to stop the persecution of the 2nd Amendment. \n \n I sincerely hoped you guys were just looking for proof that the 2nd Amendment was in fact, Individual and the States were bound by the 2nd. However, nothing has changed! If the 2 Supreme Court Cases, (Heller and McDonald) didn't give you an appreciation for what is at stake, and did not prove that what you seek to take is Mine/Ours then nothing ever will, and I hold out no more hope for your guys! \n \n Now it is only fair to our Constitution that you have to prove it to us before I believe that. \n \n In my opinion, all that is left now, is Radical Gun Grabbers!

Perish the thought.\n \n \nBut none of all of that which has been done to accommodate your wishes, is ever good enough for you guys! You always want more.\nAnd many of you guys would abolish it all. Extremists on both sides. \n \n \nWill your laws go any good? We have drugs pouring over our borders like water from a broken dam! Even if all guns were outlawed here in the U.S., do you even suggest that the Mexican drug gangs would not start flooding the U.S. Criminal Market with guns, importing them in with their already illegal drugs, like England and Australia did, and is doing!\nWhere are the majority of weapons used by criminals, both here and in Mexico, manufactured? Amazing level of denial. \n \n \nI am confused here. If you mean what gun laws I think are reasonable, I have not advocated the repeal of any of our current gun laws as of yet. I like just about all of the stuff before 1968. About 22 thousand laws! Personally I don't mind the the 1934 act as I have no desire to own a fully auto Actual Assault weapon, all of which requires a license and a one time tax. Although the licensing requirement may go by by, as indicated by Scalea in Heller. Others might be better to speak on that portion of those laws than I.\nDo you support NICS? \n \n \nIf you are asking me to add more gun laws, I have to say, Gun laws? What? After the 2 most exhaustive studies ever done on the effectiveness of gun control you want me to suggest more gun laws? :)\nI want you to say that zero regulation is not the way to go.\n \n \n \nYeah, at one time I could, but that train left the station about 8 Federal gun laws ago, the CDC study, and the National Academy of Sciences study ago. That should have been all of the proof any rational man would have needed to stop the persecution of the 2nd Amendment. \nWould a rational man advocate for an America, for all intents and purposes, like a saloon where everyone is packing? No limits at all? \n \n \nI sincerely hoped you guys were just looking for proof that the 2nd Amendment was in fact, Individual and the States were bound by the 2nd.\nI have repeatedly offered my support for this Constitutional interpretation.\n \n \nHowever, nothing has changed! If the 2 Supreme Court Cases, (Heller and McDonald) didn't give you an appreciation for what is at stake, and did not prove that what you seek to take is Mine/Ours then nothing ever will, and I hold out no more hope for your guys!\nI guess we'll have to wait for the challenges. \n \n \nNow it is only fair to our Constitution that you have to prove it to us before I believe that.\nProving before is just absurd and can never have a place in public policy. \n \n \nIn my opinion, all that is left now, is Radical Gun Grabbers! That is all!\nI suspect you couldn't be more wrong.",

That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold.

It's not required that people have a gun to enter the Capitol through the express lane. Merely holding a valid permit, and presenting it at the entrance, will get them expedited entry.\n\n \n How about them apples ? :) emoticon_cry\n \n \n sliiiick \nI'm saying that failure to notify police that yet another weapon(s) is now in criminal hands is criminal itself. \n Someone with a pattern of non-reporting frequent \"thefts\" would definitely be worth investigating.\n\n \n Yeah?

   "You see when a right isn't absolute, negotiation of regulation is expected in a Democracy.\n\n \n No it doesn't work that way. That's not democracy, that's begging. Those aren't rights, those are government approved privileges. The Constitution allows no room for such an approach.\n \n \nI'm saying that failure to notify police that yet another weapon(s) is now in criminal hands is criminal itself.\n\n \n You've continually made this argument, but you've supplied nothing to point to any actual facts to back this up. The train stops now, it's time to put up or shut up. Provide evidence for your argument or drop the argument.\n \n The Supreme Court has already ruled that a criminal can't be compelled to incriminate themselves, as such would violate their 5th Amendment rights. Your precious mandatory reporting standards would fail just the same, because it would supposedly require potential criminals to let the police know that they broke the law by giving a gun to somebody they knew was prohibited from ownership.\n \n And that's only if you could actually catch a criminal for violating such a law. The only people who are going to suffer are those that had no intention of breaking the law in the first place.\n \n We've explained the shortcomings of your precious law to you time and time again! But like so many armchair generals before you, you stubbornly maintain an attitude of \"They don't know what they're talking about, I'm always right in what I say.\" regardless of the glaring errors in your logic.\n \n It's been explained I don't know how many times, that in order to prove guilt of a crime you need to prove that more than just a criminal act was committed, you also need to prove intent. You have to prove, in a court of law, beyond reasonable doubt that the person on trial intentionally, maliciously, and deliberately, armed a person they had every reason to know was prohibited from owning a gun in the first place. You have to prove that the defendant knew what they were doing was wrong, but they did it anyway because they simply didn't care about anything but the money they could make in doing it.\n \n And let's face it, in the cases that would be coming to trial as a result of this law, you'd never be able to prove intent to commit a crime actually existed. So all you'd ultimately be doing would be harassing the victims of crime, forcing them to expend thousands of dollars of their own money in attorney fees and court costs, just to maintain their innocence. Your push to prosecute these innocent crime victims will ultimately clog the courts and slow down the process even further, bringing it to nearly a standstill, and only delaying the more important trials that could be taking place.\n \n Why you don't care about the cold hard facts, I don't know. Could be mental deficiency, could be a \"damn them all to hell\" approach to life, could be you're just a sociopath who wants people to suffer for your own grins and giggles. Whatever the reason, it doesn't change the fact that you have no idea of what you're talking about. You're arguing points you don't understand and you're getting stomped on as a result. The facts simply aren't on your side.\n \n \n \nSomeone with a pattern of non-reporting frequent \"thefts\" would definitely be worth investigating.\n\n \n And you need a brand new law to achieve this?\n \n Explain how the current laws in place are completely inadequate for making this a reality, and the only way to achieve such is to implement yet another new and unproven law.",

   "ACLU comes around | GoUpstate.com\n \n \n \n ACLU comes around\n American Civil Liberties Union is right to help man get his guns back\n \n \n Published: Sunday, July 18, 2010 at 3:15 a.m. \n Last Modified: Friday, July 16, 2010 at 5:50 p.m. \n ( page 2 of 2 )\n \n For the first time in its history, the American Civil Liberties Union is standing up for one of our most essential liberties: the right to keep and bear arms.\n \n \n \n The ACLU recently petitioned a Florida court to get an 85-year-old man's guns returned to him from the Broward County Sheriff's Office.\n \n It's about time.\n \n Founded in 1920, the ACLU has been a fundamental player in the protection of many crucial rights. The organization's stands on free speech have often been on target, as have aspects of its civil rights crusades.\n \n But the ACLU is sometimes perceived as fighting for liberalism rather than liberties because of its support of abortion rights, opposition to capital punishment, attacks on even the most reasonable intersections between public and religious life and blanket support of affirmative action.\n \n And the national ACLU organization has never been a strong promoter of the Second Amendment, arguing that states, via \"well-regulated militias,\" rather than individuals, had the right to bear arms, though some state ACLU chapters have espoused different views on this.\n \n Mostly, the ACLU has ignored the Second Amendment, and its \"Key Issues\" Web page, which lists 15 things it is fighting for (including \"Prisoners' Rights,\" \"Immigrants' Rights\" and\" Technology and Liberty\"), does not mention the right to bear arms.\n \n Fort Lauderdale lawyer Barry Butin, a cooperating attorney for the ACLU of Florida's Broward Chapter, is representing the gun owner, 85-year-old retiree Robert Weinstein.\n \n Weinstein, a retired bar and restaurant owner, had his weapons seized in February after his wife of 61 years died. He had complained to the Broward Medical Examiner's Office that his wife's ashes had been missing for three weeks and he had not been able to bury them, and, while filing that complaint, said he \"wanted to blow his head off.\"\n \n A sheriff's deputy then visited Weinstein's house, asked for his semiautomatic pistol and his revolver, which Weinstein gave him, and took him to the hospital for an evaluation.\n \n It turned out he was just angry, not crazy, but he still hasn't gotten his guns back.\n \n \"Under the Second Amendment, he has a right to have his guns in his house, \" said Butin. \"He's not a convicted felon. It is unusual for the ACLU. But the ACLU supports all constitutional rights. We don't pick and choose.\"\n \n It will be great if that becomes the case, but it hasn't been in the past.\n \n Brandon Hensler, the ACLU of Florida's communication director, admitted as much, saying: \"This is the first time I know of in the ACLU's 90-year history that we have advocated on behalf of a citizen to have his weapons returned from law enforcement.\"\n \n This stance on the part of the ACLU is to be applauded. If the organization continues to move toward supporting all constitutional rights, and stops using so much energy supporting politically divisive movements that aren't really rights at all, the results could be phenomenal.
