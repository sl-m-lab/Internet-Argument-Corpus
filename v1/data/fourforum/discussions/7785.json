   "Answers In Genesis has a list of arguments that creationists should never use. If there were a comparable list for evolutionists, I would probably put this classic text book example of evolution in the peppered moth on that list. It's not a bad example for illustration purposes, but the typical creationist response has been that this only shows \"microevolution\" within a species. They will then dismiss this as being irrelevant to \"macroevolution\" at higher taxons. \n \n Have you ever read \"Icons of Evolution\" by Jonathon Wells? His attempts at dicrediting this study of moths by Kettlewell don't really refute the fact that natural selection does occur, but his criticisms are so often parroted on these discussion forums that you are in for a predictable onslaught whenever you bring it up. Natural selection really does happen. But showing how it occurs at the level of higher taxons is a bigger challenge and it is hard to meet that challenge by using this illustration of selection.

   "Stop if you've already read this: Over 100 years, a particular species of moth has transformed from a light colored moth to a dark colored moth.\nThe moth was Biston betularia, the peppered moth. The first record of the observation of the dark morph was in 1848. As the lichens that grew on trees in industrialized areas of Great Britain died, and as the trees (and everything else) became covered with soot, the dark morphs became more and more numerous in industrialized areas. It took about 50 years for the frequency of dark morphs to go from essentially zero to about 99% of the population. It should be noted that the light morph never did disappear from populations away from the areas polluted by soot.\n \n The marked release/capture predation experiments were done in 1953-1956 by Bernard Kettlewell, an ecologist, population geneticist and Physician from Oxford. His experiments were done before the campaign to clean up pollution of the later half of the 20th century. The campaign was so successful that the light morph is again more numerous all over Great Britain, comprising about 95% of the population.\n \nA few things need to be understood before explaining this. There are people who argue against evolution and don't know the definition. I'll use an abrupt but hopefully succinct definition of evolution: the gradual change over time due to natural selection.\nI would add some very important specifications to that definition, as well as take one away. First, evolution is not just change, gradual or otherwise. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies of alleles in a population over time. That is to say, it is the genetic, heritable makeup of a population that undergoes the change. Moreover, while natural selection is extremely important, it is not the sole mechanism of evolution. Before natural selection can change the genetic makeup of a population, there must be a source of genetic diversity for selection to act upon. The methods by which that diversity arises are also mechanisms of evolution, i.e., those mechanisms cause changes in the allele frequency in the population.\n \n Since it is so significant to evolutionary theory, it cannot be stressed enough that it is populations that evolve, not individuals, and that populations evolve by changes in the total genome of the population from generation to generation.\n \nThere are also people who believe the world is only a few thousand years old; I cannot argue with these people as our reality is inherently different. Mine has people using radiometric measurements and their reality has \"just because.\"\nOr they postulate that an old book of mythology is an historical record. Anything, even observed reality, that conflicts with that mythology is rejected.\n \nA moth in a forest of pale trees used to have similar light coloring as the trees. This made it difficult for the birds to find them. However, humans brought about the Industrial Revolution and pollution. This pollution gradually darkened the trees. The light moths were easy pickings for the birds. Generations pass, and the darker moths lived longer and reproduced more than their lighter relatives. After awhile (a little over 100 years) this species of moth is now dark with no light moths remaining. The actual species changed color! Isn't that amazing?\nYes. It is amazing. However, the change took place in about 50 years, and the change back to predominantly light moths also took about 50 years.\n \n There is some discussion about the methodology employed by Kettlewell in his experiments. Michael Majerus reviewed these in his recent book. He concluded that Kettlewell did very well with the technology available to him, and that while the experiments may not have been perfect, the most logical conclusion is that the change in color of the peppered moth is an example of evolution by natural selection. Dr. Ken Miller does a better job of explaining so I'll just link his discussion. The Peppered Moth - An Update\n \nFor those who believe the world is millions upon millions of years old, you can see that 100 years for a color change in a species is quite fast.\nAnd changing in about 50 years twice in the space of 150 years is even faster.\n \nYou can also see how if something can change color in only 100 years, something else can take millions of years to develop intelligence to make use of technology.\nThat may be true, but I suspect that the differential reproduction of a morph of a species of moth is too little evidence on which to base millions of years of human evolution.\n \nPlease, someone argue about how the moth species transforming from light to dark (gradual change) over 100 years (over time) due to predation (natural selection) is not proof of evolution.\nOK. Quite simply, scientific theories aren't ever actually proved. There is the possibility that there exists other data that will cause a change. Besides, the color change is an observation - the fact - that is explained by the theory, i.e., differential reproductive success of certain morphs in a given environment.\n \nOnly the most ignorant can claim the \"intelligent designer\" decided to make the moths dark. (Most ID supporters here make somewhat intelligent, albeit illogical, arguments.)\nTrue, but they won't argue that. They will argue that Kettlewell's experiments were faked. They will shout loudly about how he glued moths to trees and them watched as birds ate them just to see if they actually ate the more visible moths in greater numbers. They will also claim that peppered moths don't rest on the trunks of trees. Actually, they do sometimes. Creationists will never talk about the release/capture experiments.",

Since definitions are only useful conventions of meaning, they can vary considerably depending on what particular aspect of biology is being considered. The most common is the Biological Species Concept (BSC) wherein a species is defined as a group of individuals fully fertile inter se, but barred from interbreeding with other similar groups by its physiology. Then there is the Evolutionary Species Concept, the Phylogenetic Species Concept, the Recognition Species Concept, the Cohesion Species Concept, the Ecological Species Concept, and the Internodal Species Concept.

Especially when the non-scientist disagrees for religious reasons.\n \nThere is a distinct line between micro and macro evolution.\nNo, there's not.\n \nThe line is whether or not the final specimen cannot procreate with the orgininal.\nThen you are saying that horses and donkeys are the same species? And lions and tigers are the same species? And brown bears and polar bears are the same species?\n \n Here's one for you. The European herring gull of northern Europe ranges out over the Atlantic to the Shetlands, Iceland, southern Greenland to North America. The populations from Europe are inter-fertile - in fact, there really is no line that separates one from the other. The American herring gull ranges across the entire northern part of North America to Alaska (and even south to the Gulf Coast). American herring gulls interbreed with Vega herring gulls from eastern Siberia and it takes an expert to tell them apart. But the Vega herring gull interbreeds with Birula's gull to the west, which interbreeds with Heuglin's gull farther to the west, which interbreeds with the Siberian lesser black-backed gull on to the west, which interbreeds with the lesser black-backed gull. As you can see, these gulls from the European herring gull to the lesser black-backed gull form a single, contiguous and continuously interbreeding population of gulls. That population circles the globe such that the lesser black-backed gull shares the same range in northern Europe as the European herring gull. The problem is, they look remarkably different and they do not interbreed. They are separate species. (Larus argentatus and L. fuscus)",

   "I never said I hadn't gotten my information from religous sources. I merely wanted to contradict the statement that I was \"parroting various religous websites\".\nOK, then. You are parroting a single religious source who is parroting various other religious sources.\n \nI recieved most of the information of which I speak from my Associate Pastor. He is very learned.\nBut apparently, not very learned in science in general and biology in particular.\n \nMuch of what he taught me came directly from books written by scientists who converted to Christianity because in trying to prove Evolution, they realized that there is actually more scientific evidence to prove Intellegent Design (which I first heard about from my Associate Pastor) than there is to prove Evolution\nThat's a myth. It just goes to show that christians don't have a problem with lying. I don't know of a single qualified scientist who earned his science degrees before becoming a creationist. It just doesn't happen. It is always the case that these \"scientists\" are creationists first, most often before they even get to college. Most usually, these \"scientists\" write books that have nothing to do with their scientific qualifications. For example, Henry Morris was a hydraulics engineer, Jonathan Sarfati is a physical chemist, Duane Gish is a biochemist, as is Michael Behe, William Dembski is a mathematician, and on and on. It's a bit like consulting your plumber when you are sick when you consult hydraulics engineers about biology.\n \nAnother good argument against Evolution is math.\nIf by \"good argument\" you mean not worth a tick, then right.\n \nMathematicians have proved that it is less likely that a single cell could have eventually developed into a complex creature, than there is a chance that a tornado can make its way through a junk yard and create a jet plane with the random pieces of junk.\nTrite, senseless junk. Show me the mathematical proof. Why do you think that jet planes are interbreeding organisms? Why do you feel that any organism sprang into being in its present state without any intermediate forms going from replicating molecules to the modern organism.\n \nIf you want me to find some definite sources, such as books, for you to look at (since, I don't think you believe my information is fact) I'd be happy to email my Pastor and ask for the titles of his sources. No doubt he'll know their names off the top of his head.\nAnd no doubt everyone here will be familiar with those sources. Most of us have read more creationist XXXX than you can dream is possible. You see, most of us at least have had the integrity to learn the basics of what we oppose. I would bet that most people on this board are more knowledgeable than your associate pastor about IDCreationism and creationism.",

   "well then, what theory do you believe in?\n\n \n I wasn't very clear. What I was saying is that the big bang theory best fits all the available evidence. What was before the big bang? Who knows. Space/time didn't exist then.\n \n \n \naccording to YOUr principals, everything had to be created by something(though this doesnt indicate God).\n\n No. As he stated: \n \nMatter and energy exist. They either started de novo or have been around forever or some other explanation.\n\n \n \nWhat would it be like if nothing existed?\n\n No one really knows. Unlike you however, we don't need to depend on an invisible man in the sky to explain it. We're happy with \"I don't know, but I want to find out\"\n \n \nthere could be one thing that neednt be described by anything that we can understand. Something that neednt be created, for it doesnt conform to the laws in which we believe\n\n Before the big bang these \"laws in which we believe\" didn't exist, so...\n \n \nAnything that applies to EArth or space cannot be used to limit this creator.\n\n Except the expectations of a YEC\n \n \nYou are fools, and I pity you for it.\n\n Says the guy who can't grasp basic high school science...\n \n \nI'm the only one here with enough sense to KNOW that a God exists because nothing is explainable otherwise.\n\n If you KNOW that \"a God\" exists, you must have some pretty good evidence. Care to share? BTW, which god is it? I hope it's Thor, I always liked him.\n \n \nAnyone who tells me that this information is not relevant, you can just go sit in a corner somewhere and think about how stupid you sound denying something higher than youself.\n\n What I am denying is the idea that you are in any way educated about the topic you are lecturing on.\n \n \n \nSometimes the only thing that explains the unexplainable IS the unexplainable. \n\n Great! So we can take all that money that's being funneled into medical research and build churches with it! After all if it's unexplainable, why bother? That makes it all so much easier. Thanks!\n \n \nyour theory will always require something to be there first. Mine doesnt.\n\n Sure it does. It requires god. Where'd he come from? What did he do before he created the heavens and the earth? \n \n \nGod cannot be described as something, becasue he is much more than that, or anything a fool such as yourself can imagine.\n\n I'd watch who you're calling a fool, since it's pretty obvious that you'll swallow, without question, any tripe a person in a position of authority feeds you. \n \n \n Oh, and by the way, even if you can somehow prove, absolutely, positively, without a doubt, that god created the universe, it does nothing to dent the ToE, since the ToE says nothing about cosmology.",

Philosophers have been having that discussion for centuries - Descartes, Thomas Acquinas, and many, many more. If you want to explore the topic as it has been discussed by great minds, there is the place to start. It is purely a philosophical question. There can be no proof of God and it seems to me that seeking empirical evidence for support of one's faith-based beliefs is pointless.\n \n You seem to have a very sheltered view of the world. My experience tells me that much of Christian teaching fosters that insular view.

One of the biggest lies that some Christians profess is that science is somehow anti-religion. Science just tries to explain the world and it does so with scientific methods and tools. How could it operate any other way? If some scientific ideas conflict with your faith, you have to resolve that somehow. A great many scientists are religious and they make their peace with it and do not see any conflict.

   "I was actually hoping to receive the onslaught from the creationists. I considered that post more as bait to begin a logical discussion for evolution vs creationism. I wanted to hear -- from a creationist -- why one can concede to evolution within a species within just 100 years, but can never agree to macroevolution across the span of hundreds of millions of years. It's tantamount to believing each species of creature now has always been here and has only transformed through microevolution. (Well, maybe the cockroach. Those things are the best, albeit icky, animal survival machines:P) Besides, there are many examples of macroevolution which would be brought up as a creationist ignorantly believes this never happens. Of course, the end result would be that the creationist will not concede because s/he cannot think logically, which is why they're a creationist in the first place.\n\n \n Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have).

Whether the reason is ignorance of the topics or just irrationality I don't know. You're in good company though. Philip Johnson wrote a book on the topic and his logic is non-existent. I guess maybe even attorneys get confused when they place dogma ahead of clear thinking.\n \nThe difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple.

You make yourself look foolish when you post such nonsense.\n \nIf this is possible I pose a few questions for you.\n \n 1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?\nHow do you know they haven't? Since new, previously unknown organisms are being discovered all the time, how do you know that they didn't form just a few years before they were discovered? Besides that, living creatures aren't made from \"inorganic compounds;\" they are made from organic compounds. I guess that is a bit of that tax attorney logic.\n \n2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not?\nHere's a clue. Inorganic compounds aren't able to decide anything.\n \n Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?\nGee. Good question. Why didn't everyone in your high school graduating class become an accountant and a tax attorney?\n \n3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is?\nBy the age of the stratum in which it is found.\n \nEvery evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it!\nIs that logic or a lie?\n \nThat's a classical example of circular reasoning.\nYes. It is also a classic example of a creationist straw man. It demonstrates that you haven't bothered to learn the most basic ideas of the topic and that you are willing to let some creationist hack dupe you. The methods of dating fossils was first developed by creationists when they discovered that certain suites of fossils were always found in the same order in geological strata. They reasoned that the deeper the fossils were, the older they were. Thus, they assigned relative ages to certain types of strata. Of course, their estimates of actual age were way off, since they thought that the earth was only a few million years old. We now have several methods of radiometric dating and can more accurately determine the ages of fossils. The relative dating methods of the creationist scientists has been confirmed - the dates are just older than they thought.\n \nI am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do.\nYou didn't have to tell us that you aren't a scientist.

This article also has many links to other articles with even more information.\n\n \n Wow, that post was so long ago:)\n 1)Human memory isn't long at all. I'll find the book that explained how a few scientists in labs examined self-replicating molecules and their habits. These molecules would grab what they needed to \"reproduce.\" No one has the time to sit through millions of years of an experiment with these, but is it impossible for mutations to occur with any of these molecules? I'll await your answer to that, while I scan my books, but surely you'll already see where it's leading.\n \n 2) I have to think you're half-joking. I want to answer seriously though. First, humans are apes. We are the \"hairless\" apes, or \"naked\" apes. I think you may mean evolve into some earlier primate. Humans haven't evolved into earlier primates for the same reason zebras haven't evolved into whales (or why drug resistant bacteria don't evolve into non-resistant bacteria). Currently, there are no pressures or forces to cause evolution of these species into that direction (well, maybe for some people I've met:). The zebra may evolve into a whale, but it would have to find itself needing to swim, communicate, eat and reproduce in the ocean. The drug resistant bacteria remains resistant because we use drugs to fight them. The ones that aren't resistant are killed, and the resistant ones live on to make us call off work.\n \n 3)I can't answer why every evolutionist you've asked would answer that way. Instead of paying particular attention to fossils, do you know how anyone determines the age of a rock or skeleton?\n \n I have to admit that the jab against the logic abilities of creationists was incendiary. I wasn't getting responses from creationists and believed I had to play upon emotions to get a response. I know that creationists can think logically, just like Scientologists. The Scientologist may be able to logically deduce, using math, that a deal at one grocery store is better than another. But they choose to ignore logical thought when it comes to questions about the beginnings of mankind. Hail Xenu.\n \n Does anyone happen to have a non-creationist link that argues against evolution? The two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, and if the theory of evolution is as weak as some creationists state, I'd believe there would be many websites from non-creationist scientists disparaging evolution as well.",

   "I'm not sure that anybody will bother to view this thread anymore,...\nWell, since it has been resurected, I thought that I might as well respond. Previously only Collin gave a short response and I thought I would expand.\n \n...but earlier on somebody claimed that there aren't different kinds of evolution. They claimed that micro- and macro-evolution weren't real.\nYou misunderstood the part of the discussion that you read and apparently didn't read a great deal of it. No one claimed that macro and micro evolution weren't real. What was said was that the terms aren't used much by biologists. I even gave a history of the origin of the words. I gave an example of a ring species - some gulls of the genus Larus. They form a huge population that encircles the northern hemisphere below the Arctic. While all populations can and do interbreed with adjacent populations, the extremes (the European herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull) do not interbreed. As I mentioned, it isn't clear if the can. However, the accumulation of genetic differences in the extremes of this population has resulted in the fact that differences in appearance, mating behavior, and/or mating call prevents these two species from recognizing each other as possible mates. Thus, small genetic changes (microevolution) has accumulated to create a new species (macroevolution).\n \nIf that is true, then I have a question. Supposedly, human beings evolved from apes and bacteria can evolve to defend against antibiotics. Both of these cases are examples of evolution. However, in one case you are left with a brand new species. In the other case, you are left with an improved form of the same bacteria. Wouldn't this be two different forms of evolution? One type produces a new species altogether while the other type simply improves, alters, or creates a new trait in an existing species.\nOne thing that is confusing you is probably the fact that you have chosen an asexually reproducing organism and are trying to compare it to sexually reproducing organisms (a whole bunch of them).\n \n If by ape you mean one of the extant species that we call \"ape,\" then you are talking nonsense. However, if you mean a lineage from which humans and modern apes have descended, then OK. It is true that we would probably call that ancient primate an ape if it were alive today. We share a common ancestor with the apes, specifically, we share a common ancestor with the two species of chimpanzee, and that ancestor shares a common ancestor with the gorilla, etc.\n \n So you are comparing an event in which an asexually reproducing organism, because of an already existing allele has a better chance to survive than other like organisms with other alleles. Thus, resistant strains of bacteria survive while others die. Decidedly microevolution.\n \n On the other hand, you are talking about a sexually reproducing organisms that have been accumulating genetic differences for millions of years, even to the extent that there have been many speciation events in both lineages. As Collin put it, you are comparing microevolution with macro-macro-macro-macro-macro-macro-macro-macroevolution. It muddies the water when you do that.",

The moths do land on both the trunk and the branches.\n \n Kettlewell performed several experiments in several locations. However, creationists tend to concentrate on a single experiment.\n \nFurthermore even if Kettlewell's flawed procedure could give accurate results,\nActually, Kettlewell's procedures aren't all that flawed.

However, the dominant f. carbonaria was observed to make up about 99% of the population. When you consider that a significant proportion of that population were heterozygous, that would easily explain why the f. typica survived. Moreover, the f. typica survived quite nicely in rural areas away from the polution and it has never been shown that finding them in industrial areas was not the result of migration.\n \nThe light colored moths survived in places where air pollution supposedly gave the dark moths an advantage while dark colored moths survived in places where there was not enough pollution to hide them.\nAs explained above, it would be expected if one actually had a grasp of population genetics. The fact that the f. carbonaria was found (and continues to be found) in unpoluted areas is easily understandable since it is the dominant form.\n \nOn the surface the moths show an aspect of natural selection that no Darwinist wants to admit: Natural selection strives to maintain as much genetic diversity as possible going so far as to preserve phenotypes that are currently dangerous to certain individuals so as to insure the survival of the species in case the detrimental genes are needed to adapt to a future and different environment.\nI can't say it any better than Collin did, so I'll just repeat; \"that's silly.\" It seems that you have failed to understand even the most basic principles of natural selection. Natural selection doesn't strive to do anything. It is a statistical tendency for some organisms to produce more offspring than others. It is differential reproductive success. In fact, natural selection does not maintain genetic diversity but tends to reduce it, along with sexual selection and genetic drift. The trouble with you creationists is that you wish to inject intelligence into everthing and therefore fail to understand basic concepts.\n \nBTW: I have a bachelor's degree in biology from Emory University.

Yet another creationist with a degree in science who is a scientific illiterate. Didn't you pay attention in clase?\n \nI don't consider Darwinism or Creationism to be legitimate science.\nActually, you ring like a typical creationist without any knowledge of evolutionary biology. It is very atypical for a qualified biologist to talk about evolutionary science as \"Darwinism.\" By the way, Darwinism was confirmed in all major precepts many times over by the scientific processes that you claim don't exist.

By 1900 they comprised about 99% of the population in industrialized areas. That was maintained for about 50 years until environmental cleanup reversed the pollution. As a result, the population numbers have reversed and are now about 95% f. typica in industrialized areas, and a bit more in rural areas.\n \n But, of course, this isn't surprising since it is less likely that any gene will be eliminated in a large population. I guess you aren't aware that the population of Biston betularia is quite large. You also seem unaware, even though you mentioned it (I guess your ignorance is intentional), that there was a large reservoir of the f. typica gene outside of the industrialized areas.

The results are in good agreement with indirect estimates, obtained by comparison of orthologous human and chimpanzee pseudogenes. The average direct estimate of the combined rate of all mutations is 1.8x10(-8) per nucleotide per generation, and the coefficient of variation of this rate across the 20 loci is 0.53. Single nucleotide substitutions are approximately 25 times more common than all other mutations, deletions are approximately three times more common than insertions, complex mutations are very rare, and CpG context increases substitution rates by an order of magnitude. There is only a moderate tendency for loci with high per locus mutation rates to also have higher per nucleotide substitution rates, and per nucleotide rates of deletions and insertions are statistically independent on the per locus mutation rate. Rates of different kinds of mutations are strongly correlated across loci. Mutational hot spots with per nucleotide rates above 5x10(-7) make only a minor contribution to human mutation. In the next decade, direct measurements will produce a rather precise, quantitative description of human spontaneous mutation at the DNA level.\n \n\n \n That basically works out to about 100 mutations per human per generation.\n \n \n The species is supposed to be the only taxon that is determined by nature.

So, lets go with the lowest mutation rate of 0.2% (0.002). That's not actually that rare. Conservative rates of mutation are more in the line of 0.00001. Your quote is saying that there is about 1 mutation per every 2,000 gametes produced in a population, and that is on the Y chromosome alone.\n \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11792858\n \n \"Our results suggest that the average mammalian genome mutation rate is 2.2 x 10(-9) per base pair per year...\"\nYes, rare. But when you look at the shear numbers involved you get a different picture from the one you are trying to paint. In a genome of 3 billion base pairs, a rate of 2.2 x 10^-9 comes out to about 6.6 mutations per individual per year. Take that times the 9 billion human population and you get about 59.4 trillion mutations/year.\n \nhttp://www.emunix.emich.edu/~rwinning/genetics/mutat.htm\n \n \"E. coli has a spontaneous mutation rate of 1/108 (one error in every 108 nucleotides replicated). Humans have a higher spontaneous mutation rate: between 1/106 and 1/105\"\n So in the human genome, taking the lower rate there are about 500 million mutations per replication - 1 for every 106 base pairs in a genome of 3 billion base pairs.\n \nThe species is supposed to be the only taxon that is determined by nature.\nDon't be silly. \"species\" is a definition invented by humans. I am familiar with 7 different definitions of species.\n \nTwo organisms are part of the same species if they can mate and produce offspring that can mate and produce offspring.\nThat is the (badly stated) Biological Species Concept, usually just called the BSC by biologists.\n \nSince scientists have not conducted breeding experiments with all known types of organisms, we don't really know what can mate with what; we don't know where all of the species boundaries lie.\nSo what? How does that change the definition of species? Why is it necessary to try to interbreed all living organisms in order to come up with a definition?\n \n[ For example, dogs and wolves have traditionally been classified as members of different species. But, because enough fertile wolf-dog hybrids are now known a few years ago dogs were re-classified and placed in the same species as wolves.\nWhat do you mean by \"a few years ago?\" As far back as I can remember it has been well understood that dogs and wolves can interbreed (check out the 1908 novella by Jack London - \"The Call of the Wild.\" So what if a revision of taxonomy has now placed them in the same species? Should we put the Red Wolf and the Coyote in the same species? They interbreed so commonly that it is believed that Red Wolf populations in Texas are actually all coyote hybrids. Besides that, not even all dogs are capable of interbreeding, i.e., it is impossible in the first place or all attempts result in death of the embryo. Do we need to put some dogs into different species than others?\n \nAs far as Genesis is concerned, dogs and wolves would be the same created kind. A kind can diversify, but whether or not the kind can become separate species depends greatly on how precise your definition of species is.\nSo now you are going to fuzzy up your definition of species? Which of the other 6 species concepts do you want to use now? Moreover, why bring mythology into a discussion of biology? While you're at it, please define \"kind\" in a way that is biologically meaningful and then give examples of a \"created kind\" that we can go and look at. What do you propose are the limits that would prevent a taxonomist from classifying a divergent population in a separate taxonomic family? There must be some specific, empirical ways to recognize these boundaries between \"created kinds.\"\n \nThe fact that we observe evolution on a daily basis destroys your idea of \"limits.\"\nIn what species can you observe evolution on a daily basis?\nBacteria was the example given, but of course, you're going to have to use a different species concept if you want to discuss that. The one you gave doesn't fit. However, changes in bacterial populations do fit the definition of evolution.\n \nChange maybe, but is mere change speciation, which is what Darwinism is supposed to lead to?\nChange can be speciation and lots of change is even more likely to be speciation. Above you were admitting that speciation can occur and now you are denying it. Pick a horse and ride it, cowboy. Go back and try to learn what \"Darwinism\" is supposed to lead to. You seem to have difficulty in distinguishing between observation and theory.\n \nWhether or not the Darwinian ape to man scenario is possible does depend on how Darwinian mechanisms allow species and higher taxa to develop. If you cannot comprehend this simple fact, you cannot comprehend Darwinism.\nIsn't that funny. You of all people talking about comprehending Darwinism. Why don't you please tell us the 5 theories that comprise classical Darwinism. Please tell us the additional theories that are included in neo-Darwinism. Please tell us about the modern synthesis.\n \nSome Creationists say the kind is the genus. Others say it is a higher taxon. Other than that the kind is likely not the same as the species, I cannot say either way because I have not studied the issue in depth.\nNeither do you seem to have studied biology in depth. The reason why there is so much differing opinion among creationists as to the definition of kind is that they must reduce the numbers in order to cram the millions of species onto the ark, so they move the definition up the taxonomic scale and them propose evolution at huge rates to produce the species, all the while denying that evolution is possible. Tell us about the kinds on the ark.\n \nI will, however, reiterate the reclassification of dogs and wolves.\nAnd I will reiterate, so what?\n \nWe simply don't know how many species exist or what organisms each species contains. So defining the kind may not be possible with our current knowledge.\nBut you haven't even begun to suggest the means by which we should be able to recognize a \"kind.\" There have to be some boundaries that evolution cannot cross. Give us an example of the evolution of some species that has reached the boundary.\n \nCop out. Are you saying the likes of Johanson and the Leakey's are not Darwinists? Why do they spend their time looking for missing links if they are not trying to prove Darwinissm?\nAnother example of your inability to understand basic concepts. Why are creationist XXXXXX searching for Noah's ark if they aren't trying to prove that it's true? Why do creationists use the non-concept of \"the missing link\" so often?

   "Stop if you've already read this: Over 100 years, a particular species of moth has transformed from a light colored moth to a dark colored moth.\n A few things need to be understood before explaining this. There are people who argue against evolution and don't know the definition. I'll use an abrupt but hopefully succinct definition of evolution: the gradual change over time due to natural selection.\n There are also people who believe the world is only a few thousand years old; I cannot argue with these people as our reality is inherently different. Mine has people using radiometric measurements and their reality has \"just because.\"\n A moth in a forest of pale trees used to have similar light coloring as the trees. This made it difficult for the birds to find them. However, humans brought about the Industrial Revolution and pollution. This pollution gradually darkened the trees. The light moths were easy pickings for the birds. Generations pass, and the darker moths lived longer and reproduced more than their lighter relatives. After awhile (a little over 100 years) this species of moth is now dark with no light moths remaining. The actual species changed color! Isn't that amazing?\n For those who believe the world is millions upon millions of years old, you can see that 100 years for a color change in a species is quite fast. You can also see how if something can change color in only 100 years, something else can take millions of years to develop intelligence to make use of technology.\n Please, someone argue about how the moth species transforming from light to dark (gradual change) over 100 years (over time) due to predation (natural selection) is not proof of evolution. Only the most ignorant can claim the \"intelligent designer\" decided to make the moths dark. (Most ID supporters here make somewhat intelligent, albeit illogical, arguments.)\n\n \n The moth didnt evolve into a new colour in any way, it's just proof of natural selection!\n \n At first, the lighter form of this moth was more common than the darker form. This lighter type blended well into the lighter-colored trunks of trees and so was more protected from birds. But then, because of years of pollution from industrial areas, tree trunks became darkened. Now the moths' lighter color worked against them, as birds could pick them out faster and eat them. Consequently the darker variety of peppered moth, which is said to be a mutant, survived better because it was difficult for birds to see them against the soot-darkened trees. The darker variety rapidly became the dominant type.\n \n But was the peppered moth evolving into some other type of insect? No, it was still exactly the same peppered moth, merely having a different coloration. Hence, the English medical journal On Call referred to using this example to try to prove evolution as \"notorious.\" It declared: \"This is an excellent demonstration of the function of camouflage, but, since it begins and ends with moths and no new species is formed, it is quite irrelevant as evidence for evolution.\"\n \n Natural selection isn't anything to do with evolution, it has nothing to do with how we supposedly developed from apes! Natural selection is how God created us. Some animals survive purely by luck / chance, not just because they're fitter. Can you evolutionists explain what the purpose is of the vast multitude of animal life? Why do plants NEED to have different colours, why do we need to see in colour? Surely we can survive without it? We beleive that God made us like this for our pleasure.\n \n God uses genes as our program, we become what our genes say. Genes don't change into something new!\n \n Here's a thought for you:\n \n What chance would there be for a complicated gene to originate by natural selection through \"random mutations\" over billions of years? \"The chances are, then, still unimaginably small (10&#8722;415) that a proper DNA molecule would be produced in this time,\" writes biologist Frank B. Salisbury in the scientific journal Nature. \"Unimaginably small\"! One chance out of 1 followed by 415 zeros!\n \n And we're talking about just one DNA molecule!\n \n Wouldn't it be easier just to accept that we must have been designed just like a car or a house was?",

Change into another type of insect is not necessary for evolution. Wouldn't it be better if you learned the basics of what you go on about before you speak?\n \nNo, it was still exactly the same peppered moth, merely having a different coloration. Hence, the English medical journal On Call referred to using this example to try to prove evolution as \"notorious.\" It declared: \"This is an excellent demonstration of the function of camouflage, but, since it begins and ends with moths and no new species is formed, it is quite irrelevant as evidence for evolution.\"\nDon't you just love out of context quotes! The case of the peppered moths is quite a nice example of evolution by natural selection. Too bad that you knowledge of the subject is so limited.\n \nNatural selection isn't anything to do with evolution,\nActually, natural selection is one of the mechanisms of evolution. There is more to it than that, but creationists with limited knowledge can't figure that out.\n \nit has nothing to do with how we supposedly developed from apes!\nWhy do you think that we developed from apes? Why do you think that that particular idea is necessary to the theory of evolution?\n \nNatural selection is how God created us.\nCould you give us a little detail about that? Exactly how is it that your god used differential reproductive success to create \"us.\" Define \"us.\" Was Homo erectus \"us\"? How about Cro-Magnon?\n \nSome animals survive purely by luck / chance, not just because they're fitter.\nHow is that relevant to the theory of evolution? Do you understand so little about what you claim to oppose?\n \nCan you evolutionists explain what the purpose is of the vast multitude of animal life? Why do plants NEED to have different colours, why do we need to see in colour? Surely we can survive without it?\nNow what are you talking about? Why do we need clouds? What is the purpose of up?\n \nWe beleive that God made us like this for our pleasure.\nIt is so nice to see creationists substitute magic and mythology for observation of reality.\n \nDarwin didn't even mention that in \"On the Origin of Species,\" the book that developed his theories of evolution.\nHave you read \"On the Origin of Species\"? Then how do you know? And if he didn't mention it, how is that even relevant to the theories that he did develop. Please name at least three of the theories that Darwin developed in that book.\n \nGod uses genes as our program, we become what our genes say. Genes don't change into something new!\nActually, they do. For example, a single gene in the peppered moth mutated to cause the dark morph. Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moth. We know of many, many mutations in all organisms.\n \nHere's a thought for you:\n \n What chance would there be for a complicated gene to originate by natural selection through \"random mutations\" over billions of years? \"The chances are, then, still unimaginably small (10&#8722;415) that a proper DNA molecule would be produced in this time,\" writes biologist Frank B. Salisbury in the scientific journal Nature. \"Unimaginably small\"! One chance out of 1 followed by 415 zeros!\nGreat! More out of context quotes. Is this Frank B. Salisbury the plant physiologist that is also a Mormon creationist? I thought so. I'll bet you don't even understand why the numbers are nonsense, do you? It's an old trick often used by creationists. Since creationists assume that everything arose in one event caused by a magical being, the odds calculated are those that such an event can happen by chance.\n \nAnd we're talking about just one DNA molecule!\nNo you're not. You don't actually know what you are talking about, do you? You got all of that claptrap in church, didn't you?\n \nWouldn't it be easier just to accept that we must have been designed just like a car or a house was?\nSure. Easier if we didn't want to know anything about our world. Your solution is not to ask questions. You want to substitute mythology and magic for reason and logic. You want others to do your thinking for you and you are willing to accept that they actually did any thinking.",

Although it is sometimes referred to as the \"white morph\", it isn't white. In fact, the coloration of the f. typica is the reason that it is called the peppered moth. Your usual lack of command of language makes your point a bit fuzzy. Are you claiming that the two alleles are not expressed in the two phenotypes? Or are you saying that I made such a stupid claim? Nevertheless, the dominant allele (call it W) when either homozygous or heterozygous results in the f. carbonaria. The recessive allele (call it w) results in f. typica only when homozygous. In other words, the genotypes WW and Ww always produce f. carbonaria while only ww produces f. typica. And yes, it was first observed in 1848.\n \nThis, in and of itself, is no evidence that it did not exist before that date.\nBut it is evidence that it was extremely rare. It is also evidence that your babble about the environment causing the genome to change is wrong. The gene existed before there was any environmental reason for it to exist. In other words, it was a mutation.\n \nMoreover, colour morphs in moths and butterflies are a very fascinating and mysterious phenomenon, along with much more complicated examples of camouflage and mimicry to be discovered throughout their world. So, as he says, the mere fact of two morphs in one species is proof of nothing.\nExcept that the colors of Biston betularia are not complicated. The color is caused by a single gene. The only complication is that there are actually three other alleles that have been discovered that product phenotypes that are intermediate. This is an uncomplicated case that is not related to mimicry.\n \nThis is quite odd, since the whole point of the \"peppered moth\" controversy is that it was held up as the first evidence of the validity of Darwin's claim that evolution was driven by a mechanism he called, \"Natural Selection\".\nExactly! It is evidence of evolution by means of natural selection. Perhaps you don't understand the meaning of the word dominant in biology either. I used the term correctly above. Dominant is the opposite of recessive. It is a genetic term that means that the dominant allele will always produce the phenotype of the organism when present. The expression of that allele dominates the expression of the recessive allele.\n \nThe premise being that originally light moths became/'evolved into' dark moths as a result of adapting to the blanket of soot caused by the industrial revolution of the early 19th century, and later revised to say that both morphs pre-existed the 'revolution', but that their relative numbers fluctuated in relation to the levels of soot, with the lighter morph regaining numerical superiory once England's soot levels dropped after WWII. Pretty much just what 'evolution's fake' just said.\nVery poorly expressed, perhaps due to your lack of command of the language. Actually, the moths didn't \"evolve into\" anything. Over generations, the dark morph had an adaptive advantage that gave it differential reproductive success over the light morph in highly polluted areas. Actually, that's what \"evolution's fake\" repeated from the post above. However, he, like you, misuse the word dominant. When you say that the black morph is dominant, you are not saying what you think you are saying. It could comprise less than 2% of the population (as it currently does) and it would still be the dominant allele (as it is).\n \nEven more odd, this assertion seems to directly contradict what pandion had just finished saying, that is, \"Actually, it was a new color.\". How does pandion put that together with, \"Actually, the black morph was always dominant.\" Does he mean, 'from 1848 on'? Where does he get his \"facts\", I wonder?\nIt makes perfect sense if you actually understand biology and genetics. Always a good idea before you discuss it. You make yourself look so foolish. Indeed from the moment the first gene mutated to form the new allele, that allele was dominant while the previously single allele became recessive. The black allele was always dominant.\n \nOr so say the geneticists. The rest of the world considers their self-serving definition of evolution, (i.e., as nothing more than a temporary change/fluctuation in allele statistics from the viewpoint of heredity), as a vacuous absurdity that has nothing in common with evolutionary biology,(i.e., the search for 'origins', the mechanism that introduces novelty and complexity to organismic morphology and behaviour). Best you got over your little dogmatic, tendentious, and absurd assumptions before you speak, pandion.\nWouldn't it be better if you learned the basics of what you go on about before you speak?

One that immediately became the dominant allele. If this is true, then the dark, dominant allele should always produce more dark moths than light, soot or no soot. It would be the mechanical cause I mentioned above, a principle of heredity. So much for \"natural selection\" as the cause of a preponderance of dark moths, since two out of three chances are that you'll get dark offspring when dark and light moths mate, and dark is dominant. \n If they don't mate, then voluntary sexual separation would make them different species, would it not?\n \n Not only is there no evolution to be found in the mere preponderance of dark moths in the mid-nineteenth century through to the mid-twentieth, apparently there's a perfectly normal genetic inheritance mechanism to account for it.

The ratio is 1:1 when a heterozygous parent is crossed with a homozygous recessive parent. Two heterozygotes will produce a ratio of 3:1. Two homozygous dominant parents will always produce dark offspring, two homozygous recessive parents will always produce light offspring, and a homozygous dominant parent crossed with a heterozygous parent will always produce dark offspring.

Since achondroplasia is caused by a dominant allele, why aren't most people \"little people\"? Huntington described Huntington's disease in 1872, so by now everyone should have Huntington's disease, right?\n These are tamer ones. Imagine a dominant allele that increased your chances of being killed before producing offspring by a significant amount. Say that 75% of people with brown eyes were killed. The relative number of people with brown eyes would decrease.\n \n \nBut, seeing you are such a knowledgeable individual, maybe you could clarify all the confusing issues I've just pointed out wrt pandion's seemingly self-contradictory comments?\n\n 1848 was the first recorded observation of the dark morphs, so he's starting from there, when the frequency of these morphs was 2%. But this has nothing to do with whether the gene is genetically dominant. This is my best guess for the source of your confusion: You don't understand basic genetics. Judging by the above, I think it's a damn good guess.\n \n I don't like pandering to ignorance.

   "**\n \n **\n A few final comments. \n 1/Kettlewell himself says that he pinned moths to tree trunks in order to make his point about 'natural selection', not simply to make nice photographs demonstrating 'camouflage' to pre-schoolers . (Any kid over five already knows how camouflage and mimicry work. They don't need some pompous pedant to \"explain the obvious\" to them with a set of slides.\n 2/ Kettlewell's work, and that of other darwinists before him, was all a tendentious and deliberate effort to come up with empirical support for a darwinist explanation of industrial melanism. ('Industrial melanism' being the observed fact of relative statistical population fluctuations in moth colour morphs, from the early 19th century to the present day; a phenomenon closely correlated with the quantities of industrial soot in the environment.) \n The truth is that not only were Kettlewell's motives tendentious and goal-serving, his methods, (even apart from pinning moths in places they rarely used, just to make his point about camouflage), were more than dubious. His census projections, his trapping methods, and other actions were less than scientifically rigourous. For 1950 (not 1850!!), Kettlewell's work was incredibly subjective, biased, and amateurish.\n 3/Majerus' book is simply an apologetic hack job that tries to redeem Kettlewell, and by so doing, salvage 'natural selection' as an explanation for industrial melanism. \n 4/If, under normal circumstances, (eg., prior to, and then after, british industrial pollution coated and killed lichens on tree branches), a biston betularia population had a dominant 'dark' morph, and a recessive 'light' morph, then, if predation caused 'light' morphs to go from predominant to minority between 1800 and 1900, you would need for birds to eat 2 dark morphs for one light morph, just to stay even. To go from a miniscule minority to a vast majority over the course of the 19th century, the dark morph, simply by outproducing the light morph two to one, would have pulled it off.It didn't need pollution, predators, or camouflage to do it. Just a well-known principle of heredity. \n 5/The effort to clean up the British environment didn't really get into full swing until after the war, i.e., post-1945. In less than ten years, Kettlewell and othere notice that dark morphs are getting rare and light morhs are starting to predominate. The only problem with the 'natural selection' by bird predation for this astounding rapidity in statistical change is that now it would take more than two dark morphs eaten for every one light morph--it would take much larger differences in predation, but-guess what?!? There is absolutely no empirical evidence from the 50's and 60's demonstrating that predation of dark morphs was 4, 5, 6, 10 times that of light morphs, which it would have to be in order to account for the rapid change to light morph predominance.\n 6/ Other than camouflage from predators as the 'selection' model requires, there is also the possibility that the moths simply operated upon their own genomes in order to produce a latent mutation based upon an instinctual drive to match themselves to the predominant shade of their surroundings. This of course suggests Lamarckism, and is automatically pooh-poohed by Darwinists. Despite that fact that any number of organisms change colour and/or hue automatically, to suit their surropundings. Heck, some, like chameleons, have the trick down so pat that they can do it in a new york minute. Without even trying.\n The point is that the whole issue of camouflage and mimicry in nature is extremely complex and poorly understood. The notion that mimicry and camouflage are the result of accidental genetic mutations followed up by \"NS\", (in this case \"NS\" stands for 'predation') seems plausible in simple cases like the either/or change of shade/hue in this moth. But there are other organisms, including other moths and butterflies, whose colour patterning is far too complex for a simple 'point mutation' plus 'selection' explanation.\n \n 6/ Finally, all Darwinists have blamed the fluctuation in morph frequency on bird predation, as enhanced or defeated by camouflage. The problem with that is, if birds are really the moth's main predator as the darwinists claim, and that those insect-eating birds hunt by sight, then recent research on avian eyesight might throw another shoe into their theoretical machinery. That being that it appears that these predators use infra-red more than our normal spectrum. Colour morphs are indistinguishable from the infra-red point of view. \n \n IOW, it's still an open question as to just what brings on industrial melanism and other forms of camouflage and mimicry in nature. None of this will mean anything to the indoctrinated Darwinists that hover over these kinds of forums, and so I know that they will be angrily chucking abuse at me as quick as they can dream it up. Go ahead, guys. I probably won't read it anyways.",

I just gave you one!!\n \n Another, more speculative, but more explanatory than 'predation', (that which you want \"natural selection\" to mean in this local and particular context-but not universally or regularly or repeatably or predictably or solely), would be that moths and other organisms have an inherent ability to 'blend in' and camouflage themselves in keeping with their surroundings.\n \n Some organisms, like some reptiles, fish, squid, etc., can do it at will. Others respond in shape and colour and hue only after chronic exposure to environmental cues. Some have those environmental cues that are regular and predictable genetically hardwired into their inherent camouflage mechanisms. Eg., snowshoe hares are dark brown in summer, snowy white in winter. Most organisms, like are ourselves, are stuck with what we've got, no matter what, so far as mimicry and camouflage are concerned.\n \n But moths and butterflies are certainly not so limited, as any study of that subject plainly reveals. And that study also reveals that some forms of camouflage and mimicry in nature are so intricate and exact, so far beyond a simple change of hue, that no accidental genetic mutation could possibly have just thrown them together coincidentally WRT their function--disguise.\n \n But that's way too complicated for you. You're probably whining that it makes your head hurt to try and understand it. You vastly prefer the notion that moth, butterfly, and other natural examples of mimicry and camouflage are, just as you assume for industrial melanism in the the speckled moth, just 'spontaneously generated' for the poor, hapless little creatures by the 'good fairy' of accidental genetic mutation. Good-night, Peter Pan.\n \n \n\n How well does your explanation account for the observations of changing relative frequencies in relation to the amount of pollution? Why is your explanation better than that of natural selection?\n\n \n **\n In brief, my hypotheses are backed by empirical observation. Your \"Natural Selection\" has nothing empirical about it. It is just as whimsical and ephemeral and nebulous and fantastic as fairies, magicians, wizards, nature spirits, flying spaghetti monsters, and great speckled birds. It's a joke, not a scientific explanation of evolution. Just a superstitious, mythic explanation lifted directly from the abrahamic religious tradition, and wearing a stolen lab coat.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The only problem with the 'natural selection' by bird predation for this astounding rapidity in statistical change is that now it would take more than two dark morphs eaten for every one light morph-- \n \n See above. You clearly enjoy pulling concepts from your XXX, so I guess we shouldn't find it surprising for you to pull numbers from there, too.\n\n \n **\n You \"see above\", smartass. This is not my concept, it's a genetics concept. If the number of morphs reproduced have the dominant dark reproducing at double the rate of the recessive light, then for the 'light' to predominate, inspite of the 'dark's' higher birthrate, the 'dark's' mortality rate must exceed the 'light's' birth rate. And, the more rapid the 'light's' relative numerical ascendency (you guys call it 'fitness) over the 'dark', the more extreme the relative mortality of the 'darks' has to be.

Let's see if I \"don't merit a response\" again.\n \n \n1/ It is wrong/dishonest to 'phony up'/misrepresent the natural world in order to support your beliefs about the natural world\n\n So now a photograph is a misrepresentation! These aren't illustrations or enhanced pictures. You sound just like Wells and his opposition to using photographs of developing embryos. (Say, you're not actually Jonathan Wells, are you? You're starting to sound a lot like him.)\n \n \n2/ It is wrong/dishonest to try to 'cover up' that dishonesty, in your yourself or another, and to try to create a bit of 'plausible deniability', by claiming that the fraud was perpetrated for a perfectly innocent reason.\n\n First, as touched on above, providing an accurate visual representation of the camouflage can't be dishonest. Second, You haven't shown that there was fraud; you've simply been repeating the assertion without providing evidence.\n \n \nThat being, that staged photographs were staged simply because natural nature photographs 'aren't good enough' for a students' aid to understanding! Right!?! Gag me with a spoon.\n\n Gee, do we use subpar photos or a photo that clearly shows the phenomenon being studied? Tough call.\n But fine. Majerus has unstaged photos. Deal with them.\n \n \n... deliberately setting out to create evidence that would support a beloved hypothetical assumption [Kettlewell].\n\n The problem is that you haven't provided any evidence of such. Again, more unfounded assertions, and despite multiple opportunities to elaborate upon and explain your objections, you've completely avoided doing so.\n \n \nExplain. (i.e., Put up or shut up.)\n\n See above, or read his book alongside Kettlewell's actual stuff.\n\n In other words, you're doing neither. Imagine that.\n \n \nAnd as always, you are utterly incapable of grasping the point. There is no logical or mathematical error in what you've quoted here.\n\n Wrong. Your error is that you're assuming that the ratio of dark offspring to light offspring is 3:1 at all times (which is funny, because earlier you said it was 2:1). You proceed to ridicule my understanding of genetics and mathematics, which clearly makes yours appear insignificant. In fact, I gave a detailed explanation of the genetic concepts that you were ignoring, and -- sure enough -- you ignored it.\n \n \nAre you really this dense?! I just gave you one!!\n\n Oh, right, the \"magical voluntary point mutation\" hypothesis. Problem is, you have no evidence for this phenomenon. You first accuse \"Darwinists\" of clinging to NS despite the alleged lack of evidence for it, then you make up your own fairy tale mechanism and cling to it -- wait for it -- despite the lack of evidence for it!\n \n \nSome organisms, like some reptiles, fish, squid, etc., can do it at will.\n\n Wrong. The color changes of, for example, the chameleon are not caused by spontaneous-but-voluntary genetic mutation. In fact, the color is not determined by a single gene, yet in Biston betularia, body color is determined by a single gene.\n But hey, I know how you can prove me wrong. You should jump at this chance, too. Take some light and dark moths. Tag them. Release some into a polluted habitat and some into an unpolluted habitat. After, well, as long as it is that you think it takes for this voluntary color change to to happen, collect specimens and cross-check the records. Tell us all exactly how many previously dark moths turned to light and exactly how many previously light moths turned to dark. Write it up. Submit it to every biology journal on the planet. If it's not \"all a tendentious and deliberate effort to come up with empirical support for a [wascallywabbitian] explanation of industrial melanism,\" everyone will publish it, and you'll be famous, rich, and redeemed.\n .. Well? What are you waiting for?\n \n \nIn brief, my hypotheses are backed by empirical observation.\n\n So you've already done this experiment? Kudos! In which journal can I find it?\n \n \nYour \"Natural Selection\" has nothing empirical about it.\n\n Assertion without evidence. Again.\n \n \nIf the number of morphs reproduced have the dominant dark reproducing at double the rate of the recessive light, then for the 'light' to predominate, inspite of the 'dark's' higher birthrate, the 'dark's' mortality rate must exceed the 'light's' birth rate.\n\n Listen, buddy, if anyone here needs to have basic genetics explained to him, it's certainly not me. The fact remains that you're still making conditional statements like \"If the number of morphs reproduced have the dominant dark reproducing at double the rate of the recessive light,\" yet you have no clue what the numbers were. That is my point.\n \n \nNobody has as yet figured out the mechanical, biochemical details of mimicry and camouflage in live organisms.\n\n Balderdash. In fact, as explained many posts ago (and again numerous times since), the genetic details behind the body color polymorphism of B. betularia is known.\n If instead, you really mean that nobody knows how any organism can alter its own genetics in the way you're insisting that the peppered moth can, you very well may be right. Of course, asserting such would just be admitting that -- as indicated -- you have no evidence at all for your position, despite your repeated insistence that you do.\n So either you're wrong or you're a liar. Once again, take your pick.\n \n \nAs far as causation is concerned, your cronies all opt for the superstitious myth of a nature spirit called, \"Natural Selection\", which can somehow 'poof' such biochemical mechanisms into existence by the magic of spontaneously generated adaptive genetic mutations.\n\n NS doesn't cause the existence, it only selects for or against it (or not at all with respect to it). Are you really that uneducated about NS, or are you just trying to sound good? (Again, either wrong or a liar.)\n \n \nMy EAM hypothesis of the origins of this biochemistry is based upon a natural force, Vitality, and not, like yours, upon a magical 'poof'.\n\n Sorry, Peeling already shredded this \"vitality\" nonsense. I'm sorry you're incapable of seeing that. And even if he hadn't, it's once again special pleading: you attack NS for alleged lack of evidence yet base all your nonsense on \"vitality,\" which has [insert trumpet fanfare here] no evidence!\n \n \nYou and your gang are the ones proposing \"magical, on-demand point mutations\"\n\n No we're not. We're \"proposing\" that point mutations occur. We have evidence of them. We're not proposing on-demand mutation. (You are.) We're not proposing that mutations are directed toward some ideal end. (You are.)\n \n \nAnd \"fuming\" is just your corruption of a perfectly scientific observation, but since you don't have such facts to back up your assumptions\n\n Let's see here; I've offered to provide you access to evidence including point mutations and repeated point mutations that you consider mathematically impossible. I've explained the genetics behind the peppered moth body color polymorphism. I've provided information about dominant genetic diseases.\n The \"evidence\" you've provided amounts to your assertions that \"Kettlewell was biased\" and \"Majerus is a hack.\" Perhaps the problem here is that you don't understand what \"evidence\" is.\n \n \nLucky me, I have the ability to make you look like a complete jackass any time I please.\n\n Oooh, can we put that to a vote?\n \n \nOriginally Posted by wascallywabbit\n Finally, all Darwinists have blamed the fluctuation in morph frequency on bird predation, as enhanced or defeated by camouflage.\n \n Even if \"all Darwinists\" were wrong about the cause, the fact remains that the effects existed and were documented.\n\n Oh, you poor retarded thing!

My point was that, had birds not played any role, the effect would still exist and need explanation.\n \n \nThe point of this thread and this forum is a dispute regarding the \"CAUSE\" of such observed factual phenomena as industrial melanism and mimicry and camouflage in general.

If your initial frequency was 50/50, then that ratio would be maintained. That would be reflected in a 1:2:1 genotype ratio and a 3:1 phenotype ratio. It is when allele frequencies change that we know that evolution is occurring. In other words, when certain phenotypes have differential reproductive success, then they no longer maintain equilibrium. Understand? That's just a bit of stuff that is covered the first day in a population genetics course.\n \nYou, Kettlewell, and the rest, have never ever empirically demonstrated such a one-sided mortality rate in dark moths, compared to light, as might justify the incredibly rapid rise to predominance of the light morph after the 'clean air act', or whatever it was called. Why can't you?\nReally!!? Then you have never read Kettlewell, have you? Why don't you go and do that. His papers are available on line. Of course, Kettlewell did his work back in the 1950s, before the the light morph (I thought you said it was white - what's the deal?) began to become more numerous than the dark morph (I thought you said it was black - what's the deal?), but he did demonstrate exactly the differences in mortality that you request.\n \n By the way, I called them light and dark and you ragged on me and claimed that they were white and black.

He did it in 24 hours. No need to take out the birds and resident moths. Kettlewell released a known ratio of moths of each phenotype (he did it several times at several locations) and then counted how many were captured in traps he set out the following day.\n \nI don't think that less than an acre will provide a sufficiently natural ecosystem, but that's just my opinion, since I don't know anything about the territoriality of tits.\nExcept for one problem. Your little game isn't a natural ecosystem since you already screwed with it from the word go. And of course, besides your ignorance of the territoriality of tits, you are also ignorant of the genetics of peppered moths, population genetics, ecology, and the work of Kettlewell.\n \nSpeaking of these birds, neither you nor anyone else has responded to my point that since these birds eyesight is much wider in frequency than our vision, extending significantly into the infra-red, where shade or hue would provide no protection for a moth, the entire notion of camouflage against bird predation as the cause of industrial melanism, is, in this instance at least, doubtful. Which make your 'NS\" a doubtful player, even in this local, particular context.\nYet another example of your failure to actually do the research. The question has been addressed on several occasions (by Majerus, for one) and found that relative protective advantages of the two morphs in different environments also holds for birds.\n \n What a slight on your integrity that you referred to Majerus' work as a \"hack job\" intended to defend Kettlewell. You don't seem to know that the case of the peppered moth occupied only 2 out of 10 chapters of the book. The rest of the book dealt with Majerus' own work with a different organism. My bet is that you can't tell us what organism that was without looking it up (of course, you'll pretend that you knew).

No idea what hat you pulled that out of. The point is that the dynamic, self-directed processes found live biosytems control the behaviour of particulate matter using the principles of physics and chemistry to their own purposes, instead of passively allowing the principles of physics and chemistry to simply operate upon them in the same way that those very same principles will operate upon that very same particulate matter, once they're dead. Ya folla?\n \n \n \n\n or that cannot be replicated in vitro.\n\n \n **\n Again, it's not the chemistry that's the issue. It's the control of it in productive systems, more particularly, natural autopoietic biosystems.\n The day you guys actually do more than 'replicate' a biochemical process, and actually 'generate' a live, self-controlled autopoietic system in a test tube, be sure to let me know. Your problem, as always, is that you make no qualitative distinction between observing a physical process and determining the causal agency that generates and directs it. \"It doesn't really do that. It isn't really like that. You're just deluded into accepting an illusion, an 'apparent' quality the we materialists know doesn't actually exist, ('life' or 'mind', for instance), because we know for a fact that all of reality is nothing more than \" particles in motion\", and everything else is just an \"epiphenomenon\" arising out of that one and only real state. We know that this true because, a/ we believe it, and b/ we know that we are so very much more intelligent than everyone who isn't a committed materialist.\". \"It just happens, that's all.\", is always the materialist's final answer to every question. And that ain't science.\n \n Note: We will now hear howls from every Darwinist on this board, saying that they are not materialists. They may not be able to say just what their metaphysic truly is, but they will claim that it is not Materialism/Mechanism/Physicalism/Positivism/Naturalism. They may even claim that they do not have a philosophy, a worldview, a metaphysic. And they will be wrong in that, as well.\n \n \n\n It was the demonstration of that fact during the first half of the twentieth century that put an end to vitalism as a viable principle in science.\n\n \n **\n Only among materialists, the people that mistook biochemical processes for their own causes, or evaded the question of causation entirely with, \"Biochemical processes 'just happen', that's all.\".

If your initial frequency was 50/50, then that ratio would be maintained. That would be reflected in a 1:2:1 genotype ratio and a 3:1 phenotype ratio. It is when allele frequencies change that we know that evolution is occurring. In other words, when certain phenotypes have differential reproductive success, then they no longer maintain equilibrium. Understand? That's just a bit of stuff that is covered the first day in a population genetics course.\n\n \n **\n Speaking as one who has never had any interest in taking even the first day of any population genetics course, can you explain to me why, in an homogenous population ratio of 1,000 brown-eyed people to every 250 blue-eyed people, that after single generation or a hundred or a thousand generations, all else save interbreeding being equal, the ratio would remain static at 1,000 to 250 for all time. What causes this stability? I really would like to know, as it is not self-evident. And please don't get all circular on me and offer 'an absence of \"NS\". Non-answers are unacceptable.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n You, Kettlewell, and the rest, have never ever empirically demonstrated such a one-sided mortality rate in dark moths, compared to light, as might justify the incredibly rapid rise to predominance of the light morph after the 'clean air act', or whatever it was called. Why can't you? \n \n Really!!? Then you have never read Kettlewell, have you? Why don't you go and do that. His papers are available on line. Of course, Kettlewell did his work back in the 1950s, before the the light morph (I thought you said it was white - what's the deal?)\n\n \n **\n I've always insisted on 'light'. It was one of your clique who used \"white\" and \"black\", not me.\n \n EDIT--I just went back and checked. It was pandion himself who used \"black\" and \"white\" instead of 'light' and 'dark' , like the rest of us. See his post, #116. Can he say \"sorry\"? Never happen.\n \n \n\n began to become more numerous than the dark morph (I thought you said it was black - what's the deal?), \n\n \n **\n As above. And why be so smartass about it?\n \n \n\n but he did demonstrate exactly the differences in mortality that you request.\n\n \n **\n The point was that his results were dubious because his methods were amateurish and questionable.\n \n \n\n By the way, I called them light and dark and you ragged on me and claimed that they were white and black. When did you discover that you were wrong? Can you say hypocrite? I knew you could.\n\n \n **\n I never did. Can you say childish ad hominem? I didn't think so.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Surely it would not be so difficult or expensive to enclose an acre of habitat in mosquito netting, remove all birds [tits, I think they are] and resident peppered moths, introduce 1000 dark and 1000 light moths , put the birds back and let them alone together for 48 hours, and then count the survivors and compare the difference in mortality between light and dark morphs. \n \n Kettlewell did better than you. He did it in 24 hours. No need to take out the birds and resident moths. Kettlewell released a known ratio of moths of each phenotype (he did it several times at several locations) and then counted how many were captured in traps he set out the following day.\n\n \n **\n I know what Kettlewell did, and that's how I know that his method was amateurish and flawed. If you can't see the glaring flaws for yourself, then you aren't much of a scientist.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n I don't think that less than an acre will provide a sufficiently natural ecosystem, but that's just my opinion, since I don't know anything about the territoriality of tits. \n \n Except for one problem. Your little game isn't a natural ecosystem since you already screwed with it from the word go.\n\n \n **\n My \"little game\" is what is referred to by scientists as \"an experiment\". Can you say that word? In an experiment most variables are held constant while the subject is an artificial introduction. My 'ecosystem' is a constant, kept as it is naturally. The only artificially introduced experimental variable is the controlled number of moths. That's how science is done you see. The whole and entire point is to verify the predation interaction of the resident birds with a given ratio of moths, from measured totals after a sufficient amount of time to make a significant difference, while holding all other influences static. Things that Kettlewell failed to do, and things you that don't understand, apparently.\n \n \n\n And of course, besides your ignorance of the territoriality of tits, you are also ignorant of the genetics of peppered moths, population genetics, ecology, and the work of Kettlewell.\n\n \n **\n Umh, I know a bit of ecology. I am no geneticist and so know little of the arcane world of genetics and it's statistical formulations. Neither am I a statistician, accountant, or bookeeper, but I don't see that impeding my understanding of evolution, either. \n In my world it is whole organisms that undergo evolution, and evolution is not temporary fluctuations in the statistics/ratioes of distributed bits of acid. I've never felt the need for such irrelevancies. Inheritance is very important, but inheritance is what stops evolution, not what causes it. And that's what I argue here. Calling me 'ignorant' just because I am not another geneticist/statistician who defines evolution your way (above)--you're geneticist who makes his living at genetics, right?-- is just you doing your standard ad hominem thing.\n \n \n Anyway, I really want to hear your expert explanation of the reason that the ratio of dominant to recessive carriers in any interbreeding population must remain static over generations whenever there is no novel external (environmental) force exerted upon that population, and no novel internal, 'accidental', entropic genetic change in the given allelelic ratio. \n \n Sounds like something I may be able to use, since it has always been my point that genetic inheritance is entirely about stasis. I'd love to know what causes that ratio to persist among randomly intermixing populations. Funny that nobody has ever pointed that out to me before, since many people I've debated over the years have been PhD carrying members of the genetics fraternity. Oh, well. Oh, and please don't say, \"That's just how it is.\"\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Speaking of these birds, neither you nor anyone else has responded to my point that since these birds eyesight is much wider in frequency than our vision, extending significantly into the infra-red, where shade or hue would provide no protection for a moth, the entire notion of camouflage against bird predation as the cause of industrial melanism, is, in this instance at least, doubtful. Which make your 'NS\" a doubtful player, even in this local, particular context. \n \n Yet another example of your failure to actually do the research. The question has been addressed on several occasions (by Majerus, for one) and found that relative protective advantages of the two morphs in different environments also holds for birds.\n\n \n **\n Gee, ask me why I don't take for gospel anything that Majerus says, much less anything you say he says. Why no links?\n \n \n\n What a slight on your integrity that you referred to Majerus' work as a \"hack job\" intended to defend Kettlewell. You don't seem to know that the case of the peppered moth occupied only 2 out of 10 chapters of the book. The rest of the book dealt with Majerus' own work with a different organism. My bet is that you can't tell us what organism that was without looking it up (of course, you'll pretend that you knew). Since Majerus' book costs around $90 in paperback, I suspect that you haven't read it. I suspect that you have relied on creationist hacks for your information.\n\n \n **\n No, I have not read the book, because I am not a professional geneticist and have no need of it. Nor have I read the chapters on Kettlewell's work and the moths. And yes, my information is from others who have critiqued those chapters, but they were qualified individuals who made cogent points. Whether or not they are \"creationist hacks\", as you claim, is of no moment to me, so long as their reasoning is sound and their facts are straight. I'm not into 'argumentum ad hominem' and prejudging people's work on the basis of their beliefs the way you are.\n \n But you have prompted me to go back and revisit the literature, out of curiosity's sake. Nothing else, since, as no organismic evolution took place, and the actual causes of camouflage and mimicry in nature are still moot, it really doesn't matter.\n The definition of evolution as any fluctuation in the relative differential of alleles in a local population is only \"the\" definition of evolution because you want it to be. Otherwise it's just vacuous, information-free jibber-jabber.",

Only to dead ones, oncethey're unplugged.\n Everything exists according to the \"principles of the universe\". So what? Only systems have functions, and systems are either natural or artificial. Computer systems are artificial systems, in case you didn't know, and natural systems are either strictly mechanical, like solar systems or storm systems; or self-controlled, i.e., organismic. Organismic systems are teleological and self-directed. All machine systems depend entirely, and passively, upon the organisms who use them. I know that simple truth is far more than you can absorb, but perhaps some of your friends aren't quite so far gone as you are.\n \n Your sig tells everyone all they need to know about you and you beliefs about biology. \"Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds. Biochemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds that crawl. \" What a pathetic view of life that is.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n For sake of illustrative language we can say that a phone is \"dead\", but it isn't, because it never was an independently operating actor. \n \n How are you defining \"independently operating actor\"?

Hold on, hold on. You'll understand that if you just focus really, really hard. Ooops, too late, you lost it again, didn't you? \n Never mind, I know you tried your best.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n And of course, monitors can be repaired, but dead organisms cannot be. \n \n That depends on your definition of \"dead.\" People are legally dead and \"brought back to life,\" but I imagine you don't count that.\n\n \n **\n People aren't 'dead' because one organ, even a heart, stops functioning, temporarily. No more than you would be dead for a minute if you held your breath for a minute. \n You've got some fairly wacky notions about what constitutes a dead organism. I hope you have absolutely no connection whatsoever with the medical profession. Or anything that lives and breathes, come right down to it. I so pity your poor relatives. Let's hope they never get so sick that you get to take charge of their lives. Poor little \"walking carbon compounds\", as you see them.\n \n \n\n I'm guessing that your definition of \"dead\" is something like \"a state of disorder from which an organism cannot recover,\" \n\n \n **\n Actually, no it wouldn't since, unlike you, I avoid passing off tautologies as if they were meaningful statements about reality.\n \n My definition would be something like this--Death is the inanimate, non-functioning, and permanent state of being that follows the disconnection of Vitality, (i.e., the 'life' force), from the corporeal parts of any biosystem it has engendered, developed, and energised. In short, death is the transition from an inherently dynamic state (or mode) of existence (i.e., alive) to an extrinsically dependent, totally passive state (or mode) of existence (i.e., dead).\n \n \n\n in which case your statement would be pretty tautologous... which is a perfect lead-in to the remark below.\n\n \n **\n See any tautologies there?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Well, a brilliant example of a fatuous tautology, that I'll grant you. \n \n And my example was a derivative of yours, so if mine's fatuous tautology...\n\n \n **\n Drerivative of my.. what? My XXX, maybe? \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The issue is, where did \"the []ability to maintain the physical conditions required for life\" come from, and where did it go at death? \n \n Why do you treat this ability as a tangible thing?\n\n \n **\n Since when is an ability (power, capacity) a tangible thing? But the constraints and limitations of the English language force us to treat it as such for communication purposes. You know a way to get around it, let me know. And while you're at it, you can also tell us where the magnetism goes when a magnet is de-magnetized. Heck, where does the time go when it's gone? Hey, this getting to be fun!\n \n \n \n\n If I were once able to leap four feet off the ground, and can no longer do so, where did that ability go?\n\n \n **\n A very good question, when you really think about it. Hopefully, you will, --someday. Hint--I've already pointed you at the answer.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n After all, all the physical bits, plus the four physical forces, are all still very much in evidence. But that \"ability\", that \"power\", that \"capacity\", that \"force\", is gone. \n \n The \"ability\" is biochemical in nature. Break down the biochemistry to simpler chemistry. Break down the chemistry to physics. Break down the physics to the basic forces. What's the problem here?\n\n \n **\n Well, since it's your problem, you tell me. You may subscribe to the mechanist theory that a system is no more than the sum of its parts. In fact, I'm sure you do precisely that, just going by your sig. Well, the day you can reduce a dead cat to its constituent molecules, put those molecules back together in their proper order, and so get a live cat instead of the same old dead one, just you gimmee a call, there's a good boy.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n I never claimed an epiphany. To the contrary, I claimed simple logic, available to anyone on demand. \n \n Proposing another \"force\" because you don't understand the universe is not what I would call logical.\n\n \n **\n Gee, you must be claiming that you understand the universe, if you think that I'm highly flawed in having only a minimal understanding of it. And _not_ proposing another force, one that would explain phenomena that the 4 physical forces cannot and do not explain, is what strike me as irrational.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n If you can do it for Gravity, then why not for Vitality? \n \n Have you observed vitality in the same way we've observed gravity?\n\n \n **\n Yup. Every time I've observed a living thing, living.\n \n \n\n No, wait, I know where this is going. We're back in the Dark Ages. You have a proposed explanation, but you are either unwilling or unable to investigate it. This \"vitality\" XXXX has been put through the wringer plenty already, so here's the gist: nothing that I have seen you propose isn't explained by biochemistry.\n\n \n **\n Sez you. Here's a test. Explain \"ambition\" in terms of biochemistry. Or how about, \"wisdom\"? I could go on.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Besides, you've never really asked what 'causes' Gravity, you've simply described it's effects, as a cause, on particulate matter. \n \n I have asked, but I haven't personally investigated it. The fact is that many scientists have asked, and many scientists are investigating it. Proposed ideas include gravitons and applications of branes and open strings in string theory.\n\n \n **\n See?!? Real scientists don't have closed minds like yours. What is it, about 350 years since Newton, and they're still trying? \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n You could do the same for Vitality by describing its effects on the behaviour of organisms as autopoietic systems. \n \n I could? How so? (i.e. Propose an experiment, please.)\n\n \n **\n Sure. Vitality is what drives organisms to strive for survival, prosperity, and some kind of continuance, usually reproduction. The ability to achieve those goals successfully is due to, (besides luck), intelligent behaviour. Measuring relative intelligence measures the relative strength of the interaction between Vitality and any one particular individual's biosystem. Just as 'weight' measures the strength of an entity's interaction with gravity. Just take it from there. Set up an arbitrary standard measure for different psychical phenomena, say intelligence, and there you are. Oops, I guess they've already done that.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The same one that generates the four physical forces and the one psychical force, all universes, and physical existence itself. \n \n Wait wait wait... You've been ranting at us for not breaking everything down into the four physical forces in minute detail, but you're allowed to make up a \"psychical\" force with no evidence whatsoever? What a joke.\n\n \n **\n This makes no sense, being a non sequitur, but it's par for your course.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n They [genetic algorithms] are human artefacts, so they originated from human vitality, and they possess as much artificial intelligence as humans can put into them. \n \n More evasion. Do genetic algorithms have \"vitality\" or not?\n\n \n **\n Not, of course! As you were told, they only 'have' those products of the vitality/system interaction, (such as artificially intelligent behaviours), as their vitality-driven human controllers can invest in them.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n That's not \"common sense\". That's just your favourite bumper-sticker. \n \n And yet you can't come up with any sort of substantive response...\n\n \n **\n Try asking me a 'substantive' question, why can't you?\n \n \n\n Think about it, Holmes. \n\n \n Sure, dick.\n \n \n\n Offspring may be slightly different than their parents. Some offspring may be better than others at reproducing, some may be as good at reproducing, and some offspring may be worse that others at reproducing. Which ones do you think will produce more offspring? Which genes do you think will become more common?\n\n \n \n **\n You call this, \"thinking\"?! That tells the world everything it needs to know about your crippled mental capacities.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Your personal judgement of me being based upon what evidence, exactly? \n \n Oh, maybe the fact that you can't wrap your head around simple biology such as genetics?\n\n \n **\n 'Won't' and 'don't' do not mean 'can't', you poor, desperate, intellectual snob. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The same \"evidence\" you claim for \"accidentally adaptive mutations\" and \"mechanical selection\"? \n \n What's wrong with my evidence for random mutations?\n\n \n **\n It is not evidence for 'accidental yet adaptive' mutations, that's what's wrong it. Lord, how many times must you be told before even the simplest thing sinks in? One more time. You have no evidence that accidental mutations are ever adaptive, and you have no evidence that adaptive mutations are ever accidental. All you've got are ideologically driven assumptions.\n \n \n\n And what do you mean -- in the biological sense -- by \"mechanical selection\"?\n\n \n **\n You people claim that your \"NS\" is not random and directionless like your \"RM\" is.\n If \"NS\" is directional, even in the short term, it then must either be psychically or mechanically directed. You deny the reality of psychical direction, so you must mean mechanical direction. Mechanical direction, as in sorting and sifting and regularizing according to principles of physics. Like planetary motion. Thus, according to you, our planets were mechanically 'selected' for their present orbits round the sun, and so were our birds for our skies. In fact, everything that is, was 'mechanically selected' to be whatever it has turned out to be, according to your wacky use of the word 'selection'.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n You say that about me, but since you produce no proof from my posts to that effect, readers can safely assume that you're lying. \n \n I already did this once, by reposting the explanation of offspring produced by parents of different genotypes. Your response was to pretend that I took your statement as an exact statistical prediction\n\n \n **\n You did. And you still can't explain why, in an isolated population of individuals with combinations of a dominant and a recessive 'allele' that are randomly mating with one another, that the dominant allele doesn't eventually 'swamp' the recessive, your 'selection pressure' being equal. As in brown eyes and blue eyes in an isolated village. I'm not saying that the starting ratioes can't be maintained, I'm simply asking what genetics principle says they must be.\n \n \n\n and proceed to lie about the predators' eyesight and according experimentation.\n\n \n **\n What lie? My source claimed that bird's eyesight extends beyond our own into both the infra-red and the ultra-violet, and that in dim light the infra-red would render shade or hue ineffective. I don't know what effect, if any, ultra-violet might have on moth predation.\n \n I think people who approve of glueing moths where they don't belong should think hard before calling other people liars. In fact, the entire premise is a lie because bats, not birds, are the moth's chief predator, and caterpillars, not roosting moths, are the tit's principal forage, (along with seeds and such).\n Predation importance of tits on adult moths is entirely speculative since any and all other mortality factors have not been removed. \n \n \n\n pandion nailed you on it, too, and yet here you are ignoring the fact that you've been busted. (I do love irony.)\n\n \n **\n \"Nailed\" me. You wish. I guess you guys have your own special meaning for the word, 'nailed', as well as 'selection', 'fitness', 'evolution', etc. etc.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n No, the issue is that you are deliberately ignoring my question. \n \n The link directly relates to your question. For crying out loud, the very first paragraph in the link talks about that specific issue you are questioning. Yeesh.\n\n \n **\n I didn't notice the link to Hardy-Weinberg. That is because I copy posts whole cloth, before I read them, and links that are simply indicated by words instead of URLs don't show. If you want me to see a link, post the URL.\n \n I wonder how the math stands up in the real world? The 'infinite population' requirement looks like a hiccup, since infinity applies only to abstractions, and not actual entities like moths.\n And if population size can be less than infinite, just how much less can it be before Hardy-Weinberg is cancelled out? And isn't that just a wee bit relative?\n Indeterminate, even, in the case of, say, England's peppered moth population?\n Never mind, it doesn't matter.\n \n Anyway, now I see where your statistical assumption of constant ratioes comes from. Thanks.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Years ago I read people like Jerry Coyne on Majerus, but at my age, memory problems reduce things to impressions, not quotations. \n \n Even a perfect memory doesn't fix incorrect input:\n Coyne\n Quote:\n \"Majerus notes that the most serious problem is that B. betularia probably does not rest on tree trunks -- exactly two moths have been seen in such a position in more than 40 years of intensive search. The natural resting spots are, in fact, a mystery.\" \n \n Here is Majerus's data, and -- as you can see -- Coyne, uh, ignores the data.\n\n \n **\n Actually, I don't see, as I don't have the link. Now I'll have to open another page. OK. Got it. Nice link of dedicated darwinists (dd's) attacking a creationist, Wells. I'll have to read it when I get some time. Meanwhile, there was a link to Coyne's review of Majerus' stuff on Kettlewell, but nothing in that to the effect that he ignored any pertinent data. Exactly what data published by Majerus did Coyne ignore, pray tell?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n I never claimed that Majerus \"wrote only about Kettlewell\". \n \n Oh, right, you only \"strongly implied\"... But you don't deny buying into and parroting the other lies I listed? Interesting...\n\n \n **\n With what words did I \"strongly imply\"? What \"lies\" have I told? You sure do depend upon scummy flames to do your debating for you. What a skank.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Their major predator is not birds, it's bats, and bats use their ears, not their eyes, in their predations. Figure it out, if you're able. \n \n So first you claim that the birds see infrared and therefore the moths aren't well camouflaged to birds. However, the birds apparently don't see infrared but instead ultraviolet, and research shows that the moths are camouflaged in the UV range, too.\n\n \n **\n What I read, right or wrong, said the extension was at both ends of the spectrum and then touched on the infra-red in low-light, dawn and dusk. Nothing in that source was said about the effect of ultra-violet extension, so far as I can recall, so I said nothing about it either.And since, apparently, ultraviolet makes no difference to camouflage, that's probably why nothing was said about it.\n \n \n\n Now you claim that the birds don't prey on them,\n\n \n **\n That's a lie. It is possible that birds prey on adult moths that they find roosting. Nobody knows because nobody is ever able to find their roosts. What I said was that it is known for a fact that bats eat them when the moths start getting active and set off mate-hunting at night. They eat a lot of them, and moth camouflage is utterly useless against bat sonar.\n \n In the daytime the adult moths may be found by birds, but there is no evidence that they ever are, under natural conditions. And tallies taken by traps could reflect, in fact probably do reflect, bat predation and not bird predation. Which does your industrial melanism by bird predation [differential 'selection'] notion no good at all.\n \n \n\n but rather bats do... How many stories do you get to trot out before the burden is on you to support your story?\n\n \n **\n These moths are nocturnal. That's a fact. In the daytime they lay low; so low that human researchers have hardly ever actually found any, even in highly populated areas. That's a fact. The male moths fly every night, the females simply hunker down after they've mated. That's a fact. There a plenty of insect-eating bats in England. That's a fact. Bats eat moths. That's a fact. Where night-flying moths are plentiful, they are the bat's chief forage, and the bats are their chief predators. That's a fact. In fact, tits, creepers, and other insectivorous birds eat mounds of moth caterpillars, of just about every moth species available, but there is no empirical evidence that they make a significant impact on the adult peppered moth population, which is all that counts where your \"theory\" is concerned.\n \n \n\n I'd say your limit is up... And even then, birds need only be a significant predator, not necessarily the major predator.\n\n \n **\n Sure. But you have to prove it with factual observations of birds eating roosting moths. Aside from Kettlewell glueing them to trees, that's never been done.Your ex post facto trap counts do not point to bird predation when there is obviously bat predation.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n True.

   "... natural systems are either strictly mechanical, like solar systems or storm systems; or self-controlled, i.e., organismic. Organismic systems are teleological and self-directed.\n\n I see we don't have a fan of determinism here. No surprise, but no matter. The fact is that when you start talking teleology, you're getting outside the realm of testable science and into philosophy.\n \n \nAll machine systems depend entirely, and passively, upon the organisms who use them.\n\n So a human gives birth, but the offspring is dependent upon organisms to feed and care for them. Do newborns lack vitality?\n \n \nYeah, and it has absolutely no control over whether or not it works \"whether [ you're] around to look at it or not\". Hold on, hold on. You'll understand that if you just focus really, really hard. Ooops, too late, you lost it again, didn't you?\n\n You didn't define \"independently operating actor,\" did you? Why can't you answer my simple questions?\n \n \nThat depends on your definition of \"dead.\" People are legally dead and \"brought back to life,\" but I imagine you don't count that.\n\n ... You've got some fairly wacky notions about what constitutes a dead organism.\n\n No, I'm pointing out that you need to define \"dead\" (you know, preferably in a sensical way, but I'm not holding my breath).\n \n \nI hope you have absolutely no connection whatsoever with the medical profession. Or anything that lives and breathes, come right down to it. I so pity your poor relatives. Let's hope they never get so sick that you get to take charge of their lives. Poor little \"walking carbon compounds\", as you see them.\n\n Good, substantive response there, buddy. Really added a lot to the conversation.\n \n \nActually, no it wouldn't since, unlike you, I avoid passing off tautologies as if they were meaningful statements about reality.\n\n Oh really? Let's see:\n \n \nMy definition would be something like this--Death is the inanimate, non-functioning, and permanent state of being that follows the disconnection of Vitality, (i.e., the 'life' force), from the corporeal parts of any biosystem it has engendered, developed, and energised. In short, death is the transition from an inherently dynamic state (or mode) of existence (i.e., alive) to an extrinsically dependent, totally passive state (or mode) of existence (i.e., dead).\n\n So death is the loss of vitality. Vitality is defined below as \"what drives organisms to strive for survival, prosperity, and some kind of continuance, usually reproduction.\" I suppose that somebody who's incredibly depressed, perhaps contemplating suicide, who doesn't eat, drink, sleep, or try to reproduce, has no vitality and is therefore dead? No, your real definition, which you won't admit, is that vitality is what makes people alive.\n Good show, mate.\n \n \nA very good question, when you really think about it. Hopefully, you will, --someday. Hint--I've already pointed you at the answer.\n\n The same \"place\" the magnetism in your demagnetized metal went? The fact is that my question can be answered with simple biochemistry without invoking the need for \"vitality.\" You're in serious need of Occam's razor.\n \n \nWell, the day you can reduce a dead cat to its constituent molecules, put those molecules back together in their proper order, and so get a live cat instead of the same old dead one, just you gimmee a call, there's a good boy.\n\n As soon as you've found the technology to do so, you gimme a call, and we'll try it.\n \n \nAnd _not_ proposing another force, one that would explain phenomena that the 4 physical forces cannot and do not explain, is what strike me as irrational.\n\n So you think that incomplete understanding makes the proposition of fairy tales rational? In another cruel bit of irony, that's argumentum ad ignorantiam: an argument from ignorance.\n \n \nYup. Every time I've observed a living thing, living.\n\n Then you'll have no idea proposing an experiment... But we'll get there.\n \n \nHere's a test. Explain \"ambition\" in terms of biochemistry. Or how about, \"wisdom\"? I could go on.\n\n I'm not a neurochemist. That's a little too specified for my knowledge. But to pretend that neurochemistry must not be able to explain it is another argument from ignorance. No doubt that you have as little understanding of it as you do of population genetics.\n \n \nSee?!? Real scientists don't have closed minds like yours.\n\n So I say that I have asked but don't have the resources to investigate for myself, and that gives me a closed mind? Get real.\n \n \nWhat is it, about 350 years since Newton, and they're still trying?\n\n Yet you're not proposing a gravitational analogue of your psychical vitality, are you? How about you give biochemistry 350 years, too, or at least stop your special pleading?\n \n \nThe ability to achieve those goals successfully is due to, (besides luck), intelligent behaviour. Measuring relative intelligence measures the relative strength of the interaction between Vitality and any one particular individual's biosystem. Just as 'weight' measures the strength of an entity's interaction with gravity. Just take it from there. Set up an arbitrary standard measure for different psychical phenomena, say intelligence, and there you are.\n\n You are more desperately in need of an Ockham style shave than I thought. We can explain the phenomenon by appealing to intelligence, or we can explain the phenomenon by appealing to intelligence and vitality. As WinAce used to say: \"It slices! It dices! It removes unnecessary supernatural entities!\"\n \n \nAs you were told, [genetic algorithms] only 'have' those products of the vitality/system interaction, (such as artificially intelligent behaviours), as their vitality-driven human controllers can invest in them.\n\n Good, we've finally established that genetic algorithms don't have \"vitality,\" that which drives entities to survival, continuance, etc. Yet the entire point of genetic algorithms is perpetuating the algorithm. The employment of this \"unvitalized\" algorithm results in those things that you say constitutes vitality. In fact, the genetic algorithms get better and better at \"reproducing\" without this vitality, through a process analogous to natural selection: their programming and characteristics change due to randomness and selection, just like living organisms... all without vitality.\n \n \nYou call this, \"thinking\"?! That tells the world everything it needs to know about your crippled mental capacities.\n\n I called it common sense, but since you don't seem to understand, I thought maybe you'd get it if you tried thinking. What a terrible mistake I've made, thinking you'd grasp something so obvious.\n \n \n'Won't' and 'don't' do not mean 'can't', you poor, desperate, intellectual snob.\n\n I didn't say \"can't\" (although whether you can't is probably still up for debate), I said that you know only a very tiny bit of ecology, i.e. \"don't\" know much, not \"can't\" know much.\n But, well, now we understand your disdain for those people who are \"intellectual snobs\" and \"presumptuous dicks\" because we can read.\n \n \nIt is not evidence for 'accidental yet adaptive' mutations, that's what's wrong it. Lord, how many times must you be told before even the simplest thing sinks in? One more time. You have no evidence that accidental mutations are ever adaptive, and you have no evidence that adaptive mutations are ever accidental.\n\n Science doesn't deal with teleology or \"accidental\"-ness. Science shows that mutations are random, though.\n But, and I'll say it yet again, you have no evidence for directed mutation, so even if your claim were true, you'd have no more ground to stand on than we would. You keep wanting to ignore this point... and it's no wonder why.\n \n \nIf \"NS\" is directional, even in the short term, it then must either be psychically or mechanically directed.\n\n Let's be careful with misleading wording, but I think I understand what you're saying. In that atypical sense of \"directed,\" then you could say that NS is directed, but this is obvious: NS \"directs\" toward more efficient reproduction. In the same sense, the planets were \"selected\" to form and orbit where they did/are based on the pattern and motion of matter within our proto-solar system. Why you have a problem with these concepts, I don't know.\n \n \nAnd you still can't explain why, in an isolated population of individuals with combinations of a dominant and a recessive 'allele' that are randomly mating with one another, that the dominant allele doesn't eventually 'swamp' the recessive, your 'selection pressure' being equal.\n\n It's not that I can't explain why, it's that you don't understand why, partially because you don't follow my links... and blame me for not posting the URL. Sorry, bub, if you don't understand how this here intarnets thing works, I'm in no mood to help you.\n \n \nI'm not saying that the starting ratioes can't be maintained, I'm simply asking what genetics principle says they must be.\n\n This is the third time I've linked to the Hardy-Weinberg principle. Sure, later you say you missed the links, but whose fault is that?\n \n \nWhat lie? My source claimed that bird's eyesight extends beyond our own into both the infra-red and the ultra-violet, and that in dim light the infra-red would render shade or hue ineffective. I don't know what effect, if any, ultra-violet might have on moth predation.\n\n Yet experimentation has shown a correlation between color and predation. How many times do you have to be told?\n \n \nI think people who approve of glueing moths where they don't belong should think hard before calling other people liars.\n\n But they do belong, as my link to Majerus's data shows. You blew off the source as biased, even though you can provide no scientific reason to reject the data. I could link to a supposedly non-biased site, but you'll still say the source is biased. It's quite funny, actually. Anyone who's done the research will say that moths do rest on trunks. But you say that anyone who says that moths rest on trunks must be biased. So performing the research makes one biased...\n \n \nIn fact, the entire premise is a lie because bats, not birds, are the moth's chief predator, and caterpillars, not roosting moths, are the tit's principal forage, (along with seeds and such).\n\n So when I said that it doesn't matter whether birds or bats are the major predator, only that birds are non-negligible predators, you ignored me?

I guess you guys have your own special meaning for the word, 'nailed'...\n\n \"Caught propogating lies.\"\n \n \nI didn't notice the link to Hardy-Weinberg...\n\n As I mentioned earlier, it's not my fault that you don't know how to use this forum.\n \n \nI wonder how the math stands up in the real world?\n\n And you have to wonder, because you are wilfully ignorant of population genetics.\n \n \nNice link of dedicated darwinists (dd's) attacking a creationist, Wells.\n\n It's a very good page of scientists and science aficionados debunking creationist balderdash, if that's what you mean. For example, on that page you'll find Wells screaming that moths don't rest on trunks, yet Majerus has unstaged photos of -- you guessed it -- moths resting on trunks.\n If you can find problems with the page, send them an email; they'll publish it in their feedback and maybe even respond to it. Else, stop your lame character assassination.\n \n \nExactly what data published by Majerus did Coyne ignore, pray tell?\n\n I can't spell it out for you any more. I quoted Coyne saying that only two moths had ever been spotted on trunks, that their resting spots were a mystery, and that the argument was therefore weak. Then I linked to Majerus's data showing that many moths have been spotted on trunks in a study of where the moths rest. Coyne clearly ignored this data.\n \n \nWhat \"lies\" have I told?\n\n The ones I was talking about there were the one about insufficient camouflage and no observed predation. Kind of like these from your most recent post that you're still repeating: \"In the daytime the adult moths may be found by birds, but there is no evidence that they ever are, under natural conditions\" and \"... but there is no empirical evidence that they [birds] make a significant impact on the adult peppered moth population.\" But fine, you go back and check the literature, then get back to me on it.\n \n \nSure. But you have to prove it with factual observations of birds eating roosting moths. Aside from Kettlewell glueing them to trees, that's never been done.\n\n Here's a quote from an entry level biology textbook:Kettlewell later solidified his argument by placing hidden blinds in the woods and actually filming birds eating the moths. Sometimes the birds Kettlewell observed actually passed right over a moth that was the same color as its background.\n\n link\n \nYou are such an XXX.\n\n Only to people who are grossly mistaken and don't care, preferring to blatantly lie and shill. (Also because I'm capable of reading, no doubt.)\n \n \nBecause I didn't read that particular book, that doesn't mean I've never read anything else!! Are you brain-damaged, or something?\n\n You said that I had no idea what you have or have not read. But you previously said that you have not read Majerus. (You've also said you've read Coyne.) Therefore I do have an idea of what you have or have not read. And unless you've been lying, it turns out I'm right. That makes me brain damaged?",

From answers.com---\n \n \"special pleading--A presentation of an argument that emphasizes only a favorable or single aspect of the question at issue; an argument that ignores all unfavorable evidence.\n \n Special pleading is a form of spurious argumentation where a position in a dispute introduces favorable details or excludes unfavorable details by alleging a need to apply additional considerations without proper criticism of these considerations themselves.\n \n The lack of criticism may be a simple oversight (e.g., a reference to common sense) or an application of double standard.\n \n A more difficult case is when a possible criticism is made relatively immune to investigation. This immunity may take the forms of:\n \n reference to vocabulary that is owned by a distinct community with sole rights to assess meaning and application \n unexplained claims of exemption from principles commonly thought relevant to the subject matter \n Example: I'm not relying on faith in small probabilities here. These are slot machines, not roulette wheels. They are different. \n claims to data that are inherently unverifiable, perhaps because too remote or impossible to define clearly \n Example: Cocaine use should be legal. Like all drugs, it does have some adverse health effects, but cocaine is different from other drugs. Many have benefited from the effects of cocaine. \n assertion that the opponent lacks the qualifications necessary to comprehend a point of view \n Example: I know you think that I should be giving my money to the poor, but you've never been rich before. There are things about wealth that you don't understand. \n assertion that literally nobody has the qualifications necessary to comprehend a point of view \n Example: I know the idea that ball lightning is caused by ghosts makes no sense to you, but that's only because you're human. Humans cannot understand supernatural phenomena. \n In the classic distinction among material, psychological, and logical fallacies,[1] special pleading most likely falls within the category of psychological fallacy, as it would seem to relate to \"lip service\", rationalization, and diversion (abandonment of discussion). Special pleading also often resembles the \"appeal to\" logical fallacies.\n \n In philosophy it is assumed that where a distinction is claimed a relevant basis for the distinction should exist and be substantiated. Special pleading is a subversion of this assumption.\n Examples\n Sure, my client may have stolen, but he is poor, therefore it is excusable. \n You may disagree with my tax plan, but I've taken many more economics classes than you so you should give me the benefit of the doubt.\"\n \n I leave it to my readers to decide who uses \"special pleading\"--myself or you and your fellow darwinists.",

Your assumption that it speaks to your \"selection\", is just your 'idiocy as usual' leap of logic. \n \n Learn what you are talking about before you speak. In your little half-assed scenario you proposed a randomly mating population with no selection. That is Hardy-Weinberg [/quote]\n \n \n **\n Now that I've read the H-W link that I didn't know had been posted, I know that to be the case. BTW, are you calling an example of H_W, \"a half-assed scenario\"? Strange.\n \n \n\n and you aren't even informed enough to know it.\n\n \n **\n I am now, and was when I posted my respnse to electrolyte, above.\n \n \n\n And, of course, the conclusion of the Hardy-Weinberg law is exactly as electrolyte said, that genetic dominance of one allele over another does not cause the dominant allele to become more prevalent.\n\n \n **\n So says the mathematical principle, and now that I've seen it, I accept it. \n \n \n\n That is the point of Hardy-Weinberg. When the allele frequencies change, then some sort of mechanism of evolution is at work.\n\n \n **\n No. That is a stupid mistake. The one and only point of H-W math is how it establishes distribution stasis under certain conditions. The assumption is, of course, that without those conditions, H-W does not operate. The only assumption that can be made in a case where the H-W math does not hold is that 'some' violation of the prerequisite conditions is in operation. H-W says nothing about what that violation might be. You, and before you, electrolyte, both made the same tendentiously presumptous, therefor stupid, mistake. You both assume that that violation must be some one of the near infinite variations on induced mortality that you call, \"Natural Selection\". WRONG!!\n \n Read lite again--\"The Hardy-Weinberg principle proves mathematically that []selection, not genetic dominance, causes tendency toward predominance of a certain genotype. \" [Bold mine.] It was this statement of his to which my above statement, which you're criticising, responded. Now do you get it? I wonder if you're able.\n \n \n \n\n If you actually understood Hardy-Weinberg you would know that each of their conditions addresses one or more of the mechanisms of evolution.\n\n \n **\n One of _your_ mechanisms for 'genetic redistribution in populations', you mean. That's to do with principles of inheritance and conservation/stasis; not evolution,[i.e., _origins_ of novel variations), as far as I, as a non-darwinist, am concerned.\n So far as I'm concerned, simple violations of 'total isolation', 'total absence of genetic mutation', and 'total stasis in environmental conditions' do not lead necessarily and sufficiently to the origins of novel variety in morphology and behaviour,[evolution], though they all 'violate' H-W. \n Nor, for evolution to take place, or not, is it necessary to be diploid or non-diploid. \n Nor need the organism be sexual reproducing to undergo evolution, or remain stable, although it does have to be, in order to conform to H-W. Discrete generations, I suppose. Non-random mating (eg., sexual selection) eliminates H-W, but not evolution, and neither does it entail it. Finally, organisms in populations of any size can evolve, or not, given the right conditions.\n \n You getting the point yet?",

   "\n WW, as usual, you're wrong. I remember studying this very thing in grade 7 & 8 science class, making me 12-13 at the time, so you're statement that \"the actual maths are way over the head of any normal 15 year old\" is false.\n\n \n **\n Simple binomial equations are not difficult. We did them in middle school, too.\n But that is not the math that established the veracity of the Hardy-Weinberg, principle, surely? Isn't it only its expression, not it's proof? It was the proof of the principle that states that dominant genes will never swamp recessive genes, all else being equal, that I was asking for. I assumed ( a mistake, apparently), that the simple binomial was not that proof, but just a simple tool for working out ratioes. I thought (wrongly, it seems) that the abstruse formulae given at the bottom of \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy-Weinberg_principle\n were the formulae Hardy used to confirm and prove the principle.\n \n \n\n As for your statement that \"in fact needed the specialised genius of Hardy, a pure mathematics prof, to put the formulae together in the first place.\" is a defense that it's not understandable by schoolchildren, big deal.\n\n \n **\n It is a big deal when the proof of the principle, and not just the equation used to do the arithmetic, is what was asked for. Who knew the weird formulae on the above link were irrelevent to a proof, and that all that counted to anybody was the binomial? Not me. So I was wrong. Let's move on.\n \n \n\n The Pythagoras Theorem is studied by children starting at about 10-11 years old, so are you saying that Pythagoras was mathematically equivalent to a 10 year old?\n\n \n I suspect that kids use the 'square on the hypoteneuse' = side 2 squared plus \n side 3 squared formula, which is simple enough, but I doubt such children could write the geometric proof for it. It reads like this--\n \n \"the area of a rectangle is (length) times (width), so the area of the one drawn above is ab. A diagonal cut divides it into two right-angled triangles with short sides a and b, and the area of such a triangle is therefore (1/2) ab.\n \n \n Now look at the square on the left constructed out of four (a,b,c) triangles. The length of each side is (a+b) and therefore the entire square has an area (a+b)2.\n \n However, the square can also be divided into four (a,b,c) triangles plus a square of side c in the middle (strictly speaking, we also ought to prove it is a square, but we will skip that). The area of each triangle, as shown earlier, is (1/2)ab, and the area of the square is c2. Since the big square is equal to the sum of all its parts\n \n (a + b) 2 = (4)(1/2)(a)(b) + c2\n \n Using the identity for (a + b)2 and multiplying (4)(1/2) = 2\n \n a2 + 2ab + b2 = 2ab + c2\n \n Subtract 2ab from both sides and you are left with\n \n a2 + b2 = c2 \"\n \n And that's the sort of thing I was looking for in H-W. Did you do this in middle school? I didn't get to this until high school, and again it looks nothing so complex as those abstruse formulae on the H-W page. \n \n But I'm tired of this. Let's just let it go.",

Now we've got a modus tollens being called a non-sequitur.\n\n \n No, I do not. From wikipedia--\n \n modus tollens-\"The argument has two premises. The first premise is the conditional \"if-then\" statement, namely that P implies Q. The second premise is that Q is false. From these two premises, it can be logically concluded that P must be false. (Why? If P were true, then Q would be true, by premise 1, but it isn't, by premise 2.)\"\n \n P[all Hardy-Weinberg conditions] entails genetic stasis, Q. \n No genetic stasis [Q untrue] entails incomplete Hardy-Weinberg, P untrue. \n \n This much I agreed to, above.\n \n But you boys introduce a non sequitur, the notion that 'no genetic stasis equals evolution'. This is not true, because genes are constantly being changed, while at the same time no 'evolution' takes place, either in individuals or in groups. You say, \"Evolution only equals genetic alteration, and genetic alteration only equals evolution\", by employing the 'special pleading' of furnishing your own arbitrary definition of evolution, that being, that it is genetic alteration.\n Nice try. You probably fooled a few people, (besides yourselves), with that little stunt. But your definition has no meaning outside of population genetics; the field which studies the quantities of inanimate acid molecules in a certain geographical area, instead of studying evolving organisms. As shown above, it is organisms that 'evolve', not genes or their 'frequencies'.\n And they think they are biologists!?! HAW!\n \n For the rest of the world, biological 'evolution' is the origin of novel traits and behaviours in _organisms_ that carry over for at least one generation. And no other definition matters. Least of all pop gen's breezy little bit of self-serving, specious inanity.\n \n As for your, \"modus tollens\", W-W stipulates 'no in or out migration'. But you can violate H-W by having in and out migration, and never encounter anything remotely resembling 'evolution'. In short, just so you might just possibly grasp the point, you might not get evolution without violating H-W, but simply violating H-W will not get you evolution. (Except in your own silly definition of it.) And that's your non-sequitur. QED.\n \n \n \n\n The HWP states that allelic frequencies will remain static if certain conditions are met. Among those conditions are:\n no selection\n no mutation\n no gene flow (i.e. migration)\n no statistical effect of genetic drift (i.e. population large enough to negate effects of random sampling)\n random mating\n If all conditions are met, then equilibrium will exist. [If p, then q.]\n Consider the case where an equilibrium does not exist. [~q]\n We can conclude that not all conditions were met. [~p] (modus tollens)\n That is to say, if the frequency of an allele is changing, we can conclude that one or more of the following are taking place:\n selection\n mutation\n gene flow\n genetic drift\n non-random mating\n These are mechanisms of evolution, because they cause allele frequencies to change.\n\n \n **\n And that last sentence is your non sequitur, as shown, above. Fluctuating allelic frequencies do not equal evolution.\n \n \n\n Oh yes, I understand that you think \"mere change in allele frequencies\" doesn't constitute evolution. You call it special pleading. How, pray tell, is it special pleading?\n\n \n **\n Well, since you've been good enough to ask, your bizarre definition of 'evolution' is 'special pleading' because-- (from answers.com)\n \n 1/\"special pleading--A presentation of an argument that emphasizes only a favorable or single aspect of the question at issue; an argument that ignores all unfavorable evidence.\"\n \n In this case your emphasis on genes when the question concerns as it always has done, the ecvolution of whole organisms.\n \n 2/\"A more difficult case is when a possible criticism is made relatively immune to investigation. This immunity may take the forms of:\n \n a/reference to vocabulary that is owned by a distinct community with sole rights to assess meaning and application .\"\n \n This also applies to 'definitions' dictated by your clique, as well as your 'Humpty-Dumpty' semantics, eg.

That's good enough for now, especially 2a.\n \n \n\n What rule or convention are we excepting without reason? Do you deny that a new mutation results in a change in allelic frequencies? Do you deny that an allele's going to fixation has an evolutionary effect?\n\n \n **\n First question, answered above. Second question, no, I do not. Third question, yes, I do deny it. An allele's going into fixation has an hereditary, not an evolutionary, effect. You guys seem incapable of understanding that heredity is not evolution.",

Change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals, and resulting in the development of new species.\n \n from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html\n \"In fact, evolution can be precisely defined as any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next.\" \n - Helena Curtis and N. Sue Barnes, Biology, 5th ed. 1989 Worth Publishers, p.974 \n \n and, from the same website:\n Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.\" \n - Douglas J. Futuyma in Evolutionary Biology, Sinauer Associates 1986 \n \n So stop arguing over the definitions. Words mean different things in different disciplines. Or would you argue with a ship captain that port is not a direction he can steer his ship in, as port is clearly a type of wine?",

   "But you boys introduce a non sequitur, the notion that 'no genetic stasis equals evolution'... Fluctuating allelic frequencies do not equal evolution.\n\n T.Q beat me to this. \n \n \nBut your definition has no meaning outside of population genetics...\n\n Again, it's ludicrous that you're again claiming to know more about population genetics than people who've thoroughly studied population genetics despite the fact that you've admitted your willful ignorance of it.\n \n \nFor the rest of the world, biological 'evolution' is the origin of novel traits and behaviours in _organisms_ that carry over for at least one generation. And no other definition matters.\n\n Check with any biologist and get back to me; tell me what \"the rest of the world\" thinks. Heritable mutations are a mechanism of evolution, but heritable mutations are not the entirety of evolution. If one organism acquires a \"novel\" heritable mutation allowing it to have 100 times more offspring than those organisms with a different allele, what do you (and your \"expert\" understanding of population genetics) think happens?\n \n \nIn this case your emphasis on genes when the question concerns as it always has done, the ecvolution [sic] of whole organisms.\n\n And the (populations of) whole organisms evolve via changes in their genetic makeup... Hello? Hello? Is this thing on?\n \n \na/reference to vocabulary that is owned by a distinct community with sole rights to assess meaning and application .\"\n \n This also applies to 'definitions' dictated by your clique, as well as your 'Humpty-Dumpty' semantics, eg. 'selection'.\n\n What tripe. T.Q touched on this too, but I'll put in my two cents. This is like trying to say that because \"density\" is the extent to which a person cannot comprehend a topic, the concept of mass per unit volume must be nonsense, and physical scientists are just making sh*t up.\n \n \nThird question, yes, I do deny it. An allele's going into fixation has an hereditary, not an evolutionary, effect.\n\n Fixation has no evolutionary effect, eh? So when a new mutation becomes fixed, the population hasn't evolutionarily changed? When several new mutations become fixed, the population hasn't evolutionarily changed?",

I, on the other hand, have addressed the issue of their UV vision, which this source acknowledges they have.\n Yet, in the big picture, this is hardly still open to debate.

He has video evidence that birds have difficulty seeing the camouflaged moths.\n \n \nMoreover, Kettlewell wrote down certain figures on a piece of paper. You call that \"document[ing]\".\n\n Now you're saying that Kettlewell lied, but you have no evidence for such an accusation. You're ignoring the data because you don't like it.

Nobody disputes that Kettlewell placed them there, but you said they don't belong there, i.e. that birds don't rest on trunks. You are wrong. You were provided evidence contrary to your assertion, and you presented the assertion again.

Dr Wells' who gives the impression in his response that he has read my book, obviously has not. If he had, he would have seen that in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 I myself have recorded 168 peppered moths on tree trunks or at trunk/branch joins.\" [source]\n \n \nEspecially if most of that pathetic number were found in the immediate vicinity, at first light, after a night of luring them into and near to lamp-lit moth traps.\n\n It sure would make you look less nuts if you followed my links and learned from them. My earlier link has two sets of data, one of which is of resting places near traps and the other is of resting places in the wild.\n \n So out of the large handful of lies I exposed, wabbit only tried to respond to a few and still got his XXX kicked.

Coyne is in the Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, 1101 E. 57 Street, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.\n \n Melanism: Evolution in Action\n by Michael E. N. Majerus Oxford University Press: 1998. 338,pp.\n \u00a355, $105 (hbk), \u00a323.95, $45 (pbk)\n \n Cautionary tale: the classic account of industrial melanism in the peppered moth now looks flawed.\n From time to time, evolutionists re-examine a classic experimental study and find, to their horror, that it is flawed or downright wrong. We no longer use chromosomal polymorphism in Drosophila pseudoobscura to demonstrate heterozygous advantage, flower-colour variation in Linanthus parryae to illustrate random genetic drift, or the viceroy and monarch butterflies to exemplify Batesian mimicry. Until now, however, the prize horse in our stable of examples has been the evolution of 'industrial melanism' in the peppered moth, Biston betularia, presented by most teachers and textbooks as the paradigm of natural selection and evolution occurring within a human lifetime. The re-examination of this tale is the centrepiece of Michael Majerus's book, Melanism: Evolution in Action. Depressingly, Majerus shows that this classic example is in bad shape, and, while not yet ready for the glue factory, needs serious attention.\n \n According to the standard textbook litany, before the mid-nineteenth century, all B. betularia in England were white moths peppered with black spots, a form called typica. Between 1850 and 1920, typica was largely replaced by a pure black form (carbonaria) produced by a single dominant allele, the frequency of which rose to nearly 100% in some areas. After 1950, this trend reversed, making carbonaria rare and typica again common. These persistent and directional changes implied natural selection. In a series of studies, this conclusion was verified by several investigators, most prominently Bernard Kettlewell of Oxford.\n \n According to these workers, the evolution of colour was caused by birds eating the moths most conspicuous on their normal resting site - tree trunks. The increase in black moths was attributed to pollution accompanying the rise of heavy industry. A combination of soot and acid rain darkened trees by first killing the lichens that festooned them and then blackening the naked trunks. The typica form, previously camouflaged on lichens, thus became conspicuous and heavily predated, while the less visible carbonaria enjoyed protection and increased in frequency. After the passage of the Clean Air Acts in the 1950s, trees regained their former appearance, reversing the selective advantage of the morphs. This conclusion was bolstered by a geographical correlation between pollution levels and morph frequencies (carbonaria was most common in industrial areas), and most prominently by Kettlewell's famous experiments which showed that, after releasing typica and carbonaria in both polluted and unpolluted woods, researchers recaptured many more of the cryptic than of the conspicuous form. The differential predation was supported by direct observation of birds eating moths placed on trees. Finally, Kettlewell demonstrated in the laboratory that each form had a behavioural preference to settle on backgrounds that matched its colour.\n \n Criticisms of this story have circulated in samizdat for several years, but Majerus summarizes them for the first time in print in an absorbing two-chapter critique (coincidentally, a similar analysis [Sargent et al., Evol. Biol. 30, 299-322; 1998] has just appeared). Majerus notes that the most serious problem is that B. betularia probably does not rest on tree trunks - exactly two moths have been seen in such a position in more than 40 years of intensive search. The natural resting spots are, in fact, a mystery. This alone invalidates Kettlewell's release-recapture experiments, as moths were released by placing them directly onto tree trunks, where they are highly visible to bird predators. (Kettlewell also released his moths during the day, while they normally choose resting places at night.) The story is further eroded by noting that the resurgence of typica occurred well before lichens recolonized the polluted trees, and that a parallel increase and decrease of the melanic form also occurred in industrial areas of the United States, where there was no change in the abundance of the lichens that supposedly play such an important role.\n \n Finally, the results of Kettlewell's behavioural experiments were not replicated in later studies: moths have no tendency to choose matching backgrounds. Majerus finds many other flaws in the work, but they are too numerous to list here. I unearthed additional problems when, embarrassed at having taught the standard Biston story for years, I read Kettlewell's papers for the first time.\n \n Majerus concludes, reasonably, that all we can deduce from this story is that it is a case of rapid evolution, probably involving pollution and bird predation. I would, however, replace \"probably\" with \"perhaps\". B. betularia shows the footprint of natural selection, but we have not yet seen the feet. Majerus finds some solace in his analysis, claiming that the true story is likely to be more complex and therefore more interesting, but one senses that he is making a virtue of necessity. My own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of six, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve.\n \n Occupying a quarter of the book, the Biston analysis is necessary reading for all evolutionists, as are the introductory chapters on the nature of melanism, its distribution among animals, and its proposed causes. Majerus, however, designed his book for both professional and lay readers, and this causes some unevenness in the material. The Biston story is sandwiched between less compelling chapters, including long sections on the basic principles of genetics and evolution, which can be skipped by evolutionists. Other discussions, involving melanism in ladybirds and other Lepidoptera, as well as the author's unpublished work on habitat selection, are full of technical details that will overwhelm the lay reader. Unfortunately, most of the work described is inconclusive; despite the widespread occurrence of melanism, its evolutionary significance is nearly always unknown.\n \n What can one make of all this? Majerus concludes with the usual call for more research, but several lessons are already at hand. First, for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom, including the classic work of Peter and Rosemary Grant on beak-size evolution in Galapagos finches. [b]It is also worth pondering why there has been general and unquestioned acceptance of Kettlewell's work.[b] Perhaps such powerful stories discourage close scrutiny. Moreover, in evolutionary biology there is little payoff in repeating other people's experiments, and, unlike molecular biology, our field is not self-correcting because few studies depend on the accuracy of earlier ones. Finally, teachers such as myself often neglect original papers in favour of shorter textbook summaries, which bleach the blemishes from complicated experiments.\n \n It is clear that, as with most other work in evolutionary biology, understanding selection in Biston will require much more information about the animal's habits. Evolutionists may bridle at such a conclusion, because ecological data are very hard to gather. Nevertheless, there is no other way to unravel the forces changing a character. We must stop pretending that we understand the course of natural selection as soon as we have calculated the relative fitness of different traits.",

The fact is, as per my citation above, that Majerus knows that he has NOT vindicated either Kettlewell or himself, and is still struggling, to this very day, to _artificially_ breed and mass release domestic peppered moths until he has enough data on them (he hasn't yet found , apparently, any way to actually get data on natural 'peppered moths' in their natural roosts being eaten by natural birds in any natural way), to draw any kind of scientific conclusion, even one drawn upon contrived and artificial conditions. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Thity-six years and about a billion moths later, majerus has seen exactly seven on exposed tree trunks. But that miniscule percentage is supposed to account for the dramatise rise and subsequent decline in morph carbonica?!? \n \n That \"miniscule percentage\" is better than one out of every eight moths observed... and that's not counting near traps. Near traps, it's nearly one in four. Quit lying.\n\n \n **\n Once again, you are the one lying, and once again your lie is stupidly obvious.\n My \"miniscule percentage\" refers to the percentage, 7 out of a billion, not what you falsely claim, 7 out of 59.

   "Give post number for this, and quote the words from the link stating this.\n\n We're beyond ridiculous now. First wabbit complains because he doesn't know how to use the internet and therefore misses the links that I provide multiple times. Then he gets pissy about how I don't boil down large tracts of pertinent information into a small handful of sentences so that he doesn't have to read any source in its entirety. So, I finally give in to his demands and quote the pertinent claim complete with a link to the source, and now what's wabbit saying? He's saying that I need to give him the post number and quote the claim complete with a link to the source.\n On the other hand, we may have discovered why wabbit keeps presenting false claims after repeatedly being shown that his claims are false: he apparently has lots of trouble with short term memory.\n \n From post #216:Let's take a different approach, since you're incapable of following a link in order to read it:\n Majerus states: \"This is just wrong. Dr Wells' who gives the impression in his response that he has read my book, obviously has not. If he had, he would have seen that in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 I myself have recorded 168 peppered moths on tree trunks or at trunk/branch joins.\" [source]\n\n \nLast but not least, don't criticize what Coyne says about Majerus' 1998 book, by using statements and data that Majerus adds later.\n\n I most certainly could if I wanted to, because it would show that -- even if Coyne's objections were justified at the time he made them -- they don't hold up now. However, I don't even need to do that. You know what's so incredibly funny about this? Not only did I cover this once originally, but I've already covered this again because you refuse to read.\n \n \nOkay, when I say, \"Been there, done that,\" I'm not exaggerating.\n \nYears ago I read people like Jerry Coyne on Majerus, but at my age, memory problems reduce things to impressions, not quotations. If I ever do what you've done, i.e., make a direct assertion about Majerus, I will provide a proper link to it. Saying that I don't trust his motives or his conclusions doesn't require a link. You want to hold up Majerus as an authority who has evidence to support your position, link us to his reasoning to that effect.\n\n Even a perfect memory doesn't fix incorrect input:Coyne\n\"Majerus notes that the most serious problem is that B. betularia probably does not rest on tree trunks -- exactly two moths have been seen in such a position in more than 40 years of intensive search. The natural resting spots are, in fact, a mystery.\"\nHere is Majerus's data, and -- as you can see -- Coyne, uh, ignores the data.\n\n\n \n \nIf youy did that, that would prove you a liar all over again.\n\n Good for me, I didn't do that. The data in the link above is from his book that Coyne was reviewing.\n \n \n... it's plain and simple that Majerus himself found the acquired data woefully inadequate to any scientific conclusions, and is still struggling to back up Kettlewell et al.\n\n Yawn. I'll just quote myself again.Here's some real \"commentary\" from Majerus, regarding bird predation as not only a significant factor but the primary factor: \"We're miles beyond reasonable doubt, but it's not scientific proof.\"\nsource (Note that you originally posted this link...)\n \nAnd your claims that you have debunked anything only prove you a liar.\n\n Really? Look above; all I have to do is repeat things I've already told you to respond to your \"debunkings.\"\n \n \nMany posts ago I told you that I couldn't relocate the link, and so to forget about it, but you keep bringing it back, like a puppy with a chewed up slipper.\n Why is that?\n\n Because you asked me to quote your lies. I did. Not only can you not find whichever source you claim speaks of birds' infrared vision, you apparently can't find any source that does so. Despite this, you've been whining about how visible and UV camouflage must be moot because of birds IR vision.\n And to top it off, rather than admit to your mistaken memory, you're blaming the imaginary source:I made no error. My source claimed that birds' vision extends into both ends of the spectrum.\n\nAnother stupid lie from electrolyte. I am blaming myself, as anyone can see.\n\n As anyone can see, you're doing your damnedest to shift all blame away from you, until even you can't keep up the charade any longer.\n \n \nI said that even assuming that birds do eat them in daylight when they are roosting where they normally roost, (and since neither their normal roosts nor birds feeding on them there has yet to be empirically established, that's just a supposition, an unproven assumption), their mortality is overwhemingly due to bat predation, since that predation has been empiricly established as a fact, and not just a self-serving assumption.\n\n I could link to Majerus's 1998 data about natural roosting sites yet again, but you would ignore it yet again.\n \n \nThe fact is, as per my citation above, that Majerus knows that he has NOT vindicated either Kettlewell or himself...\n\n Yawn. I'll just quote myself again... again.Here's some real \"commentary\" from Majerus, regarding bird predation as not only a significant factor but the primary factor: \"We're miles beyond reasonable doubt, but it's not scientific proof.\"\n\n source (Note that you originally posted this link...)\n \n... and is still struggling ... to draw any kind of scientific conclusion, even one drawn upon contrived and artificial conditions.\n\n No no; again, you don't get it. He's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious. Rather than listen to what Majerus says about Majerus's project, you're listening to Mr. Mistaken Coyne and the author of the the Science article, which doesn't say what you think it says.\n \n \nMy \"miniscule percentage\" refers to the percentage, 7 out of a billion, not what you falsely claim, 7 out of 59.\n\n Talk about a validation of my \"scientifically illiterate\" labeling of you.\n Let's say we do a bunch of research on hydrogen. However, it turns out we only have data for, perhaps, 10^40 (a very generous estimate) atoms of hydrogen. However there are probably at least 10^75 (a very conservative estimate) atoms of hydrogen in the universe, so our sample of (10^40)/(10^75) or 1 in 10^35 is even smaller than the relative size of the moth sample. Therefore we know nothing about hydrogen.\n Do yourself a favor and learn some math and science before you make yourself look even more laughable. One might think that's not possible, but I don't put anything past you anymore.\n \n \nThe comments and observations come from Majerus and written down by a reporter in the interview I cited. So you calling me a liar again is just one more slanderous accusation.\n\n Wait, the reporter just wrote them down? On paper? Well in that case, he must have made it all up! (I do love irony.)\n The fact remains that -- in this very article -- Majerus unequivocally states that the primary cause of change (in the form of bird predation) is \"miles beyond reasonable doubt,\" which, seemingly, puts you miles beyond reason.\n \n \nNow I have just received a caution from the admin re my language. I would expect that you guys must each have received one as well.\n\n How many times I did I call you a \"dick,\" \"presumptuous dick,\" or \"intellectual snob\"? That should be three cautions already. Feel lucky.\n \n \nAnd from now on I will bring every insulting post to the attention of the administration.\n\n We've already established that anybody proving you wrong is taken by you as insulting.

   "**\n Bruce Grant on the subject--\n \n \"Majerus has always paid proper homage to J. W. Tutt, who in 1896 spelled out the basic story much as it is taught today. Few other reviewers have recognized Tutt as the author of the classical explanation of the evolution of melanism in peppered moths by natural selection. A notable exception is Berry (1990) who reprinted the essentials of Tutt's account. Indeed, it was Tutt who suggested that the \"speckled\" form of the peppered moth gains\n protection from predators by its resemblance to lichens. In manufacturing regions, however, where the lichens have been destroyed by pollution and the surfaces of trees blackened by soot, the peppered forms have fallen victim to bird predators while the formerly rare black forms of this moth species have increased in numbers because they escape the attention of birds and pass their traits on to their \"children.\" It is curious that Kettlewell, who championed this account, practically to the letter,scarcely acknowledges Tutt as its author other than to say Tutt \"preferred an explanation on the basis of natural selection.\"\n \n [Great guy, ol' Kettlewell.--ww]\n \n \"It certainly is true that peppered moth caterpillars (larvae) develop different colors in response to environmental stimuli (they come to match the colors of the twigs of their host plants) (Poulton 1890), but it has never been demonstrated that environmental stimuli experienced at any stage in development can induce melanism in adults. The Mendelian inheritance of the melanic forms of adult peppered moths has been repeatedly demonstrated (see Creed et al. 1980 for an analysis of published data reporting 12,569 progeny from 83 families). Clearly, the recent attempts to extend induction arguments to the evolution of melanism in peppered moths are unfounded.\"\n \n [Unfounded only if you go about examining the question of induced colouration in adults from a purely mechanical perspective and make an a priori prejudgement that internal mechanisms of self-awareness and self-identity simply do not exist. But then, without them, how do you go about explaining mimicry and camouflage at all? Truth is, you can't, which is why mechanists have failed to do so.--ww]\n \n \"The Kettlewell era of peppered moth research began in the early 1950s when he initiated experiments to test Tutt's hypothesis that selective predation by birds drove the evolution of melanism (Kettlewell 1955a, 1956). Majerus criticizes the design of these experiments, but misses the mark in identifying solutions.\n Kettlewell's stated objective was to determine whether or not birds ate cryptic moths at rest on their normal backgrounds, and whether, in the case of polymorphic moth species, the birds ate them selectively. His experiments included 3 main aspects: 1) quantitative rankings of camouflage effectiveness (degree of conspicuousness as judged by human observers) of pale and melanic peppered moth phenotypes placed on various backgrounds; 2) direct observations of predation by birds on moths placed onto tree trunks;\n 3) recapture rates of marked moths released onto trees in polluted and unpolluted woodlands.\"\n \n \n \"His initial work was done in an aviary so the order of consumption could be followed.\" \n \n [artificially contrived ecosystem --ww]\n \n \"Among the criticisms of Kettlewell's original predation experiments (and these were first\n raised by Kettlewell, himself) is that the numbers of moths he released on trees created artificially high densities, and that the moths were put onto the trunks of trees which may not be where they actually pass the day exposed to predators. \"\n \n [and in fact, at best only a miniscule and negligible fraction of the total wild moth population has ever been observed to do this.--ww]\n \n \"Inasmuch as the high density problem was addressed by others in follow-up studies (e.g. Clarke and Sheppard 1966, Bishop 1972), Majerus' strongest criticism of these experiments is that Kettlewell used the wrong part of the\n tree. As to where peppered moths actually do take up daytime resting sites, Majerus himself reports by far the greatest number of sightings among moth workers. In his 34 years of moth hunting, Majerus has discovered 47 peppered moths at rest by day in the wild.\"\n \n [bold mine. nuff said]\n \n \n \" (The large samples of peppered moths used to calculate melanic frequencies in local populations come from operating light traps and assembling[pheromone] traps at night. It's rare, indeed, to find a\n peppered moth away from a trap by day even where the species is abundant.) \"\n \n [bold mine. speaks for itself]\n \n \"Majerus separates into categories the position on trees where the moths were located (trunk, trunk/branch joint, branches). While the trunk/branch joint was the most common site, his data indicate that the moths do not all rest in the same place. As Clarke et al. (1994) put it: \"Moths habitually resting\n in only one place will be habitually sought there.\" Mikkola (1984), based on his observations of moths kept in captivity, suggested that peppered moths hide by day on the underside of branches in the canopy. Grant and Howlett (1988) showed that captive moths move to whatever end of their holding pen light enters (if the light enters from the bottom of the pen, the moths will sit on the floor). Perhaps Mikkola's conclusion is correct, but perhaps his evidence is an artifact of his apparatus. In truth, we still don't know the natural hiding places of peppered moths.\"\n \n \"Majerus sees it as \"crucially important\" to learn the natural resting place of peppered moths if we are to assess fitness differences between the morphs based on crypsis.\"\n \n [as any real scientist should do-ww]\n \n \n \" This seems reasonable; however, in his call for future research Majerus proposes using \"two large flat\n transportable surfaces to act as artificial backgrounds to place the moths upon\" with surfaces made to match the colors of the moths. He then proposes conditioning birds to feed from these boards, then putting pale and melanic moths on the boards to record how long it takes birds to find and eat them. I fail to understand how such an experiment will tell us anything that hasn't already been demonstrated repeatedly: namely, that conspicuous moths are easier to find. If the fault with Kettlewell's experiments is that he did not use the right parts of trees to release his moths, I cannot imagine how the use of feeding trays is an improvement.\"\n \n [absolutely correct. how any scient could miss suc a glaring flaw is beyond me--ww]\n \n \" Cook (1998) correctly reminds us that Kettlewell's complementary experiments in polluted and unpolluted woodlands compared the relative success of different moths on the same parts of trees in different areas, not\n different parts of trees in the same area.\"\n \n \n \"By the time birds begin to forage, night-flying moths have assumed their daytime resting positions, and in the case of peppered moths, they remain motionless unless disturbed. It is important to understand this in evaluating Kettlewell's predation experiments. Moths released during daylight hours do not behave normally, and if prompted to fly, they will settle quickly on just about the first thing they encounter. In my view,the greatest weakness of Kettlewell's mark-release-recapture experiments is that he released his moths during daylight hours.\"\n \n [bold mine-ww]\n \n \" Kettlewell devotes considerable discussion to \"release problems\" created because he wanted to avoid having moths turned loose under the cover of darkness from flying directly into his traps before they had been exposed to predators that hunt by vision. It would have been much better had he released marked moths after dark on nights when traps were intentionally shut off. Such moths could then select their own hiding places and would either survive or fail to survive the following day before trapping begins. This solution might seem obvious and easy to recommend, but it's not easy to do. The return rate two days after release drops off enormously as a result of either mortality or dispersal from the trapping area. To get enough data for statistical comparisons requires releasing many moths, and to rear them from the egg stage requires feeding fresh leaves to thousands of caterpillars the year preceding the experiment. Few who haven't fed large numbers of growing caterpillars can appreciate how labor intensive the task is. Still, the experiment should be done. And it should be done using only lab-bred specimens, not mixtures of lab-bred and wild-caught. (This is another potential source of error in Kettlewell's procedures; but see Bishop 1972).\"\n \n [Actually using domesticated moths seems to XXXXX the whole point of 'natural' selection, but that's just me--ww]",

Despite my explanation of his mathematical misleading, wabbit continues with it.\n \n Some of you with better short-term memory might remember that I stated that there is little debate that many of Kettlewell's experiments were imperfect. wabbit has posted some excerpts to this effect, but really, all we need to do here is realize that wabbit has quote mined to his little heart's content. Here's a portion he purposely excised:Despite design problems, Kettlewell's predation experiments are still instructive. He used the same procedures in two distinctly different places, a habitat disturbed by pollution and an unpolluted habitat, and he got complementary results. His data, in both directions, were in complete accord with the directions predicted by the incidence of melanism in the regions. So, if he was wrong to use the trunks of trees in Birmingham, he was consistently wrong to use the trunks of trees in Dorset. If he was wrong to release the moths during the daylight hours in Birmingham, he was consistently wrong to release the moths at the same time in Dorset. His data, however, show that the variable of regional pollution made a significant difference as to which phenotypes of the moths better survived the conditions imposed by the experiments.\n \n Kettlewell's aren't the only experiments that show this. Majerus recounts five other studies, using variously modified experimental designs, that corroborate fitness differences between the morphs in polluted and unpolluted regions. He also reviews some exceptions. Hindsight has enabled us to find fault with all of these experiments to varying degrees and has helped us to suggest future work. It is not true, however, that these experiments are so seriously flawed that their conclusions are invalid. The conclusion that conspicuous moths are more readily eaten by birds than are inconspicuous moths has been repeatedly confirmed. The findings from the grand bulk of the predation experiments are in qualitative agreement with the direction of changes in melanic frequencies documented among geographically separated populations of peppered moths.\nNotice also that, after his repeated bitching at me for not making my links to my sources as aesthetically revolting as possible, wabbit not only forgets to include his source but also completely fails to provide a link. I can't help but suspect that he was afraid somebody might actually find it and see what it really said...\n \n From wabbit's shameless misrepresentation, we might not think that Grant's closing statement, under a heading of Indisputable Evidence for Natural Selection, was:Industrial melanism in peppered moths remains one of the best documented and easiest to understand.\nEven wabbit's own sources kick his XXX.",

   "**\n Now to sum up what facts I now know about the biston beturia 'peppered moth' controversy.\n \n When I entered this thread I was of the opinion that the peppered moth was historically expressed in two colour morphs (i.e., was bimorphic). I am no longer convinced that the dark morph, morpha carbonaria, even existed prior to the industrial revolution of the late 18th, and 19th century England. There is no evidence that it was ever seen before 1800. The inportance of thi point, for me at least, is that I had up to now pretty much ignored the controversy, because as far as I'm concerned, unless something novel occurred, no evolution took place. The mere population fluctuation from the preponderance of therecessive alle, morpha typica, over to morpha carbonaria, and the reversal of that industrial melanism back to the overwhelming preponderance of the mopha typica, was unimportant to me, since it only reflected inherited variation statistical fluctuations, and nothing about evolution (unless you bought into the self-serving geneticist definition of evolution, devised with this very sort of thing in mind). As far as I was was concerned bird predation, as claimed, could have caused it, correlating camouflage and bird predation. Predation is one of the billion and one mechanical (i.e., scientific) causes subsumed under the metaphysical abstraction, \"Natural Selection\", which all the world, including Charles Darwin, knew had nothing to do with the origins of new biological variety. Such as novel instances of mimicry and camouflage. If carbonaria and/or typica were not novel instances of real evolution, why should anyone care? Easpecially when the only actual empirical work done on the issue was tainted with incompetence and corruption, such as pinning moths where they rarel, very rarely, roost naturally, and in releasing numbers of sunlight confused moths so that the birds could go right at them.\n \n But out of boredom, as a newbie here, I joined in on this thread. Now I have more interest in the controversy, because there really may be some real evolution in organisms, and not just changes in statistics, in this case. If carbonaria was a novel, original, alteration in a moth that previously had been solely and only 'typica'.\n \n I did not know that there was any doubt that bird predation was truly the cause of the differential decline and re-ascendance of typica morphs over carbonaria morphs. Ihad simply accepted what everyone has been saying school, at least since Haldane et al. Now I know that bird predation is not a given. But if bird predation is not a demonstrated fact, then the entire premise that bird predation is responsible for industrial melanism goes right down the tube, with no other of the billion and one faces of \"Natural Selection\" in sight.\n \n The reason that bird predation is in deep scientific doo doo, is that there is absolutely no convincing empirical observations of birds eating roosting moths.\n None. Nowhere. There is nothing but assumption based upon a plausible speculation. All of the experimentation, (and nothing empirical was even attempted until Kettlewell) has failed to a/ locate the masses of roosting moths, and subsequent to that failure, b/empirical observations of birds feeding on them in sufficient quantities to account for the dramatic rise and fall in the differential census statistics of the two morphs. It's still such an open question that Majerus is still, to this day, releasing thousands of hand-raised moths in hopes that these tame insects will somehow clue him in to what happens to wild moths, before carbonaria disappears forever.\n \n I also found out what, \"Hardy-Weinberg\", means, but that was hardly worth all the trouble I got for it.",

   "Now to sum up what facts I now know about the biston beturia 'peppered moth' controversy.\n\n Translation: \"I've had my XXX kicked so handily throughout this thread that I am unable to respond substantively to the numerous refutations of my talking points. Instead, I will now review the basic premise of my position, taking into account absolutely nothing that I have learned.\"\n However, the fact that he calls it \"biston beturia\" is a pretty good indicator of his \"facts.\"\n \n \nThe mere population fluctuation from the preponderance of therecessive alle, morpha typica, over to morpha carbonaria, and the reversal of that industrial melanism back to the overwhelming preponderance of the mopha typica, was unimportant to me, since it only reflected inherited variation statistical fluctuations, and nothing about evolution\nI have only one comment, then I will skip ahead to a later quote from wabbit for the sake of approaching the two passages together:\n So the natural tendency of populations to become better suited for their particular environments means nothing to wabbit. Any reasonable person would realize that there's an association of some sort...\n \nI also found out what, \"Hardy-Weinberg\", means, but that was hardly worth all the trouble I got for it.\n\n He claims to know what \"Hardy-Weinberg\" means, but that statement alone makes me wonder. Based on the position he still maintains, we can be sure that he certainly doesn't understand HWE/HWP. The HWP means that the only way for said \"statistical fluctuations\" to occur is for some evolutionary mechanism to be operating. Yet above he says that there was fluctuation but there was not evolution.\n This is because wabbit defines \"evolution\" as the arising of a novel trait. For example, if we assume that all moths were typica, and a novel mutation produced the first carbonaria, then that instance would be \"evolution.\" All subsequent occurrences of the mutant allele would be \"evolutionarily\" insignificant. This is, of course, asinine; if the mutant allele reached fixation, wabbit's definition would reflect that no changes have occurred, because no new alleles had come into existence after the arising of the mutant body color allele. To make this more obvious, imagine two mutations of different genes, not even in the same individual. (Say one mutation makes an organism twice the size and the other mutation makes an organism twice as metabolically efficient.) Imagine both were advantageous. Also imagine, for the sake of argument, that no more new alleles arose; in other words, assume that \"no evolution took place\" by wabbit's defintion, even if these alleles went to fixation. Yet, the organisms within this population in which these alleles arose would quickly double in size and in metabolism efficiency, resulting in each individual being twice the size and twice as metabolically efficient without the benefit of \"evolution.\"\n And we can take the reverse example: Say a mutant allele arises in a single individual, and that individual dies without passing on the mutant allele. According to wabbit, this case of allele arising and extinction and the previous (single mutation) example of an allele arising and going to fixation involves precisely the same amount of \"evolution.\" Ridiculous.\n \n \nIf carbonaria and/or typica were not novel instances of real evolution, why should anyone care?\n\n Ah, the \"I don't care\" approach. \"All the evidence these people have shown me says I'm wrong, but I don't care.\" This approach always works wonders for evolution-deniers; in fact, it's pretty much required in order to be one.\n \n \nEaspecially when the only actual empirical work done on the issue was tainted with incompetence and corruption, such as pinning moths where they rarel, very rarely, roost naturally, and in releasing numbers of sunlight confused moths so that the birds could go right at them.\n\n I suppose that given a one-in-eight chance (the same proportion of moths found on exposed trunks to total moths found) of pulling the trigger with the bullet in the chamber, he'll play a round of Russian roulette?\n Again, nobody is denying that Kettlewell placed dead moths on trunks for illustrative purposes. For wabbit to present this as if it is \"corrupt\" even after having this and countless other related facts explained to him repeatedly is simply a demonstration of his despicable dishonesty. Further, should we accept the objection that the moths were released during the daytime, wabbit's ranting about the predation experiments show his ignorance of the results: when \"the birds could go right at them,\" the birds didn't find nearly as many camouflaged ones. This demonstrates the effect of the camouflage that wabbit has insisted is ineffective.\n \n \nNow I know that bird predation is not a given.\n\n wabbit's own source still kicks his XXX.

   "**\n Loathe as I am to pick up any of electrolyte's posts, except from the upwind end of a very long spade, I will again point out his distortions of the present argument, in the hope that some readers may not be card-carrying members of his cheer-leader squad, and will achieve understanding.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Now to sum up what facts I now know about the biston beturia 'peppered moth' controversy. \n \n Translation: \"I've had my XXX kicked so handily throughout this thread that I am unable to respond substantively to the numerous refutations of my talking points. Instead, I will now review the basic premise of my position, taking into account absolutely nothing that I have learned.\"\n However, the fact that he calls it \"biston beturia\" is a pretty good indicator of his \"facts.\"\n\n \n \n **\n Empty bravado, putting words in my mouth, and petty picking on the fact that my typing is so bad that I leave a lot of typoes. It obviously is not from ignorance that I did not type, \"Biston Betularia\", but from accident, but electrolyte is nothing, if not petty and spiteful.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The mere population fluctuation from the preponderance of therecessive alle, morpha typica, over to morpha carbonaria, and the reversal of that industrial melanism back to the overwhelming preponderance of the mopha typica, was unimportant to me, since it only reflected inherited variation statistical fluctuations, and nothing about evolution \n \n I have only one comment, then I will skip ahead to a later quote from wabbit for the sake of approaching the two passages together:\n So the natural tendency of populations to become better suited for their particular environments means nothing to wabbit. Any reasonable person would realize that there's an association of some sort...\n\n \n **\n Yes, any person would recognise that correlation, and certainly I do. That is why my own hypotheseis on evolution, mentioned many, many times in these threads, is called Endogenous _Adaptive_Mutagenesis, and traces back to the _adaptationist_ ideas of Lamarck. \n BUT, any intelligent, honest, and fair-minded person whose reading skills exceeded third grade, would pick up on the fact that the evolution of populations (i.e., biometrics), is a part of the study of ecology and ecosystems, which, though as important to science as the study of heredity, is, just like the study of heredity (genetics), only peripheral to the study of organismic evolution; i.e., the 'origins' of novel variations in bioforms. Organismic evolution is the only field of study that does interest and concern me in this thread, even though the geneticist crowd keeps trying to make it all about biometrics.\n \n Like all population geneticists, electrolyte wants the world to believe that the word \"evolution\" applies to numerical fluctuations in sets of alleles, i.e., bits of acid. Between arithmetic, abstract labels, distorted semantics, and reduction to acid molecules, he and his materialist/mechanist pals are doing their best to keep life and its qualities OUT of biology.\n \n Those of you who think, \"populations\", and not \"organisms\", when you hear the word 'evolution', are welcome to his lifeless world.\n \n \n [/quote]\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n I also found out what, \"Hardy-Weinberg\", means, but that was hardly worth all the trouble I got for it. \n \n He claims to know what \"Hardy-Weinberg\" means, but that statement alone makes me wonder. Based on the position he still maintains, we can be sure that he certainly doesn't understand HWE/HWP. The HWP means that the only way for said \"statistical fluctuations\" to occur is for some evolutionary mechanism to be operating. Yet above he says that there was fluctuation but there was not evolution.[/quote]\n \n **\n Wrong. Using the \"population\" definition of evolution, H-W would be true on its face, since change OF ANY KIND, not necessarily evolutionary change, destroys the stasis of H-W. Since geneticists nebulously consider ANY KIND of statistical genetic fluctuation an example of what they CALL \"evolution\", (eg., any dead duck is an 'evolving' duck, according to them, within its \"population\" of one). Three ducks shot dead out of a flock of seven is \"evolution\" in a \"population\", by their ridiculous standards. The rest of us see absolutely no evolution wrt the ducks themselves, dead or alive.\n \n Coming back to H-W, any change in stasis signifies change, but not necessarily evolutionary change, unless your definition is as nebulous and vacuous and all-encompssing as the geneticist version of 'evolution'. That is, any violation of of H-W stasis signifies change of some kind, but only a geneticist would call a change of any kind, no matter how transient, trivial and ephemeral, an evolutionary change. \n \n Only alterations in the traits of organisms that persist, carry-over, from one generation to another, are evolutionary changes, and many of those are transmitted epigenetically and are acquired developmentally, not genetically. They do not violate Hardy-Weinberg, but they do violate the geneticist version of \"evolution\".\n \n \n\n This is because wabbit defines \"evolution\" as the arising of a novel trait.\n\n \n **\n See, folks?! I knew that he knew that.\n \n \n\n For example, if we assume that all moths were typica, and a novel mutation produced the first carbonaria, then that instance would be \"evolution.\"\n\n \n **\n See? He does know more than he lets on.\n \n \n\n All subsequent occurrences of the mutant allele would be \"evolutionarily\" insignificant. This is, of course, asinine; if the mutant allele reached fixation, wabbit's definition would reflect that no changes have occurred,\n\n \n **\n Nope, lyte's statement is what's \"asinine\"! My definition states that the novel appearance of carbonaria signifies that an evolutionary change HAS occurred.\n The point being the actual dark morph, morpha carbonaria, (and not whatever mutated allele geneticists assume to be the cause of this novel evolutionary organismic form), is all the proof necessary to establish an evolutionary event, provided that the change in trait persists over one or more generations. Less than one generation and it's only a mutant.\n Whether this change only persists in small numbers over these generations, or becomes more prevalent than the original biophorm, is totally irrelevent to the fact that an act of evolution has, in fact, occurred. The only remaining question is, how and why did it occur in the first place? And that's what I care about.\n \n All the noise about industrial melanism, its rise and subsequent fall in the population, is only a matter for ecological biometrics, not the actual evolution of the dark morph. The question of its evolution geneticists merely evade. Where a creationist might say, \"Goddidit!\", they say, \"Pure chance, as an entropic, accidental, genetic mutation, 'didit'!\" The one has no more 'science' in it than the other.\n \n \n\n because no new alleles had come into existence after the arising of the mutant body color allele.\n\n \n **\n Well, duh, yeah?!?!\n \n \n\n To make this more obvious, imagine two mutations of different genes, not even in the same individual. (Say one mutation makes an organism twice the size and the other mutation makes an organism twice as metabolically efficient.) Imagine both were advantageous. Also imagine, for the sake of argument, that no more new alleles arose; in other words, assume that \"no evolution took place\" by wabbit's defintion, even if these alleles went to fixation.\n\n \n **\n Once again, that's just a horse-sh-t re-write of what I actually said. See above. If no more new alleles arise after the two mutations he gives, then Hardy-Weinberg stasis holds, and no further evolution by anybody's definition, including his own, takes place.\n \n \n \n\n Yet, the organisms within this population in which these alleles arose would quickly double in size and in metabolism efficiency, resulting in each individual being twice the size and twice as metabolically efficient without the benefit of \"evolution.\"\n\n \n **\n Exactly. Except that true wording should be, \"without the benefit of [further] \"evolution.\" Meaning that the organismic evolution is done and over with in this instance, and the rest is just statistical (arithmetic) expansion/contraction of a 'population' within a local ecosystem.\n \n \n \n\n And we can take the reverse example: Say a mutant allele arises in a single individual, and that individual dies without passing on the mutant allele. According to wabbit, this case of allele arising and extinction and the previous (single mutation) example of an allele arising and going to fixation involves precisely the same amount of \"evolution.\" Ridiculous.\n\n \n **\n Hard to tell what lyte is tryin to \"put across\" here, but let's parse it carefully.\n I said that, IF AND ONLY IF, evolution is _defined_ (as lyte and pals define it), this way;--\n \"Evolution is any statistical fluctuation in the comparitive numbers of any given allele in any specified population (and populations can be anything from one to-- you name it.) does the \"case of allele arising and extinction [sic?] and the previous (single mutation) example of an allele arising and going to fixation involves precisely the same amount of evolution.\" \n \n And it does.\n \n Now, if you boys and girls don't like what your very own definition of evolution entails, then change your definitiuon. I suggest that you start by re-defining your position thus;--\n \"Evolution is any statistical fluctuation in the comparitive numbers of any given allele in any specified population, provided that that number remains constant (fixed, stable, unchanged), from the parent \"population\" on to the offspring \"population.\"\n \n This definition is in keeping with your notion that arithmetical populations are what 'evolve', not live organisms. But it depends, ironically enough, upon the necessity that there is no change, i.e., evolution, in this respect, between the 'parent population' and the 'offspring population'. Two populations that are, in every other way, distinct. Therebye making \"stasis\" an essential feature of your \"evolution\". Ho hum.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n If carbonaria and/or typica were not novel instances of real evolution, why should anyone care? \n \n Ah, the \"I don't care\" approach. \"All the evidence these people have shown me says I'm wrong, but I don't care.\" This approach always works wonders for evolution-deniers; in fact, it's pretty much required in order to be one.\n\n \n **\n And so we get 'yada yada yada' instead of an answer. That's why we call him, 'lyte'.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Easpecially when the only actual empirical work done on the issue was tainted with incompetence and corruption, such as pinning moths where they rarel, very rarely, roost naturally, and in releasing numbers of sunlight confused moths so that the birds could go right at them. \n \n I suppose that given a one-in-eight chance (the same proportion of moths found on exposed trunks to total moths found) of pulling the trigger with the bullet in the chamber, he'll play a round of Russian roulette?\n\n \n **\n You're forgetting that you only found your 'bullets' in about 39(?) of the actual 'moth gun's' 10 million+ chambers, and that they were atypically 'loaded'.\n You are trying to make a scientific mountain out of a veritable molehill of questionable, ( i.e., forced, unnaturally observed), data, and that is, (dare I say it again?), assinine.\n \n \n \n\n Again, nobody is denying that Kettlewell placed dead moths on trunks for illustrative purposes. For wabbit to present this as if it is \"corrupt\" even after having this and countless other related facts explained to him repeatedly is simply a demonstration of his despicable dishonesty.\n\n \n **\n Fact--Moths were pinned/glued to places where they do not normally alight, for the very purpose of supporting a hypothesis that differential camouflage in different roosting places was the cause of a hypothetical \"Natural Selection\" mechanism employing diurnal bird predation as the evolutionary explanation for industrial melanism in the peppered moth. RATIONALISE THIS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE, IT IS AN INSTANCE OF CORRUPT PSEUDO-SCIENCE. \"COOKED\" EVIDENCE.\n \n FACT- mobs of tame moths were released in front of motion picture cameras in broad daylight, so that these nocturnal moths would be eagerly predated upon by the waiting diurnal birds, just as soon as the blinded moths instinctually roosted on whatever first they encountered, no matter what or where. \n \n This is the stuff of con men, not scientists. It's no different from the contrived, artificial XXXX that Walt Disney passed off on the public as \"nature documentaries\", (eg., \"The Living Desert\") during the fifties. Almost excusable in a guy who told fairy tales for a living; unforgiveable in a so-called, 'scientist'.\n \n \n\n Further, should we accept the objection that the moths were released during the daytime, wabbit's ranting about the predation experiments show his ignorance of the results: when \"the birds could go right at them,\" the birds didn't find nearly as many camouflaged ones. This demonstrates the effect of the camouflage that wabbit has insisted is ineffective.\n\n \n **\n More absolute nonsense put in my mouth by lyte. Everyone knows the advantage of camouflage. It's effectiveness as an aid to survival has never been questioned by anybody for at least a billion years. Trying to say that I said anything to the contrary is just more mendacious slander from a guy who seems to make it a staple of his very existence.\n \n The issue, for those of you with better heads on your shoulders than lyte has on his, is not that camouflage does not make a difference in predation. Of course it does. The question here is a larger one--that is, did diurnal bird predation on roosting nocturnal moths, under natural, uncontrived, conditions, cause the industrial melanism phenomenon in peppered moths and its subsequent reversal over the past 200 years?\n The fact that hunters can kill birds does not mean that hunting automatically accounts for a decline in wild bird populations, when other factors, such as the 'bird flu', may be the true cause of the phenomenon. But that kind of thinking is way too 'scientific' for , and well over and beyond the comprehension of, your everyday geneticist--like electrolyte.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Now I know that bird predation is not a given. \n \n wabbit's own source still kicks his XXX. \n Quote:\n The conclusion that conspicuous moths are more readily eaten by birds than are inconspicuous moths has been repeatedly confirmed. \n\n \n **\n Again, it is true that camouflage is a very important factor wrt predation, BUT, that, lyte's little fibs aside, was not my point. For instance, small boys catch fish off docks and sea-side piers. That much is also true. But I don't see any scientific proof that the fact that small boys catch ocean-going fish is the true explanation for plummeting global fish stocks. But electrolyte does, I'm sure.\n \n \n\n Ho-hum. Thanks for playing.\n\n \n **\n You and your little peanut gallery are definitely not welcome. Grow up and learn to debate ideas instead of insulting people, bub.\n __________________",

   "It obviously is not from ignorance that I did not type, \"Biston Betularia\", but from accident, but electrolyte is nothing, if not petty and spiteful.\n\n But it is from ignorance that you don't get it right, and the fact that you have typed \"Biston Betularia\" in your insistence of non-ignorance only goes to show that you know so little of basic biology that you don't understand even the correct capitalization and italicization, Biston betularia.\n \n \nThat is why my own hypotheseis on evolution, mentioned many, many times in these threads, is called Endogenous _Adaptive_Mutagenesis, and traces back to the _adaptationist_ ideas of Lamarck.\n\n But this so-called hypothesis is not only based on speculation and misunderstanding of the facts, but it has none -- I repeat, none -- of the evidence that science values so highly. Random mutation and natural selection, on the other hand, are incredibly well-supported.\n \n \nBUT, any intelligent, honest, and fair-minded person whose reading skills exceeded third grade, would pick up on the fact that the evolution of populations (i.e., biometrics), is a part of the study of ecology and ecosystems, which, though as important to science as the study of heredity, is, just like the study of heredity (genetics), only peripheral to the study of organismic evolution; i.e., the 'origins' of novel variations in bioforms.\n\n Again, wabbit is still stuck on his flawed definition of evolution. See also below.\n \n \nOrganismic evolution is the only field of study that does interest and concern me in this thread, even though the geneticist crowd keeps trying to make it all about biometrics.\n\n Here wabbit specifically explains that he doesn't care about the big picture, instead focusing on the arising of novel traits and paying no mind to what happens afterward. Frankly, this is precisely what I explained in my last post was wrong with his position, and here he is professing to the very same inanity.\n \n \nLike all population geneticists, electrolyte wants the world to believe that the word \"evolution\" applies to numerical fluctuations in sets of alleles, i.e., bits of acid.\n\n I'm not a population geneticist. I am decently educated about genetics, certainly moreso than wabbit.\n \n \nBetween arithmetic, abstract labels, distorted semantics, and reduction to acid molecules, he and his materialist/mechanist pals are doing their best to keep life and its qualities OUT of biology.\n\n Patently untrue; we just want to keep nonsense out of biology, and the way to do it is make it clear to everyone possible that ideas like wabbit's hold no water. The fact that we cannot always convince rabid wabbits and their ilk means not that we aren't correct but rather that some people refuse to listen to reason.\n \n \nThose of you who think, \"populations\", and not \"organisms\", when you hear the word 'evolution', are welcome to his lifeless world.\n\n Lame-XXX argument from emotion, anyone?\n \n \nSince geneticists nebulously consider ANY KIND of statistical genetic fluctuation an example of what they CALL \"evolution\", (eg., any dead duck is an 'evolving' duck, according to them, within its \"population\" of one). Three ducks shot dead out of a flock of seven is \"evolution\" in a \"population\", by their ridiculous standards. The rest of us see absolutely no evolution wrt the ducks themselves, dead or alive.\n\n It's only not \"evolution\" when using your vacuous definition of it. The death of a duck in a population of one removes all alleles in that population. If the killing of the three ducks eliminates an allele, or even just greatly changes the prevalence of an allele, this clearly has profound effects on the population, even though you personally wouldn't call it \"evolution.\" In fact, this is still the main problem with your \"this is not evolution\" line of argumentation, which runs rampant throughout your post.\n \n \nOnly alterations in the traits of organisms that persist, carry-over, from one generation to another, are evolutionary changes, and many of those are transmitted epigenetically and are acquired developmentally, not genetically.\n\n But the ability for (what I assume you mean is) \"plasticity\" is genetic. This is a far cry, however, from your proposed \"induced mutation\" that would make a peppered moth dark after moving from a light environment to a polluted one.\n \n \nNope, lyte's statement is what's \"asinine\"! My definition states that the novel appearance of carbonaria signifies that an evolutionary change HAS occurred.\n\n I did not dispute this. In fact, I agreed with it (the relative occurrence of this mutant allele went from zero to some number greater than zero), yet he's labeled my statement as asinine. Funny that, yes?\n \n \nWhether this change only persists in small numbers over these generations, or becomes more prevalent than the original biophorm [sic], is totally irrelevent to the fact that an act of evolution has, in fact, occurred.\n\n More conflation of \"evolution\" as being only arising of novel traits.\n \n \nOnce again, that's just a horse-sh-t re-write of what I actually said. See above.\n\n It wasn't a rewrite at all of what you actually said. It's a new hypothetical situation where I apply your principles and show that they're utterly ridiculous. Try to keep up.\n \n \nIf no more new alleles arise after the two mutations he gives, then Hardy-Weinberg stasis holds, and no further evolution by anybody's definition, including his own, takes place.\n\n And when I said that wabbit didn't understand the HWP, he got all pissy. Turns out I'm right. \"No more new alleles\" arising doesn't mean that HWE will necessarily be maintained. In my specific example, both mutant alleles were advantageous, which means they would be selected for, and HWE would be broken.\n \n \nExactly. Except that true wording should be, \"without the benefit of [further] \"evolution.\" Meaning that the organismic evolution is done and over with in this instance, and the rest is just statistical (arithmetic) expansion/contraction of a 'population' within a local ecosystem.\n\n We have major, even profound changes occurring in a population, perhaps even across the entire population, and wabbit is saying that no \"evolution\" occurs unless an allele is brand new. My point, which wabbit overlooks, is that we get these profound changes. Just because wabbit chooses not to call it evolution doesn't change this. In fact, he doesn't really try to deny it, he just tries to downplay it. It's no wonder, because this is precisely what natural selection is, and wabbit insists that natural selection is a Darwinian dream.\n \n \nHard to tell what lyte is tryin to \"put across\" here, but let's parse it carefully.\n\n What I'm trying to put across is that no net change and profound net change can be the same amount of \"evolution,\" by wabbit's definition.\n \n \nI said that, IF AND ONLY IF, evolution is _defined_ (as lyte and pals define it), this way;--\n \"Evolution is any statistical fluctuation in the comparitive numbers of any given allele in any specified population (and populations can be anything from one to-- you name it.) does the \"case of allele arising and extinction [sic?] and the previous (single mutation) example of an allele arising and going to fixation involves precisely the same amount of evolution.\"\n \n And it does.\n\n Baloney. Only by wabbit's definition of \"evolution is a novel mutation\" do these situations involve the same amount of \"evolution.\" Of the two examples, there is more real evolution in the population that undergoes a radical frequency change such that the new allele goes to fixation, because the ratio changed more. The other example involved only a blip of ratio change that was eliminated in the next generation. Same new allele, much different effect; this is the effect he is hand-waving away, when clearly it is significant.\n \n \nNow, if you boys and girls don't like what your very own definition of evolution entails, then change your definitiuon.\n\n Clearly, wabbit missed that his definition, not the biological one, results in that inanity of \"equal\" evolution for the above examples. The biological world doesn't use his definition for the very reason explained above. In fact, here he seems to imply that we should find something wrong with the implications. Unfortunately for him, the implications result from his definition, not the biological one.\n \n \nI suggest that you start by re-defining your position thus;--\n \"Evolution is any statistical fluctuation in the comparitive numbers of any given allele in any specified population, provided that that number remains constant (fixed, stable, unchanged), from the parent \"population\" on to the offspring \"population.\"\n\n This is even more unrealistic. By this definition, evolution cannot happen unless the death rate precisely equals the birth rate. This is why, instead of absolute numbers, we use ratios, or relative frequency.\n \n \nBut it depends, ironically enough, upon the necessity that there is no change, i.e., evolution, in this respect, between the 'parent population' and the 'offspring population'. Two populations that are, in every other way, distinct. Therebye making \"stasis\" an essential feature of your \"evolution\". Ho hum.\n\n Here wabbit explains ... well, I'm not sure what he's explaining. He seems to be saying that, using his (new, nonsensical) definition, evolution can only occur when there's no evolution. Now there's an effective definition if ever I've seen one.\n Even if we were to accept such a definition, it appears that he's still wrong. Given a constant number of organisms in the population, nothing forbids that no new mutations arise (\"evolution\" by wabbit's definition), and nothing forbids that frequencies don't change (evolution by standard definition).\n \n \nAnd so we get 'yada yada yada' instead of an answer. That's why we call him, 'lyte'.\n\n And 'lyte' is kicking this featherweight's XXX.\n \n \nYou are trying to make a scientific mountain out of a veritable molehill of questionable, ( i.e., forced, unnaturally observed), data, and that is, (dare I say it again?), assinine [sic].\n\n Do you have some explanation for why Majerus's data is unreliable, or are you just doing your typical wascally thing of ignoring the evidence simply because you don't like it? Based on your history, betting on the latter is the smart move.\n \n \nFact--Moths were pinned/glued to places where they do not normally alight\n\n Lie. Moths do rest on trunks, even exposed trunks. That you're still claiming otherwise is reprehensible.. and yet, not the least bit surprising.\n \n \nMore absolute nonsense put in my mouth by lyte. Everyone knows the advantage of camouflage.\n\n Balderdash. wabbit has (wrongly) repeatedly claimed that the UV/visible camouflage is useless because birds see IR. It turns out that -- as usual -- he had absolutely no evidence for this and was unable to even provide a link, yet he perpetuated the claim until he had it driven into him by a third party. Even then, he blamed his unspecified source instead of retracting the claims that he couldn't support, then, upon being called on this, he pretended he'd accepted responsibility the entire time. That's pathetic behavior even for an anonymous online forum.\n \n \nThe question here is a larger one--that is, did diurnal bird predation on roosting nocturnal moths, under natural, uncontrived, conditions, cause the industrial melanism phenomenon in peppered moths and its subsequent reversal over the past 200 years?\n\n According to Majerus, who has done a hell of a lot more research than has wabbit, the primary cause of change (in the form of bird predation) is \"miles beyond reasonable doubt.\" So yes, this is the question, but we have a reasonable answer; wabbit dimisses it simply because he doesn't like it.\n \n \nGrow up and learn to debate ideas instead of insulting people, bub.\n\n Funny, I don't remember calling people \"presumptuous dicks\" and \"intellectual snobs.\" You're getting really good at the projection there, wabbit. You should be proud.",
