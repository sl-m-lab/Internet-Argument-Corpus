Pakistan, like the Sauds, enjoys complete immunity from US intelligence efforts.\n \n The 'attack' Intel has proven to be three years old. But that didn't stop Homeland Security from upping the alert status, costing both NY and NJ many millions of dollars for public safety overtime and casting yet another pall of fear over the American public. I thought a photo of two cops in front of a securities building was appropriate for the times; one had an automatic weapon strapped across his chest. \n \n Our public has been put in a defensive posture, our civil rights restricted and our economy attacked. The administration seems very comfortable with these conditions as it continues to pursue a course of aggression with foreign policy and the occupation of Iraq, with no plans for change or any but token efforts to find Bin Laden. Few Americans seem to realize we're in a war of attrition where economics, not guns or explosives, will defeat us. 9/11 Damage was minor when compared to what living under current conditions is and will become in the near future.",

In all honesty, there is a part of me that agrees with you. What keeps me going is although I feel the American people in general are ignorant and easily duped by the LEFTIST propaganda being shoved down their throats, I have faith that when they wake up they will choose survival over all \"rational\" thinkers out there. When the terrorists fear us, they will stop. Right now, all these AYrabs feel safe and comfy because they have safe haven here, courtesy of the LEFTIES. The second Billy Bob and his buddies drive around picking them off one by one, they will run for their lives. The LEFT has made us a joke and an easy target. Who was that Japanese General who said, after learning that the Pearl Harbor wasn't the resounding success they had hoped, that they have just woken the sleeping bear. I don't think it's any different now. All of you \"rational\" thinkers, who don't even need their bodies anymore because they are all pure thought, say that the internment of the Japanese in WWII was wrong. This country did what it HAD to do at the time in order to survive, and we will need to do that in the future.

   "The 'attack' Intel has proven to be three years old. But that didn't stop Homeland Security from upping the alert status, costing both NY and NJ many millions of dollars for public safety overtime and casting yet another pall of fear over the American public. I thought a photo of two cops in front of a securities building was appropriate for the times; one had an automatic weapon strapped across his chest.\n \n \n \n \n And your point is? It took the terrorists 5 years to coordinate the 1993 WTC bombing. It is rumored to have taken them even longer to plan the 9/11 attacks. So if we received that information 3 years ago, right now would be a pretty good time for them to complete their plans. I can't believe you even think we are wasting money by doing these terror alerts. Hey I have a good idea...let's get rid of the terror alert, and hell, let's get rid of the Amber alert while we're at it. Do you know how much it would have cost if we didn't raise the alert and a terrorist blew up a building or 2? A lot more than a few million dollars, probably more like in the billions. \n \n \n \nOur public has been put in a defensive posture, our civil rights restricted and our economy attacked. The administration seems very comfortable with these conditions as it continues to pursue a course of aggression with foreign policy and the occupation of Iraq, with no plans for change or any but token efforts to find Bin Laden. Few Americans seem to realize we're in a war of attrition where economics, not guns or explosives, will defeat us. 9/11 Damage was minor when compared to what living under current conditions is and will become in the near future.\n\n \n \n \n Well people need to make their minds up. Do they want to be informed when the government has EXTREMELY credible information, targeting even specific buildings with which the terrorists had blueprints? Or do they want us to say nothing, and then be blamed when they attack us and we could have prevented it? I choose the former, and I think you would be extremely dumb to choose the latter.

There are few, if any, government press releases or speeches where Iraq isn't carefully folded into the text in a manner that, despite Bush and Blair's denial of links between Iraq and al Qaeda, associates Iraq with all Islamic extremists.\n \n As a political rallying strategy, the invasion and failed occupation of Iraq has worn thin with the US Public. Even after WMDs, Saddam's iron fist governing methodology and currently foreign fighters were exhausted as rationalizations for that blunder, the new political direction is to paint all Islamic extremists with the same broad brush. When was the last time anyone heard the tired rhetoric about democracy turning Iraq and then the rest of the ME into an idealistic utopia? \n \n We're still in the same foreign policy position as we were when 9/11 occurred. Our 'fighting' of terrorists has not changed one iota. We have this vastly expensive and growing bureaucracy called Homeland Security to combat retaliation to our foreign policy, which has less chance of stopping dedicated terrorist attacks than the French Maginot line did in deterring WW11 German flanking actions. Our national guard, normally deployed to provide security within our country, is very busy elsewhere. \n \n The glowing publicity about our intelligence services using computer technology to cripple al Qaeda's financial base is another load of **** in the attempt to sooth the public. Anyone remotely familiar with the ME (and much of Asia) is aware that discretionary funds in that part of the world are transferred by families who have taken centuries to establish their reputations of delivering funds with no questions asked and complete secrecy. \n \n We're running in circles and back to the starting point, again. We have added the Iraq mess to our plate, but our aggressive special interest foreign policy that demands retaliation from affected parties has not changed, nor our inability to combat dedicated, non-conventional attacks by those parties.\n \n Short of fielding a force the size of our WW11 military to invade and occupy all Islamic nations with a troop ratio ensuring total dominance, which would turn our currency into confetti, we're in a lose/lose situation.
