   "So how do creationists account for this: ERVs in humans match those in apes.\n \n ERV = useless code in DNA, but present in all members of a species\n \n Basically it goes like this. Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA. This means that if the cell is able to replicate itself, it also replicates the viral DNA. As we all accept, creationists as well, sometimes things go wrong during this replication process. Sometimes, the viral DNA is rendered inactive. This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it. But sometimes, this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing. Therefore, the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error (ERV) permanently and then passes it on. Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome, we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years. This is testable, every human on the planet has the same ERV's each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history.\n \n For evolution to be false, and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false, you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs. When we looked, we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences. The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution. We have the same error in our DNA that all apes have. Each of these errors has a cause that we can trace to a single event. How can you deny that that single event took place in a common ancestor?",

   "This type of analysis can also be mapped. We have found that our human phylogenetic tree constructed from fossil evidence is almost exactly what we find when we trace these ERVs through all of the living apes and monkeys. There are a few misplaced species, but the large scale structure is exactly what we expected. We can see that certain ERVs were inserted into the lineage before two species diverged if both species have this particular ERV. Whats more, given nothing but DNA, scientists can now build the family tree for the evolution of species without ever seeing an animal. This means you could throw a blind set of DNA at a geneticist and he will give you a tree that is both visually satisfying and probably 99% or so matching the conclusion we would come up with using nothing but fossil and geologic evidence. \n \n \n Below shows where ERV were picked up - \n http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/vol80/issue10/images/medium/0802613005.gif\n \n \n This has also been done on dogs. Since we KNOW the history of a dog's lineage from that of a wolf, and then throughout the different breeds of dogs, it seems we would find some evidence of that lineage in ERV mapping. Sure enough, we find consistent results. The canine ERVs are mapped consistently throughout wolves, dogs, foxes, jackels. Again, a blind test needs to be done here. I would really like to see the funding come up for this as it would satisfy Archs demand that we follow the scientific method. Of course any scientist capable of doing this is already a liar in some peoples' eyes.\n \n \n The first post here does a good job of explaining this concept in more detail - \n EvC Forum: ERV's: Evidence of Common Ancestory\n \n \n Creationists really struggle with this one.

If any system is not being selected for how can it be selected for?\n \n It seems a ridiculous thing to have to ask but it is the question that you have not been able to answer without one of these fallacies:\n [*]You have claimed that systems can change function\n [*]You have implied that systems do not have to be selected for because mutation may cause them to appear by chance.================================================\n 1.) Scaffolding system = Novel system, A=B : Systems could hypothetically change function, but they would not do it because of natural selection. This is an attempt to use the selection for a second system to explain the new one; it clearly rests on the assumption that system A(new) = system B(different function). \n \n Can you not see why?\n \n There is not selection for the new system until it is formed, you can't deny this!\n \n Why haven't I claimed it's impossible then?\n \n Because where there is no natural selection the genetic differential is directly and exponentially related to likely hood of a mutation to change it.\n \n Not impossible but unlikely depending directly on the assumed differential. Depending on the assumed differential the fallacy moves closer to this one than to pure chance.\n \n i.e. for every base pair/degree of the new system that is different from the old and therefore not selected for the unlikeliness of the mutation increases exponentially.\n \n For the sake of argument consider: A = 99%B could be said to be one in a thousand, A=98%B could be said to be one in a million.\n \n Why must system A = B? What evolutionary process is that? When was it identified? What is it's cause?\n \n 2.) Appeal to chance : You yourself didn't claim this fallacy directly if I remember correctly but you certainly implied it. This component deconstruction on the attack of IC is exactly what my opponents have found \"frustrating\", yet it is perfectly valid, I am not attempting to deny the dynamic nature of evolution nor looking at this in a vacuum but merely applying it where it must be applied.\n \n In evolution all mutation can be said to be pure chance, natural selection the crucial piece that makes evolutionary mechanism plausible is it's conqueror. Probabilities of genetic change in species are directly controlled by natural selection, the degree of increased unfitness or fitness of every mutation is the degree with which natural selection filters them.\n \n Acting in concert these two concepts pure chance, and filtering give us a steady out put of beneficial mutation.\n \n So why do I keep bringing it up in my arguements?\n \n The key to understanding IC is the identification of a hypothetical situation in which natural selection does not function on any supposed evolutionary product.\n \n Let me repeat that in another sense: I am talking about any case that can be found in which natural selection does not function.\n \n What do we have without natural selection?\n \n Pure chance\n \n We have mutation that is unfiltered and random, we have not a mechanism of constant guided change but of sudden improbable change.\n \n This last paragraph is in direct opposition to the idea of evolution which is supposed to explain a process by which something happened not cling to the chance that it might have.\n \n You see it in that famous quote of Darwin's about gradual change, I read an article on talk origins of a evolutionist scientist who claimed if anything in life did not come about by gradual selected change then it would be evidence for ID.\n \n IC speaks about a case when natural selection doesn't function, that is why I talk about pure chance, that is why I gave analogies like erosion forming the statue of liberty to illustrate that this is a fallacy.\n \n ================================================\n \n \n What does IC have to do with natural selection? Simply that an IC system whose components cannot be removed without removing the function.\n \n That is the normal definition but it is open to misinterpretation, specifically the errant attempt to understand it without thinking about evolution itself.\n \n IC is a system whose components cannot be removed without removing the function, Therefore IC is a system which could not be selected for without those components.\n \n It is something that is openly admitted by anyone who cares to think about it for ten seconds, that is why scaffolding was invented.\n \n How can you select for functionality that does not function?\n \n Several errant attacks have been made and repeated by posters on these forums.\n \n One of the most common is: to defeat show an IC system that could have been simpler at one point and attempt to say that an IC system is only the facade of a non IC system that has appeared to us after several parts have gone missing that makes other parts appear necessary.\n \n However it is again clear to anyone who cares to think about it that Something is necessary, that you can remove parts; but that is working in reverse not on how to derive a system but on how to make it appear underivable after it has been derived.\n \n The cleanest point against this is: Functions can be replaced and/or optimized, they can change significantly they can appear more complex or more simple but at some point they must have been novel, it is this novelty that is the source of the appearance of IC.\n \n To that effect one could point out that every single biological system has an IC component.\n \n For every system there is a certain piece(s) that cannot be removed to maintain function.\n \n Therefore it is inherently fallacious to claim that a system can become IC after being non-IC, because there is no such thing as non-IC if one is considering the entire proposed evolutionary history of life.\n \n I contend that any system can be traced back to a point where there was no selection for it. I further contend that any scaffolding or more primitive precursor to a functional system will be itself IC or can be tracked back to an IC root.\n \n I do not know why Behe has not pointed this out but it is irrelevant.\n \n I found a good analogy to IC on talk origins, imagine three stones and their function is to serve as a bridge, at some point another slab of stone is thrown over the three, and eventually the middle stone is removed.\n \n Now the removal of any of the three stones would cause the bridge to cease functioning, so this is IC right?\n \n Yes!\n \n Ah but the final system is more complex then the old one, so this disproves IC right?\n \n No!\n \n It is exceedingly simple analogy and it surprises me greatly that one cannot follow it even when one is writing the article.\n \n You see with the orginal three stones if you removed one, it would remove the functionality as well.\n \n The system started out IC, and remains IC.\n \n What if you had only two stones? same, what if only one?\n \n There you have it, IC can be traced always back to it's orginal functionality, to it's novel formation.\n \n In fact every single system that is IC now MUST have started out as a novel function no matter how primitive or inefficient.\n \n That is why the question of origin is relevant, it is the largest permutation of this same problem and challenge to evolution, the orginal IC, how could selection select before there was life?\n \n To drop all specific terminology it is the question \"Where did this stuff come from?\"\n \n I truly believe that the answer as to how any given IC system formed is also the answer to why life formed.\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n The second most common is to assert that natural selection is functioning to form an IC system, this is much easier to address.\n \n What is the hypothetical situation in which there can be any selection pressure for system A when system A is not functioning in the least?\n \n \nWe do not have to know for sure what the actual sequence is. Once we have a hypothetical sequence that doesn't break any of the known natural rules, your claim is dead.\n\n Only if I was claiming it was impossible period, not impossible as a product of evolution.\n \n I must now bring up my identification of an appeal to pure chance: Take your statement and pretend my claim is that the statue of liberty could not have eroded from a mountain.\n \n Are you claiming that because one can imagine a sequence by which that would happen no one can argue that it didn't?\n \n \nAll your claims died almost as soon as they made it out the gate. You can keep claiming that no function can exist before it is selected for\n\n No I keep on claiming that no selection can exist for a function that doesn't.\n \n \nwhich means no new functions can result from evolution ever (which has been shown to be false in laboratories), \n\n Really? Did you see what happened when peer reviewed research was thrown at me last time?\n \n It practically proved my point.\n \nbut by doing this you will continue to look like a typical ignorant creationist who does not understand the science you are attempting to refute.\n\n I find it most amusing that you are the one I keep trying to explain evolution to.\n \n Is it more than natural selection with mutation? Why and how?\n \n If you want to defeat my arguements at some point you are going to have to acknowledge their existance.\n \n I have identified the fallacies advanced, you can attack those identifications or you can blindly use them again, I don't think the latter will cause me to appear an ignorant creationist.",

Imagine that.\n \n A True Acid Test\n\n \n Even Behe admits that the system they were able to develop is IC (by his definition).

   "Wow I am pretty ignorant then emoticon_ic\n \n \n A True Acid Test:Response to Ken Miller : Behe, Michael\n\n \n Now, there is a very large problem with Behe's response.. Let's take a look at his claims, and show how his response is inadequate.\n \n Let's first look at what Behe says about the Hill experiment.\n \n \n\n All of the other functions for lactose metabolism, including lactose permease and the pathways for metabolism of glucose and galactose, the products of lactose hydrolysis, remain intact, thus re-acquisition of lactose utilization requires only the evolution of a new B-galactosidase function. (Hall 1999)\n \n Thus, contrary to Miller's own criterion for \"a true acid test,\" a multipart system was not \"wiped out\"--only one component of a multipart system was deleted.\n \n\n \n Now, that is the DEFINITION of an IC system is it not? If any one component of the system is removed, the system ceases to function. That is what Hill did. By removing a single piece, he stopped that function from happening.\n \n Now, Behe then says 'A near identical' piece replaced it.. But, that is not quite accurate. You see, not one gene evolved to create a new system.. the gene did not get replaced by another gene. Instead, there were 3 different genes that provided 3 different functions for the digestion of Lactic acid to occur. This fact is overlooked by Behe. None of the original genes were recycled in the new structure. So, Behe is guilty of misrepresenting what happened.\n \n This is what Ken Miller pointed out in the original page the responded to Behe's response.\n \n \n The Experiments in Question\n \n In 1982, Barry Hall of the University of Rochester began a series of experiments in which he deleted the bacterial gene for the enzyme beta-galactosidase. The loss of this gene makes it impossible for the bacteria to metabolize the sugar lactose. What happened next? Under appropriate selection conditions Hall found that the bacteria evolved not only the gene for a new beta-galactosidase enzyme (called the evolved beta-galactosidase gene, or ebg), but also a control sequence that switched the new gene on when glucose was present. Finally, a new chemical reaction evolved as well, producing allolactose, the chemical signal that normally switches on the lac permease gene, allowing lactose to flow into the cell.\n \n In my book I quoted evolutionary biologist Douglas Futuyma's description of these experiments:\n \n \"Thus an entire system of lactose utilization had evolved, consisting of changes in enzyme structure enabling hydrolysis of the substrate; alteration of a regulatory gene so that the enzyme can be synthesized in response to the substrate; and the evolution of an enzyme reaction that induces the permease needed for the entry of the substrate. One could not wish for a batter demonstration of the neoDarwinian principle that mutation and natural selection in concert are the source of complex adaptations.\" [ DJ Futuyma , Evolution, \u00a91986, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA. pp. 477-478.]\n \n What's Wrong with this Description?\n \n Behe, predictably, was unimpressed with these experiments, and went so far as to call my claims \"extravagant.\" Were they? Let's see:\n \n First, Behe says that Hall did not wipe out a \"multipart system\" as I claimed; he deleted just one gene. Well, that's what I wrote, too. My description clearly and correctly states that Hall started his experiments \"by deleting the structural gene for galactosidase,\" a single gene. However, I did indeed write that this deletion had knocked out a \"multipart system.\" Why? Because once the gene was deleted, three components had to evolve to replace its function: First, a new galactosidase enzyme, second, a new lactose-sensitive control region, and third, a new way to switch on the lac permease gene. And, just as Futuyma and I pointed out, that's exactly what happened - all three parts eventually evolved.\n \n Second, Behe is particularly scornful of the fact that the \"new\" galactosidase enzyme didn't evolve from scratch, but was produced by a small number of mutations in an existing gene, albeit in an operon far distant from the deleted galactosidase gene. In a similar way, the gene for the repressor of this newly-evolved galactosidase, a protein that controls its expression, was rendered lactose-sensitive by a simple mutation in its sequence. In other words, the \"new\" 2-part system was produced by a couple of rather minor mutations in two pre-existing genes.\n \n Professor Behe may be unimpressed by these mutations, but he's missing the point. This is how evolution generally works - by minor modifications of pre-existing genes to serve new purposes. He emphasizes that the ebg gene is \"homologous \" to the lac proteins and overlaps them in \"activity,\" but these statements are quite misleading. The pre-existing enzyme activity of the ebg gene is not enough to support the metabolic needs of the cell, and the ebg gene is actually only 34% homologous to the gene whose activity it replaces (meaning that about 2/3 of the protein is quite different from the galactosidase gene whose function it replaces). The repressor (control) gene is even more different, showing just 25% homology to the lac repressor.\n \n Therefore, my original descriptions of these two genes and the mutations that produce galactosidase activity in them were accurate and correct.\n \n Third, Behe points out that the lac permease which was eventually activated by yet another mutation is a pre-existing protein. It has to be there before the experiments are carried out, and it is not produced from scratch. That's true, of course, but that's also exactly what I wrote. What is new and different, of course, is that the ebg gene product, which originally could not catalyze the chemical reaction needed to switch on the permease gene, acquired that ability by means of another mutation. This chemical reaction, not the permease protein itself, is the third part of the system, even if Dr. Behe is unimpressed by the mundane way in which it evolved.\n \n Fourth, he notes that I did not mention that the bacteria in the experiment were supplied with the artificial inducer IPTG. The use of this inducer, he charges, amounts to \"intelligent intervention\" in the process, thereby invalidating the results as an example of Darwinian evolution. His criticism, once again, misses the point. We cannot even begin such an experiment without deleting the beta-galactosidase gene, and that is necessarily an act of \"intelligent intervention.\" He does not object to that, of course.\n \n However, when Hall grew the bacteria under selective conditions designed to favor re-evolved galactosidase activity, Behe cried foul. As he should know, and as Futuyma wrote, \"... mutation and natural selection in concert are the source of complex adaptations.\" All that Hall had done was to set up conditions where the bacteria would survive (although just barely), and would prosper only if they evolved a system to replace the one he had deleted. Behe calls this \"intervention,\" implying that the investigator had to intervene directly to produce the new system. He didn't of course. All that Hall did was to use that inducer to set up growth conditions that would ensure that the mutants, if they appeared, could survive to be recovered and analyzed. In short, he screened for mutants, he didn't produce them as Behe implies.\n \n Behe is perfectly free to describe the results of these experiments as \"a series of micromutations,\" but he's missing the key question. That question, of course, is whether or not these \"micromutations\" assembled a system that would fit Behe's description of \"irreducible complexity.\" As I will show, they do.\n \n \n and further\n \n Achieving Irreducible Complexity\n \n Does Barry Hall's ebg system fit the definition of irreducible complexity? Absolutely. The three parts of the evolved system are:\n \n (1) A lactose-sensitive ebg repressor protein that controls expression of the galactosidase enzyme\n (2) The ebg galactosidase enzyme\n (3) The enzyme reaction that induces the lac permease\n \n Unless all three are in place, the system does not function, which is, of course, the key element of an irreducibly complex system. Behe quotes a single sentence from Hall's 1999 Paper (FEMS Microbiology Letters 178: 1-6) to the effect that \"reacquisition of lactose utilization requires only the evolution of a new beta-galactosidase function.\" The quote is accurate, but Hall is describing only the enzymes directly involved in lactose metabolism (number 2 in my list above), not the regulatory parts that make the pathway function (numbers 1 and 3). In the very same paper Hall wrote:\n \n \"Genes for enzymes with new or improved catalytic activities do not arise from random DNA sequences; they evolve from existing genes whose products exhibit activities that are more or less related to the \"novel\" activity.\"\n \n As I wrote in Chapter 5 of my book, the well-matched parts of the newly evolved system include both the new enzyme and both new regulatory steps:\n \n \"Lactose triggers a regulatory sequence that switches on the synthesis of an enzyme that then metabolizes lactose itself. And the products of that successful lactose metabolism then activate the gene for the lac permease, which ensures a steady supply of lactose entering the cell. Irreducible complexity.\"\n \n The fact that each of these parts were scavenged from pre-existing genes doesn't compromise this example a bit. At the time Hall deleted the true galactosidase gene, not one of these three components existed in its final, functional form. Mutation and selection produced each of them, not from scratch as Behe would demand, but from pre-existing genes. As Mel\u00e9ndez-Hevia and his co-authors paraphrased Jacob in their study of the Krebs cycle \"evolution does not produce novelties from scratch: It works on what already exists\" [ J Mol Evol 43: 293-303 (1996)].\n \n Behe's Criticizes the ebg System because it is Fashioned from Pre-existing Genes.\n But that is Exactly how Evolution Works!\n \n Are Adaptive Mutations non-Darwinian?\n \n One of the interesting aspects of the ebg system, as Behe notes, is that the several mutations that produce the evolved system seem to appear much more frequently than one might expect for a truly random process. Hall and others refer to the elevated mutation rates observed during prolong non lethal selection as part of a process of \"adaptive mutation.\" Behe says that it is \"misleading\" to use such a system \"to argue for Darwinian evolution,\" because it violates the most basic assumptions of Darwinism with respect to the randomness of mutations. James Shapiro, one of the leading workers in the field of adaptive mutations, would find this reasoning strange indeed. In a 1997 review on adaptive mutations Shapiro noted that:\n \n \"the ability to increase the frequency of potentially useful mutations is beneficial (adaptive) for the bacterial population undergoing selection. It is worth noting that observations on the influence of environmental conditions on the levels of hereditary variation are hardly novel and go back at least as far as the opening chapter of Darwin's Origin of Species.\" [Shapiro, JA, Trends in Genetics 13: 98-104 (1997)]\n \n In short, Darwin would not have been surprised. And he certainly would not have found the phenomenon to be a violation of basic Darwinian principles, as Behe would have readers believe.",

Some will even claim that since we have never seen new legs form or fish suddenly start flying that this is proof evolution is false. However, we have seen mutations cause entire appendages form. Then they claim, \"Well this isn't good enough because the genetic code wasn't written from scratch.\" Now we have genetic code in bacteria written from scratch, or mutated from entirely unrelated genes, and this still isn't enough. I am being accused of strawman arguments for simply quoting what Freedom has said quite literally. If I can't attack what a creationist says, what do I have left? This becomes even more difficult since Freedom has obviously changed his stance on the issue of systems changing function. In one instant functions can't change,and now apparently they can.

Lets looks at this.\n \n \nI contend that any system can be traced back to a point where there was no selection for it. I further contend that any scaffolding or more primitive precursor to a functional system will be itself IC or can be tracked back to an IC root.\n\n \n What you refuse to believe is that the system is always changing. Parts are added, rearranged, removed, etc. Evolution is always 'tinkering' with new arrangements, and slight improvements are usually the result over long periods of time. However, the function of the system may remain exactly the same. Wow! This means that over time mutations have completely replaced the original system, but the function remained the same. There was always selection and always a function as long as the current system has existed. \n \n \n \n \nI do not know why Behe has not pointed this out but it is irrelevant.\n \n I found a good analogy to IC on talk origins, imagine three stones and their function is to serve as a bridge, at some point another slab of stone is thrown over the three, and eventually the middle stone is removed.\n \n Now the removal of any of the three stones would cause the bridge to cease functioning, so this is IC right?\n \n Yes!\n \n\n \n Seriously? The point is that its not IC. It was erected in easy progressive steps that can be seen as slight mutations. The removal of the middle stone made it look IC to you clowns.\n \n \nAh but the final system is more complex then the old one, so this disproves IC right?\n \n No!\n \n It is exceedingly simple analogy and it surprises me greatly that one cannot follow it even when one is writing the article.\n\n \n Is the final system more complex? Lets see, 1, 2, 3, 4 stones before and now 1, 2, 3 stones after...um, that's less complex buddy. What you need to get here is that were not looking at physical pieces, were looking at the code that goes into forming them. No matter how you cut it, 4 is less coding than 3, unless you counting a gene that comes along and deactivates one block gene, but then your talking about the complexity of the genome, not the complexity of the bridge coding. Besides, nobody claims that just because the final system is more complex IC is disproved. What is your reasoning for this? Were you drunk when you wrote this, BTW?\n \n \nYou see with the orginal three stones if you removed one, it would remove the functionality as well.\n\n \n OK, well here then. I have a single slab. It mutates into two pieces to allow water through instead of being a dam. Then it mutates into three. Happy?\n \n \n\n The system started out IC, and remains IC.\n\n Not anymore.\n \n \n\n \n What if you had only two stones? same, what if only one?\n \n There you have it, IC can be traced always back to it's orginal functionality, to it's novel formation.\n \n In fact every single system that is IC now MUST have started out as a novel function no matter how primitive or inefficient.\n\n \n Based on..? Wouldn't you say it started out just the way it is now?\n \n \nThat is why the question of origin is relevant, it is the largest permutation of this same problem and challenge to evolution, the orginal IC, how could selection select before there was life?\n\n \n This assumes you allow biological evolution to be traced back that far, which in your case, you don't.

This is the same point I have been making for a while.\n\n \n Good. We're getting somewhere. Here, the problem is that the function of a bridge does not necessarily let water through and is therefore a dam. The fact that it was a dam is just a byproduct of the necessity for a bridge. However, being a dam in undesirable and when a hole appears it still functions as a bridge and lets water through. Then you throw a slab on top, which by the way, the code for this is already present in some form since that was the original system. This allows the hole to grow without losing the bridge function.

We are agreeing that evolution is a balance of random (chance) mutations and natural selection, yes?\n\n Nothing is wrong with pure chance, simply that it is vulnerable to large odds. That why even though every function is IC originally, Behe only picked the ones whose odds for single shot mutation were dangerous to the credulity of evolution.\n \n Further (I have said this before I know) but pure chance as a method of advancing genome is not mentioned in evolution. It is pretended as if natural selection will and can guide every formation in a gradual manner. I fully realize that every mutation is initially random, however when natural selection is working on a system every change is recorded and guided, whereas with pure chance scenarios no changes are guided. It is a fundamental contradiction in terms of the theory for it to rely on unfiltered mutation.\n \n Xvolution is an imaginary corollary theory I just named, in Xvolution natural selection is only a concept for entire species. Xvolution claims to explain everything evolution does but instead of gradual change it claims that single mutations form new species (imagine Xmen) and those are selected for instead of alleles in evolution.\n \n Now I have natural selection which most certainly will function on a new species and determine if it's better or worse than others. It is a mix of natural selection and chance as you just put it.\n \n The only difference is in percieved chances of mutation am I correct?\n \n \nUh, why? This is a metaphor, so I contend that the slab can at least be cracked to let a little water through. Why does everything have to be so modular in your representation of systems and functions?\n\n It doesn't but the system is IC, you cannot remove the slab and keep it functioning as a bridge.\n \n If you broke it up, it would not be IC as a whole, but systems may move to periods where not every component is necessary, however so long as there are necessary components there is an IC core. You know that every system has necessary components.\n \n \nWell, yeah. But the idea of a self replicating molecule is easy for me to imagine. I imagine a non-metabolizing molecule that can mirror itself using readily available components and relying on something as simple as the warming and cooling of sunlight to provide the energy for whatever reactions were needed.\n\n Well I'm afraid the origin side of this has reached a dead end.",

   "Further (I have said this before I know) but pure chance as a method of advancing genome is not mentioned in evolution. It is pretended as if natural selection will and can guide every formation in a gradual manner. I fully realize that every mutation is initially random, however when natural selection is working on a system every change is recorded and guided, whereas with pure chance scenarios no changes are guided. It is a fundamental contradiction in terms of the theory for it to rely on unfiltered mutation.\n\n \n Your understanding of the concept is strange to me. On one hand you say NS guides random mutations to abundance, but then in the same breath you say that evolution relies on unfiltered mutation. It can't be both. I contend that your IC systems are built by slow gradual changes in a genome that. In many cases, we have no idea what a previous version of the system looked like, so it is impossible to claim that it must have been IC. In many cases where IC has been proposed, this has been solidly refuted by using living organisms in various stages of forming the system in question. This almost always involves the system changing function. Keep in mind, that a change in function need not be just for the purpose of introducing a previously unknown function that would have been beneficial all along. In most cases it can be assumed that the new function arose out of a changing environment. Maybe climate changed, maybe the organism was being introduced to a newly formed habitat. Almost always, a change in climate or habitat is going to render some of the functions of the organism useless. The systems then go on to find new functions.

Welcome to my world. The only difference is that I have at least some evidence in support of my claim.

   "Your understanding of the concept is strange to me.\n\n I can see that.\n \n \nOn one hand you say NS guides random mutations to abundance, but then in the same breath you say that evolution relies on unfiltered mutation.\n\n Once you understand the distinction I make you will understand IC. \n \n \"NS guides random mutations to abundance\"\n In cases where NS is actively guiding towards the system and function of abundance.\n \n \"but then in the same breath you say that evolution relies on unfiltered mutation.\"\n Alright again some definitional distortion here, the theory as I learned it in Biology 1 way back when is mutation with natural selection. Of course I can't say that evolution relies on unfiltered mutation when its mechanism is defined to be such.\n \n However, that would mean that cases where natural selection cannot be guiding towards a specific function and therefore not filtering mutations in a way beneficial to a final yet currently un-functional system is not evolution\n \n You may choose which one you want believe; you can have a sound theory that explains the genome back to the last piece of novel functionality, or you may have an unsound theory that claims to explain the genome since origin but relies on unfiltered mutation to do it.\n \n \nIt can't be both.\n\n You are correct; I contend that the \"origin of species\" is not explained by evolution, that the theory does not apply to IC systems. (That at some point was all of them)\n \nI contend that your IC systems are built by slow gradual changes in a genome that. In many cases, we have no idea what a previous version of the system looked like, so it is impossible to claim that it must have been IC.\n\n Now it is you who are backing away from your position of pure chance, which by the way is inescapable.\n \n We do not know the exact nature of every functional system in the past you are correct, but had I argued that since you can't tell me exactly how every single protein evolved evolution is untrue I believe you would have pointed out the fallacy.\n \n We do know on axiom principle that every functional system was functional, and that at some point it was not functional.\n \n The simplest of all theoretical IC systems would be a single component, a single protein. If you removed that protein you would remove its function.\n \n A system may go through many ups and downs of being IC and non-IC, however as I have noted if at any point later it is IC it must have been IC at its formation.\n \n This is because if at any point it is IC it necessitates the conclusion that there are a certain number of components which are required to function and that since function is implied through the past until the function was novel, that those components in some form must have been present since then.\n \n I know this is open to misinterpretation so let me give you a hypothetical from a late example:\n \n We see that today we have a biological system that digest lactose, currently it is IC, that means that the function to hydrolyze lactose must have existed so long as the system to accomplish this function existed.\n \n We could track that function (hypothetically) through thousands of proteins, hundreds of control, or efficiency components (non-IC components), but no matter how far you track the evolution of the system it will digest lactose. Before that point the function did not exist.\n \n Therefore since you cannot remove the hydrolyzing function (what ever DNA may accomplish it) from today&#8217;s system and maintain the function of the system, there was never a point along the history of the functional system in which you could remove the hydrolyzing function (what ever DNA may accomplish it)\n \n Can you see what I mean now? The irony is that examples on how systems may become more complex after formation and so \"appear IC\" goes to prove the exact opposite. Examples that show how systems may become more complex after formation are what makes anything appear not IC. (something about clowns)\n \n \nIn many cases where IC has been proposed, this has been solidly refuted by using living organisms in various stages of forming the system in question. This almost always involves the system changing function. Keep in mind, that a change in function need not be just for the purpose of introducing a previously unknown function that would have been beneficial all along. In most cases it can be assumed that the new function arose out of a changing environment. Maybe climate changed, maybe the organism was being introduced to a newly formed habitat. Almost always, a change in climate or habitat is going to render some of the functions of the organism useless. The systems then go on to find new functions.\n \n Systems don't \"find\" new functions they follow the laws of chance and mutation. You know that the particular form of natural selection is irrelevant to this discussion which is about its applicability to genetic code.\n \n \nWhen you have trillions of trillions of organisms and billions of years, you honestly think the odds are a problem for evolution and natural selection?\n\n Not for natural selection, for pure chance.\n \n The earth has been around for longer than life, and there are millions of individual peaks in our history. Do you honestly think the odds are a problem for a statue of liberty rock formation?\n \n \nI didn't remove it, I put a crack in it. A single stone hardly fits even your liberal definition of IC. \n\n Yes you can put a crack in it, but in the context of the example in the article each stone represented a segment of genetic code, which means if you remove the segment that makes the slab it cannot be a bridge. Therefore it is IC as the slab is the only component at that time.\n \n \nThat's quite a bold statement. Didn't we just see an example where bacteria evolved a new system to break down lactic acid?\n\n No, we saw an IC system that made use of an apparently unrelated but functional component that was able to fulfill the removed piece&#8217;s role, it then evolved to do it better.\n \n \nWhy, because there's nothing to refute?\n\n Just IC, that you thought phosolipids activity showed abiogenisis could have happened is a problem a class in biology could fix better than me.\n \n You litterly said since a molecule engineered by the cell fulfils it's purpose in a solution, that means the cell could have been formed by it's product in the solution. It's a chicken out of the egg case and it's almost a red herring it's so irrelevant to abiogenisis. The problem is not that lipids, and amino acids, and other hydrocarbons don't follow the laws of physics before life.\n \n \nWelcome to my world. The only difference is that I have at least some evidence in support of my claim. I gave a few links previously that all showed how organic molecules have many many different forms that can be reached naturally. When you consider the trillions of trillions of trillions of organic molecules that must have existed on early Earth\n\n Wait are you saying they have evidence for this primordial soup besides \"life exists\" and \"we did it in the lab\"\n \n \n and the couple billion years (you do realize how long a billion years is, right?) that passed, how can you say that this is unlikely?\n\n Conflicting probabilities extend into chaos, all that can happen have not happened :)\n \n By the way you accused me early in this debate of arguing from incredulity, what are you arguing from when you cite your opinion of the odds?",

   "Can we look at the definition of IC according to Behe:\n \n \n\"[A] single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease function.\" \n\n \n Behe goes on to state:\n \n \n\"An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional. An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on.\" \n\n \n I think that you are using a slightly more obscure version of this and making a much bolder statement. I think that you tend to leave out the part where if you remove a component there is no function. Of course this is because every single IC system Behe has ever proposed fails to meet this criteria. Give me an IC system proposed by Behe, and I will show the example of a part being missing and it still functioning. Ken Miller has already done all the work. \n \n \nFor every system there is a certain piece(s) that cannot be removed to maintain function.\n\n \n Which basically means that every single system in biology today has certain pieces that, if removed, will cause the function of that system to stop. And you say:\n \n \n...every single biological system has an IC component.\n\n \n You even claim:\n \n \nThe simplest of all theoretical IC systems would be a single component, a single protein. If you removed that protein you would remove its function.\n\n \n I don't really think you meant that last statement. Haven't we determined that a single protein can form spontaneously? Haven't we determined that it happens all the time? A single protein does not need evolution at all then, but if your referring to the analogue of genes that are capable of creating the proteins, then lets look at how much coding goes into a single protein. Some proteins are very large, but this is not what were looking at. The first proteins to be synthesized were surely very small and simple. So lets look at the smallest protein; that's all we need to prove this point since larger proteins could easily evolve from smaller ones. The smallest know functional protein consists of 20 amino acids. That means that you need 60 total base pairs and a stop codon (although who knows if a stop codon was needed in the first translation of a protein). These numbers are hardy staggering. Also, there could have been even smaller proteins that did their job less efficiently and were later replaced by more complex proteins. Further, amino acids can perform basic functions without being part of a peptide group. \n \n Another part of your statement says that every system has at some level an IC component, but you have yet to identify one of the \"novel functions\" or the corresponding novel system. This claim can be refuted, along with your entire basis of IC in general, with the simple fact that functions can change with only a slight mutation. You have yet to address this other than to claim that this can't happen because NS would not drive the mutation and resulting structure in that direction. That is a fallacy however since natural selection never drives a mutation in a certain direction. It always acts on a mutation after it has occurred. Therefore, natural selection is never in control of which way mutations will go. It is like claiming that heads is more likely after 10 heads rolls in a row or a better analogy, tails can't happen since were on a heads trend. \n \n You mask all of this with a strawman. You claim that the odds are just too great for that mutation to have happened. But you don't know what the odds are. Further, you don't even know the chain of mutations that have resulted in the current system. How can you then turn around and say it is unlikely?

   "\n I don't expect Behe to make bold statements as a scientist he is trained to tread carefully and make sure his words are no stronger than his evidence.\n\n He has no evidence. Behe actually believed that ha had something with this concept of IC. He probably did not expect to be so easily proven wrong. Notice that the entire scientific community has sided against him only excluding those with a religious agenda. Check up on that if you must.\n \n \n \"[A] single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function and some unnecessary parts, wherein the removal of any one of the necessary parts causes the system to effectively cease function.\"\n \n Uh, you think that removing a necessary part as opposed to an unnecessary one makes your case stronger.

So the implications are zero.\n \n \nThe second quote from Behe is succinct and clear, if you do not understand his explanation it is not surprising that I have been unable to teach you what it means.\n \n\n \n I know what it means. The fact is, like mentioned earlier, you don't know by what means evolution has lead to such a system you claim is IC. We don't know what functions the systems could have once performed. The fact is, if you did have a complicated system that came to function as a flagellum, it would surely have to be simplified. What you seem to miss is that the flagellum has been evolving as long as almost any mechanically functioning system on the planet. Evolution would predict that it would by now be in its simplest possible form to conserve energy. However, evolution also predicts that the system would have passed through a more complicated stage to get there. \n \n \n \n \n\n I.e. if we are talking about a flagellum, a secretary system is a non-functional flagellum.\n \n \n Flagellum\n \n\n \n Why do you continue to ignore the fact that a system changes function. Behe never meant for his definition of IC to allow the removal of a piece to allow for a different function. If he did, he would have said, \"removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease said function.\"\n \n \nI meant that last statement, if you are still referring to the experiment with lactose which miller did not conduct you need to review the facts, a protein did not spontaneously form it did not even spontaneously gain function.\n \n More importantly I never claimed a single mutation can't cause a protein to form.\n\n It doesn't even take DNA to create a protein. You act like a protein is some magical molecule whose very existence shouts creation.\n \n \nDo you realize that if we found a human who had mutated with the ability to move metal with their mind, you would still need to prove it was selection pressure that caused it to validate evolution?\n \n\n If we found a human who had the ability to do that, I would believe in God and in your mind \"shape up.\" Although I would still believe the Bible was nothing but mythology. This is an irrelevant hypothetical suggestion.\n \n\n Its three base pairs to an amino acid, I really hope you aren't going to try to confuse concepts here.\n\n Uh, ok\n \n\n For instance why talk about the protein without the genes, of course I am talking about the genes, if we weren't talking about DNA then evolution would be impossible.\n\n If you had read the links I posted earlier you would have seen that proteins don't necessarily require genes.\n \n \nHave you taken statistics? A linear non-locking sequence of 60 Boolean values..... \n\n These are not Boolean values. There are 4 possible values, 2 possible base pairs which can each be reversed, otherwise this would be binary. It isn't. This of course increases your following (incorrect) assumption dramatically. \n \n \n \n\n linear means that the protein would have to be in a certain sequence, non-locking is the IC, it means that if there was a mutation that coded for half of the protein it would not be selected for because the protein is not functioning, boolean is the nature of DNA, it can have two values per base link.\n \n The chances of it forming without natural selection are 1 in 1,152,921,504,606,846,975\n \n Want me to repeat that?\n \n 8.6736173798840354795827862522222e-19% that it will form in a single mutation or in a series of unguided mutations\n \n Notice something about that number? There are more seconds in the history of the earth than this. If a mutation occurred every single second for the last 4 billion years the chances would still not be 1 to 1.\n\n \n This is a common fallacy of computing odds. It is exactly the same as when whoever said the odds of the human genome arising by chance are the same as a 747 being formed from a tornado in a junkyard. You forget that any protein of any size qualifies. Not just the one I used as an example. \n \n \nSufficiently staggered? Still believe you don't need natural selection?\n\n You have only convinced of your personal need to find reason to refute what the evidence suggests. \n \n \nYet I will not allow you to evade the point I have been making which is that 60base pairs would not be selected for linearly, meaning that this protein if it formed spontaneously would not have evolved by Darwinian process.\n\n \n See comment below. Since single amino acids do serve functions, here is your linear process. This suggests that even peptides as small as two or three could serve a function and mutations compounding this could easily be seen to lead to more and more complicated proteins until you get to our current pallet of functional proteins. \n \n \n \nWhat function can a single amino acid do? and can it be a flagellum?\n\n I guess you needed the flagellum comment since you really weren't sure if single amino acids had functions. Your fear is confirmed.\n Amino acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nTo move a cell through water, flagellum.\n you could make the flagellum shorter. You could simply the motion of the flagellum to a wiggle instead of a spin. You could do a lot of things to it and it would still function. Ken Miller even remover 40 parts and the result was an exact replica of another structure present in the same bacterium in question.\n \n \nTo digest lactose, the hydrolyzing enzyme\n\n \n We have shown this function to evolve in a laboratory. Why do you insist on denying this?\n \n\n To perform functions in compartments, internal cell membranes\n\n Why is this IC? I contend that at some point cells could have malfunctioned halfway through meiosis resulting in a bunch of static Siamese twins until one mutation allowed a second meiosis while still in this state which resulted in more of the twins. The structure was then streamlined through subsequent mutations into one structure with an internal membrane instead of two distinct cells. \n \n The point is not that I came up with a hypothetical explanation, but that you have no idea what the possibilities are. This is an argument from ignorance in every case.\n \n \nTo metabolize with the help of oxygen, the electron transport chain\nEasy, oxygen was present for a long time. Cells were probably already well formed before aerobic metabolism was even possible given the conditions of the early atmosphere. The electron transport chain can easily be seen to have had simpler predecessors. This can be seen in the many different mechanisms different cells have evolved to perform the same task under different conditions.\n \n \n \n\n  Originally Posted by Databed:\n This claim can be refuted, along with your entire basis of IC in general, with the simple fact that functions can change with only a slight mutation.\n B=C +- iota, where iota is very small\n \n Why?\n\n You already admitted that even a small inkling of a benefit could be selected for. Why can't that small inkling of a benefit for the small inkling of a function result in selection for a function. You're contradicting yourself here. \n \n\n It drives sequential small mutations in a direction by locking beneficial code into the structure.\n\n \n You said above a small mutation can result in a change in function. You referred to it as \"- iota\" But afterward, NS isn't allowed to select for this since its not the original function. I see. \n \n \n \nTherefore it only acts on a change in function after it has happened.\n\n Good, Freedom!\n \n \nDatabed:It is like claiming that heads is more likely after 10 heads rolls in a row or a better analogy, tails can't happen since were on a heads trend.\n Freedom:Strawman\n\n \n You can't make some stupid abstract claim and not allow me to put it in perspective. You call my representation of your claims a strawman when you clearly stand on two sides of the line here. On one hand you say mutations can occur-mutations can be selected for-mutations can lead to a change in function. With this we have established that a new function has arisen, but then it is not allowed to continue evolving because...what? \n \n The analogy I used with a coin toss is true. You seem to think that selection can't select the new function because of the previous selections. I don't see strawman at all. If I am misrepresenting you, then please tell me how. Your only way out now is to claim that you didn't mean to say that mutations can lead to change in function, in which case you will look like a fool because I will show you several examples of this happening. \n \n \n \n \n \nYou don't know it but you just doomed me to victory, I will let you decide if that victory is your defeat.\n \n The admission that the theory relies on odds instead of method and that further those odds aren't known destroys it.\n \n That leaves each man in the position to guess at what the odds are himself, that guess is subject to personal ideology. That guess is faith not science.\n \n\n This is no way destroys it, i never claimed that evolution relies only on odds. You made that up in your head. What i said is that you claim the odds are too small without knowing what the odds are and that you claim the necessity for a route that is clearly less likely than the one I claim. You need to see everything form at once and are unable to imagine a process whereby these structures are arrived at by a dynamic system that is ever changing function and efficiency.",

   "He has no evidence.\n\n Ha! you know I have indulged you significantly, tell me what evidence does evolution have that Behe does not? Let's see if you can figure this one out yourself.\n \n \n \nBehe actually believed that ha had something with this concept of IC. He probably did not expect to be so easily proven wrong. Notice that the entire scientific community has sided against him only excluding those with a religious agenda. Check up on that if you must.\n\n I have never, in my entire life, even when I was told I was arrogant and egotistical to be doing it relied on an appeal to people to find the truth.\n \n Behe has not been proven wrong, he does not believe he has been proven wrong either.\n \n Please tell me I don't have to go through the long list of men who stood alone against all other academia of their times and we know now they are right?\n \n A recent example is the man made climate change hoax which had the backing of almost the entire scientific community until it was debunked.\n \n \nUh, you think that removing a necessary part as opposed to an unnecessary one makes your case stronger.\n\n If you understood what I was saying you wouldn't have written that.\n \n That's like saying, if you remove a vital organ you will die. Well, no duh!\n\n Yes\n \n \nThis whole concept is just silly. Allowing an IC system to evolve but then saying that it can't change function is just dumb. Are you even going as far as to say that a piece of the original IC system cannot change? \n\n I do not understand your question, I ask you to stop insulting what you don't understand.\n \n \nWhere in evolutionary theory is this even close to implied? \n\n Well by defintion if natural selection and mutation are evolving a systems functionality the enhancements must not be necessary at the time. Therefore for the same reason you can't evolve an IC system you can't add necessary components directly by evolution.\n \n Therefore any increasing complexity after initial function is HIC, because you could cut it down to the initial functionality. That is of course assuming that some pieces are not lost changing the system to IC again.\n \n \nIm not accepting HIC or IC. So the implications are zero.\n\n Have fun with that willful ignorance.\n \n \n\n I know what it means. The fact is, like mentioned earlier, you don't know by what means evolution has lead to such a system you claim is IC.\n \n You don't know either, I have shown that under current theory there is no means for evolution to form an IC system.\n \n \nWe don't know what functions the systems could have once performed.\n\n Is this another appeal to ignorance? Since we don't know what life once looked like we can't apply thought experiments to conclude something about them?\n \n \nThe fact is, if you did have a complicated system that came to function as a flagellum, it would surely have to be simplified.\n\n What?\n \nWhat you seem to miss is that the flagellum has been evolving as long as almost any mechanically functioning system on the planet. Evolution would predict that it would by now be in its simplest possible form to conserve energy. However, evolution also predicts that the system would have passed through a more complicated stage to get there. \n\n Designating an imaginary precursor to a flagellum does not change it's IC and previously HIC nature.\n \n \nWhy do you continue to ignore the fact that a system changes function. \n\n Why do you continue to ignore the fact that if this did happen it would not be because of the evolutionary mechanism.\n \n \nBehe never meant for his definition of IC to allow the removal of a piece to allow for a different function. If he did, he would have said, \"removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease said function.\"\n\n I won't argue Behe's intentions with you, that is what I mean.\n \nIt doesn't even take DNA to create a protein. You act like a protein is some magical molecule whose very existence shouts creation.\n\n Don't play word games, nucleic acid is necessary to synthesize a protein. If a protein is assembled without it, it was assembled by random interaction or proteins that were.\n \n \nIf we found a human who had the ability to do that, I would believe in God and in your mind \"shape up.\" Although I would still believe the Bible was nothing but mythology. This is an irrelevant \n hypothetical suggestion.\n\n Red herring\n You reached it, there is a certain point where I stop humoring a opponent who I can no longer honestly perceive as arguing in good faith.\n \n I will now identify fallacies as I see them and ask you to refer to previous posts of mine if the rebuttal is contained within.\n \n Further I will insist you answer questions as you have insisted I answer yours. No longer will this debate be whipped around the topic every time a specific subject starts to endanger your dogma.\n \n \nIf you had read the links I posted earlier you would have seen that proteins don't necessarily require genes.\n\n Factual but irrelevant, purposeful use of the word protein in two senses, the biological functioning protein and any given peptide set.\n \n \n \nThese are not Boolean values. There are 4 possible values, 2 possible base pairs which can each be reversed, otherwise this would be binary. It isn't. This of course increases your following (incorrect) assumption dramatically. \n\n It is boolean values review biology.\n \n \nThis is a common fallacy of computing odds. It is exactly the same as when whoever said the odds of the human genome arising by chance are the same as a 747 being formed from a tornado in a junkyard. You forget that any protein of any size qualifies. Not just the one I used as an example. \n\n What fallacy is that?\n \n \nYou have only convinced of your personal need to find reason to refute what the evidence suggests. \n\n Hypocrisy\n \n \nSee comment below. Since single amino acids do serve functions, here is your linear process. This suggests that even peptides as small as two or three could serve a function and mutations compounding this could easily be seen to lead to more and more complicated proteins until you get to our current pallet of functional proteins. \n\n Incorrect, review\n \n \nI guess you needed the flagellum comment since you really weren't sure if single amino acids had functions. Your fear is confirmed.\n Amino acid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n I am sure, a single amino acid has no function in biology except to form other compounds and proteins.\n \n \nyou could make the flagellum shorter. You could simply the motion of the flagellum to a wiggle instead of a spin. You could do a lot of things to it and it would still function. Ken Miller even remover 40 parts and the result was an exact replica of another structure present in the same bacterium in question.\n\n Ken miller did not do this, he imagined doing it.\n \n The secretory system does not move a cell.\n \n \nWe have shown this function to evolve in a laboratory. Why do you insist on denying this?\n\n Because you have not shown this function to evolve in a laboratory.\n \nWhy is this IC?

I will not waste my time again. If you intend on saying something now like \"That's because you don't have anything\" consider it already laughed at.\n \n \nThe point is not that I came up with a hypothetical explanation, but that you have no idea what the possibilities are.

And we are justified in assuming such a large pool precisely because the precursor genes were functional, thus helpful, and consequently likely to be plentiful in the population. Is that an accurate representation of your position?\n\n Well I think the \"large pool\" is unnecessary addition but yes this is my position. I don't believe anything but a single function is required for its own optimization.\n \n To spare us the review of evolutionary theory in full the fact is that small mutations which move the system towards a more functional status would be locked, causing that movement to be guided.\n \n \nWhen you go on to consider the emergence of the first gene or system with non-zero 'X functionality', however, you make a considerable error: you operate on the principle that there is no reason to expect immediate mutational precursors of that 'first functional' gene or system to be plentiful.\n\n Simply put this is the scaffolding argument if I read it correctly.\n \n The argument states in brief that for any IC system which is identified there was a system previous to it with a different function similar enough so that only a small mutation would accomplish the initial function of the novel system.\n \n That is scaffolding system = novel system +- probable mutation, A = B (if you have read the thread \"there is no evidence for evolution)\n \n So yes, I don't see a reason to expect this situation to be plentiful, in fact I think the only reason this would be the case is predetermined evolutionary pathways.\n \n There is no reason given in evolutionary theory as to why this would happen, it does not fit with the theme of chaos filtered.\n \n I don't think databed would like to accept that possibility.\n \n Unlike guided mutations, change in function is something that evolution relies on without proposed mechanism to cause it.\n \n NS + RM = Guided mutation\n \n NS + RM != Guided selection\n \n Why attribute 'intelligence' to evolution and give it the ability to select mutations that move towards enhanced systems that are the only slightly different from future systems when we know it only selects mutations based on immediate benefit?\n \n \nThis is where the problem lies. Freedom claims that the 'first functional' gene or system can't have arisen in the first place because the possible precursors are not similar enough to the new system.\n\n No I claim that evolution gives no reason as to why possible precursors would be similar enough to the new system.\n \n \nTherefore, he contends, it would take a far leap to get the new system.\n\n As you can see from your proposed 20 peptide protein, the actual gap for the difference between new and old system is staggeringly small.\n \n \nOn the other hand, he has admitted that a slight mutation can cause a new function to emerge to replace an old function.\n\n I have not. Strawman\n \n \nwhere in context he was referring to -iota being a very small new function arising. When I bring it up he cries strawman and that's the end of it.

The component which hydrolizyes lactose normally was removed but there was a protien that did that already which was no wiped out. Therefore the selection pressure was for a functioning system (excluding the part where it would not have had selection pressure if not for the artificial intake of lactose).\n \n An example of biological redundancy is not an example of IC evolving.\n \n Now don't take this example wrong there aren't really any examples of IC on a macroscopic anatomy level but this is the equivalent of cutting off a insects leg, yes you removed a part but you didn't remove the ability to walk.

   "That's probably why so many molecular biologist are unhappy with calling evolution as it stands fact.\n\n You're equivocating somewhat here. Certainly there are some proposed evolutionary mechanisms (hypotheses or theories) molecular biologists would not describe as established 'fact', but it's hardly true that 'so many' molecular biologists are unhappy with describing common ancestry (the fact of evolution) as such.\n \nThat is conjecture.\n\n No, I'm afraid it's not. Observed instances of genetic co-option and the evolution of novel functionality are well documented.\n \nBehe only attacks these problems from one angle: he's only looking for odds that might prohibit an evolutionary history and so tends to overlook odds that favour it.\n \n Chaos is a problem for order, chaos cannot favour order.\n\n Actually chaos can; you're thinking of randomness, which is not the same thing at all. Regardless, I don't see what relevance that has to this specific point - can you elaborate?\n \n Behe (and Dembski) make several mistakes when they calculate odds of spontaneous formation. For instance, they multiply in the number of possible relative orientations and positions of a system's parts - except that the parts of biological systems chemically and deterministically self-organise every time they are produced. They're not like the inert components of a macro-scale mechanism: shake up a box full of cogs and you won't get a wrist-watch, but being 'shaken up in a bag' is essentially how microscopic biological mechanisms are assembled.\n \n But even errors like that are overshadowed by a more fundamental flaw. In order to 'detect design' the odds against spontaneous formation must exceed the universal probability bound, right? Problem: those odds are rendered insignificant by the much greater chance that an error has been made when calculating them. In other words, the only 'odds' that matter are the odds that Behe has correctly identified an IC system. The significance of this has been demonstrated time and again, when systems Behe has claimed to be IC have turned out not to be.\n \nI believe you just said \"If we can find genes which are similar enough to a flagellum to make it probable they mutated into a flagellum\" then that would show Behe is wrong.\n\n Sorry; is that a question, a statement, an answer...? I must not be firing on all cylinders today.\n \nNotice one of the points and perhaps the central one is that there is no evolutionary reason to expect earlier systems to be \"scaffolding\" for novel systems.\n\n You're absolutely right: a system cannot be naturally selected on the grounds that it might later form scaffolding for some novel system. It can only be naturally selected according to its immediate benefit. If it does happen to serve as scaffolding for a later, novel system, that can only be coincidence - although as I mentioned there will be a favourable bias toward co-option if (as seems to be the case) there is a clustering of 'useful' genes in permutation space rather than a uniform distribution.\n \n However, that's not the central point. This is: absent evolution, there is no reason to expect later systems to have earlier 'scaffolding' system precursors.\n \nThis is the same a presenting the fossil record as proof of evolution, that a theory predicts something and we observe that thing does not prove the theory, in fact it cannot even support the theory if the theory has no explanation of it.\n\n The significance of the fossil record is that it exhibits a clear pattern. Evolution predicts that pattern, while competing hypotheses predict no such pattern and are thus falsified.\n \nSo primarily you would be shifting the unexplained from novel function to the \"coincidence\" of \"scaffold\" functions.\n\n You're thinking of structures like the flagellum as ultimate goals. Try not to. If you begin by asking \"How did evolution produce the flagellum?\" you oblige yourself to interpret chance events along the way as suspicious coincidences. Ask instead \"Why is the flagellum what evolution produced?\" and those 'coincidences' evaporate: what we see is what could evolve, and that's not determined by chance.\n \nSecondarily Behe concentrates specifically on systems whose parts are interconnected and necessary.\n\n Certainly he thinks he's doing that, and every time it turns out he is wrong.\n \nSo it would not be sufficient to identify homologies for each component of an IC system one would have to find a monologue for the entire thing, as multiple mutations in separate genes to form a new function are improbable.\n\n The existence of homologies is in itself highly statistically significant (a pattern where 'no evolution' would predict 'no pattern'). But you are still missing the point: the 'interconnected and necessary' components of the flagellum are only all necessary for it to be a flagellum. It's possible to strip away those components a gene at a time, retaining function (albeit different function) at every stage.\n \n \nSo for a flagellum you are assuming\n ...\n The precursor systems all mutated at the same time to form a flagellum (by pure chance)\n\n No. There were a series of precursor systems, not a pool of them.\n \n \nOr a single precursor to a flagellum was similar enough to cause only a slight genetic movement to be sufficient - Why?\n\n Again, it's not an assumption. Analysis of the genes involved demonstrates this.\n \n \nFor instance if there was a function of moving particles across the membrane and a system did it by opening a shutter the natural selection for that system would be towards a perfect shutter, not say a pump.\n\n No, the natural selection for that system would be towards whatever helps reproduction in any way.\n \nIn other words if you are building a door you can't select for both a sliding door and a hinged door at the same time as a mixture of approaches destroys the functionality.\n\n A single example does not a principle make.\n \nI now brush it aside again because it is not relevant to the question of guided movement.\n\n Again, without justification you imply guided movement must have been the ultimate goal of the process that produced it. In doing so, you 'build in' the odds you then try to use to disprove an evolutionary history. \n \nIf you are not talking about guided movement you must detail evolutions explanation.\n\n But that's the point: talking about IC in terms of specific function is meaningless. What matters is whether the system helps, not how.\n \nI want to argue we don't know how or why the flagellum evolved,\n\n Because a series of functional precursor systems, each valuable to the organism in different ways, made it accessible to evolutionary development, and the numbers of trials conducted by bacteria elevated the possibility of each step to virtual inevitability. What more do you want?\n \nIf you don't know why something happened it is not a scientific theory it is an observation.\n\n Depends upon the kind of 'why' we're talking about. In terms of 'why this as opposed to something else', evolutionary theory explains the flagellum very well.\n \nIt is not gaps in the record that are being identified but gaps in the theory. Occurrences that are claimed to be part of the theory but not explained by the theory.\n\n The same holds true for quantum mechanics, which makes only statistical, not deterministic predictions.\n \nA=B does not apply to the fossil record, it does here.\n\n Sorry; can I ask you to unpack that statement for me?\n \nAlright, let's use scaffolding as it is used commonly, as internal to a functional system.\n \n What do you wish to call so called precursor systems?\n\n That sounds fine to me.\n \nWhat I expect is irrelevant, evolution can explain guided genetic movement how can it explain this?\n\n Sorry again; when you say 'guided genetic movement' are we still talking about the flagellum's swimming action, or what?\n \nthe useful components of genetic systems serving different functions to be widely seperated in permutation space. The flagellum - amongst many other examples - is powerful evidence to the contrary: the number of identifiable homologous genes and the proximity of intermediate functional systems are far in excess of what your fundamental assumption would lead you to expect.\n \n Why?\n\n You've expressed disbelief that co-option can be responsible for the evolution of systems like the flagellum. This equates to a claim that the genes of differently functional systems are not clustered in permutation-space, but are distributed uniformly (this being necessary to exclude co-option). The flagellum is empirical evidence to the contrary: it reeks of co-option and shares many genes homologous with those of other systems.\n \n \nI truly expected that admission to come after many posts, I have been arguing with databed to much. You are obviously not afraid of the conclusions :)\n \n So I believe we are at the same place, which is that without modifying TOE one must take these as premises:\n \n there exists a tree of \"co-option\" similarity leading from the simplest function to our current biology.\n\n Roughly speaking, yes. Don't read too much into that though; there are undoubtedly systems and organisms which would work but cannot evolve because they are too isolated. What we see is merely what can (and given the chance inevitably will) evolve.\n \nThat A=B is not a prediction of the theory but must be a state of reality and consequence of carbon based life and not to be explained but accepted as Darwin accepted that life existed even though he hadn't a clue as to how it functioned except on the macroscopic level.\n\n Still not sure what you're talking about here.\n \nFurther that guided mutation and natural selection are not the only means of evolution but also luck.\n\n What is 'guided' mutation, as you put it?\n \n Also, speaking of luck... it is luck when you win the lottery. It is not luck when someone wins the lottery. Evolution does not proceed by low-probability events, but by events that are all but inevitable. That is why it counts as an explanation for what we see.",

   "No, the ability to hydrolyze lactose did not emerge. The ability to induce import of lactose never happened.\n\n \n \n I guess you are referring the the necessity of IPTG in the studies. IPTG is described here:\n \n \nAt this point it is important to discuss the use of IPTG in these studies. Unless otherwise indicated, IPTG is always included in media containing lactose or other B-galactoside sugars. The sole function of the IPTG is to induce synthesis of the lactose permease, and thus to deliver lactose to the inside of the cell. Neither the constitutive nor the inducible evolved strains grew on lactose in the absence of IPTG. (Hall 1982b)\n\n \n But notice what Behe breezes over near the end - \n \n \nWith further growth and selection, Hall isolated secondary mutants with improved B-galactosidase activity. These mutants all had the same two changes (mentioned above) at positions 92 and 977 of ebg B-galactosidase. Hall discovered that, in addition to hydrolyzing lactose, the double mutants could also synthesize some allolactose, just as the homologous lac B-galactosidase can do, allowing them to induce expression of the lac operon without further need of IPTG. \n\n \n He goes on to discredit this like so - \n \n \nCritically again, however, the lac permease induced by the action of the double mutant ebg is a pre-existing protein, part of the original lac operon, and was not produced in the experiment by the selection procedures. In the absence of that required component, the bacteria cannot use lactose.\n\n \n I don't know why he is claiming that selection did not produce the second generation bacteria that did not need the IPTG, but whatever the case, bacteria found a way to survive after the crippling genetic alteration and it required a double mutation where neither were useful without the other. The fact that IPTG was ever administered is irrelevant as this by no means guided mutations in such a way as to lead to the new B-galactosidase function or the subsequent emergence of the ability to survive without the IPTG. This was simply a way to make the experiment possible thus proving the point that functions can evolve given selection pressure and mutation.",

Certainly there are some proposed evolutionary mechanisms (hypotheses or theories) molecular biologists would not describe as established 'fact', but it's hardly true that 'so many' molecular biologists are unhappy with describing common ancestry (the fact of evolution) as such.\n\n It does not matter; the winner of this sub-debate would have at best an appeal to authority. (Not to cede the point)\n \n \nNo, I'm afraid it's not. Observed instances of genetic co-option and the evolution of novel functionality are well documented.\n\n Of the former I have exposed it, of the later post a link.\n \n \nActually chaos can; you're thinking of randomness, which is not the same thing at all. \n\n a state of utter confusion or disorder; a total lack of organization or order. \n \n Disorder and order are antonyms. The statement \"chaos can favor order\" is a contradiction.\n \n \nRegardless, I don't see what relevance that has to this specific point - can you elaborate?\n\n The only odds that favor evolution are entirely contained in the only odds that favor order, natural selection.\n \n Behe concentrates on natural selection; it is intellectual suicide to assert that there is a force that is causing life to evolve except natural selection while maintaining the theory as it is stated.\n \n For instance Behe and I completely ignore the possibility that a novel function could form by chance without natural selection.\n \n Yet that chance exists, just as there exists a chance that the statue of liberty could form by erosion.\n \n We are both concerned only by the scientific explanation of an observation of function and a stone statue of liberty, what laws caused it? By what process was it formed?\n \n I am not concerned with an appeal to chance, an appeal to chance has no place is scientific theory and especially in a theory which deals with unobservable time scales.\n \n In conclusion if it is not caused by natural selection, I say it is not evolution and that anyone who thinks current evolutionary theory predicts it is doing dishonor to Darwin and rationality.\n \n \nBehe (and Dembski) make several mistakes when they calculate odds of spontaneous formation. For instance, they multiply in the number of possible relative orientations and positions of a system's parts - except that the parts of biological systems chemically and deterministically self-organise every time they are produced. They're not like the inert components of a macro-scale mechanism: shake up a box full of cogs and you won't get a wrist-watch, but being 'shaken up in a bag' is essentially how microscopic biological mechanisms are assembled.\n\n I do not know, you may be right.\n \n \nBut even errors like that are overshadowed by a more fundamental flaw. In order to 'detect design' the odds against spontaneous formation must exceed the universal probability bound, right?\n\n If one wanted to disprove evolution this would be a good way to do it.\n \nProblem: those odds are rendered insignificant by the much greater chance that an error has been made when calculating them. In other words, the only 'odds' that matter are the odds that Behe has correctly identified an IC system.\n\n That would hold true for all probability calculations of this nature. You basically said that nothing can be below UPB because the odds of making a mistake in its calculation are above UPB.\n \n So is there anything you can say is impossible due to unlikeness? What about a laptop forming from space dust?\n \n \nThe significance of this has been demonstrated time and again, when systems Behe has claimed to be IC have turned out not to be.\n\n I can see you are more rational then databed so I hope you will only make me say this once.\n \n None of the systems put forth by Behe have been shown to not be IC, those who are against IC use the term in two different senses. In the sense of the definition, and in the since of Behe's conclusion.\n \n You can note this by the fact that several opponents including ken miller in attempts to attack Behe's theory first establish that their example intended to disprove Behe's point are in fact IC.\n \n Those who do deny the existence of all IC systems commit a fallacy on the most basic level because every system has some parts which cannot be removed.\n \n Last is the strawman in which it is taken that in the definition of IC \"functional\" is taken to mean \"any function\", it means functional as the system functions.\n \n A functional flagellum is not a secretory system, it is a functional secretory system.\n \n Therefore it is both impossible to prove any given function is not HIC/IC and that is was functional before it functioned.\n \n The statement was tautologous and the only attack route on Behe's conclusion not the fact that IC systems exist, which is the one taken; is that evolution can form HIC/IC systems by natural selection and random mutation.\n \n \nSorry; is that a question, a statement, an answer...? I must not be firing on all cylinders today.\n\n I was stating an assumption about your position, it was meant to disclaim the following statements if it was untrue.\n \n \nYou're absolutely right: a system cannot be naturally selected on the grounds that it might later form scaffolding for some novel system.\n\n emoticon_xbouncer Wait, that is the way I have been using the term scaffolding! I thought it was co-option now?\n \n \nIt can only be naturally selected according to its immediate benefit. If it does happen to serve as scaffolding for a later, novel system, that can only be coincidence \n\n Yes\n \nalthough as I mentioned there will be a favourable bias toward co-option if (as seems to be the case) there is a clustering of 'useful' genes in permutation space rather than a uniform distribution.\n\n That appearance is due to the fact that all biology is using similar building blocks (amino acids, lipids, ect.)\n \n It is clear that current complexity is not just the result of using the same forms, the common chemical basis of life is not a reason to expect this tree of co-option.\n \n \nHowever, that's not the central point. This is: absent evolution, there is no reason to expect later systems to have earlier 'scaffolding' system precursors.\n\n Actually absent common descent that is what one would expect.\n \n Evolution (the explanation of common descent) is not inseparably packaged with the observation of common descent.\n \n I have previously been pleased with the identification of the false dichotomy involved with stating that failure to accept evolution as it is stated as fact and full explanation equals asserting life formed and advanced spontaneously.\n \n Yet you use it here to assert that I MUST believe in evolution as it is presented to me or else I MUST believe in magic.\n \n I reject both.\n \n \nThe significance of the fossil record is that it exhibits a clear pattern. Evolution predicts that pattern, while competing hypotheses predict no such pattern and are thus falsified.\n\n I have not proposed a competing hypothesis.\n \n In science failure to predict observed phenomenon is as bad, nay worse than predicting some phenomenon.\n \n For example if one had the theory that states things fly because they are made by human beings, they would predict that planes fly. A prediction that matches reality!\n \n Yet birds fly as well, this falsifies the theory because it does not predict observed phenomenon.\n \n Evolution predicts common descent, common descent is observed. Evolution does not predict novel function, novel function is observed.\n \n \nYou're thinking of structures like the flagellum as ultimate goals.\n\n I am thinking of structures like the flaggelum as structures that could by definition not be ultimate goals, and have already tried to reconcile that with evolution.\n \n \nTry not to. If you begin by asking \"How did evolution produce the flagellum?\" you oblige yourself to interpret chance events along the way as suspicious coincidences. Ask instead \"Why is the flagellum what evolution produced?\" \n\n Well there's your problem (humorous drawl), if you are committing a begging the question fallacy in your thought process of course you are going to be unable to challenge evolutions soundness.\n \n \nand those 'coincidences' evaporate: what we see is what could evolve, and that's not determined by chance.\n\n I think not, after assuming that the order and form of life already exists from the start it is most certainly dishonest to then claim the advancement of life is explained.\n \n It reminds me of the answer \"where did God come from\", \"He always existed\"\n \n \"How did life advance\" \"The co-option tree always existed\"\n \n No, this co-option tree remains a premise not a prediction of evolution, un-explained coincidences which have existence but for no reason we yet know.\n \n You want to show me that evolution as its stated can advance life? You are going to have to do it by its only mechanism: random mutation and natural selection calling on no higher order or lucky breaks.\n \n It has been said these are not the only methods of evolution, I challenge you or databed to produce others.\n \n A method is not a chance, a chance that A=B or a chance that novel function springs forth without selection.\n \n NS + RM is not a chance it's a method.\n \n \nThe existence of homologies is in itself highly statistically significant (a pattern where 'no evolution' would predict 'no pattern'). But you are still missing the point: the 'interconnected and necessary' components of the flagellum are only all necessary for it to be a flagellum. It's possible to strip away those components a gene at a time, retaining function (albeit different function) at every stage.\n\n I can assure you that if you had all the proteins required for a flagellum being produced by the cell, you would have a flagellum. Do not forget control and assembly systems.\n \n \nNo. There were a series of precursor systems, not a pool of them.\n\n If they did not all exist within the cell before the flagellum forming mutation you cannot even claim the missing ones are relevant to the mutation or formation of the flagellum.\n \n \nAgain, it's not an assumption. Analysis of the genes involved demonstrates this.\n\n Common descent is not an assumption it is a fact.\n \n Why couldn't xvolution be the cause of common descent?\n \n \nNo, the natural selection for that system would be towards whatever helps reproduction in any way.\n\n And a non-functional system does not help reproduction in any way.\n \n A perfectly functioning system would help reproduction.\n \n \nA single example does not a principle make.\n\n A principle explains examples. The IC systems put forth by Behe, the examples I have imagined, the examples put forth by ken miller. They are all examples of the principle which was established by the logic of IC. The concept of IC and its consequences was not established specifically by their presence.\n \n If one considers TOE it is a principle deduced from multiple examples but most importantly logic.\n \n You would (and rightly so) call it a fallacy for someone to point that since you did not see a leg evolve it could not happen.\n \n Little good does the theory of gravitation do one if you must prove every mass is subject to it before accepting it.\n \n Little good does the theory of evolution do one if you must prove every system evolved.\n \n Little good does the challenge of IC do one if every system must be proven to be IC.\n \n However unlike the first two it can be stated that the last can be proven by tautology. Every system consists of components; if there is one component that cannot be removed it is HIC or IC. If there exists a functional system which can have all its components removed while maintaining function it would not be IC or HIC.\n \n \n \nAgain, without justification you imply guided movement must have been the ultimate goal of the process that produced it.\n\n I imply with self definitive justification that a process of guided movement must be guided movement.\n \n \nIn doing so, you 'build in' the odds you then try to use to disprove an evolutionary history. \n\n I cannot disprove evolution.\n \n \nBut that's the point: talking about IC in terms of specific function is meaningless. What matters is whether the system helps, not how.\n\n It does matter because the intermediate stages are the genetic movement I speak of.\n \n If it is claimed changes in the way a system helps an organism are produced by the mechanism of evolution, then the at every step of the process the changed system must be more beneficial than the unchanged system.\n \n If the change causes a novel function then it can be safely said that the benefit of the novel system did not exist before that change and therefore that movement towards that change was not guided.\n \n The only fallacy that circumvents this logic is that the same mutations which form novel function also benefit the organism at the same time in a different way.\n \n A = B, why?\n \n \nBecause a series of functional precursor systems, each valuable to the organism in different ways, made it accessible to evolutionary development, and the numbers of trials conducted by bacteria elevated the possibility of each step to virtual inevitability. What more do you want?\n\n An explanation, a theory that predicts this. (A = B)\n \n \nDepends upon the kind of 'why' we're talking about. In terms of 'why this as opposed to something else', evolutionary theory explains the flagellum very well.\n\n I am not talking about why as opposed to something else, evolution doesn't have the answer to the initial why. If you take yourself as a proponent of evolution then evolution simply shifts the why to a second level.\n \n Would you consider the definition of evolution: \"The theory that explains the advancement of life from simple single cells to today's diversity if a tree of co-option exists\"\n \n \nThe same holds true for quantum mechanics, which makes only statistical, not deterministic predictions.\n\n I don't believe quantum mechanics is proper science either.\n \nSorry; can I ask you to unpack that statement for me?\n\n A functional precursor to the wing can exist and cause selection towards better aero-dynamic shape (flying squirrel).\n \n A (gliding from tree to tree) ends in B (flying without height)\n \n A (secreting toxins) does not end in B (swimming)\n \n Because it is the shape and size of anatomical features that may determine it's function it is very rare (and I can think of no examples) of IC systems on that level.\n \n It is not a wing that is novel, but a bone and a mussel.\n \n Not a lung, but aerobic metabolism.\n \n \nThat sounds fine to me.\n\n I will continue to call it co-option then.\n \n \nSorry again; when you say 'guided genetic movement' are we still talking about the flagellum's swimming action, or what?\n\n We are talking about guided genetic movement. You have tried to saddle my position with attributing intent or goal to evolution. That is precisely what I have stopped doing.\n \n When I say there is guided genetic movement, I say there is guided genetic movement in the direction that will benefit the organism. A more efficient, more perfect functioning system will likely benefit the organism greater with every improving mutation. A novel function which does not exist until it functions does not benefit the organism till it is formed.\n \n Not only does one need to attribute intent or goal to evolution to claim there is guided genetic movement towards novel function that does not exist, but one may even need to assign \"design\" by \"evolution\" to select for non-existent systems to serve as \"scaffolding\" co-option precursors to more non-existent systems.\n \n So yes, I say there is no guided genetic movement towards a swimming flagellum until it swims.\n \n I will not forget my point nor be distracted by the irrelevance of coinciding selection.\n \n Yes you can claim that selection for other functions could select at the same time for a flagellum by luck, but I can claim that the entire system could be formed in one mutation by luck.\n \n Search this thread for xvolution.\n \n \n \nYou've expressed disbelief that co-option can be responsible for the evolution of systems like the flagellum. This equates to a claim that the genes of differently functional systems are not clustered in permutation-space, but are distributed uniformly (this being necessary to exclude co-option). The flagellum is empirical evidence to the contrary: it reeks of co-option and shares many genes homologous with those of other systems.\n\n I have expressed certain belief that co-option if it exists in the way evolution requires it to is unbelievable coincidence and not a product of the evolutionary mechanism.\n \n \nRoughly speaking, yes. Don't read too much into that though; there are undoubtedly systems and organisms which would work but cannot evolve because they are too isolated. What we see is merely what can (and given the chance inevitably will) evolve.\n\n I read into it exactly what it means, that evolution rests on unexplained phenomenon. Which proves that it is at best an incomplete theory and at worse that it is bad science. (refer to the bird plane example)\n \n You may wonder if I have a problem with evolution as merely defined as natural selection with random mutation, with no conclusions about advancement or the origin of species, I do not.\n \n \nStill not sure what you're talking about here.\n\n Darwin took it for granted that life worked, he did not concern himself with how a cell functions.\n \n You take it for granted that evolution works, you do not concern yourself with how a co-option tree exists.\n \n \nWhat is 'guided' mutation, as you put it?\n\n The locking of genetic code towards a certain different code.\n \n Applying natural selection that means the locking of \"AGCTA\" if that change or addition helps the organism.\n \n By locking I mean increasing it's genetic ratio in the species.\n \n As opposed to unguided or non-locking mutation which can and will occur at the exact same rate as guided mutation but will dissolve into chaos when the movement is large where guided mutation will not.\n \n I think an example is in order take these pretend segments of DNA:\n \n System A : ATGGCATGC\n \n System Ai (improved): AAGCCATTC\n \n System B: CCTGAATGC\n \n Let's pretend system A is evolving it mutates by changing the second nucleotide from an T to an A.\n \n AAGGCATGC\n \n Hey look it's closer to System Ai (improved)! On the correct assumption that being closer to improved function could provide benefit to the organism we can say this mutation although it is not Ai yet it is selected for by making the organism with this gene produce more offspring.\n \n Due to inheritance this mutation is spread to the rest of the population.\n \n Now another mutation happens second to last nucleotide changes from G to T.\n \n AAGGCATTC\n \n We have the same situation, it is now closer to the Ai, the second mutation did not have to be AAGGCATTC at the same time only the second mutation. The first was \"locked\" due to its immediate benefit.\n \n This can continue until A = Ai\n \n Now what about evolving to function B?\n \n Let's pick the code up where we left off AAGGCATTC and say that the first base pair mutated to C.\n \n CAGGCATTC\n \n Well, we are now closer to system B, but system B is IC. That means the gene will not be selected for based on what it might become.\n \n this mutation CAGGCATTC does not accomplish the function of system B.\n \n This mutation under ideal circumstances is neutral (as you can see it actually moves it away from Ai (detrimental) in this case but let's just pretend the gene was duplicated and is now free to move in any genetic direction without harming the organism)\n \n CAGGCATTC is not selected for, it's genetic ratio in the species is not changed.\n \n The next mutation that comes around has just as much chance of changing the sequence away from system B as it does towards it. Which is the same as the guided mutation, but the mutations closer to system B is never locked, it is random.\n \n We cannot expect the code to move in any direction based on system B.\n \n We could expect the code of A to move towards Ai because of natural selection and mutation.\n \n When we start expanding the code to encompass the size even one protein that is required to change a systems function, this unguided mutation does not cut it. No this is not my \"incredulity\" this is statistical fact.\n \n Now since I have done all this let me illustrate the co-option tree. What if there was a novel system C which was: AAGCCTTTC\n \n That's only one base pair away from Ai\n \n Assuming Ai is relativly static in the genes you could have very large number of mutations all rejected due to unfitness until the 6th nucleotide changes to T and forms function C.\n \n Ai = C\n \n A = B\n \n Natural selection pushed the genetic code towards system C but not because it was locking mutations for system C.\n \n So natural selection and random mutation formed the novel function C right?\n \n No they formed Ai and random mutation minus natural selection formed function C.\n \n The question is why would Ai = C?\n \n This is obviously necessary if one wants to claim that the evolutionary mechanism caused novel function but it is not sufficient to say \"so that exists and now it works\"\n \n The question is analogous to \"why would A move towards Ai?\"\n \n That question can be answered by TOE, not the former.\n \n If there was a component of evolution that gave explanation for A = B then the theory would be complete and sound.\n \n Notice also that despite how you tried to make it appear that simple clustering in permutation space could explain A = B, it cannot.\n \n Clustering indicates Gene A would be similar to Gene B, not Gene A is homologous to gene B +- difference small enough to validate statistical chance.\n \n Notice also the important factor of static genetics, if the system is changing then one cannot say that Ai = C AND A = C.\n \n Which brings forth the final nail in the coffin for coincidental Co-option, that the novel function is always at the end of optimization.\n \n \nAlso, speaking of luck... it is luck when you win the lottery. It is not luck when someone wins the lottery. Evolution does not proceed by low-probability events, but by events that are all but inevitable. That is why it counts as an explanation for what we see.\n\n Yes if you multiply any odds by infinity you will arrive at certainty.\n \n I do not find that convincing defense. Note Xvolution.\n \n \nI guess you are referring the the necessity of IPTG in the studies. IPTG is described here:\n\n Yes\n \n \n \nBut notice what Behe breezes over near the end - \n\n This fact is known to me.\n \n \nI don't know why he is claiming that selection did not produce the second generation bacteria that did not need the IPTG\n\n Because this is the artificial reproduction of the fallacy of scaffolding. If you force a function and the funciton is replaced by a more efficient version it is not the evolution of novel functionality.\n \n There was selection pressure to control the production of the EGB to the ammount of lactose, there would not have been if there was no lactose and not EGB and not lactic metabolism.\n \n Like what would be the case without the IPTG.\n \nbut whatever the case, bacteria found a way to survive after the crippling genetic alteration and it required a double mutation where neither were useful without the other.\n[*]The first was useful without the second the second was not useful without the first. (Optimization)\n [*]The alteration was not crippling\n \nThe fact that IPTG was ever administered is irrelevant as this by no means guided mutations in such a way as to lead to the new B-galactosidase function or the subsequent emergence of the ability to survive without the IPTG. This was simply a way to make the experiment possible thus proving the point that functions can evolve given selection pressure and mutation.\n\n \n It created selection pressure that did not exist, it is relevant.",

   "It does not matter; the winner of this sub-debate would have at best an appeal to authority. (Not to cede the point)\n\n \n Hey, I didn't bring it up :)\n \n \nOf the former I have exposed it, of the later post a link.\n\n \n You haven't exposed anything. Your objections to the example already presented by Databed are invalid. For the latter, either his example or the classic 'nylon bug' qualify.\n \n \nDisorder and order are antonyms. The statement \"chaos can favor order\" is a contradiction.\n\n \n Sorry; I was speaking of mathematically chaotic systems rather than the layman's term.\n \n \nThe only odds that favor evolution are entirely contained in the only odds that favor order, natural selection.\n\n \n This is not actually true. Raw self-replication skews the odds in favour of evolution by increasing the number of potential trials. In the same way, mass participation in a lottery favours the chances of a winner emerging.\n \n \nBehe concentrates on natural selection; it is intellectual suicide to assert that there is a force that is causing life to evolve except natural selection while maintaining the theory as it is stated.\n\n \n \nFor instance Behe and I completely ignore the possibility that a novel function could form by chance without natural selection.\n\n \n No, only you are doing that. Behe recognises the need to quantify the isolation of a novel function before claiming it cannot have arisen spontaneously. His use of irreducible complexity is such an attempt. It fails because he neglects the possibility that a system whose parts are all necessary for one function may nevertheless be reducible to a simpler system with a different function.\n \n You say that in general one would not expect such proximate intermediate functional systems to exist. You may very well be right - which only makes our ability to find them in specific cases like the flagellum all the more significant.\n \nWe are both concerned only by the scientific explanation of an observation of function and a stone statue of liberty, what laws caused it? By what process was it formed?\n \n I am not concerned with an appeal to chance, an appeal to chance has no place is scientific theory and especially in a theory which deals with unobservable time scales.\n\n On the contrary, quantum mechanics teaches us that pretty much everything we think of as 'lawful' ultimately depends upon chance compounding to statistical near-certainty. Your ability to see, breathe reliably, digest food, not fall through the chair you're sitting on - everything. Self-replication similarly compounds chance to near-certainty; the process is no less lawful.\n \nIn conclusion if it is not caused by natural selection, I say it is not evolution and that anyone who thinks current evolutionary theory predicts it is doing dishonor to Darwin and rationality.\n\n Why is the necessary proximity of co-opted function any more of a problem than the necessary proximity of improved function? Natural selection depends every bit as much on the sequence-space proximity of genes yielding contextually improved function; they must be stochastically attainable for NS to get its teeth into anything. And both kinds of proximity - contextually improved function and co-opted function - have been observed.\n \nThat would hold true for all probability calculations of this nature. You basically said that nothing can be below UPB because the odds of making a mistake in its calculation are above UPB.\n \n So is there anything you can say is impossible due to unlikeness? What about a laptop forming from space dust?\n\n I'm not saying that nothing can be below UPB. I'm simply pointing out that the limiting factor is how certain you can be you're calculating the odds correctly - how certain you can be that 'forming spontaneously with no functional precursors' is the only way a system could arise without intelligent input. It's very difficult to be certain enough to make the UPB odds themselves relevant - as has been demonstrated over and over again.\n \nNone of the systems put forth by Behe have been shown to not be IC, those who are against IC use the term in two different senses. In the sense of the definition, and in the since of Behe's conclusion.\n\n That's false in both senses. On the one hand, the allegedly IC blood clotting cascade was shown to be non-IC whilst still functioning as a blood clotting cascade. On the other, the existence of IC systems with cores that serve other functions are a flaw in Behe's application of the term, not his opponents, because he is trying to use IC to prove that there are no evolutionary 'rest stops' on the way to the 'finished' system.\n \n \nThose who do deny the existence of all IC systems commit a fallacy on the most basic level because every system has some parts which cannot be removed.\n\n Nobody denies the existence of IC systems. What they point out is that 1) 'IC' systems aren't necessarily particularly complex (and are thus attainable in a single step) and 2) ignoring cores with alternative function is a fatal error when calculating the odds of formation.\n \nLast is the strawman in which it is taken that in the definition of IC \"functional\" is taken to mean \"any function\", it means functional as the system functions.\n\n There is no strawman here. For quantified irreducible complexity to have any significance it must apply to 'any function' and not a specific function. This is a very simple, crucial point upon which we must agree before proceeding. \n \n The irreducible complexity argument against an purely evolutionary history for a system goes like this:\n \n 1. Evolution proceeds if the mass replication of systems at step N can overwhelm the odds against step N+1 arising by stochastic modification.\n \n 2. If the system at step N is the simplest functional configuration, then there are no grounds to suppose that mass replication of any step N-1 could have overwhelmed the odds against it appearing.\n \n (strictly speaking we should probably be talking about N-2 or N-3 to cover ourselves against genetic drift, but I'll omit that for the sake of simplicity)\n \n Now, if \"simplest functional configuration\" is taken to mean only \"for that specific function\", pillar 2 of the IC argument collapses, because we are neglecting the possibility that a step N-1 exists with a different function, which could, therefore, be replicated sufficient to overwhelm the odds of step N arising.\n \n \nemoticon_xbouncer Wait, that is the way I have been using the term scaffolding! I thought it was co-option now?\n\n Had we agreed upon that terminology when I wrote that? If so, sorry for the confusion.\n \nThat appearance is due to the fact that all biology is using similar building blocks (amino acids, lipids, ect.)\n\n Oh no, that's not it at all. I'm talking about clustering of functional genes within the sequence space of those building blocks.\n \nIt is clear that current complexity is not just the result of using the same forms, the common chemical basis of life is not a reason to expect this tree of co-option.\n\n Precisely :) Only an evolutionary history is a reason to expect to see co-option, because undoubtedly most potential biological systems would not lie on such a tree.\n \nActually absent common descent that is what one would expect.\n\n Sorry, sloppy wording on my part: Absent a purely evolutionary history is what I mean to say, which equates to what you said :)\n \nI have not proposed a competing hypothesis.\n\n And you think that lets you off the hook? :)\n \nIn science failure to predict observed phenomenon is as bad, nay worse than predicting some phenomenon.\n\n Absolutely. Like Behe's failure to predict the existence of alternatively functional cores to the flagellum.\n \nEvolution predicts common descent, common descent is observed. Evolution does not predict novel function, novel function is observed.\n\n Oh dear me, no. Quite wrong. Evolution predicts what novel function should look like, if it occurs - the same way it predicts what improved function should look like if that occurs: either a modification of an existing functional system or, ultimately, something simple enough to arise spontaneously.\n \n \nI think not, after assuming that the order and form of life already exists from the start it is most certainly dishonest to then claim the advancement of life is explained.\n\n It is explained to the same extent that star and planet formation is explained. Beyond that, there is the fact that almost all iterative systems with simple rules have subsets of starting conditions that exhibit complex behaviour - life is the form that phenomenon takes in this universe but is by no means special.\n \n\"How did life advance\" \"The co-option tree always existed\"\n \n No, this co-option tree remains a premise not a prediction of evolution, un-explained coincidences which have existence but for no reason we yet know.\n\n I understand your dissatisfaction, but bear in mind the following:\n \n 1. There is no bespoke distortion of the laws of physics conjoining each branch of the co-option tree: it is an entirely emergent phenomenon.\n \n 2. It seems certain to me that the vast, vast bulk of potential functional biology lies outwith this co-option tree. When we see nature explore that tree, therefore, we see not strange unexplained coincidences but more statistical inevitabilities: a tree of some kind is bound to exist within that space and will inevitably be explored if its roots are chanced upon.\n \n \nYou want to show me that evolution as its stated can advance life? You are going to have to do it by its only mechanism: random mutation and natural selection calling on no higher order or lucky breaks.\n\n I think I have presented as much here.\n \nA method is not a chance, a chance that A=B or a chance that novel function springs forth without selection.\n\n As I said earlier, many lawful methods ultimately decompose into chance.\n \nNS + RM is not a chance it's a method.\n\n Certainly. And it works regardless of whether what is 'selected' at each step is a proximate improvement to an existing function or a proximate novel function.\n \nI can assure you that if you had all the proteins required for a flagellum being produced by the cell, you would have a flagellum. Do not forget control and assembly systems.\n\n I did not suggest otherwise.\n \nIf they did not all exist within the cell before the flagellum forming mutation you cannot even claim the missing ones are relevant to the mutation or formation of the flagellum.\n\n That, I'm having difficulty parsing; sorry.\n \nCommon descent is not an assumption it is a fact.\n \n Why couldn't xvolution be the cause of common descent?\n\n It would only need to be if evolution were demonstrably insufficient.\n \nAnd a non-functional system does not help reproduction in any way.\n\n Since when have I relied on non-functional systems assisting replication?\n \nA perfectly functioning system would help reproduction.\n\n Careful, now. 'Perfect' is entirely contextual.\n \nLittle good does the theory of gravitation do one if you must prove every mass is subject to it before accepting it.\n \n Little good does the theory of evolution do one if you must prove every system evolved.\n \n Little good does the challenge of IC do one if every system must be proven to be IC.\n\n Nobody is demanding that every system be proven to be IC. They're just pointing out that the examples Behe has chosen invariably prove not to be.\n \nHowever unlike the first two it can be stated that the last can be proven by tautology. Every system consists of components; if there is one component that cannot be removed it is HIC or IC. If there exists a functional system which can have all its components removed while maintaining function it would not be IC or HIC.\n\n Absolutely correct. However, you are not quantifying the isolation of anything with this abstract proof, and that's the ball game.\n \nI imply with self definitive justification that a process of guided movement must be guided movement.\n\n Sorry; you've lost me there. \n \n \nIf it is claimed changes in the way a system helps an organism are produced by the mechanism of evolution, then the at every step of the process the changed system must be more beneficial than the unchanged system.\n \n If the change causes a novel function then it can be safely said that the benefit of the novel system did not exist before that change and therefore that movement towards that change was not guided.\n\n Equally, the movement towards an improvement is not guided, because the benefit of the improvement does not exist before such a change. You have constructed an entirely arbitrary conceptual distinction between something that helps because it's 'better' and something that helps because it's 'novel'. All that matters is that it helps. What pigeonhole we put it into after the fact is irrelevant.\n \nAn explanation, a theory that predicts this. (A = B)\n\n Which is exactly what the TOE does: it (correctly) predicts that novel function will only arise through co-option. It predicts what we will see and what we will not. I ask again: what more do you want?\n \nWould you consider the definition of evolution: \"The theory that explains the advancement of life from simple single cells to today&#8217;s diversity if a tree of co-option exists\"\n\n That's like calling fluid dynamics \"the theory that explains what water will do if a certain system of pipes exists\".\n \nI don't believe quantum mechanics is proper science either.\n\n Mmm. Well, empirical verification to umpteen decimal places says otherwise :)\n \n \nA (secreting toxins) does not end in B (swimming)\n\n Except it clearly can. You only need to look at the flagellum and secretory systems to observe this.\n \nWe are talking about guided genetic movement. You have tried to saddle my position with attributing intent or goal to evolution. That is precisely what I have stopped doing.\n\n I apologise; I think I was just getting confused about whether 'guided movement' meant the flagellum's swimming action, genetic change brought about by design, or what.\n \nWhen I say there is guided genetic movement, I say there is guided genetic movement in the direction that will benefit the organism. A more efficient, more perfect functioning system will likely benefit the organism greater with every improving mutation. A novel function which does not exist until it functions does not benefit the organism till it is formed.\n\n Nor does an improvement to a function, so that cannot be called 'guided' either. The 'guiding' part comes after the improvement occurs: making that variant plentiful so that further steps will be taken from there rather than the previous iteration.\n \nSo yes, I say there is no guided genetic movement towards a swimming flagellum until it swims.\n\n I quite agree. Just as there is no guided genetic movement (in terms of the next step taken) towards a 'better' functional system.\n \n \nYes you can claim that selection for other functions could select at the same time for a flagellum by luck, but I can claim that the entire system could be formed in one mutation by luck.\n\n In terms of achieving proximity sufficient for co-option into the flagellum specifically, if you demand in advance that the flagellum be the end product, yes, that would have to be called luck - as much luck on your part that you happened to pick in advance what was eventually achieved as anything. But in terms of achieving proximity to co-option into some novel function, that's statistical inevitability, not luck.\n \n \nI have expressed certain belief that co-option if it exists in the way evolution requires it to is unbelievable coincidence and not a product of the evolutionary mechanism.\n\n It could only be called 'unbelievable coincidence' if you were to set out in advance what evolution had to achieve via co-option and then watched it achieve it. Coming along after the fact and painting bullseyes around all the bullet holes, as it were, is not the same thing at all.\n \nDarwin took it for granted that life worked, he did not concern himself with how a cell functions.\n \n You take it for granted that evolution works, you do not concern yourself with how a co-option tree exists.\n\n It seems to me all but inevitable that some kind of contiguous co-option space would exist within such a crowded sequence-space.\n \n \nHey look it's closer to System Ai (improved)! On the correct assumption that being closer to improved function could provide benefit to the organism we can say this mutation although it is not Ai yet it is selected for by making the organism with this gene produce more offspring.\n\n Wow, no. I mean, no. :) Being 'closer to' improved function cannot be selected for. Ai is only attainable by RM+NS if the chain of changes A1, A2, A3,... Ai is a relatively unbroken series of contextual improvements. I say 'relatively' because gaps of two or three neutral mutations can be hurdled by large populations.\n \nWe cannot expect the code to move in any direction based on system B.\n\n That's absolutely correct. \n \nNow since I have done all this let me illustrate the co-option tree. What if there was a novel system C which was: AAGCCTTTC\n \n That's only one base pair away from Ai\n \n Natural selection pushed the genetic code towards system C but not because it was locking mutations for system C.\n \n So natural selection and random mutation formed the novel function C right?\n \n No they formed Ai and random mutation minus natural selection formed function C.\n\n That's just wrong, Freedom. RM+NS formed C in exactly the same way they formed the series A1, A2... Ai: unguided mutation followed by selection. \n \nThe question is why would Ai = C?\n\n As I keep trying to get you to see, asking that question presupposes that C was specified in advance and that attaining it is a coincidence that must be explained. The question is not 'why would Ai be close to C' but 'Is it statistically likely that there will be some C close to Ai?'\n \n \nThe question is analogous to \"why would A move towards Ai?\"\n \n That question can be answered by TOE, not the former.\n\n You need to re-examine your understanding of the TOE if you think that A can make several neutral steps towards Ai merely because Ai would represent improved function.\n \n \nIf there was a component of evolution that gave explanation for A = B then the theory would be complete and sound.\n\n The inevitability of the existence of some B.\n \nNotice also that despite how you tried to make it appear that simple clustering in permutation space could explain A = B, it cannot.\n \n Clustering indicates Gene A would be similar to Gene B, not Gene A is homologous to gene B +- difference small enough to validate statistical chance.\n\n Alright then, 'sufficiently close' clustering :)\n \n \nNotice also the important factor of static genetics, if the system is changing then one cannot say that Ai = C AND A = C.\n \n Which brings forth the final nail in the coffin for coincidental Co-option, that the novel function is always at the end of optimization.\n\n Erm, says who? If C is adjacent to Ax, where Ax is somewhere between A and Ai, then C is just as likely to form as Ax+1, because Ax+1 can only form when enough Ax exists in the population to overwhelm the odds against it.\n \n Don't forget, there's no such thing as absolute perfection. Changing environments present a moving target, keeping genes on the move and increasing the amount of sequence space explored. Whenever genes 'brush' co-option opportunities there's a chance it will happen; there's no reason to require that to be at the point of 'perfection', transient and contextual or otherwise.",

   "What flaw would that be?\n\n As Peeling put it, you are painting bulls eyes around bullet holes. To then think that the marksman is a crack-shot and not a monkey with a rifle is absurd. \n \n \n \n \nAppeal to chance\n\n Its not an appeal to chance. I am simply stating that you assume you should be able follow an obvious trail from one characteristic of an organism to another. It's just not that simple when so many mechanisms exist in mutation. \n \n The fact that you refuse to believe that mutations can propagate through a genome without selection is just stubbornness. One way to explain this is to say that mutations occur simultaneously. Lets say one is good and one is neutral. Would you deny that the neutral mutation would also be selected?

   "Hey, I didn't bring it up :)\n\n \n\"You would not surprise a molecular biologist by pointing out to her that novel function must arise by chance.\"\n\n \n \nYou haven't exposed anything. Your objections to the example already presented by Databed are invalid. \n\n I will not take your word on it.\n \nFor the latter, either his example or the classic 'nylon bug' qualify.\n\n I do not believe so.\n \n \nThis is not actually true. Raw self-replication skews the odds in favour of evolution by increasing the number of potential trials. In the same way, mass participation in a lottery favours the chances of a winner emerging.\n\n Appeal to chance\n \n \n \nNo, only you are doing that. Behe recognises the need to quantify the isolation of a novel function before claiming it cannot have arisen spontaneously. His use of irreducible complexity is such an attempt. It fails because he neglects the possibility that a system whose parts are all necessary for one function may nevertheless be reducible to a simpler system with a different function.\n\n One only needs to quantify odds if one is appealing to them. If you want to begin that debate let me win this one.\n \n \nYou say that in general one would not expect such proximate intermediate functional systems to exist. You may very well be right - which only makes our ability to find them in specific cases like the flagellum all the more significant.\n\n \n I say that absolutely one would not expect such proximate intermediate functional systems to exist because of evolution.\n \n I am right and when and if they are found is evidence against evolution.\n \n Under evolutionary theory there should be no need for these but there is. Not slow gradual change but physical coincidence.\n \n Darwin said \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case\"\n \n That case has been found in every function of every cell, you have a new statement to make:\n \n \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex system existed, which could not possibly have been formed by random chance the theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case\"\n \n Every attempt made to refute me has been an attempt to credit that random chance, 'it isn't the great a leap if you consider the concept of co-option', 'it was a very long time so some one's got to win the lottery'.\n \n No attempt has been made to move away from that premise and I can assure you that I do not feel my contentions threatened by failed attempts at mitigation.\n \n What are you arguing against? I shall admit now what you seem to be after.\n \n If there was a co-option tree which facilitated evolution, evolution could explain advancement.\n \n Yet you do not defend the notion that a co-option tree is explained you defend the notion that evolution could be plausible by it.\n \n Any function, any advancement, any improvement in genetic code can be accomplished by random chance in a mutation.\n \n If you believe these admissions win your argument then say so and let's end this unproductive venture.\n \n \nWhy is the necessary proximity of co-opted function any more of a problem than the necessary proximity of improved function?\n \n Because there is no necessary proximity in improved function. The assumption is made that every step towards improved function will increase fitness.\n \n Not to say that this is some law but it is possible.\n \n \nNatural selection depends every bit as much on the sequence-space proximity of genes yielding contextually improved function; they must be stochastically attainable for NS to get its teeth into anything. And both kinds of proximity - contextually improved function and co-opted function - have been observed.\n\n I disagree.\n \n \nThat's false in both senses. On the one hand, the allegedly IC blood clotting cascade was shown to be non-IC whilst still functioning as a blood clotting cascade.\n\n In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade:Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison: Behe, Michael\n \n \nOn the other, the existence of IC systems with cores that serve other functions are a flaw in Behe's application of the term, not his opponents, because he is trying to use IC to prove that there are no evolutionary 'rest stops' on the way to the 'finished' system.\n\n You are trying to prove there are roads between them.\n \n \nThere is no strawman here. For quantified irreducible complexity to have any significance it must apply to 'any function' and not a specific function. This is a very simple, crucial point upon which we must agree before proceeding. \n\n You will have no agreement, functionality is the functionality of the system for the purpose it serves.\n \n If you have a different system you have a different selective pressure.\n \n \nPrecisely :) Only an evolutionary history is a reason to expect to see co-option, because undoubtedly most potential biological systems would not lie on such a tree.\n\n You obviously don't realize the unbelievable coincidence that such a tree implies. It is not just general similarity it is inevitable predetermined pathways.\n \n It relies on static systems which relies on static environment and static selection.\n \n Both of which are tangents which evolution again has no effect on.\n \n I have started writing a program for natural selection vs. chance, let's actually get somewhere unlike the typical debates of this type.\n \n Let's identify the size of the genetic difference between a flagellum and the combination of all it's precursors and run the simulation.\n \n \nAnd you think that lets you off the hook? :)\n\n If the hook is \"you damn creationist\" yes.\n \n \nAbsolutely. Like Behe's failure to predict the existence of alternatively functional cores to the flagellum.\n\n IC is not a statement about co-option but evolution.\n \n \nOh dear me, no. Quite wrong. Evolution predicts what novel function should look like, if it occurs - the same way it predicts what improved function should look like if that occurs: either a modification of an existing functional system or, ultimately, something simple enough to arise spontaneously.\n\n Natural selection, random mutation, and odds (and/or) co-option.\n \n The third leg of your evolutionary theory.\n \n Because natural selection and random mutation do not predict novel function. Every thing I have said and much of what you have admitted is proof of that.\n \n \nIt is explained to the same extent that star and planet formation is explained. Beyond that, there is the fact that almost all iterative systems with simple rules have subsets of starting conditions that exhibit complex behaviour - life is the form that phenomenon takes in this universe but is by no means special.\n\n Gravity and pressure and force are not random but laws, random mutation is.... random.\n \n \n2. It seems certain to me that the vast, vast bulk of potential functional biology lies outwith this co-option tree. When we see nature explore that tree, therefore, we see not strange unexplained coincidences but more statistical inevitabilities: a tree of some kind is bound to exist within that space and will inevitably be explored if its roots are chanced upon.\n\n The fact that any tree exists is unexplained, not unexplained as in why us why here?\n \n but why ever?\n \n If you would consider the source material for a second you would see that you are not talking about 99% homology you are talking about 99.9% homology in very specific circumstances.\n \n This tree is not wide and lucky, it is narrow, narrow paths leading to specific points, not cross connecting and blending with each other but rigid and specific.\n \n Many times I have been told that I forgot an element or fact, you forget that what ever complexity you are attempting to explain in biology by co-option must exist in co-option as well.\n \n The odds can be moved around but not eliminated.\n \n \nI think I have presented as much here.\n\n \n The moment you relied on a co-option tree, the second databed used that fact that a novel function could form by pure chance you both abandoned the mechanism of evolution.\n \n Co-option is a higher order, pure chance a lucky break.\n \n As I said earlier, many lawful methods ultimately decompose into chance.\n \n When the odds are inevitable; appeals to chance in evolution are exceptions not rules.\n \n \nCertainly. And it works regardless of whether what is 'selected' at each step is a proximate improvement to an existing function or a proximate novel function.\n\n \n necessitating the assumption that proximate improvement = proximate novel function, A=B.\n \n \nIt would only need to be if evolution were demonstrably insufficient.\n\n \n I have demonstrated that.\n \n You want to prove evolution includes factors other than random mutation and natural selection be my guest.\n \n Remember occam's razor? Xvolution is the simpler explanation, I want you to argue against it if you can without compromising your own arguements.\n \n For the sake of debate I say that evolution should only be considered if Xvolution is shown to be insufficient.\n \n \nSince when have I relied on non-functional systems assisting replication?\n\n By implication.\n \n You cannot have it both ways; You cannot claim that novel systems are selected indirectly because they are similar to existing systems and then claim that selection now ceases to mean a change in reproductive ratios.\n \n \nCareful, now. 'Perfect' is entirely contextual.\n\n \n Don't beat around the bush, if a system is not perfect it can be improved, if it can be improved it will be. That is the law of rational evolution.\n \n If no perfect biological system exists then no genetically static biological system exists.\n \n \nAbsolutely correct. However, you are not quantifying the isolation of anything with this abstract proof, and that's the ball game.\n\n \n Not my ball game, you think co-option is statistically likely we will put that idea to the test.\n \n Equally, the movement towards an improvement is not guided, because the benefit of the improvement does not exist before such a change. \n \n Correct, like a voltage the concept of guided mutation is undefined in any single mutation. Only when looking a a series of mutations can the concept apply.\n \n \nYou have constructed an entirely arbitrary conceptual distinction between something that helps because it's 'better' and something that helps because it's 'novel'.\n\n \n It is not entirely arbitrary and you have got to realize it or you would have simply claimed that it doesn't matter what natural selection does before novelty appeared merely that novelty was not lost afterward. Much like databed did.\n \n Thanks to guided mutation the odds of improvement can be reduced to certainty, it would be a fallacious linking of concepts to claim that since guided mutation of a particular kind is certain that unguided mutation of any particular kind is also certain.\n \n \nAll that matters is that it helps. What pigeonhole we put it into after the fact is irrelevant.\n\n \n It doesn't matter if would help in the future, and it doesn't help before minimum genetic movement is achieved.\n \n \nWhich is exactly what the TOE does: it (correctly) predicts that novel function will only arise through co-option. It predicts what we will see and what we will not. I ask again: what more do you want?\n\n \n An explanation for co-option if you are to rely on it.\n \n You have crossed a fine line here but I noticed it. Evolution does not predict co-option it predicts co-option is necessary.\n \n There is a difference.\n \n For example imagine a theory that states wind makes kites fly, the theory would predict wind is necessary for kites to fly and it would predict kites fly in wind.\n \n If one asked \"what causes the wind the blow?\" You cannot answer \"The theory that the kite will fly in the wind\"\n \n Similarly if evolution (and I have only heard this from you) predicts that co-option is required for the advancement of life, and it predicts the advancement of life when the co-option tree exists.\n \n One cannot answer the question \"What causes co-option\" with \"evolution.\"\n \n You may at now point out that the theory about the kite is correct. Evolution as well would be a correct theory that I would except within these bounds.\n \n Now to answer the question \"How did life advance from simpler forms, what is the origin of species?\"\n \n You see if that is your position on evolution you have removed every assertion it contains until it's implications are justified by it's form.\n \n You have rendered it unable to answer that question but only place a piece of a puzzle on the table.\n \n It is like (to me) defending the following theory:\n \n You are looking through a tunnel and you see a car lifted up into the air with no directly visible force acting on it.\n \n You state the theory \"The car is lifted up by air currents, this explains it's movement\"\n \n Someone challenges it saying that air currents aren't sufficient to lift a car.\n \n You respond and say some force must have done it, I don't accept the idea that God lifted the car.\n \n Your opponent then says yes a force must be acting on the car or else it would not lift, but that doesn't tell us what it is.\n \n You say, there could be a crane lifting the car to help the air.\n \n Your opponent says \"Yes that would explain it's movement\"\n \n You say, I was right!\n \n Co-option is that crane peeling, co-option would explain the advancement of life.\n \n Co-option is not caused by or reliant on natural selection and mutation, they rely on it.\n \n \nThat's like calling fluid dynamics \"the theory that explains what water will do if a certain system of pipes exists\".\n\n \n An excellent analogy\n \n \nMmm. Well, empirical verification to umpteen decimal places says otherwise :)\n\n An undead cat has something to say about that\n \n\n Except it clearly can. You only need to look at the flagellum and secretory systems to observe this.\n\n Begging the question\n \n \nI apologise; I think I was just getting confused about whether 'guided movement' meant the flagellum's swimming action, genetic change brought about by design, or what.\n\n I actually understand, from my position one must assume design if one wants to accept evolution as it stands.\n \n So for you who take as a given that evolution is true it appears as if I must assume design.\n \n I am arguing against evolution so I do not assume design in this debate.\n \n \nNor does an improvement to a function, so that cannot be called 'guided' either. The 'guiding' part comes after the improvement occurs: making that variant plentiful so that further steps will be taken from there rather than the previous iteration.\n\n I call it guided, I have given my reasons and a intensive (as far as forum arguing goes) example.\n \n \nI quite agree. Just as there is no guided genetic movement (in terms of the next step taken) towards a 'better' functional system.\n\n \n I have addressed this already\n \n \nIn terms of achieving proximity sufficient for co-option into the flagellum specifically, if you demand in advance that the flagellum be the end product, yes, that would have to be called luck - as much luck on your part that you happened to pick in advance what was eventually achieved as anything. But in terms of achieving proximity to co-option into some novel function, that's statistical inevitability, not luck.\n\n \n By assuming that there always exists some system which is co-opting with an existing system you can prove that co-option is inevitable.\n \n This is a subtle begging the question\n \n \nIt could only be called 'unbelievable coincidence' if you were to set out in advance what evolution had to achieve via co-option and then watched it achieve it. Coming along after the fact and painting bullseyes around all the bullet holes, as it were, is not the same thing at all.\n\n \n I only set out that a tree exists, every link in that tree is increasingly unlikely just as every base pair in a single mutation is increasingly unlikely to get in a certain sequence.\n \n It is a fallacy that is perfectly demonstrable, if I said that a mutation in Xvolution need not be towards a specific system because since there are so many systems it is not necessary that the mutation be anything but random to stumble upon a functional one.\n \n Similarly it is not chance there exists functional systems, it is chance that they have static genetic zones similar enough to another functional system to cause it's formation to be likely.\n \n The higher you stack this tree the more unlikely it becomes just like DNA.\n \n It is not valid to say that there are enough functioning sets of DNA out there to make guided mutation unnecessary, just so it is not valid to say that there exists enough functional systems to make guided co-option unnecessary.\n \n We know from research that the vast majority of mutations end in detriment or at the very least neutrality, we can infer (although we should not have to) that functional systems are the exceptions in permutation space.\n \n From that premise you can cogently conclude that linked functional systems are the exception in co-option space.\n \n \nIt seems to me all but inevitable that some kind of contiguous co-option space would exist within such a crowded sequence-space.\n\n Argument from credulity?\n \n No the fact is you have no reason to expect that, you simply take the existance of life as evidence that it does exist. Not to say that is invalid, merely not an explanation.\n \n \nWow, no. I mean, no. :) Being 'closer to' improved function cannot be selected for. Ai is only attainable by RM+NS if the chain of changes A1, A2, A3,... Ai is a relatively unbroken series of contextual improvements.\n\n \n There you are right, even if an improved function can be imagined it does not mean that there is a stepwise guided process towards it.\n \n However that must be determined on a case by case basis and is not a rule, unlike novelty of IC.\n \n \n I say 'relatively' because gaps of two or three neutral mutations can be hurdled by large populations.\n\n \n I am not sure what you mean here, there will be vastly more neutral mutations than beneficial ones, in fact there will be vastly more detrimental mutations than beneficial ones.\n \n All that matters is that the beneficial one was locked by natural selection.\n \n \nThat's just wrong, Freedom. RM+NS formed C in exactly the same way they formed the series A1, A2... Ai: unguided mutation followed by selection. \n\n \n Ah but the conceptual difference is key here, the chances that A1 might mutate to A2 might not be any different than Ai to C but when one says genetic movement is guided it is always a measurement between two points.\n \n The boolean value of that measurement is \"Was the first point locked due to similarity with the second point\"\n \n That value is TRUE for every point along A to Ai, it was false from Ai to C.\n \n This was the point of that example, as I have already said co-option combined with evolution explains the advancement of life.\n \n The concept of guided mutation is only significant when one attempts to explain significant genetic movement.\n \n For instance from Ai to B\n \n This is why co-option cannot be alienated and why natural selection + mutation are useless against novelty without it.\n \n \nAs I keep trying to get you to see, asking that question presupposes that C was specified in advance and that attaining it is a coincidence that must be explained. The question is not 'why would Ai be close to C' but 'Is it statistically likely that there will be some C close to Ai?'\n\n I would say no, you would say yes. The fact is neither of us really have any science to back up those hunches because no one has done any research on those odds. (excluding ID advocates)\n \n That is a fundamental supporter of my point that evolution is not being treated scientifcaly even by scientist.\n \n Now consider the question you asked, say that it is similar to funcional systems G F K H what are the statistics that all four of those are similar to a system Z which is a second generation co-option from system A.\n \n You must hold that for a coherent tree to exist that each system is like many other systems or else a break in the chain would be fatal to the concepts purpose.\n \n \nYou need to re-examine your understanding of the TOE if you think that A can make several neutral steps towards Ai merely because Ai would represent improved function.\n\n Who said there were any neutral steps towards Ai?\n \n \nThe inevitability of the existence of some B.\n\n \n Is an article of faith\n \n \nAlright then, 'sufficiently close' clustering :)\n\n \n Has not been shown to exist much less given explaination.\n \n \nErm, says who? If C is adjacent to Ax, where Ax is somewhere between A and Ai, then C is just as likely to form as Ax+1, because Ax+1 can only form when enough Ax exists in the population to overwhelm the odds against it.\n\n Precisly, not only is your propsed co-option close enough to the orginal system to make a lucky mutation probable, but it is now close enough to be even remotly as likley as a simple benificial mutation that improves existing function.\n \n After reading that I have thought up a story which fits this perfectly, a debate is caried on about the likleyhood of a bucket of water falling down a well. One party concludes it was very likley if you take as a premise that he himself knocked it in.\n \n\n Don't forget, there's no such thing as absolute perfection. Changing environments present a moving target, keeping genes on the move and increasing the amount of sequence space explored. Whenever genes 'brush' co-option opportunities there's a chance it will happen; there's no reason to require that to be at the point of 'perfection', transient and contextual or otherwise.\n\n You don't even care that you just added a few extra exponents to the chance of evolution and co-option do you?\n \n \nYour terminology is generally so vague that it is hard to tell what you are talking about. Are you talking about biological mechanisms that cause changes in allele frequencies? If so, then you should be aware that there are others.\n\n None that produce guided change in mutated alleles\n \n \n Either you haven't bothered to educate yourself or you are being intentionally disingenuous.\n\n Funny\n \n \nIn addition to mutation and natural selection there are:\n \n gene flow\n\n Random and stablizing\n \ngenetic drift (already pointed out to you)\n\n \n Random\n \nnon-random mating (one type of which is sexual selection)\n\n \n natural selection for fitness integrating social fitness\n \nrecombination\n\n \n random\n \n \nmovable elements\n\n \n random\n \n \nbiased variation\n\n \n natural selection\n \n \nAs Peeling put it, you are painting bulls eyes around bullet holes. To then think that the marksman is a crack-shot and not a monkey with a rifle is absurd. \n\n Peeling is painting a bull's eyes everywhere, I am asking why they should not be painted on the target.\n \n \nIts not an appeal to chance. I am simply stating that you assume you should be able follow an obvious trail from one characteristic of an organism to another. It's just not that simple when so many mechanisms exist in mutation. \n\n \n Oh I'm sorry I thought that all that random zig zagging was meant to cause a non-random outcome.\n \n\n The fact that you refuse to believe that mutations can propagate through a genome without selection is just stubbornness.\n\n Oh of course they can, any particular reason why ones that lead to novel IC systems should propgate more than ones that lead away from novel IC systems?\n \n \nOne way to explain this is to say that mutations occur simultaneously. Lets say one is good and one is neutral. Would you deny that the neutral mutation would also be selected? Maybe \"selected\" isn't the correct term, but the point is that it will propagate along side the beneficial mutation. \n\n \n Yes it is possible, I believe you used the terms selected OF instead of FOR?\n \n \nTrue, but this is just an analogy to animate how evolution can lead down paths to nowhere. It can back track and it can do so mindlessly. Also, in the example of the maze solver, the turns it made were not based on intelligence. The could be programmed to be random turns every time and the maze would still get solved.\n\n \n Yes, but that would not be a simulation of IC.\n \n If one had to make twelve consecutive turns in the right order or there would be no exit.........\n \n The one element I have noticed above all in responding to these posts is the double standard of holding natural selection and random mutations as the mechanism of evolution, but then in every attempt to defend \"evolution\" from IC, references to unselected events and proceses are made.\n \n From your arguements someone could be confused to think that Co-option and random chance is the mechanism of evolution.",

   "\"You would not surprise a molecular biologist by pointing out to her that novel function must arise by chance.\"\n\n You're entirely correct; I completely missed that. Thanks - and sorry :)\n \nI do not believe so. (that genetic co-option has been observed)\n\n I can only show you the examples; I can't make you 'believe' them. The experiment detailed by Databed clearly shows existing genes being co-opted into a novel (to that organism) metabolic pathway and regulatory system. The nylon bug demonstrates existing genes being co-opted into a novel (to any organism) metabolic catalyst.\n \nAppeal to chance\n\n No, it is an appeal to statistical inevitability, the overwhelming of chance.\n \nOne only needs to quantify odds if one is appealing to them. If you want to begin that debate let me win this one.\n\n If you are not appealing to odds to support your case, then you have no business associating yourself with Behe or using his arguments and results to support yours. Behe's arguments concerning irreducible complexity are strictly quantitative.\n \nI say that absolutely one would not expect such proximate intermediate functional systems to exist because of evolution.\n\n We would certainly not expect proximate intermediate functional systems to exist for all possible biological systems. But evolutionary theory predicts we will find them for all biological systems that have been realised in nature - a distinction you grasp nicely later on.\n \nI am right and when and if they are found is evidence against evolution.\n \n Under evolutionary theory there should be no need for these but there is. Not slow gradual change but physical coincidence.\n\n For slow gradual change to yield a novel function, co-option is mandatory. Indeed, 'co-option' could be defined as 'a small change bringing about a conceptually novel function'. \n \nDarwin said \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case\"\n \n That case has been found in every function of every cell,\n\n No, it hasn't. You cannot even consider making such a claim until you quantify the functional isolation of the systems in question.\n \nWhat are you arguing against? I shall admit now what you seem to be after.\n \n If there was a co-option tree which facilitated evolution, evolution could explain advancement.\n\n True, but I fear I have created a false image in your mind as to the nature of what is required. I shall return to this later iand try to clear up any misunderstanding.\n \nAny function, any advancement, any improvement in genetic code can be accomplished by random chance in a mutation.\n\n I wouldn't agree with that. Evolutionary theory only predicts that the 'advancements' (strictly speaking 'changes') that we see realised could be so accomplished.\n \nWhy is the necessary proximity of co-opted function any more of a problem than the necessary proximity of improved function?\n \n Because there is no necessary proximity in improved function. The assumption is made that every step towards improved function will increase fitness.\n\n You said this before, and it's completely wrong. How can a step towards improved function itself increase fitness?\n \nIn Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade:Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison: Behe, Michael\n\n \n Some rather more up to date coverage of the issue.\n \nFor quantified irreducible complexity to have any significance it must apply to 'any function' and not a specific function. This is a very simple, crucial point upon which we must agree before proceeding.\n \n You will have no agreement, functionality is the functionality of the system for the purpose it serves.\n \n If you have a different system you have a different selective pressure.\n\n No, you don't. The only function that can be naturally selected is \"assists reproduction\". That is the only directional component of evolution. Nothing cares how reproduction is assisted.\n \nYou obviously don't realize the unbelievable coincidence that such a tree implies.\n\n Again, I realise now what a misleading impression I have created. I apologise and will clarify in a moment.\n \nI have started writing a program for natural selection vs. chance, let's actually get somewhere unlike the typical debates of this type.\n \n Let's identify the size of the genetic difference between a flagellum and the combination of all it's precursors and run the simulation.\n\n Sounds good to me. All you have to do to make it a fair test is identify its most immediate possible precursors. Although you did say earlier you weren't appealing to odds...\n \nIC is not a statement about co-option but evolution.\n\n Which is precisely why it's meaningless.\n \nBecause natural selection and random mutation do not predict novel function. Every thing I have said and much of what you have admitted is proof of that.\n\n Natural selection and random mutation do not 'predict' improved function either. The contextually 'better' gene has to be nearby, in potentia, for RM to realise it and NS to bring it to abundance. What I'm trying to get you to appreciate is that we cannot expect 'contextually better' to respect our post-hoc labeling of function.\n \n Think for a moment. You're claiming that we should expect the chemical interactions of folded sequences of amino acids to be neatly compartmentalised according to arbitrary english language conceptual conventions.\n \nGravity and pressure and force are not random but laws, random mutation is.... random.\n\n Physical laws describe the distribution of randomness. For instance, on average the random motions of particles in a space cancel out and we perceive uniform 'pressure', which can be described by a simple mathematical law. In that respect, evolution is much the same: although individual mutations are random the genes they are occurring to are not, because they have been filtered by past natural selection.\n \nThe fact that any tree exists is unexplained, not unexplained as in why us why here?\n \n but why ever?\n\n Ok, time to deal with this mess I've made :)\n \n For a start I'm not talking about a static series of preset branches along which evolution has crawled. What I'm talking about is a fluctuating genetic fitness landscape whose contours are not obliged to respect our post-hoc labeling of function. Perhaps a change improves the effciency of a secretory system, or perhaps it bungs up that secretory system with a protein that allows the organism to adhere to a nearby surface. If the latter is contextually beneficial, NS won't care that it's beneficial for a different conceptual reason.\n \nThis tree is not wide and lucky, it is narrow, narrow paths leading to specific points, not cross connecting and blending with each other but rigid and specific.\n\n It's certainly not rigid, and you overstate the fineness of the shifting 'paths' besides. If they were so narrow, a far higher proportion of mutations would be catastrophic than actually are.\n \nMany times I have been told that I forgot an element or fact, you forget that what ever complexity you are attempting to explain in biology by co-option must exist in co-option as well.\n \n The odds can be moved around but not eliminated.\n\n What odds? Please, tell me what they are!\n \nThe moment you relied on a co-option tree, the second databed used that fact that a novel function could form by pure chance you both abandoned the mechanism of evolution.\n\n Evolution selects improved reproductive success. It doesn't care how that improvement comes about. What we've ended up calling a 'co-option tree' is merely a reflection of our arbitrary post-hoc categorisation of how genes contribute to reproductive success. There is no basis for your claim that the behaviour of slightly different folded strings of amino acids must be compartmentalised according to english-language conceptual descriptions.\n \nRemember occam's razor? Xvolution is the simpler explanation, I want you to argue against it if you can without compromising your own arguements.\n\n I haven't seen \"xvolution\" described in any meaningful way. Could you help me out?\n \nSince when have I relied on non-functional systems assisting replication?\n \n You cannot have it both ways; You cannot claim that novel systems are selected indirectly because they are similar to existing systems and then claim that selection now ceases to mean a change in reproductive ratios.\n\n 'Novel' systems are selected on the same grounds as their precursors: they all help reproduction. At no point am I relying upon non-functional systems assisting replication.\n \nDon't beat around the bush, if a system is not perfect it can be improved, if it can be improved it will be. That is the law of rational evolution.\n\n I'm not beating around the bush. There is no such thing as a biological system that is 'perfect' in all contexts.\n \nIf no perfect biological system exists then no genetically static biological system exists.\n\n Correct. And?\n \nThanks to guided mutation the odds of improvement can be reduced to certainty,\n\n Only if proximate, contextually 'better' genes happen to exist. You depend upon the same hidden 'odds' as me :)\n \nYou have crossed a fine line here but I noticed it. Evolution does not predict co-option it predicts co-option is necessary.\n \n There is a difference.\n\n Absolutely.\n \nSimilarly if evolution (and I have only heard this from you) predicts that co-option is required for the advancement of life, and it predicts the advancement of life when the co-option tree exists.\n\n I'm surprised you've only heard this from me, because co-option is pretty much implicit in the concept of 'descent with modification', both at the macro scale (gill arches becoming jaws etc) and the micro.\n \nOne cannot answer the question \"What causes co-option\" with \"evolution.\"\n\n Very true. The general analysis of co-option in permutation spaces would be a separate mathematical endeavour.\n \n You may find this interesting: Stephen Wolfram: A New Kind of Science | Online - Table of Contents.\n \nNow to answer the question \"How did life advance from simpler forms, what is the origin of species?\"\n \n You see if that is your position on evolution you have removed every assertion it contains until it's implications are justified by it's form.\n \n You have rendered it unable to answer that question but only place a piece of a puzzle on the table.\n\n I agree-although it's a fairly substantial piece :)\n \n What I would say is that you are potentially making too big a deal of the ability of genes to occasionally mutate across arbitrary conceptual functional boundaries. You haven't in any way shown that to be a priori unlikely. A really good screwdriver makes an indifferent hammer, but serviceable enough for NS to get its teeth into, right? Is that co-option such an incredible coincidence that it demands further explanation?\n \nIt is like (to me) defending the following theory:\n\n No; that's not a good analogy.\n \n Evolution is an explanation of how genetic fitness space has been navigated. The topology of that fitness space is defined in turn by the laws of physics, which dictate how proteins fold and chemically interact.\n \n To return to the flagellum, evolution explains why we get to see the flagellum realised, but not why it is proximate to other functional structures in gene sequence space in the first place, right? From this you infer a large amount of unexplained coincidence, whereas I do not. The reason I do not is as follows:\n \n The laws of physics - which are entirely responsible for the way the flagellum self-assembles, functions, and its proximity in sequence space to other systems - are far too blunt a tool for us to imagine that the flagellum - and every other biological system - was 'designed' by tweaking them. \n \n To put it another way, if we assume as you do that a 'co-option tree' is enormously unlikely, such that the extant laws of physics are effectively the only ones able to generate one, then 'design' would only be the same kind of explanation for those laws being realised as evolution is for the flagellum being realised: it's a piece in the puzzle but the monstrous coincidence of a small set of physical rules happening to yield a vast and intricate co-option tree remains unexplained. God might have picked the rules, but he was simply lucky that there were any to pick which suited his purpose. Do you see what I mean?\n \n I, on the other hand, see no pressing reason to assume that 'co-option trees' are unlikely. I reckon it would be much harder to find laws of physics under which a screwdriver couldn't also be used as a hammer :)\n \nI call it guided, I have given my reasons and a intensive (as far as forum arguing goes) example.\n\n You're entirely free to call it 'guided' - so long as you're consistent. If randomly hitting upon improved genetic function, followed by selection for that improvement, counts as 'guided', then so does randomly hitting upon a novel function, followed by selection for the benefit to reproduction that new function provides.\n \nBy assuming that there always exists some system which is co-opting with an existing system you can prove that co-option is inevitable.\n\n I'm not making any such assumption. I explicitly said that not every possible system will have adjacent co-opted systems - only the ones we see realised. \n \nI only set out that a tree exists, every link in that tree is increasingly unlikely just as every base pair in a single mutation is increasingly unlikely to get in a certain sequence.\n\n Oh dear, no; that doesn't follow at all.\n \nIt is not valid to say that there are enough functioning sets of DNA out there to make guided mutation unnecessary, just so it is not valid to say that there exists enough functional systems to make guided co-option unnecessary.\n\n What you call 'guided mutation' is random mutation followed by selection. Clearly there are enough functional, adjacent sets of DNA for that process to yield reproductive improvement.\n \nWe know from research that the vast majority of mutations end in detriment or at the very least neutrality, we can infer (although we should not have to) that functional systems are the exceptions in permutation space.\n\n Actually, no we can't make that particular inference. As I keep trying to remind you, better/worse is context dependent: every sequence could be functional and it could still be true that in any given context most mutations would be neutral or detrimental.\n \n Functional sequences are in the minority, but your inference is an invalid way of showing it.\n \nFrom that premise you can cogently conclude that linked functional systems are the exception in co-option space.\n\n Again, this is an invalid inference - not that it matters. Linked functional systems can be the exception.\n \nNo the fact is you have no reason to expect that, you simply take the existance of life as evidence that it does exist. Not to say that is invalid, merely not an explanation.\n\n I expect it because, as I said earlier, nothing - not design, nothing - can truly explain the 'coincidence' of a co-option tree emerging from simple rules if it is in fact an unlikely occurrence. A designer would only be able to 'pick the special one', which would explain why it was realised but not why it was possible in the first place. \n \nHowever that must be determined on a case by case basis and is not a rule, unlike novelty of IC.\n\n Show me the rule that states similar genetic material cannot be co-opted into novel functions.\n \nI am not sure what you mean here, there will be vastly more neutral mutations than beneficial ones, in fact there will be vastly more detrimental mutations than beneficial ones.\n\n What I mean is that large populations can hurdle gaps of one or two neutral mutations. If we start at A1, then a large population can attain A3 (or A4) even if A2 (and A3) are neutral mutations and thus not selected.\n \n \nAh but the conceptual difference is key here, the chances that A1 might mutate to A2 might not be any different than Ai to C but when one says genetic movement is guided it is always a measurement between two points.\n \n The boolean value of that measurement is \"Was the first point locked due to similarity with the second point\"\n \n That value is TRUE for every point along A to Ai, it was false from Ai to C.\n\n Ah. Now I see your mistake.\n \n A1,A2,A3... do not get locked just because they are more similar to Ai. They get locked if and only if they are advantageous in their own right. That is why the leap from Ax to C, and C's subsequent locking, is as likely as the leap from Ax to Ax+1 and Ax+1's subsequent locking.\n \n What you are describing as 'guided evolution' simply doesn't happen.\n I would say no, you would say yes. The fact is neither of us really have any science to back up those hunches because no one has done any research on those odds. (excluding ID advocates)\n On the contrary, I have numerous examples of co-option, many of which used to be ID examples of IC.\n \nYou must hold that for a coherent tree to exist that each system is like many other systems or else a break in the chain would be fatal to the concepts purpose.\n\n Not at all. It is only necessary for some systems to be - at quite different extremes of their configuration - like three others. Not forgetting the times when two or more systems can together be similar to a third, etc etc.\n \nWho said there were any neutral steps towards Ai?\n\n You did. You described the intermediate steps as being 'closer to' improved functionality. Moving closer to improved functionality is a neutral step, since it does not itself improve functionality.\n \nPrecisly, not only is your propsed co-option close enough to the orginal system to make a lucky mutation probable, but it is now close enough to be even remotly as likley as a simple benificial mutation that improves existing function.\n\n Yep, just like the examples observed in the lab.\n \nYou don't even care that you just added a few extra exponents to the chance of evolution and co-option do you?\n\n On the contrary, it removes them: it keeps genes in motion, spreading them out in permutation-space rather than having them collect permanently at static points.",

The nylon bug demonstrates existing genes being co-opted into a novel (to any organism) metabolic catalyst.\n\n You are incorrect review the paper and the facts omitted (which can be found in Behe's rebuttal), if you don't want look back for the link Google true acid test.\n First observing similarity in biological systems when by your own arguments you admit that genetic code is routinely copied and modified.\n There is no cogent much less certain way to know if a similar system is a modified copy or an example of co-option.\n Second since I do not claim co-option is impossible so an example of co-option would not prove me wrong.\n On this last let me make an important point, the reason I must say that co-option isn&#8217;t impossible is because it is a chaotic system and even a negative is a form of structure that cannot be applied to it.\n \n Imagine a glass box full of flies; I cannot say that it is impossible for the flies to form a letter while flying around it is chaotic and so any particular outcome cannot be predicted.\n \n I can say it is highly unlikely for a letter to take shape, even more unlikely for two letters to form consecutively.\n \n I may then go on to claim that it is practically impossible for a sentence to form by forming one letter after another.\n \n Now it may be claimed that if the flies were immortal and you had a Camera capturing every letter, eventually (no claim is made as to how long) a sentence will be made.\n Similar thought examples include the monkeys writing hamlet, and your argument for co-option.\n \n As I have already noted I believe it is fundamentally flawed to multiply odds by infinity, in mathematics infinity is called an indeterminate form for a reason.\n Further even if it was a valid method of knowledge evolution did not occur under infinite conditions.\n \n In this example natural selection would be like painting glue in the shape of the sentence on the glass so that every time a fly lands in a correct position it is locked.\n Co-option would be like having a stencil in the shape of the sentence so that it looks like there are flies in the correct shape because you can&#8217;t see the others.\n I see a common theme in your arguments of conferred order.\n \n By conferred order I mean that your various approaches to circumventing IC have taken the form of allowing novelty to become probable by taking assumptions that make it so.\n \n So it is unlikely that a random mutation forms a novel function&#8230;\n - But not if we assume the mutation is very small!\n \n So it is unlikely that the mutation is very small\n - But not if we assume the system the DNA is in is similar to the new system for a reason, that reason being homology or &#8220;co-option&#8221; with novelty.\n \n So it is unlikely that systems have co-option with novelty\n - But not if we assume that homology and co-option are a normal occurrence\n \n Every time the burden of order was conferred to a deeper level, I can predict where this is going and I stated as much.\n The end of the conference chain is molecular biology, the idea that the chemistry of life implies homology between functions, that homology between function implies co-option, co-option implies probable single shot novelty forming mutations, single shot novelty forming mutation save evolution and combine with natural selection to allow all advancement.\n \n The fundamental error here is that chemical bonds imply sufficient homology.\n The shape of an enzyme implies similarity with all other enzymes that accomplish the same function because of similar target and method, it implies nothing further. All other cases have similar statements.\n \n No enzyme implies genetic similarity with a structural protein, if similarity is found it is &#8220;a lucky break.&#8221; There is no rational reason to expect it.\n That there is implied similarity is the basic foundation of any claim to probable co-option.\n In chess the complexity of all possible outcomes is unimaginably massive, the rules are relatively simple. Yet no one can claim to predict any particular outcome in any particular game.\n \n I predict the response to that will be that one does not need to predict an outcome, that doing so is placing post factual limitations of evolution.\n Now, and I want an answer to this; if evolution is not meant to explain the particular outcome of life as we know it how can you call it science?\n I don&#8217;t know how best to make this following point emphasized but in my mind it is the most important one made, since we know that biology has a very large range in genetic permutation space how can you claim clustering will cause sufficient homology?\n i.e. there is insignificant homology between code to say perform endocystosis compared to code which packs DNA.\n There is a large distance between them but by your vision of co-option there must be a connection somewhere (a break in the web would be what you called an isolated system).\n \n Under what justification can you say it is likely that there exist systems at regular genetic differentials between them simply because you need a web of co-option. \n Wouldn&#8217;t that make you guilty of the same post factual assignment you accuse me of?\n \nNo, it is an appeal to statistical inevitability, the overwhelming of chance.\n\n That is unsubstantiated.\n The evidence against it is the ratio of detrimental/neutral mutations to possible homologous function mutations.\n \n \nIf you are not appealing to odds to support your case, then you have no business associating yourself with Behe or using his arguments and results to support yours. Behe's arguments concerning irreducible complexity are strictly quantitative.\n\n Yes of course but appealing to unlikeliness is fundamentally different from appealing to likeliness.\n \n For instance if I got 5 scientist to put a % chance that God was real it would be fundamentally unsound to claim that since someone can put appeal to chance that makes it possible, and then to multiply the odds by infinity to arrive at certainty.\n \n It is not unsound to state that since there is no reason to believe there is any chance that God existed an appeal to any odds it innately fallacious.\n \n If you prefer a less clouded example the flying spaghetti monster, what proof can you make against the flying spaghetti monster?\n \n None of course you cannot prove a negative, but further let&#8217;s take a different example, say that of a Boeing 747 could form out of random particle collisions.\n \n There is no physical law that states this cannot happen.\n \n If one assumes the universe is infinite you can multiply the size of the universe (trials) by time (very long) by likely hood.\n \n Yes there is an infinite term, the chances is certain that an infinite number of Boeing 747's exist and have existed.\n \n Now what would one say to that? That it is unlikely? (I am), that we have never seen it happen (I have)? That there is no method or reason for it to happen (I have said that as well)?\n \n I hope you can see that if two parties admitted that it is not impossible for a flying spaghetti monster to exist that the one who appeals to unlikeliness is the cogent position due to lack of logical justification on the opposing odds no matter what they are appraised to be.\n Now that is on principle, in this case I can tell you that it is not statistically inevitable that a co-option tree exists because that would necessitate a function crowded permutation space.\n \n That permutation space is known to be dominated by useless and detrimental code.\n \n The only way to escape this logic is to say that function grouping is not uniformly distributed around functional code.\n \n That is a non-chaotic element in particular contradiction with the premise of random cause.\n \n \nNo, it is an appeal to statistical inevitability, the overwhelming of chance.\n\n That is unsubstantiated.\n The evidence against it is the ratio of detrimental/neutral mutations to possible homologous function mutations.\n \n \nIf you are not appealing to odds to support your case, then you have no business associating yourself with Behe or using his arguments and results to support yours.

But evolutionary theory predicts we will find them for all biological systems that have been realised in nature - a distinction you grasp nicely later on.\n\n Yes of course the classic valid defense against \"the earth is so perfect\", well it only seems lucky because we don't see all the planets that aren't like this.\n Now what happens if you find out you are in a system with 231 habitable planets?\n The equivalent is \"the fact that this function has co-option with another is so perfect\" well it only seems lucky because we don't see all the other functions which don't have co-option.\n In your version a function that leads to another, leads to a hundred others down the road.\n You can only assume that co-option is not rare, or that this is unbelievable coincidence.\n \n I have shown that by definition co-option must be rare because function is rare.\n \n \nFor slow gradual change to yield a novel function, co-option is mandatory. Indeed, 'co-option' could be defined as 'a small change bringing about a conceptually novel function'. \n\n I think you just agreed with me but I'm not sure.\n \n \nNo, it hasn't. You cannot even consider making such a claim until you quantify the functional isolation of the systems in question.\n\n Darwin was talking about natural selection you are not.\n \n \nTrue, but I fear I have created a false image in your mind as to the nature of what is required. I shall return to this later iand try to clear up any misunderstanding.\n\n It seems you have been very clear.\n \nI wouldn't agree with that. Evolutionary theory only predicts that the 'advancements' (strictly speaking 'changes') that we see realised could be so accomplished.\n\n It sounds like &#8220;evolutionary theory predicts only those changes that we see must have happened\".\n \n So since the car moves and I have a theory that predicts its movement my theory is correct?\n \n \"Evolutionary theory predicts whatever we see in life\" That is the definition of a good scientific theory but a gross begging the question fallacy .\n \n I could have an abstract called \"good scientific theory\" and this theory would predict all phenomenons with no contradiction.... what's that? You think my theory isn't real science? emoticon_xhoho\n \nYou said this before, and it's completely wrong. How can a step towards improved function itself increase fitness?\n\n The answer is it grants a small improvement itself.\n \n Yes I think there are probably IC improvements  out there too.\n \nNo, you don't. The only function that can be naturally selected is \"assists reproduction\". That is the only directional component of evolution. Nothing cares how reproduction is assisted.\n\n We have been over this before; a step towards a flagellum in a secretary system is not necessarily beneficial to the process of the secretary system. Therefore without co-option there is no reason to expect the mutation to be locked.\n \n Mutation of a system will not help unless\n A: it forms a new function\n B: it increases fitness of the system it is in\n There is no C: God like gaiatopia designer (but not really designer but mystical nature) locks a mutation because evolutionists really need it.\n \n As you can see B clearly dictates that the locking of mutations is FULLY contextual to the system it is in not any system it may resemble in our eyes.\n \n I don't see why I am cursed to always have the debate where at least one point is completely inverted.\n \n How many times have I heard \"evolution doesn't have any purpose in mind, stop imagining a specific goal\", and then I am told natural selection can guide mutation series based on something other than immediate benefit.\n \n By definition immediate benefit refers ONLY to the current functionality.\n \n I must agree, if you don't agree with this we should just concentrate on this section of the arguement.\n \n \nSounds good to me. All you have to do to make it a fair test is identify its most immediate possible precursors. Although you did say earlier you weren't appealing to odds...\n\n To positive odds, I appeal to negative odds every time I hear something that is not physically impossible but unobserved.\n \n You do to I am sure.\n \n In any case the point of this exercise would be to take a real world example and illustrate exactly what odds you are relying on.\n \n The fact is that it can't be a good scientific experiment because as many have pointed out if IC is right, the simulation will run forever.\n \n However I believe we can work together to get it to the point where you agree it is modeling evolution in the specific case we choose.\n \n I have a pretty fast machine and I ran off 6 million mutations in 20 minutes so this is doable.\n \n This isn't the kind of surface data you read in articles, I would appreciate some help.\n \n We need to identify every protein used in the function and assembly of a flagellum, the proteins of all precursor co-option systems.\n \n A peptide count for each and degree of divergence between precursor and flagellum proteins.\n \n Now that I think about it that information might not be on the web....",

   "Which is precisely why it's meaningless.\n\n That must have been a typo it appeared you accepted the premise the co-option is not evolution.\n \n \nNatural selection and random mutation do not 'predict' improved function either. The contextually 'better' gene has to be nearby, in potentia, for RM to realise it and NS to bring it to abundance. What I'm trying to get you to appreciate is that we cannot expect 'contextually better' to respect our post-hoc labeling of function.\n\n I have already told you I don't believe I am the one attributing intelligence to evolution.\n \n This argument basically sounded to me like \"evolution doesn't care what we call novel function so it doesn't care if a system is IC or not\"\n \n Of course evolution doesn't care at all. It will neither seek not avoid anything beyond the scope of selection.\n \n \nThink for a moment. You're claiming that we should expect the chemical interactions of folded sequences of amino acids to be neatly compartmentalised according to arbitrary english language conceptual conventions.\n\n Think for a moment. You're claiming that we should expect the chemical interactions of folded sequences of amino acids to be neatly compartmentalized according to what evolution claims to predict.\n \n The sword is double edged peeling, natural selection is the only leverage you have over complete genetic chaos. You know it is not enough so you use co-option.\n \n I say again natural selection and random mutation do not predict novel function. They predict that every mutation that is beneficial is locked. The random part of random mutation sticks around only in a very specific case, the case of non-immediate benefit.\n \n It remains that evolution will not care what we call novel function, it does 'care' that a mutation is not selected for.\n \n \nPhysical laws describe the distribution of randomness. For instance, on average the random motions of particles in a space cancel out and we perceive uniform 'pressure', which can be described by a simple mathematical law. In that respect, evolution is much the same: although individual mutations are random the genes they are occurring to are not, because they have been filtered by past natural selection.\n\n Peeling, I implore you; you must know by now that I understand the precepts of evolution. Why do you make me read all of this?\n \n It is alright to ignore something I have said if it is getting off topic.\n \n \nFor a start I'm not talking about a static series of preset branches along which evolution has crawled. What I'm talking about is a fluctuating genetic fitness landscape whose contours are not obliged to respect our post-hoc labeling of function.\n\n It seems to me this concept lends itself even worse to the purpose of guiding the guider, it certainly fits better with the theme of evolution though.\n \n \nPerhaps a change improves the effciency of a secretory system, or perhaps it bungs up that secretory system with a protein that allows the organism to adhere to a nearby surface. If the latter is contextually beneficial, NS won't care that it's beneficial for a different conceptual reason.\n\n So basically \"there has got to be a co-option somewhere in a set of existing functions and given enough time evolution will come in close enough distance to jump\"\n \n I want to point out that I believe this is worse, by setting up the premise of dynamic genetics (which actually fits reality well) you have opened the door to another \"attack of the odds\" in which a co-option is so close to a novel function that it is relatively likely compared to \"ordinary\" genetic movement.\n \n For instance imagine a certain system is moving along a evolutionary path way changing constantly as demanded by the changing environment.\n \n Since mutation is always random it is no more likely that a co-option mutation occur than a mutation that would move it away from that co-option but that will provide immediate benefit.\n \n Where previously co-option only required time it now requires even greater degree of homology and can \"miss\" the target. You are depended now on the non-random changing of the environment which causes non-versatile functions to be kept in a state of primitive flux while versatile functions advance and are not thrown back to take another shot at co-option.\n Remember conferred order? You have even abandoned that. This is now a pure appeal to pure chance.\n \nIt's certainly not rigid, and you overstate the fineness of the shifting 'paths' besides. If they were so narrow, a far higher proportion of mutations would be catastrophic than actually are.\n\n I don't think so, when compared to the distance between pathways I would describe it as laser fine.\n \n \nWhat odds? Please, tell me what they are!\n\n Not good.\n \nEvolution selects improved reproductive success. It doesn't care how that improvement comes about. What we've ended up calling a 'co-option tree' is merely a reflection of our arbitrary post-hoc categorisation of how genes contribute to reproductive success. There is no basis for your claim that the behaviour of slightly different folded strings of amino acids must be compartmentalised according to english-language conceptual descriptions.\n\n Been over this.\n \nI haven't seen \"xvolution\" described in any meaningful way. Could you help me out?\n\n Identical to evolution except that mutations only occur at massive scale.\n \n Meaning that when a single mutation forms a new species that species might be fitter than the parent species, if so it is selected for and survives.\n \n No mutations other than those are considered.\n \n Natural selection works on new species but not before they are formed.\n \n \n'Novel' systems are selected on the same grounds as their precursors: they all help reproduction. At no point am I relying upon non-functional systems assisting replication.\n\n You are relying on co-option.\n \n \nI'm not beating around the bush. There is no such thing as a biological system that is 'perfect' in all contexts.\n\n No comment\n \nCorrect. And?\n\n And nothing, I was operating under a misinterpreted view of the 'co-option tree'\n \n \nOnly if proximate, contextually 'better' genes happen to exist. You depend upon the same hidden 'odds' as me :)\n\n No I do not state that all points between an arbitrary improved function must be themselves improved, I simply state that is possible and prevalent and most importantly absolutely necessary for guided movement.\n \n \nI'm surprised you've only heard this from me, because co-option is pretty much implicit in the concept of 'descent with modification', both at the macro scale (gill arches becoming jaws etc) and the micro.\n\n I always heard it as if claiming it was a natural part of evolution where you have not.\n \n \nWhat I would say is that you are potentially making too big a deal of the ability of genes to occasionally mutate across arbitrary conceptual functional boundaries. \n\n If you mean by this that evolution only cares if there is benefit not how it came about I agree, if you mean that genes have been observed to change function under the influence of natural selection I have no seen no examples of this \"ability.\" Nor can I make too big of a deal about it when it is absolutely necessary for evolution to be true.\n \nYou haven't in any way shown that to be a priori unlikely. \n\n I have referenced the necessary relationship with permutation space.\n \nA really good screwdriver makes an indifferent hammer, but serviceable enough for NS to get its teeth into, right? Is that co-option such an incredible coincidence that it demands further explanation?\n\n No not that particular one, what about a good oven that makes an indifferent storage closet, except that to be an oven it has to burn anything inside?\n If one had only an average American home to work with, would anything in any combination be an indifferent helicopter?\n If one claims you could build a helicopter out of household objects it demands further explanation. Here analogies fail us and we must look at life itself.\n A good secratory system does not make an indifferent flagellum.\n The flagellum remains one of the best examples because it's components continue to both fit IC's definition and none of the parts have yet been shown to be indispensable.\n Necessitating co-option by random chance instead of conceptual homology.\n \n \nNo; that's not a good analogy.\n\n I think it is.\n \n \nThe laws of physics - which are entirely responsible for the way the flagellum self-assembles, functions, and its proximity in sequence space to other systems - are far too blunt a tool for us to imagine that the flagellum - and every other biological system - was 'designed' by tweaking them. \n \n To put it another way, if we assume as you do that a 'co-option tree' is enormously unlikely, such that the extant laws of physics are effectively the only ones able to generate one, then 'design' would only be the same kind of explanation for those laws being realised as evolution is for the flagellum being realised: it's a piece in the puzzle but the monstrous coincidence of a small set of physical rules happening to yield a vast and intricate co-option tree remains unexplained. God might have picked the rules, but he was simply lucky that there were any to pick which suited his purpose. Do you see what I mean?\n\n No\n \n I believe you tried to link chemical bonding to a web of co-option without reason though.\n \nI, on the other hand, see no pressing reason to assume that 'co-option trees' are unlikely. I reckon it would be much harder to find laws of physics under which a screwdriver couldn't also be used as a hammer :)\n\n Or a car a door?\n \n \nYou're entirely free to call it 'guided' - so long as you're consistent. If randomly hitting upon improved genetic function, followed by selection for that improvement, counts as 'guided', then so does randomly hitting upon a novel function, followed by selection for the benefit to reproduction that new function provides.\n\n I am consistent; guided is between two points of genetic change.\n \nWhat you call 'guided mutation' is random mutation followed by selection. Clearly there are enough functional, adjacent sets of DNA for that process to yield reproductive improvement.\n\n Oh clearly : xbanghead\n \nActually, no we can't make that particular inference. As I keep trying to remind you, better/worse is context dependent: every sequence could be functional and it could still be true that in any given context most mutations would be neutral or detrimental.\n\n Shouldn't have picked something so disprovable.\n \nFunctional sequences are in the minority, but your inference is an invalid way of showing it.\n\n I wasn't trying to show it, I was using it as a premise to conclude that functionality is rare in permutation space.\n \n \nAgain, this is an invalid inference - not that it matters. Linked functional systems can be the exception.\n\n Only if you then have a reason for there to be a large web of exceptions.\n \n \nI expect it because, as I said earlier, nothing - not design, nothing - can truly explain the 'coincidence' of a co-option tree emerging from simple rules if it is in fact an unlikely occurrence.\n\n The simple rules we know do not explain it, there may be other rules which we do not know.\n \nA designer would only be able to 'pick the special one', which would explain why it was realised but not why it was possible in the first place. \n\n Why are you talking about a designer?\n \n \nShow me the rule that states similar genetic material cannot be co-opted into novel functions.\n\n Show me the rule that would cause it.\n \n I have seen some logic traps in this debate but this is the most obvious. I do not need a rule to prove a negative, show me the rule that states God cannot exist.\n \n \nWhat I mean is that large populations can hurdle gaps of one or two neutral mutations. If we start at A1, then a large population can attain A3 (or A4) even if A2 (and A3) are neutral mutations and thus not selected.\n\n Oh I see, yes of course larger populations make lucky shots more probable. Of course until I am absolutly sure you know what I mean when I say guided selection I would like to point out that a jump such as this would not be guided when measuring from the last locked mutation before the jump to the first one after.\n \n \nAh. Now I see your mistake.\n\n emoticon_xangel\n \n \nA1,A2,A3... do not get locked just because they are more similar to Ai. They get locked if and only if they are advantageous in their own right. \n\n Of course, the assumption is that the closer you are to Ai the more fit you are.\n \n \nThat is why the leap from Ax to C, and C's subsequent locking, is as likely as the leap from Ax to Ax+1 and Ax+1's subsequent locking.\n\n Perhaps but as it is not guided it is random, necessitating  luck in homology.\n \n \nWhat you are describing as 'guided evolution' simply doesn't happen.\n\n What I am describing as guided evolution is evolution.\n \n Do not make unwarranted conclusions and say \"evolution doesn't happen\", but I am glad my arguments have done some good.\n \n \nI would say no, you would say yes. The fact is neither of us really have any science to back up those hunches because no one has done any research on those odds. (excluding ID advocates)\n On the contrary, I have numerous examples of co-option, many of which used to be ID examples of IC.\n\n That is not a statement about probability.\n \n As I said before it is impossible to retro-actively identify if something is co-option or copied degradation without fossil DNA.\n \n i.e. the story is that secratory system had co-option with a flagellum, how do we know that there wasn't a flagellum which was copied and degraded into a secretory system?\n \n Secondly and most importantly, simple homology is not qualification for co-option. Sufficient homology is.\n \n I still reserve judgment that a type three secratory system has co-option with a flagellum until I see the genetic differential.\n \n Finally as you pointed out so succinctly an exception a rule does not make.\n \n \nNot at all. It is only necessary for some systems to be - at quite different extremes of their configuration - like three others. Not forgetting the times when two or more systems can together be similar to a third, etc etc.\n\n I didn't say that you claimed there are no dead ends, simply that there is a tree and that it does cover all functions.\n \n \nYou did. You described the intermediate steps as being 'closer to' improved functionality. Moving closer to improved functionality is a neutral step, since it does not itself improve functionality.\n\n I did not mean to imply that intermediate steps were not themselves improvements, consider this quote from my post.\n \n \"Hey look it's closer to System Ai (improved)! On the correct assumption that being closer to improved function could provide benefit to the organism  we can say this mutation although it is not Ai yet it is selected for by making the organism with this gene produce more offspring.\"\n \n Ai is an arbitrary point of improvement, the assumption is that almost all points in-between provide improved fitness, there are further mutations afterwards when the environment changes.\n \n \nYep, just like the examples observed in the lab.\n\n Eh no, (that was an invitation to prove it)\n \n \nOn the contrary, it removes them: it keeps genes in motion, spreading them out in permutation-space rather than having them collect permanently at static points.\n\n Adding another random element into a system as a necessary variable adds unlikeliness.\n \n \nRandom mutations are all unselected at the time they occur (i think you know this). It is true that some functions were built on unselected mutations that are present in the genome. The fact is, there are unselected junk DNA sequences propagating through all the genomes on the planet. Do you contend that no combination of this junk DNA* and a single subsequent mutation is allowed to cause a novel function to emerge? If these random, unselected anomalies were rare, you would have point here, but they are not rare and instead very common.\n \n \n *don't get me wrong here, the qualifier \"junk\" is just to demonstrate a point. Novel functions can also arise via previously functional genes that have been modified\n\n \n \nRandom mutations are all unselected at the time they occur (i think you know this).\n\n Yes\n \nIt is true that some functions were built on unselected mutations that are present in the genome.

I want to be certain we are on the same page with this before moving on. I apologise in advance if I end up boring you with the trivially obvious - it's just that right now I don't feel we're talking about quite the same thing, and we need to be.\n \n Earlier you described a sequence of mutations A,A1,...,Ai as being 'guided', and said that A1, A2 etc would be selected - would become fixed - because they were 'closer' to Ai. You subsequently said:\n \nOf course, the assumption is that the closer you are to Ai the more fit you are.\n\n \n The first point I want to make sure we agree upon is the nature of the 'guidance' that is going on, namely that (excluding leaps facilitated by large populations) A1 becomes abundant ('fixed' isn't strictly necessary) because it confers a contextual reproductive benefit to its bearer. This abundance makes mutation A2 statistically likely, whereupon A2 will become abundant because it confers a contextual reproductive benefit, and so on.\n \n In each case the mutation is random, with the subsequent guidance supplied by differential reproductive rates. Are we in agreement?\n \n Now, what I'd like you to do for me is explain what about that guided process is function specific.

Further it does not add a discernable pattern to the dealt cards necessitating the label random.\n \n What if the dealer looked at each card before he dealt it and discarded it if it wasn't good for the player? (Natural selection), then the hand would not be random.\n \n So as pointing out that biological functions are not totally isolated from each other in form effects the odds it does not mean they are not random.\n \n Now peeling has already grasped this point and is not arguing that novel function is predictable in any further way than the odds times the trials results in certainty.\n \n \nIt is true that some functions were built on unselected mutations that are present in the genome. The fact is, there are unselected junk DNA sequences propagating through all the genomes on the planet. Do you contend that no combination of this junk DNA* and a single subsequent mutation is allowed to cause a novel function to emerge?\n\n \n \nI contend it is unlikely in general...\n\n \n Substitute \"the combination of this junk DNA and single subsequent mutation forming novel function\" for it.\n \n To arrive at: I contend that the combination of this junk DNA and single subsequent mutation forming novel function is unlikely in general...\n \n \nWhy? You have nothing that suggests this is unlikely. In fact, this was seen in the acid experiment, was it not?

I want to be certain we are on the same page with this before moving on. I apologise in advance if I end up boring you with the trivially obvious - it's just that right now I don't feel we're talking about quite the same thing, and we need to be.\nI am\n \nEarlier you described a sequence of mutations A,A1,...,Ai as being 'guided', and said that A1, A2 etc would be selected - would become fixed - because they were 'closer' to Ai. You subsequently said:\nI had a very elegant response that was about 2 pages long, of course I hit back. I suppose we should stop that long stuff anyway.\n \n I will just define guided mutation:\n Guided mutation - The measurement between two points in which genetic movement is guided when the point(s) in the range are locked due to similarity with the final point.\n \n Guided mutation is an evaluation that is performed on any genetic code and any other set, for example between a system and a precursor.\n \n There is partial and total guidance which is some points being locked and all points being locked respectively.\n \n Single mutations can never be guided because there is no range only start and end (which are not included in the range)\n \n The first objection I would make to this is \"A mutation is never selected due to similarity with anything.\"\n \n Since guided mutation is a tool of conceptual analysis so is the judgment of cause.\n I fully know that mutation in reality is always locked due only to immediate benefit. What Behe has dragged out into the open is the question \"Why does any given mutation cause benefit?\"\n \n Going back to your hammer and screwdriver example, suppose a screw driver is being used as a hammer, a mutation comes along and makes it heavier. Evolution of course does not think so it cannot think \"a heavier object is more like a hammer so this should be selected for\" it does 'decide' that \"a heavier object is better.\"\n \n The mutation for a heavier screwdriver was locked due to immediate benefit, in our conceptual analysis we see that there is benefit because the screwdriver is now more similar to a hammer.\n \n This is the essential and perhaps only tool for explaining why 500 selected mutations later our screwdriver would be mistaken for a hammer.\n \n Only be refusing to categorize physical functions we see in biology can \"benefit\" remain hazy in reference cause and effect.\n \n \nThe first point I want to make sure we agree upon is the nature of the 'guidance' that is going on, namely that (excluding leaps facilitated by large populations) A1 becomes abundant ('fixed' isn't strictly necessary) because it confers a contextual reproductive benefit to its bearer. This abundance makes mutation A2 statistically likely, whereupon A2 will become abundant because it confers a contextual reproductive benefit, and so on.\nClose but not quite, it makes A1 + A2 statistically more likely than it would if A1 did not become abundant because of selection, it does not necessarily mean A2 alone is any more likely than it was before.\n \n The key is the odds of A1 do not need to be multiplied by A2, each can be 'tackled' one at a time.\n \n This is important because probability propagates quickly into unmanageable sizes while time and population remain comparatively linear.\n \n \nIn each case the mutation is random, with the subsequent guidance supplied by differential reproductive rates. Are we in agreement?\nYes, guidance is merely a measurement of the locking of each point.\n \nNow, what I'd like you to do for me is explain what about that guided process is function specific. \nOnly mutations which improve function can be selected/locked, therefore each mutation to any given gene is specific to its current function.\n \n If the gene currently has no function then no mutation can be guided.\n You've said that A5 proliferating at the expense of A4 counts as 'guided evolution' if and only if the function of A5 is, to an outside observer, conceptually the same as that of A4.\n \n There can be no guidance over one mutation. Now if we are measuring from several points before A4 when it's function is different from A5 one can see that no mutations will be locked due to similarity with A5 because the function is different.\n \n Again code:\n A3 (function 1) = ATTC\n A4 (function 1) = ATCG\n A5 (function 2) = ATCT\n \n ATC in A4 might be useful for function 2, but as of A4 the benefit provided is the modification of function 1.\n \n Therefore the final point (A5) was irrelevant to the locking of A4, therefore the mutation A 3-<5 was not guided.\n \n This can be made apparent by modifying the example to say that ATC is useful for function 2 but detrimental to function 1.\n \n That would cause A4 to never be locked, drawing the clear and very relevant line caused by change in functions.\n \n Let's continue the tradition of using household objects as examples if only to put some values on these variables for clarities sake and say we are mutating a kitchen knife.\n \n Say that the final point we are measuring to is a key, I can say that there is no guidance in mutation towards the key because until it is a key.\n \n This is because while it is a knife mutation for larger size, sharpness, and serrations are beneficial. Mutations for smallness, dullness, and the correct shape are beneficial for a key.\n \n It is incontestably relevant to ask at each point is this a key or a knife because only the answer can tell you if a mutation is beneficial.\n \n Assuming the point when it becomes a key is the final point of measurement I can say every single point before it was not selected/locked due to similarity with a key, a key does not necessarily make a good knife and whether it does or not is irrelevant because in fact was was selected based on its function as a knife.\n The only reason the knife would move towards a key is that a good knife is close to a functional key. That is co-option.\n \n Co-option assumes something about the first function but it does not cause genetic guidance towards the second, it simply states that guidance of the first is identical to movement towards the second.\n \n \nI disagree for the following reasons:\n \n 1. A5 is attained by random mutation of A4 irrespective of whether its function is conceptually similar.\nI have said that there is no guidance over one mutation.\n \n2. A5 becomes abundant/fixed through the same process (differential reproductive rates) irrespective of whether its function is conceptually similar.\nYou cannot include the end point in the range, if you say that you are measuring till A6 then A5 was locked due to similarity with A6. (the new function) Meaning that the locking of A5 is not measured if it is the end of the genetic movement being evaluated for guidance.\n \n In different words you have having the same problem as databed, when I speak about the formation of a system it is innately irrelevant to point out that after the function is formed it will not be lost due to natural selection. It is of course easy to see that formation is not a problem when something is already formed.\n My position states that the fact that A5 will be selected for does not affect the selection of A4 and all A(4-n) \n \n \n3. You do not possess any theory predicting the existence of an A5 proximate to A4 that would perform - in conjunction with its broader genetic and environmental context - the same function better.\nI believe we have switched variables here, by your paragraph containing \"function specific\" I assumed A5 was a different function. I will now change that (but from this point on) to A5 being merely an improvement to the A function.\n \n So what theory do I have predicting that there exists a modification to a system that will improve its function?\n \n Let's make one up right now, the theory of non-perfection states: \"Unless a biological system is perfectly adapted to its current environment there are modifications that will increase contextual adaptation.\"\n \n Now if you are talking about a theory that predicts that there will always be a slight likely change that will improve function I don't have one.\n \n In fact if you read Behe's book some of his examples, immune response in particular are specifically about IC improvements.\n \n Remember though I don't claim that the evolution of improvement is inevitable, simply that it is possible.\n \n The difference between my position on improvement and yours on novelty is that a small change to an existing function may be contextually beneficial to that function so guided mutation may exist, while in the case of novelty it cannot.\n \n I believe what you have tried to do here is draw a link between co-option and beneficial mutation. I ask why should co-option be expected and you ask why improving mutation should be expected.\n \n A clever trap but one I will not fall for, improving mutation can be expected by the fact that the function already exists so that if there is any mutation that will lead to a guided chain of improvement it can be happened upon. The existence of these chains is predicted by the detection of minute usefulness by natural selection\n \n If there is a fence and it is coded for by DNA, it is certain that the height of the fence is coded in the DNA, it is then likely that a change in the code may change the height. A change in height may affect the benefit provided by the function of the fence.\n \n Co-option is fundamentally different because the properties of non-existent systems do not already exist to be modified.\n There is no small mutation to a fence that will cause a gate to appear in it, co-option in this case would state that a pseudo gate was beneficial in a fence but not because it was a gate.\n \n That is the question that needs to be answered, we already know that there exist some novel functions that could help an organism, and we already know there exists some improvements that could help a system. What we don't know is why improvements have to be like novel functions.\n \n There is no similar question for improvements themselves, why would you ask \"why is an improvement an improvement?\"\n \n Again I do not contend that there always exists or must exist a beneficial improving mutation, but I do maintain that it is likely that intermediate steps on a road of improvement are themselves beneficial, while intermediate steps on a road to a new function are not likely to be beneficial.\n \n \nYou are therefore as reliant as I upon empirical evidence of the existence of that structure and pattern in the sequence-space of DNA.\nYes, but homology between variations in the same function are expected, it is this that is primary and logical and I believe (no disrespect intended) that it is this fact that you are attempting to harness to co-option.\n \n I see it in the way that the acid test was pointed out as an example of co-option. It was not an example of homology between different functions and systems but homology within the same function but different system.\n \n If there a thousand enzymes that slice up sugar; you can safely expect that all those enzymes will have something in common with each other under the assumption that there are not infinite ways to accomplish that function.\n That homology is contained within that function, now why would you expect any of those enzymes to be similar at all to a cyto-skeleton?\n \n \nHomologous genes serving different functions are just as powerful evidence of the structure my theory requires as homologous genes serving similar functions are of the existence of the patterns your theory requires.\nThere is no reason to expect homologous genes to serve different functions; there is reason to expect homologous genes to serve similar functions.\n \n That is the difference.\n \n You couldn't have summed up better the reason to expect similar genes to accomplish similar function, similar shape that is.\n \n Similar shape implies similar shape, not different shape.\n \n \nThis is due to Freedoms strategy of breaking posts up and nitpicking each phrase as it stands alone. I have complained about this before and I have a tendency to let a lot of things he says slide.\n\n You certainly aren't nitpicking right now are you?\n \nPeeling, you seem like an intelligent person. If you don't understand Freedom's invented terminology, it's because he doesn't want you to understand it. Once you understand it, you will realize how stupid it is. \nI want him to understand, I want you to understand.\n \nThis is why we are so far off topic in this thread. This thread is about ERV's in a host genome. Freedom has derailed this thread to focus on intangible concepts that only make sense to him; \nCheck out post 21, 24, 28 Don't ask questions if you don't want answers, don't make accusations if you don't want responses.\n \nit's hard to refute something that is undefined.\nThat's true, good thing I just defined it. Want to define evolution?\n \n It would be nice if Freedom would explain how ERV's are not evidence of evolution, or what he meant by - \nBecause it is evidence for common descent, common descent is already predicted by evolution and already practically proved by the fossil record, so it would be most accurate to say it is not new evidence for evolution.\n \nin a \"no-duh\" context\n It was a serious question, I haven't really met many creationists who wanted to argue with me (probably because I too am against evolution) and I want to know why they even care about arguing against common descent or evolution for that matter.\n \nI guess Freedom is claiming that God is performing his handiwork all the time in biology. If so, why deny the experimental results?\nThere you go, now why don't creationist just say that and be done with it?\n \nI really do think that this line of reasoning makes sense in Freedom's head, but that's only because he is a delusional Christian (maybe other) searching for a rational behind a belief he has known all his life. \nYou find rationale first then comes belief :)\n \nThese people are capable of believing anything as long as it supports the ideas some scholars wrote down two or three thousand years ago.

I am pretty sure he accepts the premise that the only quality of a mutation that really matters is whether it leads to an increase or decrease in genetic abundance. \n \n Freedom's main contention here is that once selection starts locking in mutations that improve some function, it would require a leap to bring forth a different function.

We may not have a satisfactory example of such a beneficial change but we also don't have millions of years and the entire Earth as a lab. \n \n I think there is a problem with the way you are wrapping your heads around this issue. This is due to defining a single target, Ai. Maybe you are trying to define how Ai came about, but by doing this you are ignoring the fact that Ai could have been Aj with a similar function, identical function, or a totally different function. For instance, maybe Ai helps an organism stick to rocks. This seems unlikely until you consider that if Ai had been Aj, then the organism would have been lofting with the current. You may look at this and consider it just as unlikely without ever considering that you need to factor in the alternative possibility thus doubling the considered outcomes and, as a result, doubling whatever probability you have concluded. Take into account that billions of different combinations of base pairs can probably achieve the same function and that that function could have been another function and suddenly your odds are looking a lot more optimistic. \n \n I know you are picking at a certain flaw in Freedom's logic and probably realize that this argument isn't really relevant since in every instance you pick a definite outcome, but why not focus on Freedom's refusal to accept that a random mutation can bring about a beneficial change in function?",

   "I think there is a problem with the way you are wrapping your heads around this issue. This is due to defining a single target, Ai.\n\n Ah, no :) That's what I thought Freedom was doing to begin with, too (after all, that's the standard mistake people make, right?), but that's not it at all - which is why you've been arguing past each other for the last few pages.\n \nMaybe you are trying to define how Ai came about, but by doing this you are ignoring the fact that Ai could have been Aj with a similar function, identical function, or a totally different function. \n\n I'm not ignoring that fact, and nor is Freedom; trust me on this.\n \nFor instance, maybe Ai helps an organism stick to rocks. This seems unlikely until you consider that if Ai had been Aj, then the organism would have been lofting with the current.\n\n I completely agree, but that's not relevant to Freedom's point either.\n \n His argument is that regardless of what we happen to see - Ai or Aj - we can only legitimately use natural selection to explain its evolution from A if A serves the same function. But not for the reason you think:\n \nwhy not focus on Freedom's refusal to accept that a random mutation can bring about a beneficial change in function?\n\n He doesn't refuse to accept that. That's what you have to appreciate before you can truly get to grips with his argument. In your defence, I think he could state his position a lot more clearly than he has - and even then, it remains flawed.\n \n Still, he isn't saying such mutations can't happen. What he's saying is that relying on such events doesn't count as an explanation. Let me try to elaborate.\n \n RM+NS has the power to explain how a series of incremental functional genetic improvements are realised. But it doesn't in itself explain the proximity in genetic sequence-space of each increment. It explains how the fitness landscape is traversed, but not its topology. Are you with me?\n \n Now, what Freedom's saying is that, starting from first principles and not presuming genetic sequence space to possess any unusual properties, it's... if not inevitable then at least acceptably likely that given a functional sequence A there will be a sequence Ai somewhere nearby (let's say ten mutations distant) that performs the same function rather better. In other words, he sees similar sequences having the same function to be a safe assumption. He also sees it as safe to assume that, in general, approaching Ai from A will increase fitness: in other words there is a good chance of there being a gradient RM+NS can traverse as opposed to an impassable gulf. And (if I have understood him correctly) he has formalised this principle - the existence of a smooth gradient - as 'guided evolution'.\n \n Still with me?\n \n Now we come to genetic changes yielding beneficial, novel functions. Let's call such a sequence Aj, and assume that it too lies some ten mutations distant from our already-realised sequence A.\n \n How can we get from A to Aj? According to Freedom, we cannot apply the principle of guided evolution because A and Aj do different things: Aj is the first point at which the novel function kicks in at all, so unlike between A and Ai we cannot expect a smooth gradient to exist that is capable of guiding RM+NS from A to Aj. The best we can hope for is that a gradient leading from A to some Ai happens to pass very close to Aj.\n \n According to Freedom, while this might happen on rare occasions, we can't expect it to be true sufficiently often for evolution to be able to explain all life's diversity unless we assume the topology of gene sequence space has some specific and unusual properties. At which point, the question of how life's diversity emerged becomes 'how did those specific and unusual properties come about?'\n \n I have to go now; I'll come back tomorrow and we can talk further.",

The best we can hope for is that a gradient leading from A to some Ai happens to pass very close to Aj.\n\n \n I see. And you are of course arguing that going from Ax to Ai is no different from going from Ax to Aj where Aj is a new function and very similar to Ax. Got it.\n \n But I don't think Freedom's definition of guided mutation is the only means by which a novel function can emerge. Sometimes there is a very fuzzy line or smooth gradient that can exist between two functions. Where would you draw the line between of functions of crawling and climbing? Between breaking down soil and breaking down wood? Between pulling oxygen from water as opposed to oxygen from air? This is just my first point: with the current line of argument, there is the assumption that a difference in function must be absolute.\n \n My second point point boils down to this: whether or not you accept this as an explanation (Ai mutates into Aj) still only relies on one question: does it or does it not happen naturally? Evolution does not concern itself with how mutations occur, only that mutations occur to feed its process. We look at experiments and use empirical suggestions to conclude that yes, it does happen naturally. Why not focus on showing this.\n \n Last point - There is no need to define how selection can (and must according to Freedom's theory) result in a smooth gradient of slight changes between two functions. It has not been demonstrated that this is necessary. It is obviously necessary that some form of an appendage exist before a wing can evolve, but when we look at bacteria, which is what we've really been focusing on, the sudden emergence of a new function, however primitive at first, can be seen to happen all the time. We see drug resistances, new strains, etc etc emerging and these are all linked to slight changes in the DNA that can be associated with sometimes a single mutation and subsequent improvements. While these changes usually inhibit some other function, sometimes they really are just a new sequences emerging from the trash heap of unused junk DNA. So there it is, no co-option, just a fluke.\n \n I guess the problem I am having with the current argument is that some assumptions have been made that seem pretty bold to me. There are too many unknowns that exist in the processes of mutation and many more unknowns in just how information is stored and read from DNA for us to be making an assumption that the only way a new function can be built is from the lineage of a previous function and that this is inherently too unlikely to account for all the variations we see in biology. \n \n Again however, I feel that we are ignoring that a leap from Ai to Aj (using the previous notation) could just as easily have been a leap to Aa, Ab, Ac, Ad...Az, Aaa, Abb etc. To focus on the odds of a single sequence approaching a definite target through any mechanism ignores the fact that mutations can go in any direction and only after they occur can they be beneficially selected.",

Thus the conceptual analysis of selection/locking as being due to 'greater similarity' fails.\n\n \n Not if you substitute actual systems for these letters, blue is divergence from a red hammer. Let us pretend that blue has selection pressure.\n \n Then the mutation that caused the screwdriver to be blue is beneficial, yet it is not similar to the final point.\n \n Here is the key point, only when the divergence is exclusive to similarity is your point valid.

This is due to defining a single target, Ai.\n\n \n No one said there was only one form of an improved function; in fact I believe I indicated that all the intermediates between A and Ai were forms of improved function.\n \n \n Maybe you are trying to define how Ai came about, but by doing this you are ignoring the fact that Ai could have been Aj with a similar function, identical function, or a totally different function.\n\n Yes but by definition the last would fail the guided mutation test.\n \n \nFor instance, maybe Ai helps an organism stick to rocks. This seems unlikely until you consider that if Ai had been Aj,\nAlright I am getting a little confused with the variable terminology again. In my original example the capital letter indicated the function, the second lowercase or number was a subscript to identify a form of that function.\n \n I am then a little confused does this mean: the initial function seems unlikely until you consider that the improved function could be a different function?\n \n \n then the organism would have been lofting with the current. You may look at this and consider it just as unlikely without ever considering that you need to factor in the alternative possibility thus doubling the considered outcomes and, as a result, doubling whatever probability you have concluded. Take into account that billions of different combinations of base pairs can probably achieve the same function and that that function could have been another function and suddenly your odds are looking a lot more optimistic. \nYes once you assume that there is a co-option tree it is likely that novel function occurs, in fact it's somewhat inevitable.\n I have yet to see a real example of complete co-option.\n \n \nI know you are picking at a certain flaw in Freedom's logic and probably realize that this argument isn't really relevant since in every instance you pick a definite outcome, but why not focus on Freedom's refusal to accept that a random mutation can bring about a beneficial change in function?\n\n Because that is an appeal to chance, perhaps he is not willing to abandon the gradualist natural selection driven view of evolution for your luck based faith.\n \n\n I completely agree, but that's not relevant to Freedom's point either.\n\n What was he saying?\n \nStill, he isn't saying such mutations can't happen. What he's saying is that relying on such events doesn't count as an explanation. Let me try to elaborate.\n \n RM+NS has the power to explain how a series of incremental functional genetic improvements are realised. But it doesn't in itself explain the proximity in genetic sequence-space of each increment. It explains how the fitness landscape is traversed, but not its topology. Are you with me?\n \n Now, what Freedom's saying is that, starting from first principles and not presuming genetic sequence space to possess any unusual properties, it's... if not inevitable then at least acceptably likely that given a functional sequence A there will be a sequence Ai somewhere nearby (let's say ten mutations distant) that performs the same function rather better. In other words, he sees similar sequences having the same function to be a safe assumption. He also sees it as safe to assume that, in general, approaching Ai from A will increase fitness: in other words there is a good chance of there being a gradient RM+NS can traverse as opposed to an impassable gulf. And (if I have understood him correctly) he has formalised this principle - the existence of a smooth gradient - as 'guided evolution'.\nI thought I was clear, but that was truly succinct.\n \n I would like to clarify one point though, when speaking of similar physical functions (physical meaning not just the function but how it is accomplished) the similarity if not existence of other functional sequences near the original is guaranteed on first principles.\n \n Only by assuming that there are no variations of a system that will continue to function can you compare internal homology with external homology.\n That simply isn't the case and it's completely predictable.\n \n That would mean there is no such thing as neutral mutation, we know this isn't true.\n \n The only logic one would need to predict it is \"does similar genetic code produce similar structure\", yes of course it does, because we know that the systems structure is directly dependant on its genetic code.\n \n If similar genetic code produces similar structure then any group of structures that performs a function is going to have a corresponding group of DNA sequences which performs that function necessarily in the same differential distribution as the structures themselves.\n \n I hope that is abundantly clear how it is a fundamentally different assumption that these groups are connecting by saying any group of structures has multiple functions.\n \n While this may be true and almost certainly is in some cases there is no fundamental (first principle as you put it) reason to believe that this is the case.\n \n Therefore we are just looking at odds.\n \n You don't calculate the odds of similarity being similar. You may calculate the odds of things being similar.\n \n \nNow we come to genetic changes yielding beneficial, novel functions. Let's call such a sequence Aj, and assume that it too lies some ten mutations distant from our already-realised sequence A.\n\n \n \nHow can we get from A to Aj? According to Freedom, we cannot apply the principle of guided evolution because A and Aj do different things: Aj is the first point at which the novel function kicks in at all, so unlike between A and Ai we cannot expect a smooth gradient to exist that is capable of guiding RM+NS from A to Aj. The best we can hope for is that a gradient leading from A to some Ai happens to pass very close to Aj.\nYes very accurate, again I have a slight clarification. You can apply the principle of guided mutation but it will return the result that A to Aj is not guided.\n \nAccording to Freedom, while this might happen on rare occasions, we can't expect it to be true sufficiently often for evolution to be able to explain all life's diversity unless we assume the topology of gene sequence space has some specific and unusual properties. At which point, the question of how life's diversity emerged becomes 'how did those specific and unusual properties come about?'\nYes\n \n \nI see. And you are of course arguing that going from Ax to Ai is no different from going from Ax to Aj where Aj is a new function and very similar to Ax. Got it.\nI don't believe so; by understanding the concept of guided mutation he has already taken as a premise that it is different.\n \n I believe his argument will be that co-option is predicted in the same way internal-functional homology is (that is homology within the same physical function)\n \nBut I don't think Freedom's definition of guided mutation is the only means by which a novel function can emerge.\nIt's the only means by which it can emerge without pure chance.\n \n What I have defined as guided mutation is the result of the mechanism of evolution; it is instinctively known that guided mutation is the process of evolution when a student first reads about random mutation and natural selection working together to change genetic code for benefit.\n \n \nSometimes there is a very fuzzy line or smooth gradient that can exist between two functions. Where would you draw the line between of functions of crawling and climbing?\n\n \n None, they are not different functions but degrees of the same.\n Just like there is nowhere to draw the line between flying and gliding.\n This is precisely why my assumption that movement towards Ai is beneficial the whole way.\n \n When attempting to explain flight what point between gliding and flying would you pick out where stronger or larger wings did not grant benefit?\n \n That is why the idea of IC meant little to Darwin; he never found these lines.\n Behe has pointed out the long overdue observation that in molecular machinery there is no room for this fuzziness between functions but only between forms of the same function.\n \n Where would I draw the line between gliding and flying? Nowhere; where would I draw the line between flagellum and a secretory system? At a functional flagellum.\n \n Better gliders are better flyers, better secretory systems are not better flagellums, there is no reason to expect it either.\n \n \n Between breaking down soil and breaking down wood?\n\n \n If by soil you mean organic material, I guess the ability to dissolve cellulose.\n \n Between pulling oxygen from water as opposed to oxygen from air?\n\n By the machinery that can remove the oxygen from a water molecule\n \n This is just my first point: with the current line of argument, there is the assumption that a difference in function must be absolute.\n\n No, that such absolute differences exist.\n \nMy second point point boils down to this: whether or not you accept this as an explanation (Ai mutates into Aj) still only relies on one question: does it or does it not happen naturally? Evolution does not concern itself with how mutations occur, only that mutations occur to feed its process. We look at experiments and use empirical suggestions to conclude that yes, it does happen naturally. Why not focus on showing this.\nIs that what your question boils down to? I will answer it.\n Premise - Function exists and was at one time novel\n Premise - Magic is not a possibility\n Conclusion - Novel function arises naturally\n Not that hard.\n \nLast point - There is no need to define how selection can (and must according to Freedom's theory) result in a smooth gradient of slight changes between two functions. It has not been demonstrated that this is necessary. It is obviously necessary that some form of an appendage exist before a wing can evolve, but when we look at bacteria, which is what we've really been focusing on, the sudden emergence of a new function, however primitive at first, can be seen to happen all the time.\nIt does not happen all the time, it has not been seen to happen all the time.\n \n We see drug resistances, new strains, etc etc emerging and these are all linked to slight changes in the DNA that can be associated with sometimes a single mutation and subsequent improvements. While these changes usually inhibit some other function, sometimes they really are just a new sequences emerging from the trash heap of unused junk DNA. So there it is, no co-option, just a fluke.\nPost it.\n \n Calling this evolution is like calling the fact that mountains are shaped generally like triangles is a explanation for the pyramids.\n \n Our immune system literally uses recombination (a type of random protein production) to create anti-bodies.\n \n It is not novel functionality every time it adapts to an invader.\n \n\n I guess the problem I am having with the current argument is that some assumptions have been made that seem pretty bold to me.\n\n Yes, like there has got to exist a co-option tree.\n \n There are too many unknowns that exist in the processes of mutation and many more unknowns in just how information is stored and read from DNA for us to be making an assumption that the only way a new function can be built is from the lineage of a previous function and that this is inherently too unlikely to account for all the variations we see in biology. \nMy final conclusion is ignorance you know.\n \nAgain however, I feel that we are ignoring that a leap from Ai to Aj (using the previous notation) could just as easily have been a leap to Aa, Ab, Ac, Ad...Az, Aaa, Abb etc. To focus on the odds of a single sequence approaching a definite target through any mechanism ignores the fact that mutations can go in any direction and only after they occur can they be beneficially selected.\nAppeal to chance",

   "They are different functions. Crawling is horizontal, climbing is vertical. \n\n Do they have the same selection pressure?\n \nSome species can pull oxygen from air and water with the exact same machinery, yet one is not even necessary. \n\n You mean that the same proteins isolate oxygen from dioxygen and H2O? Or that the same intake system is used?\n \n \nMy point is that all functions have some sort of slightly different function that could be compounded until the first is no longer similar to the original.\n\n Many to be sure.\n \n I just ask you remember the law of non-contradiction. You cannot leave a function behind without leaving it behind.\n \n If you can define a difference then you have defined the line.\n \n It is possible that functions are not mutually exclusive to other functions, it is possible that they have many like selective pressures.\n \n It is predicted that they have like selective pressures if the reasons for these pressures are the same.\n \n Take for instance your crawling climbing, wait! I said it wasn't a different function, because when I heard them I immediately thought of limb driven locomotion as a function which you were slicing up.\n \n We were both right, and I will explain why. Many functions will have more specific applications/ sub-functions, this does not mean they have co-option. Co-option if you remember requires that selection for is not required.\n \n So take for instance your crawling climbing example, what selection pressures do they have in common? what selection pressures are different?\n \n Undoubtedly bigger muscles are useful for both, bigger muscles can be said to be the target of guided mutation for all limb based locomotion.\n \n What about claws? claws are definitely helpful for climbing, and neutral for crawling (assuming the animal is not hunting or something). That is a selection pressure or target of guided mutation for climbers.\n \n How about hoofs? those screw up climbing pretty good, positive SP for crawlers negative for climbers.\n \n When attempting to explain huge muscles one only needs to take a point of smaller mussels and apply the guided mutation test.\n \n At all the points of change on the muscle genes was the mutation selected for because the mussels were bigger? (were they selected due to similarity to an arbitrary Ai=huge mussels)\n \n Now let's talk about a change in function, suppose an animal was a crawler and had no claws.\n \n Then we see later in the fossil record it had claws and started climbing. Well how did it get the claws?\n \n Well let's apply the guided mutation test, at every point of genetic change on the genes for the ends of the feet which made them more clawlike (bear with the inaccuracy here) was the change selected for because it was similar to Ai = Good climbing claws?\n \n Yes again.\n \n Now suppose that the animal couldn't climb without it's claws?\n \n You see if you can't tell the huge change that factor introduced, the difference that it makes to any evolutionary explanation then you still haven't understood what I have said.\n \n If it couldn't climb without it's claws it must be, yes must be this is a law formed by the definition of guided mutation; that at each step the larger claws were not selected for because they were similar to good climbing claws.\n \n How could they be, the animal didn't climb there can be no selection pressure for climbing one way or another.\n \n You are obliged to say one of two things:[*]The animal had selection pressure for claws, that happened to work for climbing[*]The animal got extremely lucky and claws good enough for climbing sprung forth by chance.\n Those are respectively co-option and an appeal to chance. \n \n Or are they?\n \n You see if the animal had selection pressure for claws for hunting, that would have co-option for claws for climbing.\n \n If you looked at the reason claws not good climbing claws just claws appeared you would have again guided mutation.\n \n A claw is a claw, of course claws have co-option with claws of various types.\n \n Through this analysis you can see that what was being called co-option is in fact predicted by the same homology that predicts improvement in function.\n \n It is very easy to become confused into thinking that co-option between sub functions which is predicted is the same as co-option between functions with no categorical connection which are not predicted.\n \n As you get to the more basic functions of cells and life the categorical over functions become less and less, eventually they disappear and you just have functions.\n \n Claws have predicted homology with specialty claws.\n \n Claws will pass the guided mutation test given any sub-function as a target, will secretory systems and any intermediate to a flagellum do the same with a flagellum as the target?\n \n \nThat is the mechanism behind co-option. You contend Darwin wasn't concerned with IC because he couldn't see the lines. I still don't see these lines.\n\n \n What intermediate between a functional flagellum and what ever you want to designate as it's non-flagllar precursor has selection pressure for swimming?\n \n That's the line, an intermediate on anatomical level can be easily imagined and their selective benefits are clear.\n \n \n\n I am not constrained just because I don't have the information to precisely explain the process and phases some structure went through. \n\n You are constrained by me to admit you don't have the information to precisely explain the process.\n \n My orginal contention was little more than that.\n \n \nYou have attempted to invent a law that evolution must follow. You give it a name, guided mutation.\n\n That is evolution, your version is unbound by laws but not my laws, reality's.\n \n \nYou've made it quite elegant, but as soon as you introduce the part where guided mutation cannot result in a change in function you start to sound like a Bible kook because you cannot tell us why this part must be included.\n\n If you cannot see that once you stop guiding mutation it is unguided, and that once it is unguided it is random, and that once it is random it is unpredictable, and once it is unpredictable it cannot be a prediction of a theory.... well all I have to say is that you have a book and your a kook about it but it isn't the Bible.\n \n \n You have accused us of appealing to odds, when your entire premise is that the odds are too small.\n\n Appealing to the odds to prove a positive is fallacious, appealing to odds disprove an appeal to odds is not.\n \n Joe contends that there is a statue of liberty formed by natural processes on another planet somewhere.\n \n Tom says that just isn't likely.\n \n Joe says that there is a tiny chance and that given the vastness of the universe that chance is greatly increased.\n \n Tom says you can't appeal to odds to prove something exists.\n \n Joe says \"well you just said it isn't likely aren't you appealing to odds?\"\n \n \nAgain, you have not shown that you have even an inkling of understanding of what the odds actually are.\n\n \n They are great, the 20 protein example was just a taste.

   "My point was that you are making up your own rules. You are requiring guided mutation and are defining guided mutation as small linear changes characterized by a selection force that is already in place. This requires that you accept that the selection pressure is hovering over only picking mutations that improve an already existing function. \n \n I made a couple of points that point out flaws in the assumptions you have made - \n \n First, you assume that a change in function must be absolute. I contend that this is wrong. A simple example, imagine a fish that has found its niche on the sea bottom. At some point it becomes beneficial to walk instead of swim since this does not disturb the silt and allows the fish to find its prey. Its fins become modified to allow for better walking and eventually it begins to walk out of the water since its tide pools are drying up. Soon it becomes a good land crawler. At some point it becomes beneficial for the fish (now an amphibian) do dig into the mud so it develops claws for digging. Later as the mud begins to dry out, or it ventures further from its pools, it becomes beneficial to climb. Turns out the same claws it used for digging also make for good climbing. So now you have what was a good swimmer becoming a good climber. I'm pretty sure you will accept this as feasible, right? But what if I removed any information we have on how it was once a digger or once a sea bottom walker. By your definition of guided mutation, there is no way for the fish to ever make it and this creature will fail your test and you will therefore contend that evolution does not explain how climbing came about. You can't pick and choose which evolution can explain based solely on what information you have available. \n \n My second point. You keep bringing up odds saying that the chances of co-option bringing two functions close enough together cannot account for all the diversity we see in nature. Back to the fish - lets say the same fish that was beginning to walk on the sea bottom diverged from its tide pool cousins and decided to stay in deeper water. Whats to stop it from taking advantage of totally different evolutionary pressures? Lets say instead of walking fins, it developed a more streamlined shape and used speed in the deeper less silt ridden waters. Turns out, there is a second, totally different route that leads to success. So if your going to say either route by itself is unlikely, you have to take into account that both are possible. Maybe one of them could have lead to extinction, maybe neither, maybe both. Evolution predicts that the only ones we will see today are the ones that lead to success. All the failures are somehow missing from any of your odds calculations. \n \n I have a third, less concrete point as well. You are assuming that new features must be built off of previously existing, previously functional structures. You contend that there must be a defined path of functions and it must be controlled by selection pressure. This is actually not true. This assumption implies that selection drives mutation, but in reality, selection's only job is to make beneficial mutations abundant. There are no rules that say a mutation cannot be selected (or occur according to you) unless it improves some function that can only be explained by previous selection events. There are thousands of dead gene sequences in any genome that can be rearranged, duplicated, combined, etc to form a function that biological history has likely never seen before. \n \n You say the burden of proof is on the evolutionist. I show you fossil evidence, common DNA lineages in similar species, homologous genes that have different functions, common ERV's in completely different species, etc - this list goes on and on. If you want to show evolution to be false, I think the ball is in your court. In addition, if you choose to accept that all of this evidence is the result of common decent and somehow not evolution, I will label you a crackpot and give up :(\n \n In the meantime, here is a paper outlining homologous genes associated with the flagellum and many other structures found in modern bacteria and archae. It contains many examples of divergence and co-option. While the authors goal is to rebut IC, it does show a feasible pathway evolution could have taken. It also shows several different examples of flagellum evolution as well the complexity in which organism can mutate given the time to do so. (Don't get me wrong, most of this is over my head since I have no clue what the difference between a FliC and a FliD is and don't have the time or motivation to research it.)\n \n http://saier-144-51.ucsd.edu/~saier/bimm130/reading130/week4/paper4c.pdf",

In the alphabetical sequence space of english words, for instance, sequence homology does not imply functional homology. Light? Excuse me, I mean 'Right?' :) In mathematical terms, mappings which preserve homologies are in the profound minority. We can only infer it to be the case with DNA through observation. Which of course ties in with the big issue as expressed in 1: your assumption - contrary to the abundant evidence of genetic homologies - that functionality becomes prohibitively discrete at the sub-cellular level.\n \nClaws have predicted homology with specialty claws.\n\n As finished products, maybe; it's easy to imagine gradually morphing one kind of claw into another. But evolution doesn't take place at the finished product level, it takes place at the level of genes regulating the developmental process.

   "My point was that you are making up your own rules.\n\n Yes, so did Darwin and Behe.\n \nYou are requiring guided mutation and are defining guided mutation as small linear changes characterized by a selection force that is already in place.\n\n Complete your thought, that you are defining mutation that is not based on a selection force that exists. What would you like to call that except unguided mutation?\n \n In the story you just wrote, in all the evolution stories I have read the same leap is used \"a selection force exists, therefore the improvement appeared.\"\n \n \nThis requires that you accept that the selection pressure is hovering over only picking mutations that improve an already existing function. \n\n \n You got it; I have said it many times.\n \n You haven't taken an opposing position explicitly because you can't; the opposing position would be: \"my position does not require that selection pressure affects only functions that already exist\"\n Or\n \"My position allows that selection pressure affects some functions that don't exist\"\n \n \nI made a couple of points that point out flaws in the assumptions you have made - \n First, you assume that a change in function must be absolute. I contend that this is wrong.\n\n \n Change in function is absolute if it changes; the best you can hope for is this change is gradual.\n \n I really shouldn't have to prove these things, they are self-evident. A functional structure can gain a new function without losing an old one but that is not change it is addition, in fact any case where the original function is not lost is not a case of change in function. If the original function is lost that is an absolute change.\n \n \nA simple example, imagine a fish that has found its niche on the sea bottom. At some point it becomes beneficial to walk instead of swim since this does not disturb the silt and allows the fish to find its prey. Its fins become modified to allow for better walking \n\n Oh I was hoping I was going to get at one of these documentary flybys!\n \n Beautiful example Data, at least of the thinking that fools most people, \"it becomes beneficial... it's fins become modified to allow for better walking\"\n \n Selection pressure exists, therefore improvement is made.\n \n Secondly you also imply one of my other requirements for natural selection, a requirement which you rejected vehemently.\n \n The requirement that function already exist for guided mutation.\n \n You can't help it, not that you should though. \"To allow for better walking\"; Tell me doesn't better walking mean that the fish can walk?\n \n Did you mean \"its fins become modified to be able to walk\"?\n \n Can that be a guided mutation series?\n \n \nand eventually it begins to walk out of the water since its tide pools are drying up. Soon it becomes a good land crawler.\nSo evolution; sensing that the best solution to drying tide pools is aerobic respiration made it happen....\n \n \nAt some point it becomes beneficial for the fish (now an amphibian) do dig into the mud so it develops claws for digging.\nGuided selection for claws presupposing that the fish/amphibian can dig in the mud AND that it has something that can be modified to produce claws.\n \n \n Later as the mud begins to dry out, or it ventures further from its pools, it becomes beneficial to climb. Turns out the same claws it used for digging also make for good climbing. So now you have what was a good swimmer becoming a good climber.\n\n Again co-option within the same structure function group is predicted.\n \n Claws can be used to climb and dig, you know many disaccharide enzymes are used to break down many disaccharides.\n \n In your story you \"evolved\" claws used natural selection to optimize them for climbing and expected the co-option between different kinds of claws to impress upon me evolution's ability to create novelty.\n \n Please Databed, this sounds overdramatic but open your mind; everything you have said fit perfectly into my stereotype of evolutionary thought.\n \n \n I'm pretty sure you will accept this as feasible, right?\n\n Eh no.\n \n \nBut what if I removed any information we have on how it was once a digger or once a sea bottom walker. By your definition of guided mutation, there is no way for the fish to ever make it and this creature will fail your test and you will therefore contend that evolution does not explain how climbing came about. You can't pick and choose which evolution can explain based solely on what information you have available. \n\n Correct, you can't pass the test after you cross selection domains, Therefore climbing claws were not selected for as a bottom dwelling fish.\n \n If I was given no information about the intermediates I could have still predicted the nature problems I pointed out if not the exact details using \"my new rules\" (which are merely the clarified implications of evolutionary theory).\n \n If there is not selection for then any movement towards is a matter of chance.\n \n It is certainly a clever tactic to set up a situation in which you have already placed all selection pressures in the right order and right time to accomplish your co-option.\n \n Yet it was still not enough, the robustness of guided selection analysis is impervious. The only rational evolutionary story that can be told that will defeat it will contain a co-option tree, one that only exists in the mind of the story teller.\n \n For instance, what if fins that happened to work like legs were evolved from normal fins, then it would not be a problem for it to start walking on the silt.\n What if?......\n \n What if the fish had a structure that was capable of minimal digging for some other reason, then it could have dug in the mud.\n What if?......\n \n The fundamental fallacy of evolutionist is using circular reasoning, since evolution must be true (ahhh can't let the creationist have any ammo) these if's become \"must have been s.\"\n \n A thousand stories just as colorful could be created for every instance in which the selection pressures were nothing like the ones you described.\n That wouldn't prove anything either, a lack of knowledge cannot become knowledge; the fact that you believed it happened and are satisfied with a story that shows it is not impossible is not evidence for someone who did not believe it happened.\n \n A set of beliefs in which facts are presupposed to be true for any reason, is an example of faith.\n \n No real scientific theory requires you accept it before it can be proven, this is not a real scientific theory.\n \n Most importantly though the examples of IC which best illustrate the failing of evolution to explain structures are basic biochemical systems.\n \n \nMy second point. You keep bringing up odds saying that the chances of co-option bringing two functions close enough together cannot account for all the diversity we see in nature. Back to the fish - lets say the same fish that was beginning to walk on the sea bottom diverged from its tide pool cousins and decided to stay in deeper water.\n\n If I said diversity (I don't believe I did) I apologize for miss wording. Evolution as it stands excels at explaining diversity.\n \n \nWhats to stop it from taking advantage of totally different evolutionary pressures? Lets say instead of walking fins, it developed a more streamlined shape and used speed in the deeper less silt ridden waters. Turns out, there is a second, totally different route that leads to success. So if your going to say either route by itself is unlikely, you have to take into account that both are possible. Maybe one of them could have lead to extinction, maybe neither, maybe both. Evolution predicts that the only ones we will see today are the ones that lead to success. All the failures are somehow missing from any of your odds calculations. \nFailures don't increase the odds, that mistake #1 in statistics. Toss a coin 6000 times, suppose it was tails 6000 times.\n \n Is the next time you flip it not 50/50?\n \n Is the fact that it was 50/50 at each toss somehow a explanation as to the incredible coincidence of 6000 tails.\n \n \nI have a third, less concrete point as well. You are assuming that new features must be built off of previously existing, previously functional structures. You contend that there must be a defined path of functions and it must be controlled by selection pressure. This is actually not true. This assumption implies that selection drives mutation, but in reality, selection's only job is to make beneficial mutations abundant.

There are thousands of dead gene sequences in any genome that can be rearranged, duplicated, combined, etc to form a function that biological history has likely never seen before. \nAny other assumption is an appeal to chance.\n \nYou say the burden of proof is on the evolutionist. I show you fossil evidence, common DNA lineages in similar species, homologous genes that have different functions, common ERV's in completely different species, etc - this list goes on and on. If you want to show evolution to be false, I think the ball is in your court. In addition, if you choose to accept that all of this evidence is the result of common decent and somehow not evolution, I will label you a crackpot and give up :(\nI disagree; you are of course free to give up.\n \n I have every epistemological blunder in history telling me to not believe something that is contradiction with facts or lacks non-circumstantial evidence.\n \n Let me ask you, if you had a very convincing angel come to you and tell you God is real and you should be a Christian wouldn't your first instinct be to look for the camera?\n \n Why when you have evidence of a glowing angel right before you?\n The same standard that you would be held to by a Christian in this situation you hold me to in face of the evidence you speak of.\n \n If the thing someone is trying to prove is self-contradictory there can be no amount of inferential evidence that is sufficient for a rational mind.\n \n Deductive evidence would force you to admit you understand something incorrectly but nothing else.\n \n So I say again evidence for common decent is not proof of any particular cause of common descent.\n \n Evolution as you hold it contradicts it's principle of gradual selection in your attempts to redefine it. Both gradual and selection are contradicted are more fundamental principles of theoretical method, in which you abandon the idea that a method is even needed, when you assert that simply because there is no law preventing extremely lucky occurrences, no force keeping systems from taking any ordered form that one need simply multiply the odds until it seems plausible, there needs not be selection to form useful structure, merely chance.\n \n No experiments to prove evolution have even been undertaken much less succeeded at doing so, therefore any attempt to suggest this debate is anything but theoretical in nature will fail.\n \n I will not be convinced until my understanding of probability or the theory changes OR evolution is proved, the latter necessitating the former.\n \n \nIn the meantime, here is a paper outlining homologous genes associated with the flagellum and many other structures found in modern bacteria and archae.

Our knowledge of biology is a first principle of theories of biology.\n \n My statement did not mean that every divergence from a code set will have a corresponding divergence in function, merely that if the same function is accomplished in the same way, the two code sequences will have homology (with respect to the peptides coded for).\n \n You can break a function with a single base pair change, so a useless set of DNA has great homology with a functional set.\n \n \nWhich of course ties in with the big issue as expressed in 1: your assumption - contrary to the abundant evidence of genetic homologies - that functionality becomes prohibitively discrete at the sub-cellular level.\n The observation in concert with evidence of genetic homologies is correct.\n As finished products, maybe; it's easy to imagine gradually morphing one kind of claw into another.

   "Since the basis of your argument is simple odds, lets focus on this.\n\n No my argument was based on the defeat of natural selection as a creator of novel function, you were then forced to appeal to odds and now the basis of my argument against that appeal is odds.\n \n \nThat's not what I said. You base your argument on the fact that a single mutation that results in new function is rare. I agree with you.\n\n rare is an understatement.\n \n \nBut you continually ignore the fact that there are billions upon billions of mutations that fail to result in novel function and don't show up on your radar.\n\n Meaning?\n \nThis does change the odds. These are trials. It may be unlikely to win a lottery, but if you buy all 72 million or so possible numbers, it becomes inevitable. 71,999,999 of the numbers don't get any attention in your mind. \n\n That is because as peeling said previously the odds that someone will win the lottery are 100%\n \n The odds that some mutation will create novel function is not.\n \n You are proving that I was completly right when I said you were applying statistical analysis incorrectly and committing a begging the question fallacy by taking the assumption that it is inevitable once you consider all mutation events.\n \n Now let's take a proper statistical analogy, a lottery has certainty in it so it is not a proper analogy.\n \n flipping a coin never has certainty in it.\n \n So I ask you, how many times can I flip and get heads before the odds of the next flip are not 50/50? \n \n \nWow, high school probability is going to bring me down now. Nice try, but this is a total misrepresentation of what I said. \n\n Not from what you just said.\n \n \n \nWere not looking for the Statue of Liberty. Were looking for anything intelligible (analogous to genetic code that makes sense). There in lies another problem with your odds calculations. You require that what exists be exactly what we calculate the odds on. Look here:\n List of rock formations that resemble human beings - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n It is not a failing, you find the statue of liberty you calculate the odds that it formed naturally. We find life we calculate the odds that it formed naturally.\n \n The only failing is in thinking that the odds improve because of your conceptual connections. (remember that one)\n \n \nSurely you can see what I mean. It was pure chance that this part of my analogy was fulfilled, but it illustrates my point perfectly.\n\n What?\n \n Do you actually believe rock formations that looks like faces explain a statue of liberty rock?\n \n I really don't believe you see a difference between a random event and a predicted event.\n \n I can't believe you can compare events with higher likelihoods to ones with lower likelihoods and with a straight face imply the former effects the latter.",

   "First, let me say I am an amateur. What I am trying to say is, if apes and humans are of the same nature, then evolution makes sense, because we are just another species. If humans and apes are of a different nature, that differnce must extend beyond the potential of apes. For example, matter is created from energy, but matter is of a different nature. Even if we know the circumstances of how energy transforms into matter, we will never know why. Energy has the potential to transform itself into quarks, etc. but does not have the potential to change into a proton. Thus energy and matter are of a different nature. \n \n If we look back to the beginning of the universe the following patterns can be observed: something exists (quarks, etc.), this something has a potential on what it can do, once that potential is recognized, conditions are right for a quantum leap, once the leap is made, something of a different nature is created (protons, electrons, etc) and the cycle is renewed. The specifics of this pattern are not relevant to the argument. The important thing is that things are of a different nature, and we cannot assume we are a the end of this process. This argument becomes must more interesting when you look at things of a more complex nature; life, awareness, etc. In these areas we can see that at inception, life for example was relatively simple, life had to become much more complex for awareness to develop. While awareness is dependent on life, it is of a different nature.",

If we could ask them, and they could understand the question, they would certainly claim to be self aware.

Since this force, so far at least, can only be understand using antidotal evidence, I am just not sure what it is. Briefly, I believe that at some point, the potential of life and awareness was recognized and a kind of quantum leap took place and the result (humans) was created and we are of a different nature. It fits in with other changes that have occurred in the history of the universe \n \n One other note. This is not a theory, doctrine in the conventional sense. It merely provides a point of view which will alter the way we view things. Of course, my explanation sucks though.",

   "First, let me say I am an amateur. What I am trying to say is, if apes and humans are of the same nature, then evolution makes sense, because we are just another species. If humans and apes are of a different nature, that differnce must extend beyond the potential of apes. For example, matter is created from energy, but matter is of a different nature. Even if we know the circumstances of how energy transforms into matter, we will never know why. Energy has the potential to transform itself into quarks, etc. but does not have the potential to change into a proton. Thus energy and matter are of a different nature. \n \n If we look back to the beginning of the universe the following patterns can be observed: something exists (quarks, etc.), this something has a potential on what it can do, once that potential is recognized, conditions are right for a quantum leap, once the leap is made, something of a different nature is created (protons, electrons, etc) and the cycle is renewed. The specifics of this pattern are not relevant to the argument. The important thing is that things are of a different nature, and we cannot assume we are a the end of this process. This argument becomes must more interesting when you look at things of a more complex nature; life, awareness, etc. In these areas we can see that at inception, life for example was relatively simple, life had to become much more complex for awareness to develop. While awareness is dependent on life, it is of a different nature.\n\n \nWhat we see throughout the history of the universe is a continuous cycle of things becoming more complex and things of a different nature being created.\n \n When you look at humans and apes as being of a different nature, some quantum leap had to have occurred. While the physical (common usage) human may have evolved from ape, that essense of what makes humans human occurred in a much different manner. Comparing the DNA of humans and apes tells us nothing about the differences of the two. That which makes humans human does not reside in the physical self, it is of another nature. So the creationist are right in concept at least. \n \n In short the limited theory of quantum potential simply contends the nature of our existence is to recognize our potential, to prepare for the next quantum leap. Once that idea is internalized, one can see how limited our current views are.\n\n I see what you are saying, on a very abstract level it makes perfect since. On that same level of abstractness the fact that we exist and we did not always exist is proof that our existence was formed and proof that you are right.\n \n However I disagree that this is the question and answer we are talking about here. I was arguing specifically about the assertions of the common view of evolutionary theory and it's inconsistency, I was not attempting to make any philosophical points or discover the nature of the universe.\n \n You are right that we do not know why forces, matter, and energy exist and that it is a philosophical question. I would like to know how you would convert this 'quantum leap' which sounds about as mystical as it gets to an actual theory.\n \n None the less this concept is very popular in people's sub-consciousness I have seen it in fiction many times.\n About the nature of humans, I don&#8217;t think the creationist or you are right in saying what makes us human &#8216;does not reside in the physical self&#8217;. To exist is to be physical, the idea of spirituality is the result of faith, and it injects a state of pseudo-existence for concepts to float in-between total fiction and the real world.\n \n Such a state does not exist&#8230; existence is a Boolean value. There are no degrees of realness. Therefore any attempt at forming a valid spirituality must include physical existence composed of as of yet undetectable substance, but a substance none the less and one that follows laws as all other matter and energy does.\n \nYou've got it backwards, disorder in the universe is increasing, (see entropy).\n \n An increase in complexity does not mean there is an increase in organized matter, the opposite is true.\n\n His point was that there has been an increase in organization.\n \n It is inevitable given the laws of physics, the fact that they are laws means there is order.\n \n \nA random pile of building material is more complex then a house which is created from that same pile of building materials, because that material is now organized.\n\n Just because it is easier for you to comprehend does not mean it is less complex.\n \n I believe by definition the house must be more complicated for it has the same number of components as the pile but with interactions that would not occur in the pile.\n \n Complex and organized are two different concepts and attributes.\n \n A vial of gas has is very complex when comprehended on the particle level and so is a computer but one is much more organized.\n \n \nWhich means that the universe is not infinitely old. Otherwise total entropy would have already occurred by now.\n \n So, the universe had a beginning. Which you can't explain.\n \n Genesis 1:1\n \n emoticon_xchickenemoticon_xchicken\n\n I am not going to start endorsing genesis as a theory but Easyrider is certainly right if anyone here thinks they can explain it any better than the bible.\n \n You are talking about the difference of \"the universe appeared out of god's head\" vs \"The universe appeared (out of nowhere)\"\n \n The former is an explanation based on no evidence and the latter is not actually an explanation.\n \n \nYou think that a man, for example, is a more complex thing then if the atoms that make him up were just floating around in space.\n \n That is incorrect, man is less complex then a bunch of random atoms floating around in space, even if they are the exact same atoms that makeup that man.\n \n Man, animals, etc are all organized systems and less complex that random systems.\n \n If you can't get that right then I see no reason anyone should regard your entire argument as anything but dreck.\n\n Why don't you look up the definition of complexity..... Or you want to get back to the totally unfounded assertions you made about relativity in between calling me an intellectual fraud.\n \nComplex: made up of interconnecting parts. Entropy: the measure of disorder in a system. Theory states that there is a natural tendency toward disorder unless there is a some other influence. Before the stars etc. the universe was no more than a bunch of atoms floating through space (entropy's high point?). Then came the outside influence, gravity, and the stars were created. \n \n Even if entropy is correct, there is always an outside influence. Life was not a random occurrence, there was an outside influence.

   "The discussion seems to have conflated three different concepts: entropy, order/disorder, and complexity/simplicity.\n \n Entropy is not actually either of the other concepts. Sometimes, for simplicity sake, in order to explain to those uneducated in thermodynamics, entropy is explained as a measure of disorder in a system. Obviously, from this discussion, that causes confusion. What we usually hear echoed is that entropy is a measure of disorder. What happened to the system?\n \n Just for yucks, here is a formal definition of entropy from my thermodynamics text:\n \nSomething is said to be a property of a system if, and only if, its change in value between two states is independent of the process of that change. The Clausius inequality states that the integral of the heat transfer at a part of a system boundary during a given cycle divided by the absolute temperature at that part of the boundary, when the integral is performed over all parts of the boundary and over the entire cycle, is less than or equal to 0. It can be demonstrated (this is a fact) that for any internally reversible process between two states of a system that the value of the integral depends on the end states only. It can be concluded, therefore, that the integral defines the change in some extensive property of a system. That property is entropy.\n\n Please don't conflate your ideas of order/disorder, and complexity/simplicity with the definition of thermodynamic entropy.\n \nSurely that is not the sum of your argument?\n\n Certainly not. But you seem to have ignored several other posts were he tried to explain this to you.\n \nSuppose that there trillions of holes drilled into it ?\n\n The the rock with holes drilled in it is obviously more complex that the rock, which is more complex than a cube carved from the rock.\n \nWould the components of a person in a gaseous form be more complex than the living person?\n\n Certainly so. Such a state would be more complex, more disordered, as well as more entropic.\n \n You do understand, don't you, that while a house made of bricks has only one possible arrangement of those bricks, that a pile of those bricks can have an almost infinite arrangement. Thus, the pile of bricks is more complex (it has more possible configurations), more disordered, and, in fact, has more entropy.\n \n The concept that creationists mis-apply is that all systems tend towards an increase in entropy. While true, that doesn't mean that decreases in entropy in certain parts of a system are impossible with an infusion from another part of the system. In fact, such infusions of energy from one part of a system into another do cause a decrease in entropy in the receiver of the energy, while there is an offsetting increase in entropy in the source, equal to or greater than the decrease. Take, for example, the huge increase in entropy in the sun as opposed to the paltry decreases exhibited by living organisms on the earth that receives only an infinitesimal amount of the energy emitted by the sun.",

If I think you are wrong and I am right and know why I am right, I am going to feel that I am intellectually superior to you. Many times when dealing with creationists, rather than try to understand what they are telling me, I am going to jump to \"why does this person actually believe this?\" That is often a better place to start since their ideas are often so incredibly baseless. Being an intellectual does not have to encompass considering anything.\n \n And injecting tired empiricist arguments is all we really have. Our beliefs only change when new facts are unveiled. Believe me, I get tired of the same old arguments too, but at least in the scientific community, beliefs are universal because facts are universal. If you take a random sample of ten creationists views on the way things are (should be), you will likely get ten different answers. Can they all be correct?\n \n And if our perspective is narrow, its only because they are compared to the broad spectrum of delusional ideas a typical creationist has ingrained in their brain.

   "What does this mean?\n\n It means that many religion integrate concepts that don't require faith, but they do so most of the time to absorb some of the political/cultural momentum that such a concept brings with it.\n \n For example in the middle ages it was said that God wanted you to obey your lord. Well that gives political capital to the church because feudalism was the government of choice back then.\n \n Many of these religions from the start have rehashed many primary virtues (virtues that are very prevalent due to their primacy to human existance) as divine doing the same thing.\n \n For instance if God says it's good to love, and you love, that must mean you are listening to God which means you believe in God.\n \n The logic is invalid but too often people do not run these thoughts through a strict analysis but let them float around just under their conscious mind.\n \nYou have admitted that humans and apes share a common descent. What this means is beyond me since you don't accept that evolution represents the mechanism by which this came to be.\n \n A possible mechanism as is the magic fairy origin, or the Son of God's salvation of apes.\n \n As I have said before logic does not require an explanation it requires consistency.\n \n If you have no consistent explanation you have no explanation, it does not mean you have to throw out an observation.\n \n For instance assume that somehow an ancient person discovers that the sun is an object made of matter like the earth.\n \n How many explanations for it's luminance can he really come up with?\n \n More importantly would his observation be invalid if he could come up with no sound explanation as to why matter is burning for eons in the sky?\n \n What if a contemporary told him it's because the forge god breathes his life into it?\n \n Is this contemporary allowed to say \"You have admitted that the sun is made of matter which on earth is now glowing. What this means is beyond me since you don't accept that the forge god represents the mechanism by which this came to be\"\n \n I say no, the contemporary has an invalid proposed mechanism and the fact that it is the only one offered does not make it valid.\n \n \nI don't think you took my statement in context. Even if you did, this really doesn't make sense.\n\n The context was dallas' statement about a compound view on the world involving part mysticism and part reason.\n \n You asked what part should be based on mysticism and I answered \"none\".\n \n By the way dallas, that view is not novel. It is the official standpoint of the catholic church, whose greatest philosopher held reason as supreme except where 'faith was required'.\n \n What some people such as you databed don't understand is that the church sees no contradictions between their religion and science, and they are right too; try to point one out.\n \n A all powerful God coupled with a subjective perspectivist view of man means all concepts are self closing and consistent with that of God.\n \n The only contradiction arises when you throw out faith as a means of knowledge, but that is already outside the circular logic of theirs.",

   "God as something other than divine? Some definitions for you:\n\n \n I should have said religious view of God; the idea of god as a benevolent, guiding force which possesses human characteristics or vice versa; god is merciful, god is good, god wants, god is personified, if we do right we go to heaven if not we go to hell. \n \n \nAnd as for understanding how humans came to be, science already has what is to me a satisfying explanation for how humans came into being. It does not require any magical or mystical leaps or bounds. Why then do you find it necessary to insert something new? Also, have you even defined what this novel idea is?:\n\n \n Sure it is easy to understand if, as you stated earlier, you believe the essense or nature of humans is the same as apes. It is only a belief, but I think humans are of a nature of which apes cannot evolve to. But a ape to human view evolution is time based, from here to there. But how about the DNA/protein combo at the inception of life. \n \n There are no circumstances in which initial life would occur naturally, it is not a naturally occurring chemical reaction, and could not occur by chance. Also, every molecule in our body is non-living. So how can life be accounted for? The answer: life was created. Life is one of those mystical/magical leaps. \n \n Science cannot offer an explanationt for creation; the why. It cannot explain why energy turns into matter, they can only explain the circumstances in which it happens;the how. Its like a legal trial, science can produce the evidence but it takes something else to make a case.\n \n Religion invokes the idea of god as being the creator or the reason why. There is no problem with that explanation, but god and why life exists is still a big unknown. The problem with religion is that it claims a certain knowledge of god which should be challenged. Religions tend to be based on tenets written when there was a consensus the world was flat. We are a much different world today, we understand more. Blind faith should be replaced with reasoned faith. Basically, all religion offers is a glimpse of god from a certain point of view. \n \n I have nothing new to introduce, all I have is my point of view. To me its is of benefit to see where in the history of the universe manifestations of god are most obvious. Saying god created humans (Adam and Eve) out of nothing does not suffice, but saying humans evolved from apes is also incomplete. \n \n In my opionion, organized religion is falling short of its mandate. This failure is the result of the actions of religious leaders and the static nature of their guiding tenets. There are other issues here. A new non-tenet based view of god is needed. That view should be a collaboration. \n \n My pov: god is interjected at certain points in the history if things (the advent of life). the results of this interjection have a certain potential (becoming complex organisms), once that potential is met and other conditions conducive to change (intelligence life) god may interject something of a different nature (humans). However poorly I described this, the concept is consistent throughout the universe history. Energy does not turn into protons, it turns into quarks. Quarks turn into protons. \n \n That is an innocuous pov. But, it would be beneficial to view the nature of things through this lens. God is the creator, and what is created has a potential, once the potential is met change in the nature of things is possible and it occurs. In other words, god is present in everything not because god is some kind of micro-manager, but because the potential was made available and exists in all things. If humans have a purpose, it is to recognize this potential and not to adhere to some tenet (tenets are the foundation of religion). \n \n Example, a child with no means scrapes together $3 to give to a charity. A very wealthy man gives a million dollars to the same charity. Their intentions were of equal value. Which act displays the greater moral worth? The charity benefited more from the million dollar gift, more people were helped. But the child gave everything they had. I say it was the child; they lived up to their potential.",

I may be talking only about the atheist here, but why so vitrolic?\n \n For example, an atheist would agree (I think) if you hold an object in your hand and you can see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, and hear it, it exists. The proof is provided by the senses and the recognition of that truth takes place in out brain/mind. However, when faith is introduced things suddenly change. I am not a religious person, but for those that are, faith is manifested in very real ways. As real as any object they hold in their hands. Why dismiss this? For them to explain to a reluctant ear is trying to explain color to a person who has always been blind. \n \n An atheist closes the door to such things. They have made a decision god does not exist. Their argument is that they can't believe is something that has no proof.

Make sure you don't make the odds of any number calculated the same as a winning number. In other words, consider all the possible ways amino acids could be arranged that have not occurred yet, or at least not presently, in addition to the ways that have when you calculate your odds. \n \n \nI am pretty sure about the chemical elements, and what elements are necessary for life. A magical chemical compound; interesting idea. \n \n Life is complex to the max. To think it was just dumb luck or a simple undirected chemical reaction is just ludicrous. \n\n \n Pure argument from ignorance. \n \n \n \n\n For years atheism was championed by Anthony Flew. The DNA argument convinced him, he was wrong and he denounced atheism. The evidence was compeling enough to persuade him to give up a life time of believing that foolish idea.\n\n \n \nIn an earlier essay, I described Antony Flew's apparent conversion from atheism to deism and took Professor Flew to task for accepting the arguments of the pseudoscientist Gerald Schroeder. I wished \"that Professor Flew had read Mr. Schroeder's work more carefully or had consulted critical references to Mr. Schroeder's work before pronouncing Mr. Schroeder kosher.\"\n \n According to Richard Carrier (2005), who has become sort of an unofficial mouthpiece for Professor Flew, Professor Flew now admits that he has been \"mistaught\" by Mr. Schroeder and also, astonishingly, blames Richard Dawkins for his own misunderstanding of abiogenesis, or the development of life from nonliving matter.\n \n Mr. Carrier adds further that Professor Flew appears to remain a deist but calls his new belief a \"very modest defection from [his] previous unbelief.\" \n\n Antony Flew's Conversion to Deism: An Update - The Panda's Thumb\n \n But on a different note, who the hell cares what some guy converted to? There are plenty of fools in the world that believe some pretty stupid stuff. You think there aren't any cases of people converting the other way? The only thing astonishing about this case is that by the time most people have adult reasoning, say, 16 or 17, they are no longer susceptible to the brainwashing that most religious children have undergone in order to actually believe that some magical afterlife is awaiting them. This guy was actually ignorant enough to take up such a story. \n \n (I realize he became a deist, however, which is somewhat different. )",

You came up with a one in a huge number odds for this sequence arising by chance. I commend your ability to do simple odds calculations, even if it was flawed by your assertion that genetic code is binary. But, you ignore the fact that that means there are also that same huge number of possible sequences that could happen. What you need to focus on is what percentage of that huge number creates something that makes sense in genetics. You have yet to do this and therefore you have yet to refute this point of mine even with your assumption, which is wrong, that this sequences must have appeared fully formed from no previous, more simple version.\n \n Another factor you don't seem to accept is that these sequences arrive before the function can possibly be known. Even improvements in some function arrive by the exact same premise, that is, the improvement can't be realized before the mutation occurs. To say that nothing new can happen before it is being selected is therefore incorrect, and you must agree as long as you accept that an improvement can occur by natural selection, which you do. To somehow separate the selection that acts on a novel function from that which acts on what you would call a simple improvement makes no sense since any selection must wait until that improvement/new function comes to be. If you can't grasp this, which apparently you can't, you need to redirect your intellect to that of mysticism or the pseudoscience of ID. Wait, you do... \n \n I realize that your differentiation between the two relies on any new function being so novel that there is no way some sequence left over from some previous function could ever bring it close enough for some mutation to be explainable by a given mutation. By making this assertion, you only demonstrate your lack of knowledge about not only how natural selection works, but genetics in general. You ignore junk DNA, you ignore genetic markers which turn genes on and off, you can't give a satisfactory definition of scaffolding (that which you give is obviously derived from ID proponent websites), you dismiss experimental results which show novel function forming in bacteria, and you continually submit incredulous dismissals of what is shown to you. At very worst and inexplicable by me or you, you accept that humans and apes have a common ancestor or common genetic heritage! But a slow gradual change in genome over a period of time does not account for this? It couldn't have been natural selection because I dont get it!

BTW, the cecal valves are an entirely new and novel function not found in the original lizards.\n \n What would be your estimation of the odds of all that happening in just 36 years from an original five adult pairs of lizards? According to your argument this should be impossible, no?\n\n \n This will never do any good. Freedom has already admitted that humans and apes share a common ancestor. I would imagine that even if you did beat his \"not enough proof for me\" argument and back him in a corner, he would defend with natural selection can't explain this strange phenomenon because I am unwilling to accept it as possible. Some quotes showing this.\n \n \n \n\n \nAre you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation?\n\n \n \nYes\n \n The only other option would be multi-formation, leaving the similarity in genetic material entirely unexplained.\n\n\n \n \n \nIs there anyone who doesn't think species come from earlier species?\n\n \n \nWe did more than change from that ancestor we advanced, it is important to find out how.\n\n \n \nBecause it is evidence for common descent, common descent is already predicted by evolution and already practically proved by the fossil record, so it would be most accurate to say it is not new evidence for evolution.\n\n \n My point is, that if this is his stance, why didn't he just come out and say it just now? Instead he went a different route saying nothing new was created. If he is willing to allow for something new to be created, why not just say it here? I think it's because he has to be careful and limit his reliance on ludicrous assertions like the quotes above.",

The volvox is my favorite example since it isn't even considered a multi-cellular organism, just a collection of flagellates held together in a sphere by cytoplasm filaments. And yet this colony of cells is able, through slight differentiations, to detect light and swim towards it, and manage dimorphic gametes. There's nothing very 'novel' at the cellular level, but novelty at the functional level. There are some volvox colonies that have a concavity in which their light detection differentiation is concentrated and this provides more directionality to their light detection. And et cetera. \n \n Novelty is built up generation after generation, sometimes faster and sometimes slower. But there is no \"target\" functionality being aimed at, just the current functionality of the current generation. If that functionality is \"good enough\", the species continues on. If not, the species ends up in the evolutionary dust bin. And most species end up in the dust bin, which is just what one would expect with an untargeted \"drunkard's walk\" through the fitness landscape.",

What, exactly, do you mean by \"benefit?\" You seem to have been misguided by the Spencerian philosophy of \"survival of the fittest.\"\n \n2. There are functions/systems/structures in biology that have no benefit (except by chance) until they are formed.\n\n Can you give me an example of a function/system/structure that has a biological benefit (meaning?) before it is formed? Can you explain the benefit of a function/system/structure that does not exist?\n \n3. Therefore natural selection + random mutation the process cannot form these systems\n\n But, of course, in order to reach a logical conclusion (a therefore) you must have two valid premises. Neither of yours is valid, since the first is erroneous and the second is gibberish. What you seem to be saying is that biological functions/systems/structures that do not exist can be of benefit (???) to some unspecified organism in some unspecified environment. While your premises are complete nonsense, the conclusion is true. Biological functions/systems/structures that do not exist most certainly can have no effect on evolution.\n \n4. leaving only random mutation, the appeal to odds (pure chance)\n\n That wasn't even a \"nice try.\" If you haven't bothered to try to understand either science or logic, why display your ignorance with such gibberish?\n \nThere have been an appeal to odds in the preceding arguments but it was not I who made them.\n\n Actually, it was you who made an appeal to odds, clumsy as it was. \n \nThey were made by those who could not undermine the soundness of 1,2,3 and so attempted to substitute any rational definition of evolution with 4.\n\n Since neither 1 nor 2 are sound, 3 does not logically follow. And of course, anyone who understands logic understands that in order to reach 4 from 3, you need an additional premise. Obviously, you don't.\n \nThere have been exchanges on whether there is actually a difference between natural selection + random mutation the process and random mutation alone.\n\n But, of course, there is a difference. One would have to be ignorant of evolutionary theory to deny either, as well as the other mechanisms of evolution, like gene flow, recombination, non-random mating (e.g.,sexual selection), genetic drift, biased variation, and movable elements.\n \n(these can be identified by statements like \"but once a function is formed it is selected for)\n\n Or against. Again, you display your ignorance.\n \nThere have been some elegant appeals to chance and some not so elegant.\n\n Again you display your failure to educate yourself about the topic. Evolutionary theory is not an appeal to chance. Nor is it an appeal to mythology.\n \nThe least so have been appeals to infinite mutation events and infinite possible functions. Let it be noted that I fully realize that the total odds are modified by the number of mutation events and the total number of functional sequences, but I have provided inferential data and other various arguments to show that the trials are on a smaller order of magnitude than the odds.\n\n What you have provided is evidence of your misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. Of course, your statement of what you think you have provided is, again, nothing more than gibberish. Of course, any informed individual knows that inference is but a small part of science, and that it isn't data. Inference leads to an hypothesis. Anyone knowledgeable understands that an hypothesis is meaningless until it is tested. Your \"other various arguments\" have been shown to be meaningless, and in fact, not even arguments.\n \nThe elegant have been appeals to 'co-option' in which valleys in a genetic fitness landscape interconnected like a great river delta and these evolutionary pathways allow the formation of new function.\n\n Jesus! More meaningless gibberish.\n \nAs I just said I provided inferential evidence about how many functional sequences there are in relation to all possible sequences which indicate these valleys are more like wells separated by miles on a vast plane of unfitness.\n\n I guess your have read some of Dawkins and didn't understand any of it.\n \nThe last type of argument brought against me was the idea that there are no novel systems that at every point advancement took the form of modifying a currently functional system.\n\n Again, gibberish. What does that mean? I suspect that you don't actually understand evolutionary biology enough to understand what what was said.\n \nThat was countered by the point that since functioning is a boolean value there must have always been some point at which it did not exist then it did.\n\n So we are back to functions/systems/structures that don't exist? Are we to understand that you think that evolution acts on functions/systems/structures that do not exist?\n \nThis line of argument was revealed to be a somewhat sloppy attempt to paste the concept of gradual change (an important part of evolution) onto something that could not contain it.\n\n Speaking of sloppy, how about your 4 premise argument? That being said, the above quote is again meaningless. What does it mean?\n \nThe only counter to that counter was an appeal to odds that the functioning of a previously existing system was modified to perform a new function (refer back to co-option)\n\n What??? It's not odds. It's natural selection. Thus, feathered, maniraptoran dinosaurs developed flight, simply because it provided a differential reproductive advantage. It has nothing to do with \"odds.\" What are you thinking?\n \nSo you see I believe I have responded to every argument brought against mine and the fact that everyone who brought those arguments have nothing more to say seems to support that position.\n\n But you have responded with nonsense. When you respond with nonsense to facts, it means that you are intentionally ignorant. It does not mean that you are correct.\n \nThen it claims there are no new functions, that is the extent of rational evolution and it I support and endorse.\n\n That's not what it says. Again, you show your ignorance.\n \nYou are correct, nothing will except an argument that shows my argument to be unsound.\n\n That's been done. What you don't understand is that there is no argument against an illogical argument. You presented two invalid premises and followed with two conclusions. Besides the fact that your argument was based on extreme ignorance, you show a lack of understanding of logic. You can't draw two conclusions from two premises. Please make an effort to educate yourself. Your arguments only reveal your ignorance.\n \nThe laws of logic demand that if it is false and we have enough information to know it is false such an argument exists.\n\n More gibberish. Please tell us about the laws of logic. You have already demonstrated that you know nothing about logic. On the other hand, my minor in philosophy included a course in logic (15 weeks x 2 hours/week=30 hours). All of those hours were involved with understanding what are and are not valid (logical) arguments. You make no valid (logical) arguments.\n \nIt could and the universe can be viewed as a collection of particles interacting by some basic laws. Semantics and implied analogies will not alter my position.\n\n More nonsense. What does that have to do with anything being discussed?\n \nThe jump from chemical to life is the greatest example of irreducible complexity but not the only one by far.\n \n It fits the pattern of a function that does not exist and so cannot be selected for perfectly.\n\n More ignorance. What does \"perfect selection\" have to do with this discussion. Moreover, I guess you are not aware that there are certain organic chemicals that reproduce. In any environment, those chemicals that reproduce more efficiently become more numerous in that environment. I guess that you aren't aware of chemical compounds that reproduce themselves.\n \nThen arguing for irrational evolution is not for you, it is composed entirely of using words to blur differences in concepts.\n\n And how are you arguments from mythology any better?\n \nArgument by definition is a deductive argument, if you find it pointless to have definitions it is definitely fruitless to argue with me.\n\n Argument by definition is no such thing. You define parameters that will support you conclusions before you examine the evidence. Besides that, you don't even bother to educate yourself about anything outside of your definitions before you argue.\n \npossible explanation vs observed fact, natural selection vs random selection, yea the list goes on and on.\n\n That's just stupid. Evolution IS an observed fact. Natural selection is one of the tested mechanisms that make up part of the theory of evolution that explains the observed facts. There is no such thing as \"random selection,\" at least not in the sense that you mean.\n \n It would be really nice if you made an effort to educate yourself about topics that you oppose before you engaged in debate.

I guess that you aren't aware of chemical compounds that reproduce themselves.\n\n I literally aware of nothing at all, my ignorance is a infinitely deep hole.\n \n \nAnd how are you\n\n I'm fine thank you.\n \n arguments from mythology any better?\n\n May the thunder God smite you for that!\n \n \nArgument by definition is no such thing.\n\n There is.\n \n \nThat's just stupid.\n\n That&#8217;s a little bland, can't you do any better?\n \n Evolution IS an observed fact. Natural selection is one of the tested mechanisms that make up part of the theory of evolution that explains the observed facts. There is no such thing as \"random selection,\" at least not in the sense that you mean.\n \n It would be really nice if you made an effort to educate yourself about topics that you oppose before you engaged in debate. Your ignorance of evolutionary theory is mind numbing.\n\n Mind numbing that&#8217;s better.\n \n Alright I guess the funs over.\n \n O.K. I suppose you want an official response?\n \n Practically everything you accused me of, I accuse you of. Ok that takes care of the majority of it.\n \n If you did take a 15 weeks course on logic you are either the worst student or you had the worst teacher.\n \n If you think that anything besides sound logic will dissuade me think again.\n \n That's all.\n \n \n#1 is wrong. Natural selection more accurately culls out the unfit. Mutations which are neutral, slightly beneficial or overwhelmingly beneficial pass through the filter of natural selection. Also, there are other evolutionary mechanisms you have not addressed, such as genetic drift, sexual selection, etc.\n\n I have addressed them to note they are not directed (except sexual selection which is included in the concept of natural selection)\n \n 1 is correct.\n \n \n#2: I'm not sure what you mean by this. Could you provide an example applicable to evolution (and not abiogenesis)?\n\n Flagellum, eukaryotes, photosynthesis, aerobic metabolism, sexual reproduction, and pretty much every distinct system you can think of. If anyone gave it a chapter in a biology book chances are it's IC.\n \n \nAs I tried to point out with the volvox example, every \"system\" has a precursor \"system\" which is at least 'adequate' to the organism's fitness landscape. So an example or two of what \"systems\" you are talking about would be helpful.\n\n If you are talking about a functional system its improvement is not unelectable.

In the next line I only pointed out (once more) your ignorance of evolutionary biology, genetics, and logic.\n\n If you don't think a series of statements which contain the opponent debater as the subject; which are meant to conclude the debater's argument is wrong, is an Ad Hominem I accuse you of lying about your formal education on logic. \n \n \nHow am I wrong?\n\n I am not interested in arguing about whether I am ignorant of biology or logic or not. I have made sound arguments and if you cannot defeat them that will speak for itself on this matter.\n \nWhere and when did you actually take a course in logic?\n\n You will not know, and I don't care where you took yours.\n \n \"As a formal student of logic I know that arguments by those who have not studied logic are unsound for that reason\" is the perhaps one of the oxymoronic statements that can be made.\n \n \nWhere and when did you actually study evolutionary biology? Where and when did you actually study genetics?\n\n Again you will not know. I refuse to proceed on your fallacious premise even in the least.\n \n \nCome on!

Yes it is that, you have tried to use me as the fulcrum for your point.\n \n Now if you are trying to argue about my ignorance, my logic skills you may do so.\n \n Admit now that such an argument would not be one about evolution.\n \n I find examples are a good way to teach so I will teach you. Above I said I would not respond. I take it back. I will use an ad hominem attack every time you do. I will do the same fallacy as you every time you use one.\n \n The difference will be that I will not cloak them in derisive paragraphs I will simply state them.\n \n This will have the effect of 'unblurring' the proceedings for readers and will act as a key for them to understand what you are trying to do and the nature of your statements.",

By shrugging it off, you seem to have no defense. \n \n Then you said,\n \n \nAs you have pointed out to me many times, what one can visualize is irrelevant.\n\n \n I never said this. What one can speculate on is in fact relevant especially when defending against someone who says, for example, \"its impossible for that pyramid to be erected by man.\" I say, \"No, they could have done it this way with thousands of slaves.\" \n \n Now, without actually building a pyramid to show you, or moving a single stone, I have showed that is not impossible. \n \n Then you said this,\n \n \nthere can be no systematic progression to a new function because a new function does not give benefit.\n\n \n This is obviously false. Do you really stand by this? \n \n I could go on and on. I think you really need to form coherent paragraphs with a statement and then something to back it up. So far, all you ever do is pick phrases out of context and either dismiss them with some logical fallacy argument or take their meaning as something different than was intended. This is why you're arguments always turn so sloppy. No one can remember what you were originally saying because you don't write intelligibly. \n \n BTW, you really need to rework your four statements. I know they have been nitpicked, but the first two are straight up incorrect and the second two are dependent on them.\n \n \n \n 1. Natural selection will select only for benefit, nothing else\n\n \n But natural selection is not the only mechanism responsible for change in a genome. That simple, assertion needs reworking. \n \n \n 2. There are functions/systems/structures in biology that have no benefit (except by chance) until they are formed.\n\n \n All changes in genome, whether for improvement in function or novel function, are by chance. No changes have benefit until after they occur. \n \n \n 3. Therefore natural selection + random mutation the process cannot form these systems\n\n \n This statement is just flat out wrong. I am sitting here trying to reword it in a way that makes some sort of sense, but even if I accept your first two statements, this one simply does not follow. This is because neither of your first two statements rule out a chance mutation leading to novel function. This is where you need to focus.\n \n \n\n 4. leaving only random mutation, the appeal to odds (pure chance)\n\n \n Yeah, but all changes are \"pure chance\" whether they lead to functional improvement or novel function. Again, you have to show that there is an impassable gorge or a gap between any existing function and any new function. In other words, your argument boils down to IC. \n \n BTW, you might want to stay away from logic as logic will never prove IC. As you said before, you have to be careful with the term impossible and logic deals in absolutes, not probables. Your better off sticking to probabilities, even though you have yet to correctly deduce the odds of anything.",

By shrugging it off, you seem to have no defense. \n\n \n Attacking a 'view' without reason is called argument by dismissal, however this phrase \"...you're view on evolution is too narrow to grasp the big picture. \" could only be an ad hominem. Don't get me wrong I don't see Ad Hominem as necessarily an insult simply any statement intended to counter an argument which uses a person (Any of their attributes included) as reason.\n \n Joe says cats are nice.\n \n Bill says Joe is wrong because he is such a kind person he can't be trusted to think anything is mean.\n \n Bob says Joe is wrong because he is an XXXXX whose ignorance tops all records.\n \n Jill says Joe is wrong because his view is narrow minded and he doesn't understand cats.\n \n All three of these arguments are Ad Hominem fallacies.\n \n Someone may well not understand something and may well be unable to speak intelligently about something, but that in itself does not make any argument they think up wrong. Saying so is another fallacy: Disproof By Fallacy.\n \n So even things that seem relevant can be fallacies, one must understand that one cannot argue against the person or their beliefs, or their knowledge. Only their argument itself is permissible and just because one may mention that an argument is wrong does not mean one argued against it, thereby sanctioning anything else one says in the same post.\n \n For instance \"As mentioned above, you leave out many mechanisms that result in a changes in a genome.\"\n \n That seems relevant and it would be in a string of other premises, but to prove it's relevance you would have to name other mechanisms, show (by argument) that I omitted them as factors and that this omission effects my argument.\n \n You did not so it was not unreasonable to attach this as a unsupported support of the other statement you made: \"you're view on evolution is too narrow to grasp the big picture.\"\n \n Now that is attacking the view not the argument, attacking the argument would conclude things about the other argument.\n \n This statement as well as \"You're attempting to distill evolution down so that it will have to conform to the constraints you impose on it.\" would be a description or explanation as to why I advanced an unsound argument.\n \n Since you did not show that to me, however; it still seemed as if you were attempting to counter my argument with statements about me.\n \n Therefore it was and is an Ad Hominem.\n \n \nI never said this. \n\n Ah but you have every time you pointed out that my lack of imagination for how something evolved is not proof that it couldn't have. You have accused me many times of making an argument from incredulity which is precisely that; saying that since I cannot visualize something it cannot happen.\n \n The inverse must be true, saying something must have happened because you can visualize it is fallacy.\n \n I of course had this response because that's the only point I saw in what I was responding to.\n \n I said whether something is functioning or not is a boolean value and you said not all functions are the same, while this is obvious you seemed to imply that you could visualize intermediates between non-functioning and functioning system.\n \n Since I know that is impossible all I had to do to expose the lack of support was point out that visualization is not support.\n \n Then you said this,\n \n \n \n \nThis is obviously false. Do you really stand by this? \n\n Yes, although the wording may be misunderstood. In all honesty I have stated these same arguments in a much more precise and thorough manner. I can't be blamed for getting a little tired of having to type the same thing over again because people have an aversion to reading (or remembering) more than a page back.\n \n \"there can be no systematic progression to a new function because a new function does not give benefit before it is formed which would encompass the entire time period in which the systematic progression would occur.\"\n \n \nI could go on and on. I think you really need to form coherent paragraphs with a statement and then something to back it up. So far, all you ever do is pick phrases out of context and either dismiss them with some logical fallacy argument or take their meaning as something different than was intended. This is why you're arguments always turn so sloppy. No one can remember what you were originally saying because you don't write intelligibly. \n\n ..........\n \nBTW, you really need to rework your four statements. I know they have been nitpicked, but the first two are straight up incorrect and the second two are dependent on them.\n\n If you can show they are incorrect you would have taken away two premises which are absolutely essential to my argument, you would win.\n \n \nBut natural selection is not the only mechanism responsible for change in a genome. That simple, assertion needs reworking. \n\n I did not say it was, so there is not assertion to rework.\n \n \n \nAll changes in genome, whether for improvement in function or novel function, are by chance. No changes have benefit until after they occur. \n\n That is true.\n \n Do you wish me to explain why that is not contradictory to my premise? (or you could reread or read for the first time what I have said on guided mutation)\n \n \nThis statement is just flat out wrong. I am sitting here trying to reword it in a way that makes some sort of sense, but even if I accept your first two statements, this one simply does not follow.\n\n I don't see how.\n \n maybe if the premises were more brutally stated?\n \n NO SELECTION WITHOUT BENEFIT\n \n NO BENEFIT\n \n THEREFORE NO SELECTION\n \n \nThis is because neither of your first two statements rule out a chance mutation leading to novel function. This is where you need to focus.\n\n You may have not noticed the 'the process' part or the last statement which addresses pure chance.\n \n Pure chance which just happens to be natural selection + random mutation - natural selection.\n \n natural selection + random mutation - natural selection. != natural selection + random mutation.\n \n If a function appears because of pure chance it is not pure chance plus filtering that causes it to appear, it is just pure chance.\n \n I can understand your confusion because in normal language:\n \n As an analogy if someone said Cooking + Following a recipe cannot produce a meal which is not in the recipe book, but Cooking alone can; it would seem a little silly because one can cook and follow a recipe at the same time.\n \n but if you say Cooking + Following a recipe - the process by which cooking is conducted according to a recipe book cannot produce a meal that is not in the recipe book, but Cooking by randomly trying combinations of frying, broiling, and seasoning food can. It would be much more intelligible.\n \n It is the same in my premises, natural selection & random mutation as a process of selecting changes in organisms is not identical to random mutation alone.\n \n For instance what if I said random mutation + natural selection can produce a horribly crippled species which is doomed to death in minutes?\n \n Well that would be madness, natural selection implies such a random mutation would be gone quickly before it even spreads to an entire species.\n \n Yet pure chance random mutation can certainly screw individuals up and if there was no natural selection it could spread.\n \n If one was merely an expanded version of the other they would both be capable of the same things but one would be capable of more. That is not the case, one is capable of certain things and the other any thing at all, one is a predictable process the other is not. \n \n \nYeah, but all changes are \"pure chance\" whether they lead to functional improvement or novel function.\n\n No, every mutation is pure chance. Not any change.\n \n If a system improved itself by say 10 evolutionary units in one mutation it would be totally unselected, total luck.\n \n If it did it in 200 mutations AND there were intermediate benefits it was not.\n \n Novel function CANNOT have intermediate benefits before it exists, meaning it is always totally unselected, total luck.\n \n What you are basically saying is that everything is totally unselected, total luck but that isn't true.\n \n Large changes can be built off of a series of small changes.\n \n If there was a law that said no possible improvement can be selected for until it reaches a certain level of improvement it would be in the same boat as novelty but there isn't, not for all improvements.\n \n If I gave a challenge to two people that they had to see what you can do to make a really good bike by changing it randomly, but here's the catch I say you have to throw out any bike that doesn't ride.\n \n Now I give one guy a squeaky old bike that barely works,\n To the other I give a rock.\n \n The first starts with an array of random liquids sprayed onto the bike. A lot of unimproved bikes (covered with water, milk, and such) a couple bikes were melted by strong acids, but he came across oil which helped the chains and open bearings, then he stumbled upon paint.\n \n Given enough time he could turn that bike into a pristine randonneur, the key to that is he gets to select if there was an improvement.\n \n Every single change was random but the total effect was not.\n \n What about the guy with the rock? Well he tried a lot more things than the first person. Some times he even got ridiculously lucky, once he actually managed to get a crankset and bolted it to the rock.\n \n I guess you see where this is going though right? It didn't ride, none of the rock modifications rode.\n \n Why not? Isn't it the same thing, it's not like either planned any of the changes they made right? Yep.\n \n They were all perfectly random and only selected afterward?\n Yes.\n \n Whats the difference? It's the rule that you have to throw it out if it doesn't ride.\n \n Let's add another law and run it again. This time you have to throw out the experiment if it's not a pristine randonneur.\n \n Now; even though many of the changes the first made were improvements he still had to lose them because it wasn't a pristine randonneur.\n \n Not much changes with the other.\n \n The end result is neither are able to systematically improve their experiments.\n \n The only way they are getting a pristine randonneur is if that happens to be the entire change (the first makes all necessary changes and the second gets a randonneur and puts the rock on a bike rack).\n \n In conclusion the only way for every change to be pure luck is in the absence of natural selection.\n \n \nAgain, you have to show that there is an impassable gorge or a gap between any existing function and any new function.\n\n To defeat the absurd notion that functions regularly leap around for no reason?\n \n No, the burden of proof here is definitely on you. When one says something can't happen except by pure chance it is for the opposition to show the non-random process that causes it.\n \n If you aren't claiming that a non-random process causes it but that it's so likely it doesn't require one I have stated a cogent argument about the actual chances of co-option.\n \n \nIn other words, your argument boils down to IC. \n\n I gasped at that! Of course I know that. In fact the first thing I said about evolution on this form was \"the only sound argument against evolution I have heard is that of IC\" or something very similar.\n \n \nBTW, you might want to stay away from logic as logic will never prove IC.\n\n Why?\n \n As you said before, you have to be careful with the term impossible and logic deals in absolutes, not probables.\n \n Um not exactly, look up the difference between a deductive and inductive argument particularly the nature of their conclusions.\n \n \nYour better off sticking to probabilities, even though you have yet to correctly deduce the odds of anything.\n\n I have given good indication of the order of magnitude of the odds, the balls in your court now if you want to strengthen your appeal to odds.",

(better in a certain amount of time of course)\n \n \n That is benefit.\n \n None of these bother me because despite your mindless accusations I have considered them all.\n \n Am I to understand that what potential mates look for is somehow tied into a deep level of complexity in the universe?\n \n Would it not be reasonable to say that if one can clearly differentiate between selection because of the other gender's code and selection because of your own survival, that the former takes no pattern except the apparent disconnect with your attributes and your survival?\n \n For instance darker manes are better?\n \n Why?\n \n Because females think so.\n \n Any reason besides?\n \n No, or else I wouldn't have pointed it out.\n \n Why would the females care about something that doesn't matter to survival?\n \n There is no reason for it.\n \n What about female lions liking the strongest males?\n \n Any reason besides their preference?\n \n Yes.\n \n Then the selection for strong males is sexual selection but also selection for what you call 'benefit'.\n \n It is therefore patently absurd to claim that when the parts of natural selection which actually do select based on the effectiveness of objectively functional components, cannot discern any pattern but survival benefit; that sexual selection is capable of doing more.\n \n Keep in mind when I say benefit I mean anything that increases the ratio of any individuals offspring.\n \n That could be anything including deletions which are assuredly not 'advancement'.\n\n \n Lets assume for a moment that intelligent design is a fact, what can we then do with it?\n \n How can we measure it?\n \n How can we test it?\n \n What great scientific discoveries will we make with it?\n \n How will we use it to feed the hungry?\n \n What sicknesses will we cure with it?\n \n Does it have any use at all?",

I am guessing that this correctional system in fungii is actually the remnants of a switch from a diploid existance to a haploid one.\n \n Let's forget about the fungii and look at the cells which were supposed to develop meiosis.\n \n Were they diploids or haploids?\n \n The only answer you can give that would make any sense would be what the fungii are now, haploids until a mistake is made.\n \n If that were true though meiosis would optimize to destroy any stable diploid state.\n \n This correctional method just corrected any chance at normal diploid existance, unless you have control systems which always seem to be the hiccup in evolutionary stories.\n \n Finally I would like to point out that the only real benefit in meiosis would be recombination, such recombination would be meaningless without cellular fusion. (recombining a copy of yourself is not different from mitotic recombination).\n \n \nClearly there are several possible evolutionary step-wise paths from mitosis to meiosis, and most of these intermediates are seen in extant organisms. \n\n Not so clearly to me.\n \n \nI also ran across several papers on evolutionary pathways for photosynthesis, metabolism, flagella, etc. Have you read all these papers and ruled all of them out as providing possible evolutionary pathways?
