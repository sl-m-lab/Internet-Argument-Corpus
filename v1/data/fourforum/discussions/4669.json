What's with the ageism? Let's not group all teens into one large catagory. I'm willing to bet that the average intelligence of teens in my community topples the average intelligence of the adults. Age has little to do with smartness/stupidness. Pythagorous (spelling?) outsmarted his math teacher when he was a mere child by adding all the numbers from 1 to 100 in a matter of seconds. Ramanujan solved many mathematical proofs at just age 16. Age does, however, have a lot to do with wisdom. It's one thing to say, \"those teens are so unwise/immature because they are teens,\" and another to say, \"those teens are stupid because they are teens.\"",

That said, I think its much more realistic to try and accept that there are differing opinions and view points. Scientific explainations aren't perfect, they weren't a century ago, so why should they be now? There are always loopholes in logic, reasonable comments made with bias...things that can be picked apart. Instead of picking it apart to tear it down and label it stupid, why not try to see the truth in it? None of us known the absolute truth, so why not open up to the possibility that even the most mentally handicapped person may hold a piece of truth in their words and thoughts?",
