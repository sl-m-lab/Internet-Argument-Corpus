Idiot. 80% of the Greeks and Romans at that time WERE homosexual, they were known mainly has homosexual people. Hence why it says such things as them not taking over. Also, it has nothing to do with God in the first place. it has to do with our constitution. \"The right to worship freely\" rules out that idea, the idea of it being ungodly. it is nothing more than a bunch of timid, uptight, right wing republicans in office and congress, who go hunting every sunday to make them feel masculine. I mean, the majority of people in office and congress etc and running this country are from the ages of 40-80 years old. They were RAISED on prejiduce and fear. What more is there to it?",

   "Actually Arsenokoites as taken from Youngs AND Strongs Concordance to the Bible translates it as homosexual, etc....\n\n Heya TRAVELER...Actually Mr. Jack's comment to you is closer to the truth than what you got out of your concordances. The word Arsenokoitai means literally \"male f----r\" and meant a prostitute who was hired to assume the active role in intercourse with either a woman OR another man. The word Homosexual is a late 19th century invention which is a hybrid greek-latin word, ie: homo (greek, for same) and sexualis (latin, for sexual). Obviously the word (and probably the modern concept of a person with primarily same sex erotic attraction) didnt occur to the sacred writer, Paul. The word Malakos, means simply, soft. It has been given a WIDE range of meaning from decadent or lazy, and has even been applied to those who engage in solitary sex. It seems unlikely that someone who is effeminate (which would be no fault of his own)is kept out of the Kingdom of God, without any regard to the type of life (possibly entirely virtuous)that person is leading. A good book for you to acquire would be John Boswell's Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality, (Univ of CHicago Press)possibly the best book ever written on the topic.",

In Catholic moral theology, actions, though objectively sinful, may not bear subjective moral culpability if the sinner sincerely (no pun intended) does not know or does not believe they are sinful. Three things are necessary in catholic teaching for something to be gravely sinful: 1)Serious matter, 2) Knowledge that it is wrong, and 3) Full consent of the will. If as you say, a homosexual does not believe the actions are wrong, then by catholic definition, they cannot be subjectively sinful, no grave sin is committed, and hence no dmanation to hell. This does not mean the actions may not be objectively wrong, just that the sinner is not liable to judgment. Also, if the urge to commit a sin is such a strong part of the persons character that it is impossible to overcome, likewise no grave sin is committed.",

No. Rather...what I am saying is that we Christians love to cite such concpets while focusing specific segments of sinful humanity while somehow trying to separate ourselves from them. I don't see Christians going around reminding everyone, every single day that judgers or men will not inherit the kingdom or that liars will go to hell or that adulterers will wither away.

We Christians need to take a piece of humble pie - you and me are not better or worse than a gay person is in the eyes of God and equally accepted and loved! I am fed up with the misquoted, abused concept of \"loving the sinner and not the sin\" as some some sort of excuse to continue treating homosexuality with an obvious and deep negative bias up and over the other aspects of sinful humnanity that are just as deeper and definetly more prevalent in our churches. Lets cut the bs...Christian still treat gays with special disdain and that is neither Biblical nor Christlike. Meanwhile, Christ would be buds with the \"XXXXXXX\", \"dikes\" and \"those upon which the wrath of God has been visited\" via AIDS as the Mary Magdalenes, Zaccheuses and lepers of his day. \n \n More and more and more and more...As I try and engage in discusison about homsexuality and Christian faith, the only real principle that I can base my arguments on is simple...We Christians who are without sin should cast the first stone (or simply shut up).\n \n MC",

Up until President Lincoln officially declared African American people as a free people, the Mosaic Law was commonly used to support the belief that enslaving African American people was not only permissible, but biblically approved and encouraged. To this I refer to Leviticus 25:44-45, wherein it states, \"Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.\" Yet, such is not to suggest by any stretch of the imagination that in declaring African Americans a free people we stopped the hate that has been routinely imposed against them. \n \n Now many would argue that the old \"Mosaic Law\" became obsolete when the New Testament was written, though commonly the book of Leviticus and others in the Old Testament are still used today to browbeat and oppress anyone whom we disagree with or do not like. Of course we apply these scriptures in very biased ways, only enough to poke at others, yet never enough to reveal our own immoralities or sinful ways, for example. We commonly hear Leviticus 20:13 quoted, which says, \"You shall not lie with a man as with a woman, it is an abomination\", and yet, conveniently forget that in Deut 22:13-21, it says, \"A marriage shall be considered valid only if the wife is a virgin. If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be stoned to death.\" The point being here is that while I suppose we can quote any number of scriptures to seemingly justify our personal hate for others on the premise that it is \"human nature\". The fact is, we are ultimately the masters of our own choices to hate those whom we believe to be different from ourselves. So perhaps we would serve God better if we utilized biblical scriptures to look into our own hearts, rather than to browbeat or hate others.",
