   "Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2003\n \n South Africa and Sweden Outkill the U.S.\n \n The blame-America-firsters such as stupid white man Michael Moore try to depict the United States as a hotbed of murder and violence, but this time they're even wronger than usual.\n \n South Africa is the world's bloodiest nation, The Economist notes, with a shocking 114.8 murders for each 100,000 people, compared to only six in the U.S. and two in Japan, according to Interpol.\n \n More than 21,000 South Africans were killed last year, \"worse than some war zones.\"\n \n Other countries that outkilled the U.S. on Interpol's list aren't a surprise: Brazil, Russia, Botswana, Zambia, Angola. \n \n But here's one that might startle you: Sweden, supposedly the land of granola-munching socialist peaceniks, had 10 murders for every 100,000 people. Yes, Sweden is branching out and is no longer just Suicide Central.\n \n Maybe Stockholm will take a cue from our Second Amendment and allow its citizens the right to defend themselves from its out-of-control population of greasy-haired blond killers.",
