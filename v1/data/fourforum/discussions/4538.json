   "http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html\n \n This is a list of \"fallicious arguments\", that have been referred to off and on in these forums for months. They seem to be geared to live debates in front of audiences, but largely apply to the written debate that goes on here.\n \n They seem to me to have a liberal slant. I believe it's hard to debate at all without slightly breaking some of them. I believe some of them are worth noting, some are nit-picky, some are good but have a liberal slant in their description, and a few are false.\n \n One of them is \"argument by personal charm. Example, Ronald Reagan. It helps if you have an opponent with much less personal charm. Charm may create trust, or a desire to please the speaker. This last is greatest if the audience feels sex appeal.\" \n \n It's a valid point, but wouldn't John F Kennedy's winning the 1960 debate with Richard Nixon be a better example? Or John Kerry picking pretty boy Edwards as his running mate?\n \n One that I think is false is the \"Slippery Slope Fallacy\". This attempts to refute 'incrementalism', a very real slippery slope that recent history proves with things like anti smoking, the EPA etc.\n \n What should be added to it, or subtracted from it - thoughts??",

This attempts to refute 'incrementalism', a very real slippery slope that recent history proves with things like anti smoking, the EPA etc.\n \n What should be added to it, or subtracted from it - thoughts??\n\n \n Well, I don't have any additions or subtractions of my own, but I do think that the \"Slippery Slope Fallacy\" is accurate, and I think it is very important for people here to understand what it is saying.\n \n The fallacy itself does not state that it is wrong to oppose issue X if issue X may eventually lead to something worse. It does say, however that issue X is not wrong. Just because issue X may lead to something bad bears no relevance to whether issue X itself is actually bad. So although someone might state \"I oppose issue X because it will lead to bad things\", that person would often be better off arguing not to oppose issue X, but to look for a way to support issue X while preventing the bad things it leads to from happening.",

It's THE reason the U.S. government has grown so exponentially in the last century.\n\n \n No, I don't think that is the reason. I think that people want government services. So when people hear that \"Republicans want to cut funding for Program 1\", people get unhappy and vote against them. When they hear \"Democrats want to cut funding for Program 2\" they again get angry. Furthermore, a lot of wealthy interest groups often have strong support for a particular program, and opposing such a program could cause you to lose funding. When both the groups that fund you and the majority opposing cutting funding to a program, it is really difficult to get rid of it.\n \n Anyhow, even if it seems that no one in our society is willing to stop at some point, this fallacy still holds true. Issue X is still morally good, it is only some other set of issues that is morally bad. I feel that it is much more common for people who are looking for any reason to oppose issue X to say, \"Well, I can't think of a reason why issue X is bad, but I can think of a reason why issue Y is bad, and issue X will lead to issue Y.\" Again, the most logical conclusion may very well be to support issue X while working to prevent issue Y. It is not to simply oppose both. Too many people use this argument as a reason to believe that issue X is wrong, but issue X is not wrong just because something that is wrong might follow it, and to think so is indeed a logical fallacy.",

Do they think the government can provide a service for them better, more effeciently than a private enterprise? Very few actually think that, but in many cases it doesn't stop them from preferring the government over private business, and there's a very simple reason for it.

   "I suppose that depends on which cases you define as \"worse\", though I will admit that same-sex marriage is more a civil liberties issue than a tax one. \n\n \n The cases I define as worse are most, (not all) of the increases in size and scope of the federal government in the last 100 years or so. One reason I say \"not all\", is because changes in technology have caused a few good increases. An example would be the interstate highway system. We didn't have it in 1905, and we need it today, and it's constitutional. \"Congress shall have power to......post roads\".\n \n \n \n \nEasier isn't the same as better. Sometimes by supporting the right cause, we open the door to the wrong one, and it may prove difficult to deal with the wrong one, but if it is truly wrong, it will not be impossible. \n\n \n When concerning the slippery slope, issue X is seldom if ever in stark contrast to issue Y. If issue X concerns bigger government, roughly half of the US favors both it AND issue Y, and the other half supports neither. \n \n \n \n \nI can't name such a change, for one change could always be interpreted as having led to something else; none of us really know what would have happened if any single bill hadn't been passed.

But the only really good example I can think of in example of the slippery slope is African American rights, which have led to Affirmative Action. And in truth, I'd take Affirmative Action over what we had before any day. \n\n \n How about Social Security? It's changed a lot since it was introduced by Roosevelt. There must have been some concern about the slippery slope back then, because FDR was making some interesting promises. It would be completly voluntary, 1% of the first $1400 of annual incomes would be enough, the money participants elected to put into the program would be tax deductible, it would not go into the general fund for other purposes, payments to retirees would never be taxed as income. Changes have been made, haven't they? Did they happen all at once, or a little at a time? You know the answer. We made it all the way to the late seventies before we started handing it out to 65 year old immigrants, who never paid a dime into it! \n \n \n \n \nAnd Bush has cut domestic spending? \n\n \n He hasn't allowed it to INCREASE as much as a Democrat administration would have.\n \n \n \n \nIf you look back further than a hundred years, then it isn't just liberals who look down on those people; it's everyone. \n\n \n Maybe in the case of slavery, but that really has nothing to do with the increase in government over the last 100 years. The reason I keep saying \"100 years\" is because I think if we had today's technology, with the same size government (in terms of tax percentage, and personal liberty) of 100 years ago, we'd be in pretty good shape. There would be problems with it that we don't have today, but I still think it would be better. \n \n \n \n \nNow that depends on your issue, but clearly if one man supports the end result, then there is a debate over whether or not it is bad in the first place. \n\n \n It's bad if that one man supports the end result, but DOESN'T SAY SO for fear of opposition. Many people who supported \"no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less\", had other things on their minds. (\"Oh come on, surely you can do without a cigarette for 2 little hours\") They wanted it banned on airlines, banned in restaraunts. But they didn't dare say it at that time. Both sides of politics are guilty of NOT saying things, but when it comes to domestic issues, I think Democrats are more interested in not saying things, because bigger domestic government is interested in making people's decisions for them. It's easier, when people are less informed.\n \n \n \n \nIt's not a fallacy to say that things might go to far, but it is a fallacy to state that issue X is wrong because of issue Y. It might not be a fallacy to say that you don't support issue X because issue Y might happen, ........\n\n \n But that seems to be the argument of the \"slippery slope fallacy\" supporters. It's a very credible argument that one issue can lead to a related, yet far more harsh issue, yet the fallacy list supporters immediately cry \"fallacy\". And it's not. History proves it.\n \n \n......but I think that because of this fallacy, people tend to ignore the more reasonable approach of supporting issue X while opposing issue Y. \n\n \n What people tend to do most of all is focus only on issue X, without giving a thought to issue Y. Democrats depend on it.\n \n \n \nAgain, no, but I can't name any that I consider examples of a slippery slope except Affirmative Action as stated above. Perhaps you could provide better examples than mine?\n\n \n I've heard recently that automakers are going to be required to equip new cars by (2008?) with sensors and a dashboard readout to warn the driver when his tire pressure is low. Nobody is really going to notice, the government has been in the car business for decades now - pollution standards, bumper standards, airbags, fuel milage standards. It's all happened in small steps. Let's cut our 100 year time period in half. If the tire pressure warning technology would have been available, how do you think the American public would have reacted to an announcement like this in 1955? I don't think the government had a thing to do with auto design in 1955. \n \n How many deaths are a result of underinflated tires? I'm sure there's a figure for it. If a study was performed, I'd bet my bottom dollar that dark colored cars, (black, dark blue, gray, etc.) are involved in more accidents than brightly colored cars (red, yellow, white, maybe silver) because they are less visible. Are there more deaths because of dark cars visibility than low tire pressures? If so, can't the federal government require cars to be painted bright colors? Dupont, PPG, and others that make car paint would pay millions in political campaign contributions to get it done. When does a free country cease to be free? Has it already happened?",

If issue X concerns bigger government, roughly half of the US favors both it AND issue Y, and the other half supports neither.\n\n \n I don't really consider this situation to be a slippery slope, for if half of the population already favors issue Y, the slippery slope isn't leading those people to change their views on issue Y. That would just be two victories by the group who supports issues X and Y, and if half the population favors both issues X and Y, either one is as likely to preceed the other, meaning that it isn't likely one caused the other. I think a slippery slope situation would exist when few people support issue Y, but this changes because issue X is allowed. Perhaps if most people do not realize that half the population supports issue Y, we are dealing more with a situation of intellectual dishonesty.\n \n \nHow about Social Security? It's changed a lot since it was introduced by Roosevelt. There must have been some concern about the slippery slope back then, because FDR was making some interesting promises.

We made it all the way to the late seventies before we started handing it out to 65 year old immigrants, who never paid a dime into it!\n\n \n Well, you're right, social security has changed dramatically. But this situation again is the sort of example I'm talking about. I believe we are better off having social security than we are not having it. Even if one doesn't support the latest changes to it, I think few would argue that we would have been better off never having implemented it.\n \n \nHe hasn't allowed it to INCREASE as much as a Democrat administration would have.\n\n \n You're probably right.\n \n \nMaybe in the case of slavery, but that really has nothing to do with the increase in government over the last 100 years. The reason I keep saying \"100 years\" is because I think if we had today's technology, with the same size government (in terms of tax percentage, and personal liberty) of 100 years ago, we'd be in pretty good shape. There would be problems with it that we don't have today, but I still think it would be better. \n\n \n See, I think you're sort of classifying government growth as part of the slippery slope argument, but I think this can again be used to further explain what I'm trying to say. The slippery slope argument could have been used at any particular size of our government's growth; it could be said that we should have no government at all because that government will eventually grow to sizes too large and we will lose some of our freedom. Every democracy before the US had turned into a monarchy or fallen apart, and one could argue that the same would happen for the US. But I consider that argument nothing but a fallacy, for although such a slippery slope could happen, it is possible to create a government which preserves freedom in a much more acceptable fashion than anarchy provided we put forth certain precautions. Even though my opponent might justify his case with the slippery slope argument, I would argue that it is a completely wrong stance to claim that we should have no government; the only right stance is that we should implement government with certain precautions in place to protect against tyranny.\n \n When looking at government spending, back when the government was passing bills that you thought were great, that you would pass too if you were a dictator, you would not have been justified in claiming that the government should not be passing those bills because they would lead to an increase in government size. For surely it is just as easy to stop the passage of a bill later down the chain of the slippery slope and just as easy to put precautions against sliding down the slope in place. In fact, it should be easier to stop passage of a later bill because there is a good reason to argue against it; you think it is actually wrong instead of just possibly leading to something wrong. I should argue then that it is just as much a fallacy to oppose any bill that is right in fear of what it might lead to as it is to live in anarchy for fear of eventual government tyranny. The right stance lies somewhere in between, in support of a bill that is right with proper precautions put into place.\n \n \nIt's bad if that one man supports the end result, but DOESN'T SAY SO for fear of opposition. Many people who supported \"no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less\", had other things on their minds. (\"Oh come on, surely you can do without a cigarette for 2 little hours\") They wanted it banned on airlines, banned in restaraunts. But they didn't dare say it at that time.\n\n \n See, I wouldn't say that this situation is a slippery slope situation; in this case, one side is using a tactic of partially implementing what they want the end result to be to further along their view as much as possible. It is passage of a bill with the intent to move further, not passage of a bill that will lead to unintentional results. However if the argument could best be made that people should not be allowed to smoke on flights of two hours or less but should be able to smoke on longer flights, the best and probably most likely to succeed solution would have been to support a law that denies smoking on flights of two hours or less while opposing restricting smoking on all flights.\n \n \nBoth sides of politics are guilty of NOT saying things, but when it comes to domestic issues, I think Democrats are more interested in not saying things, because bigger domestic government is interested in making people's decisions for them. It's easier, when people are less informed.\n\n \n Well, the intent of having elected officials is so that the officials can make the decisions for the people as a measure of putting a check on the power of the majority. But that's another discussion. I can agree that many elected Democrats are guilty of not saying things, but I think that if you are someone who understands the reasons why Democrats in general support a particular issue, it is far easier to understand the reasons a Democrat supports an issue than it is a Republican. But Republicans tend to leave things out as well; it is more necessary for a Republican to explain the economic impact of a decision, for the reasons for their decisions are not always as readily apparent to an uninformed individual, but they aren't saying much beyond that. Neither side has an intention to inform the public, not because they want to tyrannize but because they don't think the public has a long attention span for anything but blanket statements. And they're probably right.\n \n \nBut that seems to be the argument of the \"slippery slope fallacy\" supporters. It's a very credible argument that one issue can lead to a related, yet far more harsh issue, yet the fallacy list supporters immediately cry \"fallacy\". And it's not. History proves it.\n\n \n Well, you're right; it is not an untruth to make that claim, yet it is a fallacy to oppose an issue which is right because of what it might lead to. People who use the slippery slope fallacy refers to the claim that issue X is wrong because it might lead to something wrong. The slippery slope fallacy is taken further because often people point out the faults of the issue Y in an effort to show that they also apply to issue X. But the argument itself is still a logical error in that using the slippery slope to conclude that issue X is wrong brings us to a different conclusion than does using the slippery slope to conclude that issue X is right, but allowing it could create some unwanted side-effects.\n \n \nWhat people tend to do most of all is focus only on issue X, without giving a thought to issue Y. Democrats depend on it.\n\n \n I disagree; although Democrats are often in favor of more government institutions which likely makes their bills more likely to have side effects, they do not depend on ignorance of the side effects of their bills in order to succeed. Though I would argue that both sides are often willing to create ignorance of the negative effects of their actions.\n \n \nI've heard recently that automakers are going to be required to equip new cars by (2008?) with sensors and a dashboard readout to warn the driver when his tire pressure is low. Nobody is really going to notice, the government has been in the car business for decades now - pollution standards, bumper standards, airbags, fuel milage standards. It's all happened in small steps. Let's cut our 100 year time period in half. If the tire pressure warning technology would have been available, how do you think the American public would have reacted to an announcement like this in 1955? I don't think the government had a thing to do with auto design in 1955. \n \n How many deaths are a result of underinflated tires? I'm sure there's a figure for it. If a study was performed, I'd bet my bottom dollar that dark colored cars, (black, dark blue, gray, etc.) are involved in more accidents than brightly colored cars (red, yellow, white, maybe silver) because they are less visible. Are there more deaths because of dark cars visibility than low tire pressures? If so, can't the federal government require cars to be painted bright colors? Dupont, PPG, and others that make car paint would pay millions in political campaign contributions to get it done. When does a free country cease to be free? Has it already happened?\n\n \n You're right, that is pretty unreasonable, yet an tire air pressure sensor is a small price to pay for air bags and pollution standards, and it would certainly have been a more successful venture to oppose the air pressure sensor than air bags. Again, I don't think a case can be made that it is reasonable to oppose air bags because eventually we'd need tire air pressure sensors; the appropriate course of action would be to stop when we've gone too far.\n \n You're also right that we aren't free, but we give up our freedom as soon as we create a government. It is certainly our job to preserve freedom as much as possible, however, and I'd rather car manufacturers were not forced to have this tire air pressure sensor.",

   "Hmm, do you not think this function of government is a good thing? \n\n \n Yes, when it's clearly constitutional, as \"posting roads\" is. So much of what the federal government has incrementally, slippery sloped it's way into doing clashes with the 10th amendment. The states & people aren't being consulted.\n \n \n \n \nI don't really consider this situation to be a slippery slope, for if half of the population already favors issue Y, the slippery slope isn't leading those people to change their views on issue Y. That would just be two victories by the group who supports issues X and Y, and if half the population favors both issues X and Y, either one is as likely to preceed the other, meaning that it isn't likely one caused the other. \n\n \n OK, I can go along with that. If about half of the population supports issue Y, then it would not be a slippery slope if it passed.\n \n \n \n \n I think a slippery slope situation would exist when few people support issue Y, but this changes because issue X is allowed. Perhaps if most people do not realize that half the population supports issue Y, we are dealing more with a situation of intellectual dishonesty. \n\n \n I agree also, but rather than say \"few people\", it could be......25% of the people. And that 25% misleads the other 75% about their support of issue Y, until issue X is passed and in place for a number of years. The slippery slope and intellectual dishonesty go hand in hand.\n \n An example in my area - all through the 1990's, auto emission testing was debated and discussed, and it was implemented in the year 2000. The local newspaper heartily endorsed it. Their slanted news reports and editorials simply didn't address, or brushed off questions about the wisdom of testing brand new cars. (\"for the program to work properly, and financial considerations to be met, all cars must be tested\" every two years) As soon as two years went by, surprise!! 99% of new cars are passing!!!! The newspaper then heartily endorsed exempting cars 4 years old and newer, thereby shifting the entire financial burden of the contractually arranged program to older cars. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that most newspaper staff people drive newer cars. They knew if they'd been truthful about their feelings of testing newer cars from the beginning, the entire program certainly wouldn't have gotten off the ground. Thankfully, they haven't gotten their wish yet - Ky. has been voting in a lot of Republicans lately. It's a classic case of supporting issue X, with secret support of issue Y. Classic slippery slope.\n \n \n \n \nWell, you're right, social security has changed dramatically. But this situation again is the sort of example I'm talking about. I believe we are better off having social security than we are not having it. Even if one doesn't support the latest changes to it, I think few would argue that we would have been better off never having implemented it. \n\n \n Today, maybe yes. Tomorrow, maybe no. It needs WORK, and there are no easy answers. There never is, concerning an evolving government program.\n \n \n \n \nYou're probably right. \n\n \n So you'll start voting Republican now? emoticon_xclown \n \n \n \n \nSee, I think you're sort of classifying government growth as part of the slippery slope argument, but I think this can again be used to further explain what I'm trying to say.

(if banning smoking on airlines for 2 hours is good, wouldn't banning it altogether be better?)\n \n \n In fact, it should be easier to stop passage of a later bill because there is a good reason to argue against it; you think it is actually wrong instead of just possibly leading to something wrong. I should argue then that it is just as much a fallacy to oppose any bill that is right in fear of what it might lead to as it is to live in anarchy for fear of eventual government tyranny.

But argueing that it could lead to a total ban was an important part of their arguement. It was not a \"fallacy\".\n \n \n \n \nSee, I wouldn't say that this situation is a slippery slope situation; in this case, one side is using a tactic of partially implementing what they want the end result to be to further along their view as much as possible.

The previously passed 2 hour ban is the biggest ace the total ban supporters have. As I said above, they'd say, \"if a 2 hour ban is good, wouldn't a total ban be better?\" Those who supported the 2 hour ban but oppose a total ban have a hard time answering.\n \n \n \n \nWell, the intent of having elected officials is so that the officials can make the decisions for the people as a measure of putting a check on the power of the majority.

And I think that makes opposing abortion in the first week simply to avoid allowing it in the ninth month a good reason by itself to oppose it.\n \n \n \"If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin. \n\n \n I've heard that's true, marijuana really is a stepping stone to harder drugs. Now I know many will say that they use marijuana, and have no desire to try harder drugs. The question is what percentage of marijuana users move on to harder drugs. If a high enough percentage of them do, then not making marijuana legal is justified on that basis. It's not a fallacy.\n \n \n \"If I make an exception for you, then I'll have to make an exception for everyone. \n \n \n He claims that as a fallacy. When dealing with just about any type of group or organization, to maintain honesty and fairness, it's the truth. It's not a fallacy.\n \n \n \n \nI disagree; although Democrats are often in favor of more government institutions which likely makes their bills more likely to have side effects, they do not depend on ignorance of the side effects of their bills in order to succeed.

Thankfully, they haven't gotten their wish yet - Ky. has been voting in a lot of Republicans lately. It's a classic case of supporting issue X, with secret support of issue Y. Classic slippery slope.\n\n \n It's classic slippery slope except that the issue Y isn't actually being passed. The truth is that any law change has a risk of being taken a step further, and if we'd originally wanted it a step further, we'd have taken it there originally. So we can keep our laws the way they are, fixing no problems that we see, or we do something about it: fix the laws now and fight taking something too far when it goes too far. If our laws are bad now, it does us no good to sit around and assume that they'll always be bad. We must at least make the attempt to fix them; even if we do end up taking them too far, we'll still end up with bad laws again, and we'll just have to try to fix them again.\n \n What I don't think people who use the slippery slope argument understand is that the current situation is already bad, and to suggest that we do nothing to fix the current problem because a new one might appear is by definition a worse solution. By attempting a change, there is least a chance that no problem will appear, but if we leave the situation as it is, there is no chance that our problem will ever be fixed. I suppose if the problem that occurs because of the slippery slope it too great, it might be worthwhile to not fix our current problem, but that generally is not the case because slippery slope changes are generally small in comparison to the original change, which indicates that the original change addressed a larger, more important issue. Look at slavery, for example. One could have argued that if we allow blacks to become citizens, we'll eventually follow the slippery slope to the point where we give them Affirmative Action benefits, and that won't be fair. Well, that did happen, but Affirmative Action is a much smaller problem with far less bad consequences than slavery.\n \n The root of the fallacy of the slippery slope is that it presents no argument against issue X. By not providing such an argument, it admits that issue X is a good thing, and in doing so, it admits that we have a problem today which needs to be fixed. So even though there is a possible future problem, the use of the slippery slope argument means that there is a definite current problem, and it offers no suggestion on how to fix it.\n \n \nToday, maybe yes. Tomorrow, maybe no. It needs WORK, and there are no easy answers. There never is, concerning an evolving government program.\n\n \n It needs a solution, and we're trying to come up with one. When we see the negative effects of social security, we counter them. But we'd never even had the opportunity to create the right system if slippery-slope debaters had started with the assumption that it can never work.\n \n \nSo you'll start voting Republican now? emoticon_xclown\n\n \n Hah, of course not. Maybe I should mention this; I'm not sure that many people who vote republican understand it. Strong supporters of Democrats tend to be strong supporters of Democrats because of social and moral issues. I am moderate when it comes to fiscal issues; I think we need to cut government spending. But I'm not going to even consider voting for Republicans until they decide to stop forcing their own religion, lifestyle, and morality upon everyone.\n \n \nIt's all in the constitution.\n\n \n The Constitution is the ultimate slippery slope. People who opposed it said that it would eventually have complete power over the states, that it would force states to outlaw slavery, that it would cause people to eventually become uncaring about government. But it did those things because it had to; those opponents failed to provide a solution of their own, to address the problems that the Constitution solved.\n \n \nI think it's far harder to stop a bill later down the chain (issue Y) because proponents of issue X point to IT as the main reason to support issue Y. (if banning smoking on airlines for 2 hours is good, wouldn't banning it altogether be better?)\n\n \n People don't tend to point at issue X to be the main reason for supporting issue Y; they tend to say that the same set of logic can be used to justify both. In the case of airline tickets, that wouldn't be the case; the same set of logic which justified banning smoking on only two-hour flights can't be used to justify banning smoking on all flights. New justification for extending the ban needs to be provided. And you can argue against that. You can say, \"We only put the ban on two hour flights because people can handle two hours without smoking. People can't handle four or five hours.\" Maybe people will still institute the ban, but they'd do it because they saw the benefits of banning smoking on two hour flights, and they are now willing to justify banning smoking on all flights in favor of those new benefits. It's still slippery slope, but if the reasons for only having a two hour ban are still valid, then you can more easily argue against a complete ban then you can against having a two hour ban.\n \n \nUsing the 2 hour smoking ban again, I don't think those who opposed it did so ONLY because they thought it would lead to a total ban - they simply didn't think it was a victory for freedom. But argueing that it could lead to a total ban was an important part of their arguement. It was not a \"fallacy\".\n\n \n But it was a fallacy. You are not logically justified in opposing the two hour ban based on a slippery slope unless you believe that there is any problem with our current situation or our current situation is better. In the case of a two hour smoking ban, you believe that it is better to allow people the freedom to smoke on any flight; the slippery slope argument doesn't play any part in that. It is also invalid to use the slippery slope reasoning to try to convince your opponent that he is wrong, because again that argument only matters if we admit that there is a problem today. If your opponent believes there is a problem today, saying that we should do nothing to fix it because there is a chance that more problems will arise is a failure to address our current problems (which your opponent believes we have). It is only logical to try to convince your opponent that we actually don't have a problem today, and the slippery slope argument can never do that.\n \n The slippery slope does sometimes happen, but it is a logical fallacy to use it as a reason to oppose a change.\n \n \nI don't think it would be most likely to succeed at all. The previously passed 2 hour ban is the biggest ace the total ban supporters have. As I said above, they'd say, \"if a 2 hour ban is good, wouldn't a total ban be better?\" Those who supported the 2 hour ban but oppose a total ban have a hard time answering.\n\n \n Well, I'm not arguing that this won't happen. People are less opposed to smaller changes at a time. It should be easy to answer: we made it only two hours for a reason. If we'd thought it was a good idea to institute a full ban, we'd have done that.\n \n \nIn the Don Lindsay link I used to start this thread, here are his three examples of the slippery slope fallacy;\n\n \n The examples on that site have been consistantly trash. It is not a logical fallacy to say that legalizing abortion in the first week will make it more likely to legalize all abortion. But it is a logical fallacy to use that as a reason to say that we should not legalize abortion in the first week. To use that as a reason is to imply that even if there is a problem today, we should still not fix that problem because there is a possibility of a new problem appearing. That is bad logic because it does not address the current problem, it uses the existence of a lesser problem to justify ignoring the current problem, it ignores the fact that slippery slopes don't always happen meaning that we're replacing a certain problem with a possible one, and it makes it impossible for us to ever arrive that the correct solution.\n \n I don't think the marijuana argument is exactly a case of slippery slope but of the harms of marijuana. If we can say \"One of the harms of marijuana is that it causes people to try heroine\" then we have identified a specific harm caused by marijuana. Since we can also make the logical claim that legalizing marijuana causes more people to use it, we can make the logical conclusion that legalizing marijuana causes more people to try heroine. This is different than saying that legalizing marijuana will lead to the legalization of heroine. In this case, we are saying that \"One of the harms of legalizing marijuana is that it causes people to change their political outlook on legalizing drugs\". Although neither addresses the current problem, the first is a problem inherent in using marijuana while the second is only a temporary problem caused by the recent law change. The first says \"legalizing marijuana creates a new problem\" while the second says \"if we get things exactly right, we might go back to having a problem.\" Or more simply, the first says \"legalizing marijuana is the wrong law to have\" while the second says \"even if legalizing marijuana is the right law to have, we'll have the chance at creating a new wrong law\". It ignores the fact that we'll never get the right laws if we never allow ourselves to change the laws.\n \n His third example, the \"If I give you one, then I'll have to give one to everyone\" example, is in a sense a good example, but it isn't fully thought out. For to assume that the only problem with the situation is this, then we assume that you have additional need to have whatever I'm giving out, and I don't have enough for everyone. But you need what I'm giving out, so the correct solution isn't to say, \"Too bad for you\" it's to say, \"Okay, I'll give one to you, and I'll try to stop anyone else from taking one. If I have to put up with someone else taking one, I will, but I'll try to change that too.\"\n \n \nBut you weren't asked, and the 10th amendment says that you should have been. We would have to determine how we should be asked about this type of thing on a case by case basis, whether by a vote, or (as I believe in this case) by the peoples buying habits. I believe the people would have noticed the fact that they weren't asked in 1955, but we weren't as far down the slope then.\n\n \n The tenth amendment as easily says that state governments should be allowed to decide the issue.\n \n But I'm going to state that under no circumstances should we have put those issues up to a vote. The majority only cares about the majority, and they are largely uninformed. If we'd put it up to a vote, every car would have air bags, every car would have air pressure gauges, and every car would have automatic windows and a lifetime warranty. We'd have ban on smoking in airplanes, in restrauants, and probably in any public place. The majority votes for what sounds good, not for what is good. They don't care about freedoms of a car company or of a smoker, they care about having better cars and not having smoke in their own face. That's why we don't leave these decisions up to majority votes, we leave them up to decision by a legislature whose job it is to become informed on these issues and figure out which one benefits everyone the most.",

So we can keep our laws the way they are, fixing no problems that we see, or we do something about it: fix the laws now and fight taking something too far when it goes too far. If our laws are bad now, it does us no good to sit around and assume that they'll always be bad. We must at least make the attempt to fix them; even if we do end up taking them too far, we'll still end up with bad laws again, and we'll just have to try to fix them again.\n \n What I don't think people who use the slippery slope argument understand is that the current situation is already bad, and to suggest that we do nothing to fix the current problem because a new one might appear is by definition a worse solution. By attempting a change, there is least a chance that no problem will appear, but if we leave the situation as it is, there is no chance that our problem will ever be fixed. I suppose if the problem that occurs because of the slippery slope it too great, it might be worthwhile to not fix our current problem, but that generally is not the case because slippery slope changes are generally small in comparison to the original change, which indicates that the original change addressed a larger, more important issue. Look at slavery, for example. One could have argued that if we allow blacks to become citizens, we'll eventually follow the slippery slope to the point where we give them Affirmative Action benefits, and that won't be fair. Well, that did happen, but Affirmative Action is a much smaller problem with far less bad consequences than slavery. \n \n The root of the fallacy of the slippery slope is that it presents no argument against issue X. By not providing such an argument, it admits that issue X is a good thing, and in doing so, it admits that we have a problem today which needs to be fixed. So even though there is a possible future problem, the use of the slippery slope argument means that there is a definite current problem, and it offers no suggestion on how to fix it. \n\n \n In our society, with our constitution, with our ideas of limited government, we should ask what issue X does for limited government. If there's no answer, then that presents an argument against it. You're always talking about \"fixing problems\", \"attempting changes\", etc. Limited government isn't perfection, and shouldn't attempt to be. A notable percentage of any population will be better off if a government holds it's hand. But this stifles \"pursuit of happiness\" of ALL of that population.\n \n \n \n \nIt needs a solution, and we're trying to come up with one. When we see the negative effects of social security, we counter them. But we'd never even had the opportunity to create the right system if slippery-slope debaters had started with the assumption that it can never work. \n\n \n It's debatable if it was the right system. Free market systems work, and usually even fix negative effects themselves. It's not always pretty. A cost of limited government.\n \n \n \n \nHah, of course not. Maybe I should mention this; I'm not sure that many people who vote republican understand it. Strong supporters of Democrats tend to be strong supporters of Democrats because of social and moral issues. I am moderate when it comes to fiscal issues; I think we need to cut government spending. But I'm not going to even consider voting for Republicans until they decide to stop forcing their own religion, lifestyle, and morality upon everyone. \n\n \n Now really, which is forced on you more; religion, lifestyle, and morality, or \"safety\", and a \"clean\" environment? \n \n \n \n \nThe Constitution is the ultimate slippery slope. People who opposed it said that it would eventually have complete power over the states, that it would force states to outlaw slavery, that it would cause people to eventually become uncaring about government. But it did those things because it had to; those opponents failed to provide a solution of their own, to address the problems that the Constitution solved. \n\n \n The constitution isn't the slippery slope, it's the fault of it's interpretation, allowing it to \"change with the times\".\n \n \n \n \nPeople don't tend to point at issue X to be the main reason for supporting issue Y; they tend to say that the same set of logic can be used to justify both. In the case of airline tickets, that wouldn't be the case; the same set of logic which justified banning smoking on only two-hour flights can't be used to justify banning smoking on all flights. New justification for extending the ban needs to be provided. And you can argue against that. You can say, \"We only put the ban on two hour flights because people can handle two hours without smoking. People can't handle four or five hours.\" Maybe people will still institute the ban, but they'd do it because they saw the benefits of banning smoking on two hour flights, and they are now willing to justify banning smoking on all flights in favor of those new benefits. It's still slippery slope, but if the reasons for only having a two hour ban are still valid, then you can more easily argue against a complete ban then you can against having a two hour ban. \n\n \n Agree to disagree. I think there are too many examples in U.S. history (the past 100 years) that show that it's hard to stop the \"total ban\", after a successful \"partial ban\".\n \n \n \n \nBut it was a fallacy. You are not logically justified in opposing the two hour ban based on a slippery slope unless you believe that there is any problem with our current situation or our current situation is better. In the case of a two hour smoking ban, you believe that it is better to allow people the freedom to smoke on any flight; the slippery slope argument doesn't play any part in that. It is also invalid to use the slippery slope reasoning to try to convince your opponent that he is wrong, because again that argument only matters if we admit that there is a problem today. If your opponent believes there is a problem today, saying that we should do nothing to fix it because there is a chance that more problems will arise is a failure to address our current problems (which your opponent believes we have). It is only logical to try to convince your opponent that we actually don't have a problem today, and the slippery slope argument can never do that.\n \n The slippery slope does sometimes happen, but it is a logical fallacy to use it as a reason to oppose a change. \n\n \n It is when one favors small government.\n \n \n \n \nWell, I'm not arguing that this won't happen. People are less opposed to smaller changes at a time. It should be easy to answer: we made it only two hours for a reason. If we'd thought it was a good idea to institute a full ban, we'd have done that. \n\n \n See my auto emissions testing description above. One big step seldom works - too big a shock - 2 or 3 small shocks work.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe examples on that site have been consistantly trash. It is not a logical fallacy to say that legalizing abortion in the first week will make it more likely to legalize all abortion. But it is a logical fallacy to use that as a reason to say that we should not legalize abortion in the first week. To use that as a reason is to imply that even if there is a problem today, we should still not fix that problem because there is a possibility of a new problem appearing. That is bad logic because it does not address the current problem, it uses the existence of a lesser problem to justify ignoring the current problem, it ignores the fact that slippery slopes don't always happen meaning that we're replacing a certain problem with a possible one, and it makes it impossible for us to ever arrive that the correct solution.\n \n I don't think the marijuana argument is exactly a case of slippery slope but of the harms of marijuana. If we can say \"One of the harms of marijuana is that it causes people to try heroine\" then we have identified a specific harm caused by marijuana. Since we can also make the logical claim that legalizing marijuana causes more people to use it, we can make the logical conclusion that legalizing marijuana causes more people to try heroine. This is different than saying that legalizing marijuana will lead to the legalization of heroine. In this case, we are saying that \"One of the harms of legalizing marijuana is that it causes people to change their political outlook on legalizing drugs\". Although neither addresses the current problem, the first is a problem inherent in using marijuana while the second is only a temporary problem caused by the recent law change. The first says \"legalizing marijuana creates a new problem\" while the second says \"if we get things exactly right, we might go back to having a problem.\" Or more simply, the first says \"legalizing marijuana is the wrong law to have\" while the second says \"even if legalizing marijuana is the right law to have, we'll have the chance at creating a new wrong law\". It ignores the fact that we'll never get the right laws if we never allow ourselves to change the laws. \n\n \n But there is CERTAINTY in how past laws work, and uncertainty in how future laws will work.\n \n \nHis third example, the \"If I give you one, then I'll have to give one to everyone\" example, is in a sense a good example, but it isn't fully thought out. For to assume that the only problem with the situation is this, then we assume that you have additional need to have whatever I'm giving out, and I don't have enough for everyone. But you need what I'm giving out, so the correct solution isn't to say, \"Too bad for you\" it's to say, \"Okay, I'll give one to you, and I'll try to stop anyone else from taking one. If I have to put up with someone else taking one, I will, but I'll try to change that too.\" \n\n \n Somebody will just about always end up hearing \"too bad for you\", when all's said & done. With small government, it's the underachiever, with big government, it's the achiever.\n \n \n \n \nThe tenth amendment as easily says that state governments should be allowed to decide the issue.\n \n But I'm going to state that under no circumstances should we have put those issues up to a vote. The majority only cares about the majority, and they are largely uninformed. If we'd put it up to a vote, every car would have air bags, every car would have air pressure gauges, and every car would have automatic windows and a lifetime warranty. \n \n \n Not if they're fully informed. Not if they are told how much it will COST them.\n \n \nWe'd have ban on smoking in airplanes, in restrauants, and probably in any public place. The majority votes for what sounds good, not for what is good. They don't care about freedoms of a car company or of a smoker, they care about having better cars and not having smoke in their own face. \n\n \n I don't think we've reached that point yet. Selfishness does abound, but at least some people still realize that when they don't support their neighbor's freedom, their neighbor won't support their freedom in return. Many people do something in their lives that the majority doesn't do. Some people don't like soft drinks but like coffee, and you're not likely to see them complaining about the caffeine in soft drinks.\n \n \n \nThat's why we don't leave these decisions up to majority votes, we leave them up to decision by a legislature whose job it is to become informed on these issues and figure out which one benefits everyone the most.\n\n \n Especially THEMSELVES. That's why we have to be carefull which decisions we leave up to them.",

   "I think there's just about always intellectual dishonesty when issue X is a change that is not inspired by free markets. Someone gains something, someone else loses something. But the elitist that implemented it NEVER loses.\n\n \n Someone generally does gain and someone generally does lose, but it isn't always the case that this is intellectual dishonesty. It is as possible that the person who is losing has far too much in the first place. The person who is losing might be just giving back what he has taken. Intellectual dishonesty exists only when one person supports an issue while secretly attempting it to take it further than he states.\n \n \nBut there's a danger that it could be, and the uncertainty of it affects economics.\n\n \n As I said, any new law has the possibility of going too far, but it doesn't mean we should never fix problems in our laws. We must at least try.\n \n \nIn our society, with our constitution, with our ideas of limited government, we should ask what issue X does for limited government. If there's no answer, then that presents an argument against it. You're always talking about \"fixing problems\", \"attempting changes\", etc. Limited government isn't perfection, and shouldn't attempt to be. A notable percentage of any population will be better off if a government holds it's hand. But this stifles \"pursuit of happiness\" of ALL of that population.\n\n \n You're right, sort of. I wouldn't have said, \"we should ask what issue X does for limited government\", I would have said \"we should ask what issue X does to support freedom, equality, and happiness\" because limited government exists only because it is the best way to protect those things. Still, the idea that you bring up here is the correct one. We should indeed ask what the benefits of issue X are, and if there are none, we probably shouldn't enact it. But the slippery slope argument says, \"Well yes, I realize that issue X agrees with limited government, but it could be taken too far.\" And that is why it is wrong to use the slippery slope argument. The reasoning behind a slippery slope argument allows us to argue against limited government because limited government could be taken too far. But that's not a good reason.\n \n The issues you bring up, most of those issues are wrong before they're even taken too far, and we should be arguing against them not because of the slippery slope but because they're wrong. If we want to point out that this will lead to even more wrong things, we can, and we wouldn't be wrong about that, but that would never be a reason for someone on either side to change his mind on the issue.\n \n \nIt's debatable if it was the right system. Free market systems work, and usually even fix negative effects themselves. It's not always pretty. A cost of limited government.\n\n \n Well, it is debatable whether social security is a good thing, and I do believe there are many problems with a limited government and a free market, and there are many things we can't leave up to the free market to solve. However, that's another discussion. According to the slippery slope argument, issue X is correct or it doesn't matter whether it is correct; we should oppose it because it could lead to something wrong.\n \n \nNow really, which is forced on you more; religion, lifestyle, and morality, or \"safety\", and a \"clean\" environment?\n\n \n Religion, lifestyle, and morality are forced upon me every second of every day, which is as often as I wish that the government recognized my lifestyle and religion as equal. They are forced upon many people I know in worse ways, and many people I don't know in even worse ways. These people wish they were able to enjoy the benefits of marriage every second of every day. Evironmental protections and safety protections at least exist with a reason. And although their effect has a larger impact on society as a whole, that impact affects no single individual as much as imposing one's religion, lifestyle and morality affects the individual who is imposed upon.\n \n \n \n \nThe constitution isn't the slippery slope, it's the fault of it's interpretation, allowing it to \"change with the times\".\n\n \n Yet disallowing it to change would have forced it to crumble long ago. The Constitution was designed to change, to be interpreted to match the times, and in that design it created a slippery slope. But it was the only design that could have worked. The slippery slope argument meant nothing.\n \n \nAgree to disagree. I think there are too many examples in U.S. history (the past 100 years) that show that it's hard to stop the \"total ban\", after a successful \"partial ban\".\n\n \n Agreeing to disagree never resolves the problem. The truth is that in the case of a partial ban, people who support the partial ban almost always believe that the activity is immoral and need no convincing to support the total ban. And in truth, if the partial ban is correct, then usually the total ban is correct as well. If the total ban is wrong, then usually the partial ban is also wrong. If one believes a partial ban is right or wrong, that person tends to believe the same about the total ban, and that's why so many partial bans become total bans. But the slippery slope isn't always about partial bans. If we free the slaves, they'll ask for more. If we allow same-sex marriage, they'll ask for polygamous and incestuous marriage. If we allow marijuana, we'll allow more drugs. If we stop forcing our own morality upon the minority, they'll want us to stop doing it even more.\n \n Partial bans do turn into total bans, but that's because the majority of people always believed a total ban is the right thing to do. The only reason you see partial bans is because politicians try to compromise to stay elected, not because anyone ever believed a compromise was the right thing to do.\n \n \nIt is when one favors small government.\n\n \n If issue X is an attack on small government, then you should probably be voting against it in the first place. You should be arguing against it for that reason. You shouldn't be arguing against it because some other issue is an attack on limited government. If issue X is a good thing but issue Y is an attack on limited government, then you should look for a way to promote issue X while preventing issue Y, and that is a reasonable thing to ask. But you're describing situations where you really disagree with both issues X and Y. That's not slippery slope; that's something wrong followed by something worse.\n \n \nSee my auto emissions testing description above. One big step seldom works - too big a shock - 2 or 3 small shocks work.\n\n \n You're right, of course. It is not because we are not talking about the situation where issue X is good yet issue Y is bad. We're talking about the situation where some people want neither issue and others want both, and politicians compromise to get issue Y passed in small steps at a time so they won't offend opponents of the issue as much as they would have. That isn't slippery slope. Only when you agree with issue X but oppose issue Y can we have a slippery slope because the slippery slope argument rests on the idea that it doesn't matter if issue X is right or wrong. The slippery slope suggests that even if you think issue X is right, we should not allow issue X because it'll lead to issue Y. And that isn't logical reasoning; the logical reasoning will always be to work toward the right solution and oppose the wrong one. If issue X is the right thing to do, then staying where we are is just as bad as going too far. If I can show that issue X is right, the slippery slope argument means nothing.\n \n \nBut there is CERTAINTY in how past laws work, and uncertainty in how future laws will work.\n\n \n Absolutely, and in the case of the slippery slope, we know with certainty that our current laws are wrong. We know that issue X is correct and not having issue X is wrong. Lincoln couldn't have known for certain what would happen if our society had no slavery laws, but he did know that our current laws were wrong, and that is enough. If I can show you that our current laws are wrong, then the only certainty we can have is that we need to change those laws.\n \n \nSomebody will just about always end up hearing \"too bad for you\", when all's said & done. With small government, it's the underachiever, with big government, it's the achiever.\n\n \n But the definition of achiever is defined by the government. In a different government system, the achiever would not be the most cunning businessman but perhaps the best warrior, the hardest worker, or the individual who helps the most people.\n \n Still, I think it is generally right to support small government, and that's the reason we should oppose those bans you're talking about, not the slippery slope argument. And the slippery slope argument is as often used to support keeping the government large as it is to support keeping the government small. In both cases, the slippery slope argument has no place.\n \n \nNot if they're fully informed. Not if they are told how much it will COST them.\n\n \n Well first, people are never informed, and you should know this. They would vote exactly as I described because it sounds good. Second, the fact that informed people will vote for what benefits themselves indicates that in any such vote, the majority will oppress the minority because doing so benefits themselves.\n \n \nI don't think we've reached that point yet. Selfishness does abound, but at least some people still realize that when they don't support their neighbor's freedom, their neighbor won't support their freedom in return. Many people do something in their lives that the majority doesn't do. Some people don't like soft drinks but like coffee, and you're not likely to see them complaining about the caffeine in soft drinks.\n\n \n But do people care that their neighbor won't support their freedom? Is that even true? If I remember correctly, you oppose same-sex marriage. Do you care that same-sex couples won't support your freedom? Or do you realize that same-sex couples don't have enough sway to even come close to taking away your freedom, and even if they did, they wouldn't want to take away your freedom because they understand how horrible that can be? The vast majority of people have no problem or fears taking away the rights of the minority, and they've got no reason to fear it. The majority will oppress as many people as it can, and it will never see payback for all the people it's hurt.\n \n \nEspecially THEMSELVES. That's why we have to be carefull which decisions we leave up to them.\n\n \n Yes, politicans will often choose to benefit themselves, but benefiting themselves means getting reelected and trying to become famous. To do this, politicians have to try to help as many people as possible. The only exception to this is if one faction is in a majority. In that case, they could simply appease that faction and continually get reelected. That's why we need one representative to represent an extremely large number of people; that way it is tougher for one faction to gain a majority (though certainly it does happen).",

We may not have bigger brains, but our logic-toolbox has gained some pretty funky innovations in the past 100 years - the development of symbolic logic, for example, and its derivatives.\n \nSome of them appear to me to be an attempt to be a defence against conservatism.\n No, moreso a defence against all stripes of sloppy inference. Logic, fortunately, implies no particular political ideology. It's a tool for analyzing arguments and computing inferences. \n \nThe slippery slope is the main way our \"limited\" government has grown so big. It's not a fallacy IMO.\n I think you're confusing a fallacy of deductive inference with the form of social change. The reason why the slippery slope fallacy is a fallacy is because deductive or truth-preserving logics deal in discrete propositions. The slippery slope fallacy uses a series of near-equivalence identity statements rather than a series of actual equivalence identity statements. \n \n Here's an example of what I mean. \n \n Suppose A is not the same as C. \n \n If A is virtually the same as B\n And B is virtually the same as C\n Then A is the same as C. \n \n Notice how in the first two lines I propose that each equivalence is such that it is sufficient for an identity, and how I used that slight-of-hand to say that because those equivalences appear sufficient that they are sufficient. \n \n Where I say \"virtually\" that is where the fallacy lies because it trades on \"virtually the same\" being identical to \"the same\". \"Virtually the same\" can only be \"the same\" where a criteria of relevance exists to govern the relationship such that \"virtually the same\" is taken to mean \"possessing identity sufficient to our purpose here.\"\n \n\"Argument By Personal Charm\"? Is there a clear cut definition of exactly what personal charm is? It's just about the biggest factor in how politicians get elected - nothing false about that.\n I think that the point is that when someone makes an argument how charmingly they make it is irrelevant. Where two people give the same argument, and one gives it in a more charming manner than the other, it is a fallacy to presume that the latter has given a better argument. They've presented it better, which is a good thing, but assuming the actual argument is better because of that presentation is a fallacy - like thinking a particular car will go faster if you paint it a more pleasing colour. \n \n So politicians do get elected, or not, on the basis of personal charm. No fallacy there. Holding arguments to be valid and sound on the basis of charming presentation is a fallacy. \n \nSome \"fallacies\" in these lists make good sense, but so many of them seem to be solely intended to benefit the American left.\n I really hadn't noticed. If you're thinking of them like you did the \"Argument by Personal Charm\", then you may be mistaking logical arguments for conversational arguments. A logical argument is mechanical method of reasoning where a conversational argument is a social activity. Logical arguments can be used in conversational arguments to make a point, but they can also be used in mathematics, computer science, and so on. \n \n The problem, as I see it, is that people use the term \"logic\" these days as a colloquial term for \"argument\". Logic is simply the form, or the syntax, of reasoning - quite apart from content. Logic, combined with propositions, constitutes arguments.",

   "Not really, if the very minor financial breaks married heterosexuals get over homosexuals AND single people such as myself was the worst case of redistribution of wealth we had, we'd be in really good shape. \n \n \n \n Cutting it is tough, it's hard to climb BACK UP the slippery slope - it's much easier not to SLIDE DOWN in the first place, as we've done so much in the last 100 years. \n \n Holding the line on spending is more realistic than cutting it. Recognizing that issue x often leads to issue y is a good way to do it. Maybe we need to discuss examples. Can you name an issue X in the last 100 years; an increase in federal government spending, or a loss of individual liberty, that has been a good thing, and hasn't lead to something else? If so, how does it relate to the constitution?\n \n \n \n \n \n You left out the word DOMESTIC. 9/11, Iraq etc. is another thread.\n \n \n \n \n \n Looked down upon by liberals, with their personal definition of \"hurting\". \n \n \n \n That's exactly right, because most people who support issue X already have issue Y in their crafty little minds. They know how incrementalism works. THAT is what history has proven.\n \n \n \n \n You just said that it's a fallacy that things go too far, but since no one spoke up, things went too far!!!!! :) \n \n Look at how much more government is involved in our everyday lives in 2005 than it was in 1905. Can you name a tax increase, or a loss of personal liberty, that made ONE change over that 100 year period? I can name several that made many little changes.\n\n \n You got to understand Mark........\"Little Man's\" favorite word is fallacy.he uses it in almost every post.........",

We may not have bigger brains, but our logic-toolbox has gained some pretty funky innovations in the past 100 years - the development of symbolic logic, for example, and its derivatives. \n\n \n But not everyone has equal access to the funky innovations. When it comes to political decisions, we shouldn't allow only those familiar with symbolic logic and it's derivatives to make political decisions that affect the lives of everyone. There is a word for thinking that we should - liberalism.\n \n \n \n No, moreso a defence against all stripes of sloppy inference. Logic, fortunately, implies no particular political ideology. It's a tool for analyzing arguments and computing inferences. \n\n \n Logic doesn't, but these lists of \"fallicious arguments\" do. \n \n \n \n I think you're confusing a fallacy of deductive inference with the form of social change. \n\n \n It's not me who's confusing it, it's those who yell \"slippery slope fallacy\" when someone points out that one tax increase can lead to another, or one environmental regulation can lead to another.\n \n \n I think that the point is that when someone makes an argument how charmingly they make it is irrelevant. Where two people give the same argument, and one gives it in a more charming manner than the other, it is a fallacy to presume that the latter has given a better argument.

No fallacy there. Holding arguments to be valid and sound on the basis of charming presentation is a fallacy. \n\n \n I agree, but it goes both ways. The charmer shouldn't be penalized for being charming. If his OPPONENT brings the subject up, it can distract, and therefore penalize. These fallacy lists aren't so bad if non participants silently consider them, but when participants toss them around, they can be distracting, and unfair. It happens often on these forums - not nearly as big a deal in written debate as it would be in a live, verbal debate.\n \n \n I really hadn't noticed. If you're thinking of them like you did the \"Argument by Personal Charm\", then you may be mistaking logical arguments for conversational arguments. A logical argument is mechanical method of reasoning where a conversational argument is a social activity. Logical arguments can be used in conversational arguments to make a point, but they can also be used in mathematics, computer science, and so on. \n\n \n I noticed, because I see them being used not so much in mathmatics or computer science, their purpose seems to be POLITICAL. In Lindsay's list, one of his examples in \"Ad Hominem\" attacks, is, \"a common form is an attack on sincerity. For example, How can you argue for vegetarianism when you wear leather shoes?\" Lindsay seems to imply that it's a fallacy to question sincerity - I think it's a valid question. It the same as when a Hollywood elite who condemns the unwashed masses for driving gas guzzling, polluting SUV's, yet drives one himself. The sincerity of those who want to make political decisions, and then excempt themselves from them should be questioned by those who consider themselves free. Liberalism often disagrees.\n \n \nThe problem, as I see it, is that people use the term \"logic\" these days as a colloquial term for \"argument\". Logic is simply the form, or the syntax, of reasoning - quite apart from content. Logic, combined with propositions, constitutes arguments.\n\n \n Do you see nothing but logic in these fallicious arguments lists, or do you see some being more questionable than others? Do you think they should be an active part of a debate, or only silently used by non participants?",
