It seems that we are stuck in a rut here because while leaving before Iraq is stable would destroy us as far as international opinion, tantamount to admitting defeat, while staying and supporting Iraq leads to closer ties with Iran, and in the real world, a closely allied Iran and Iraq will rule the ME, regardless of US wishes. \n \n \nWithout examining the causes here and now that created of a disaster of such epic proportions, how does one avoid being sucked into a repetition of that gross deceit?

Sure, let's just gloss over that insignificant detail. \n \n \n You and I both know that discovering the cause is not that important, because the American people are too apathetic to care. The next time we feel compelled to invade a nation, with reason or without, our politicians will beat the drums of war, claim that the only patriotic option is to follow them, and immediately the drooling XXXXXX that are the American people will line up to support whatever asinine agenda is being pushed.\n \n Think REAL HARD. How long did it take for the majority of Americans to pick up on the fact that the whole Iraqi fiasco was a crock? The evidence was there all along. No thinking person could have listened to our justifications for war and believed that garbage, which is why we could not sell it to the rest of the world. Those of us who dissented in the beginning were ridiculed for failing to support the idiocy. More than once people suggested that I should leave the country. It took YEARS before the US public picked up on the reality of the situation. Even after the Bush administration admitted that there were no WMDs, there was a significant portion of the US public trying to prove that there were.\n \n This is the American public. You really think that finding the cause will matter? You are talking about people who finance consumables on their credit cards, not an intelligent bunch. How many folks here have you seen argue thing adamantly, with no clue what they are talking about? Americans are sound byte people, not thinkers.",

Tony Blair evidently believed, or affected to believe, that the war against Iraq was justified. This is why an admittedly small British force (in comparison with the American effort) is stuck in Iraq with probably no prospect of disengagement until the US withdraws. \n \n Why Blair decided to support America in this crazy adventure is a mystery which I've not yet seen satisfactorily explained. Public opinion over here, in so far as anyone is actually awake, has a majority against any British involvement.",

I went to school, ensured that I become educated in a trade (actually 2 in my case), and applied myself to achieve the position that I am currently in. Even someone with a basic education who goes out and works every day is providing for themselves and their families. There is a great working class in this country who pride themselves on the ability to provide for themselves. Don't get me wrong that they can achieve all of it on their own, but in general I believe that the initiative is there. \n \n \nI find it difficult to accept that the average, individual US citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on TV. Voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit.\n\n I think that you tend to underestimate the average American. Most citizens are concerned about basic human needs, but being concerned about something and doing something about it are 2 different things. It is just like what happened down in N.O. during the Katrina fiasco. The people knew that they needed food and water, knew that they should have evacuated, knew that the storm was going to be a hazard to their liives, but yet they sat in their homes despite these glaring facts. This is the true apathy, those who simply rely on the government to save them, and do nothing to help themselves. The same people who did nothing to get themselves out of the city, but then had the nerve to whine that they were not being rescued or evacuated quickly enough. While these people make a lot of headlines, I do not see this as representative of the majority of the citizens in this country.\n \n As for local elections, I see those adds on television all the time. It is this time of the year when the television is flooded with negative adds about this candidate raising taxes, and that candidate cutting benefits for the elderly, and this guy setting criminals free, and this guy eating his young...blah blah blah. Not to mention the 3000 signs per square block per each candidate. If people really only did what the TV tells them to do, they would probably turn out en mass to vote in local elections. My guess is that most people realize that the big ticket items that really effect them are handled at the state and federal levels, and this is why you see higher voter turnout for these elections. I bet even you could not honestly name your all of your local representatives, and most people cannot even name members of the state assembly. Does this mean that these people do not care about issues that effect them? I doubt it. I think it probably means that people are more willing to focus their time in places where they think it will do the most good for them. \n \n But then again, that's all just my opinion.",

   "You simply qualified yourself for a job supplied or not supplied by society. While intuitive is present, I see no influence or control over the supply. \n \n As to apathy, if the general public was actually aware of how their system of government worked, they'd understand political power starts and is amassed at local levels to facilitate state and national committees with the power they wield. Put anything on the national tube and they get interested because that's the intent of mass advertising.\n \n And I do know the names and political loyalties of my local and national representatives. I even know some of them on a personal/business basis. But I'm not naive enough to believe my opinions, unless on a parallel with theirs, have any influence unless accompanied by money or other tangible exchanges. \n \n I believe the general public to be extremely ignorant of how the real world works. If any system of government functions at a level allowing full bellies, affordable breeding and entertainment, the public remains content. Among other instances of poor judgment, that apathetic contentment has put them in a position of providing basic consumables on high-interest credit cards and accumulating abnormal personal debt, something I don't consider sound intuitive.",

I just feel at the present time we need to clean up some other messes. Sure have a group set up like the 9-11 Commision or whatever and they can look into the reasons for the Iraq war. I just don't feel we needed to close down the whole Senate and what not for such a huge investigation amisdt all the other situations going on. \n \n The answer will sure enough come out as to what happened, unfortunately I honestly believe it's passed to late to even do something about it.
