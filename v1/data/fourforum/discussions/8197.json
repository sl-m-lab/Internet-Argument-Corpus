   "We have a huge responsiblity towards the planet... that pro choice attitude has been running right through humanities attitude towards nature for a very long time \"its my planet, I can do what I want with it\" but we cant... We arnt the owners of the planet we are the planets guradian, our attitude towards the earth and nature should be to care for and cherish our natural habitat \n \n obviously we are the \"crown of creation\" the highest form of life on the planet, now the topic at hand shows how the words of christ are filled with eternal wisdom \"the greatest among you must be your servent\" as the highest form of life on the planet we have a resposiblity to the earth, to serve it, but we have made it serve us, we have plunded our natural habitat instead of nurturing it, embracing it we have only looked to take from the earth and again christs words ring true in my ears \"it is better to give than to recieve\" and I think its beyond time we gave something back to the earth. \n \n In christian teaching, with the resurection of christ it wasnt only humanity that was raised up, it was the whole of creation, the world and everything in it became the footstool of christ, almighty god and everyone and everything had to be respected and loved as creatures of god and christians were given the task of bringing this good news along with the fact mankind had been given the opportunity to accept and once again take up our responsiblities as \"crown of creation\" and become the \"new tenants\" in his \"vineyard\" \n \n christ said \" I am the saviour of the world\" \n \n his teachings certainly support this statement especially in todays world because becoming servents of the world and giving to it instead of recieving from it and plundering our natural habitat is the only way creation can survive... Its no longer a matter of the \"right thing to do\" its a matter of our salvation. \n \n People say christianity has no meaning, no relevence to our time, and many ask me how I know Christianity is True..... if only people would open their eyes!",
