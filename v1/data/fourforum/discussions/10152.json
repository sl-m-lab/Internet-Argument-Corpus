   "I thought this was just a neat little story that showed how big a little dogs heart can be... \n \n Tiny dog saves baby from rattlesnake\n Sun Jul 22, 3:24 PM ET\n Zoey is a Chihuahua, but when a rattlesnake lunged at her owners' 1-year-old grandson, she was a real bulldog.\n \n Booker West was splashing his hands in a birdbath in his grandparents' northern Colorado back yard when the snake slithered up to the toddler, rattled and struck. Five-pound Zoey jumped in the way and took the bites.\n \n \"She got in between Booker and the snake, and that's when I heard her yipe,\" Monty Long, the boy's grandfather, said Thursday.\n \n The dog required treatment and for a time it appeared she might not survive the bites she suffered earlier this month. Now she prances about.\n \n \"These little bitty dogs, they just don't really get credit,\" Booker's grandma Denise Long told the Loveland Daily Reporter-Herald.",

You call the dog heroic and selfless which would imply that he knew there was danger and responded to protect the child. Without the ability to reason in advance, did the dog somehow magically know that the snake was going to bite the child? Did the dog evaluate the situation and think 'hmm...the kid could get hurt, I might want to jump in and do something to prevent that? \n \n More than likely, the dog was attracted by the rattle of the snake, and as such went to investigate the noise and upon finding the snake, attacked it out of instinct. It's just what they do.\n \n Calling the dog heroic and selfless is rediculous in the aspect that you would have to conclude that the dog knew the danger to itself, and acted anyway. Not likely. I'm sure the dog is not educated in the dangers of poisonous snakes. \n \n And for the record, daewoo in no way suggested that the dog reasoned about being able to withstand the venom due to it's high tolerance to it. He simply stated a fact, that they have a high tolerance to snake venom. The fact that they have a high tolerance for snake venom is another issue all together. Call it ev...err...an adaptation if you will.",

Pretty cold hearted deawoo, and totally misses the point of the thread, which was just to praise a brave little dog who pretty much definitely saved the life of a toddler who's chances of surviving that bite was slim to none.\n\n \n Others have summed it up pretty well. Your argument here is an interesting one. You seem to be attemtping to debunk my post by implying that I belieive the dog reasoned ahead of time that it was immune to the poison and (rightly) you scoff at that idea. Then you seem to hinge your argument on the idea that the dog reasoned ahead of time that the snake not only posed a threat, but posed a mortal threat to the infant. \n \n Now, back in the real world, unless the dog had been bitten by a rattlesnake before, it had NO IDEA that the snake was dangerous. There is a better than average chance that, being a city dog, it had NO IDEA what a snake was. Even though it had no idea what it was, its instinct would have been to kill it. \n \n As far as what exactly the dog saved the baby from...it was probably not so much a horrible death as it was an annoying stinging sensation and a small to moderate amount of uncomfortable swelling. It is pretty unusual for somebody to die of a snakebite...even if they get no treatment...and dying from a bite from a prairie rattle snake or a timber rattler is virtually unheard of. I have been bitten by a prairie rattlers on numerous occasions, as have most others around here who gather hay (the snakes are often found under hay bales in the field and strike when you lift the bale) and the result is a swollen area on my leg. Unless the individual is allergic to the venom (as some people are to bee venom) prairie rattlers and timber rattlers jsut aren't all that dangerous. If they ARE allergic to the venom they can go into anaphylactic shock, in which case an injection of ephinepherine is warranted. A snake enom allergy is EXTREMELY rare, though. I have never seen one, nor have I ever heard a first person report of an individual having one. \n \n So basically....we are back to the story. A terrier killed a snake...which is what terriers do.",
