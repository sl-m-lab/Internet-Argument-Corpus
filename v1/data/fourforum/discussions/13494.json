   "At n+1 Panel, the Cat Got Douthat's Tongue on Topic of of Gay Marriage\n View Story On One Page Print This Story Share This Story By Matt Frassica\n October 21, 2009 | 12:39 p.m\n \n Ross Douthat, conservative op-ed columnist for the New York Times, was made visibly uncomfortable for a moment while onstage last night at the New School's Tishman auditorium. Having sailed through a discussion titled \"Meet the Neo-Cons: They're Young, They're Bright, They Tilt to the Right\" alongside his friend and co-author Reihan Salam (Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Save the Working Class and Save the American Dream), moderated by Marco Roth of n+1 magazine, Mr. Douthat became suddenly fidgety when asked to respond to a question from the audience on gay marriage.\n \n The question came from Christopher Glazek, a fact-checker at The New Yorker, who wanted to know whether Mr. Douthat and Mr. Salam believed that former RNC chairman Ken Mehlman, who has apologized on behalf of his party for the Southern Strategy, should also apologize for the Republican party's gay politics.\n \n At first Mr. Douthat seemed unable to get a sentence out without interrupting himself and starting over. Then he explained: \"I am someone opposed to gay marriage who is deeply uncomfortable arguing the issue in public.\"\n \n Mr. Douthat indicated that he opposes gay marriage because of his religious beliefs, but that he does not like debating the issue in those terms. At one point he said that, sometimes, he feels like he should either change his mind, or simply resolve never to address the question in public.\n \n He added that the conservative opposition to gay marriage is \"a losing argument,\" and asked rhetorically if committed homosexual relationships ought to be denied the legal recognition accorded without hesitation to the fleeting enthusiasms of Britney Spears and Newt Gingrich.\n \n After the panel, Mr. Douthat told the Observer: \"If I were putting money on the future of gay marriage, I would bet on it.\"\n \n He added: \"The secular arguments against gay marriage, when they aren't just based on bigotry or custom, tend to be abstract in ways that don't find purchase in American political discourse. I say, 'Institutional support for reproduction,' you say, 'I love my boyfriend and I want to marry him.' Who wins that debate? You win that debate.\"\n \n Marco Roth, editor-at-large for n+1, interrupted. \"We're taking you to Stonewall,\" he told Mr. Douthat.\n \n Actually, the columnists and their hosts decamped to the considerably more middle-of-the road bar on Christopher Square, Kettle of Fish.\n At n+1 Panel, the Cat Got Douthat&#039;s Tongue on Topic of of Gay Marriage | The New York Observer",

   "It's rather irritating to listen to these political apologists!\n \n When are they gonna admit the rebranding of their party is little more than regurgitating the Southern Strategy but this time with different targets in mind? By attracting xian fundamentalists with holy hyperbole, they focus on a different kind of hate & intolerance.\n \n How did the faith of Jesus come to be known as intolerant, anti-love, anti-gay rights, pro-rich, pro-war, & only pro-American? \n \n Honestly, what has happened here?",

I mean I am not bound by some one else's religion when I go to the secretary of states office to be issued a drivers license or pay for the plates for my car. I am not bound by someone else's religion when I file my deed for my property with the county clerk, get a business license, or charter a corporation. So why should civil marriage be any different?",

You win that debate.\"\n\n Therein lies the problem.\n If a person looks at this message board and its variety of people who oppose gays on a regular basis, you'll notice something amusing about this issue.\n \n Most, with some specific exceptions, DO NOT try to give a secular justification in the matter of reasons people should be against gay marriage in the first place.\n Many of the posters try to approach the issue from the matter of EXISTING OPINIONS (regardless of how justified they aren't) and trying to argue that the EXISTENCE of the opinion in a voter somehow validates that opinion.\n That a sheer majority alone justifies the unconstitutional discrimination.\n emoticon_wow\n It does not.\n \n Others, like Archie and Easyrider, try to prevent \"reasons\" against gay marriage which readily invoke religious hypocrisy and religious fervor to a zealoted extreme.\n \n I keep up on the arguments attempted IN THE COURTS on the issue of gay marriage, and it's amusing that the anti-gay marriage proponents here do not even really try to bring those up like they are winning arguments... emoticon_xdonno\n \n In the end, gay marriage will eventually win.\n The opponents will whine about \"judicial activism\" ad nausieum.\n And the opinions of the populace will continue to shift in favor of gay marriage. The dinosaurs opposing gay marriage will die out.\n \n Cause when it comes to the younger generation, the older people who desire oppression against gays don't seem to comprehend that the younger generation is DEMANDING an answer to why.\n And when they don't get a real one, the younger generation turns away from the prejudice and discrimination of the older generation.\n \n At this stage, I am wondering if the opinion polls on gay marriage will shift to have a majority support FOR gay marriage before gay marriage is recognized on a federal level.\n Right now, we have a majority support for sexual orientation hate crimes legislation, for legislation preventing sexual orientation discrimination in the work-place, and for preventing sexual orientation discrimination in the military.\n EVEN AMONGST THE REPUBLICAN base, we have a majority rooting for gay equality and gay support on those issues.\n \n But even now, it's like pulling teeth trying to get the government to pass legislation that the majority WANTS... emoticon_wow",
