You are absoultely correct in that we have good reason to take control of North Korea away from Kim for moral reasons.\n \n The problem that occurs is one of how we could possibly invade North Korea and improve the situation for the people. Almost all of them would be forced to fight against any invaders sacraficing themselves to the war effort and it would probably end in a nuclear fashion destroying parts of North Korea. Surely we cannot cut the aid we give North Korea or the people would suffer even further as well. The only good option is one of politics and somehow encouraging North Korea to either back away from their dictatorship or to have them join the two Korea's together under a democracy.\n \n So although I support us helping the people of North Korea I still can't see how we could force North Korea to give their citizens a better life without having to go in there and screw up a million lives. I think it has to eventually come down to letting North Korea change on it's own.

Patriots don't work against high altitude, hig speed rockets. They are designed to shoot down scud class and lesser missles. That also do not work well in the launch phase of a projectiles flight (this has to do with the scanning/targeting systems).\n \n Why would they crash or not take off? IT seems reasonable to assume that their weapons systems are based on Soviet and Chinese technology. We akready know that the Soviet and Chinese missiles don't have any trouble getting off the gorund and on target. They are not as accurate as US missiles, but how accurate do you have to be when you are pushing a 150 kiloton warhead? The chinese and Soviet systems were always considered more reliable than US systems due to the simplicity of their design (like the AK versus the M-16. You can freeze the AK, bury it in sand, drop it inthe ocean for a month, pull it out, dry it off, load it and fire). I would say it is more like a 2% chance that the missiles don't launch. \n \n \n \nHitler in his early stages wasn't a problem to the US either . . .\n\n \n Hitler was into empire building.

We have no real idea of what kind f miliatry force they have beyond estimates made from sat photos. The S Koreans can't even get good humint out of N korea. Spy novels are just that, novels. James Bond is a fictional charachter. If we were talking a few nukes at a fixed location, I suppose it might be possible to conduct some kind of surgical operation to take them out. That is not what we are talking about. By all indications, they have several nukes on portable launchers. This makes things much more difficult.\n \n Again, whay is it our problem or our business to meddle inthe internal affairs of othe countries?\n \n There seems to be this misconception today that we have this great military and can move in and take anycountyr int he world in a week. Somewhere like the middle east, you can pull this off. The terrain in the region does not lend itself to geurilla warfare and long term war. You go somewhere like N Korea, where the terrain is more accomodating to a resistance and all of a sudden you have a lot more problems to deal with.\n \n America lately has this nasty tendancy to launch some cruise missiles, drop some bombs, parade a few ground troops around, then go \"we won that one\". Look at afghanistan. I saw a newsbrief the other day where they were talkign about attacks in Afghanistan. They had the map up, with red indicating sections of th sountry that \"we\" (meaning the democratic government of Afghanistan, which we appointed) control, and blue indicating sections that \"we\" do not control. There was a LOT more blue than red, but people seem to think we won that one. It seems to me that to mark it as a \"win\" you have to at least control half the country.",

   "I guess Israel is not justified if you think that suicide bombers should have access to all public places, allowing them to get close to women and children before killing themselves and anyone around them. If they went for military targets, it might be a different story as it would count more for a true rebellion or whatever (even then, it's a weak argument).\n \n My main point is the mass killings, not disagreeing with a viewpoint or with the morals of a country.\n\n \n So then you consider Nelson Mandela and the ANC to be terrorists still? They commited some of the same acts that some Palestinian militias have (killing civilians)?",
