   "I have heard many people say that we can't give school vouchers because we'd be giving money to religious schools. That is total ****. We are giving the money back to the people who shouldn't have had to pay in the first place. I went to a private school through 8th grade and my parents were paying for my education and also a fraction of the public education cost. Why don't we not give tax cuts because they might donate it to a church? School vouchers are just another refund. If you don't use your public education, shouldn't you be able to spend your tax dollars to a school of your choice? Of course then public schools may have to compete with private schools and find out that their method of teaching to the tests isn't working and maybe get better teachers. The problem is now that unless you have a good amount of money you are stuck with public schools. If you are able to get your money back it wouldn't cost as much for a private school and more people would go to private schools. This would reduce overpopulation (my school has 3400 in a school built for 2500 people), reduce class size, and with fewer teachers, the ones left would be the better ones. This would improve education a lot, yet some argue it violates separation of church and state.",

Because you don't plan to get your money's worth personally is not the point. You pay for prisons also but probably don't want \"equal time\" do you? The government subsidizes religion enough already IMO. Should the government pay for Karate lessons if I think they should be part of any basic curriculum?",

If a kid goes to a private school they don't need as much money because they don't have to educate that child. If they have 10,000 people go to private school, why should they still get money for education when they need to educate 10,000 less people. Of course I could have gone to public schools and knew what was going on. But that doesn't mean it's fair. In my opinion I don't see why people without children should have to pay for education. Tax money is supposed to go towards the good of the country, state, county, whatever tax it is.
