   "It is true that Lamark was wrong, but that does not necessarily mean that the crops in Russia failed because of it. (As a matter of fact, it did I guess.)\n \n Darwin and his theory of evolution through Natural Selection: \n \n [Since I was asleep during the video and I'm too lazy to do any research, I won't talk about the Galapagos Islands.]\n \n 1. Overproduction: This guy named Malthus went over to Russia and asked the poor starving women why they had so many children that it would be impossible to feed them all. They replied casually that it increased the chances that one of the children would survive and continue on the family farm. (Or something to that degree.) This is also true for species. Having more offspring will increase the chances of the survival of at least one of the children. The reason I'll explain in the 4th step.\n \n 2. Variation: We can all agree that all the organisms of a species are not all the same, right? Some have traits that other's don't have and the ones that don't have that one trait might have something different.\n \n 3. Competition: Since there is an limited amout of food, shelter, and mates, those things will be competed for, either intraspecies (within its own species), or interspecies (with other species).\n \n 4. Natural Selection: Yes... natural selection is a step within Natural Selection. This is the meat of the theory I think. Basically, since organisms have different traits, certain different traits will give advantages in survival, and competition for limited needs in number 3. Those organisms with those advantageous traits will take those limited resources and reproduce and the one's who don't have them die.\n \n 5. Speciation: Small increments of changes from the rest of the steps will eventually lead to a new species. \n \n There is a problem, however. Fossil records do not show Speciation. What they found in the layers of strata was that there would be a fossils of one species, a small section where there would be almost no fossils, then the fossils of a similar species of the first, but with different structures or something.\n \n There is a newer idea to this, something called Punctuated Equilibrium: Populations of species remain stable for long periods of time, then rapid genetic changes occur.\n Sudden, changes in the enviorment will cause organisms within a species with a certain trait to have better survival rates than ones in the species without that trait. \n \n For example, before the industrial revolution. There were a majority of light brown moths and a minority dark brown moths. Moths would be on trees and since light brown moth's color was close to the color of the bark of the tree, and the dark brown moth's color wasn't, predators would always pick out the dark brown ones. But after the industrial revolution, the bark of trees became darker from the massive amounts of smoke being let out from the factories. Now, the dark colored moth's color was like the color of the bark, and the light colored moths stood out, so predators would pick out the light colored moth's instead. So, most of the light colored moths died out and the dark colored moths became the majority.\n \n And that's about it on basic Evolution. If you had any questions or see any flaws, post it. If not, then I'm assuming that it all makes since and that you have no problems with accepting this. Oh yeah, I guess I should also explain why Lamark is wrong. Oh well.\n \n Edit: Oh yeah, and I hope you all who read this post, that after reading it, you left a little more informed on what evolution is actually about. Instead of the usual misintrepretations. I guess I should also quote on some (some being misintrepertations) that were brought forth by people who don't really know what they are talking about, but try to sound like it.",

   "Those organisms with those advantageous traits will take those limited resources and reproduce and the one's who don't have them die.\n\n No. Much too drastically stated. You didn't even mention the fact that populations tend to remain relatively stable. Thus just because an individual organism has some beneficial trait it does not follow that all of those that don't will die. That would result in extinction. Natural selection is a tendency - it is differential reproductive success. Because those organisms with advantageous characteristics have a competative advantage, they will tend to become more numerous in a stable population.\n \nPopulations of species remain stable for long periods of time, then rapid genetic changes occur.\n\n You seem to have failed to grasp punctuated equilibrium. Punctuated equilibrium is not a theory about periods of statis punctuated with periods of rapid evolutionary change. What punk eek says (and what both Eldredge and Gould observed) was genetic change taking place in a small, peripheral, or even isolated population. While \"rapid\" when compared to the norm, the changes were still quite gradual in that population. What we observe in the fossil record is not the evolution event but a migration event. The idea change in peripheral populations was first expressed by Darwin himself, later by Dobzhansky and Mayr, and finally by Eldredge and Gould.\n \n Also, you fail to mention that the peppered moths changed from light to dark (about 98%) between about 1850 and 1900. After about 1950, they have changed back to mostly (high 90%) light forms. The first dark morph was actually recorded in 1848. While it is a reasonable hypothesis that the changes were natural selection as the result of perdation, Kettlewell didn't have sufficient controls to conclusively demonstrate that fact. Probably yes, and there is no other reasonable explanation, but perdation of moths by birds during the day hasn't been consistently observed because the moths haven't been consistently observed during the day.\n \n What makes you think that we need instruction in evolutionary biology?",

   "How can you prove that various fossils are transitional as opposed to being seperate and distinct species? Answer: You cannot.\n\n \n Hunter:\n Transitional fossils are named so because we can use them to piece together the evolutionary history of a species. But that fossil isn't some mutant that's inbetween one morphology and another. It's a distinct, functioning species in its own right. So for every transitional fossil that we find between point A and point C, creationists have the opportunity to say \"well, fossil B isn't transitional, but a species in its own right - show me a transitional fossil between A and B or B and C and I'll believe you.\" There's no winning to this logic. Also, it's important to keep in mind that \"transitional\" is kind of a misnomer, since in fact everything is transitional, since evolution is a constant process. Our own skeletons that we're constantly burying in the ground will one day constitute transitional fossils between our previous form (primate) and whatever it is we'll look like in a few million years.\n \n This actually raises the question of man being made in God's image - if we're still evolving, then how can we be sure God looks anything like we do now? Maybe he has two heads, four arms and antennae. \n \n \nCould it be that evolution is true when referring to lower forms of life, but totally false when talking about man?\n\n \n Um...no. Those who accept evolution accept it all the way across the board, no species excluded. Now, if you want to believe that a diety guided the processes, that's your business, but it's absurd to think that Man is somehow immune to the natural processes around him. I also think that it's disrespectful of you to consider yourself a higher form of life. Every species has its place and its function in this world. Besides, other primates have been demonstrated to be self-aware just like we are - we're just the only species to have developed cell phones and hair plugs.

As you said, those who do not have the advatageous trait will not disappear, but become a minority of that species.\n \n With punctuated equilibrium I had two choices of explanations to use. This one:\n \n Punctuated equilibrium, or punctuated equilibria, is a theory of evolution which states that changes such as speciation can occur relatively quickly, with long periods of little change in between. This theory is one of the proposed explanations of the evolutionary patterns of species as observed in the fossil record, particularly the relatively sudden appearance of new species in a geologically short time period, and the perhaps typical lack of substantial change of species during their existence.\n \n Or the one that you probably would have prefered:\n \n \"Large, stable central populations exert a strong homogenizing influence [on the gene pool]. New and favorable mutations are diluted by the sheer bulk of the population through which they must spread....But [in] small, peripherally isolated groups [that] are cut off from their parental stock ... selective pressures are usually intense because peripheries mark the edge of ecological tolerance for ancestral forms. Favorable variations spread quickly...\n \n \"What should the fossil record include if most evolution occurs by speciation in peripheral isolates? ... In any local area inhabited by ancestors, a descendant species should appear suddenly by migration from a peripheral region in which it evolved. In the peripheral region itself, we might find direct evidence of speciation, but such good fortune would be rare indeed because the event occurs so rapidly in such a small population.\" \n \n Seeing that the first explanation is a lot less detailed and inaccurate, but a lot easier to understand without those biology terms, I chose the first one. And yes, I got those from Wikipedia.\n \n Well, apparantly my moth example of Natural Selection and Punctuated Equilibrium did not live up to your expectations of having good enough evidence to be posted. I chose it because it was relatively easy to understand, and that it was the example used on my worksheet I got to explain Punctuated Equilibrium.\n \n The reason I had posted, is that many creationists that come here had little or no education on the topic of evolution. In my opinion, their entire basis of knowledge of evolution comes from misconceptions made commonly. \n \n This is from The Lost World, by Michael Crichton:\n \n \"Oh, there are many examples,\" Levine said. \"In Africa, acacia trees evolved very ong sharp thorns - three inches or so - but that only provoked animals like giraffes and antelope to evove long tongues to get past the thorns. Thorns alone didn't work. So in the evolutionary arms race, the accacia trees next evolved toxicity. They started to produce large quantities of tannin in their leaves, which sets off a lethal metabolic reaction in the animals that eat them Literally killks them. at the same time, the accacias also evolved a kind of chemical warnign system among themselves. If an antelope begins to eat one tree in a grove, that tree releases the chemical ethylene into the air, which causes other trees in the grove to step up the production of leaf tannin. Within five or ten minutes, the other trees are producing more tannin, making themselves poisonous.\n \n \"And then what happens to the antelope? It dies?\"\n \n \"Well, not any more,\" Levine said, \"because the evolutionary arms reace continued. Eventually, antelopes learned that they could only browse for a short time. Once the trees started to produce more tannin, they had to stop eating it. And the browsers developed new strategies. for example, when a giraffe eats an accacia tree, it then aviods all the trees downwind. Instead, it moves on to another tree that is some distance away. So the animals have adapted to this defense, too.\"\n \n The explanation that Levine provides, sounds more like something Lamark would say. A change in the enviorment produces a need for change in organisms. \n \n Like in the second sentence of the third paragraph, Levine uses the word, learned. The problem is that with the usual mind set of what we think the word learned meant, it would mean that Levine meant that antelopes concluded somehow that eating in the same place for long periods of time is not good, and that knowledge is passed to the next generation somehow. The problem is that even if the antelopes learned that, it is a \n \n That and among other things too.",

Me too. I've been a student of evolutionary biology since 1960. If you are not sure enough to get the details right, then it would be better to ask questions rather than pretend to instruct.

However, there doesn't seem to be any other rational explanation and no evidence that indicates that there is another explanation. Perdation by birds seems to be the cause but it hasn't been observed in the wild consistently.\n \n The evolution of the peppered moths is not an example of punctuated equilibrium, or at least I wouldn't consider it one.\n \nThe reason I had posted, is that many creationists that come here had little or no education on the topic of evolution. In my opinion, their entire basis of knowledge of evolution comes from misconceptions made commonly.\n\n True.\n \nThis is from The Lost World, by Michael Crichton:\n \n \"Oh, there are many examples,\" Levine said. \"In Africa, acacia trees evolved very ong sharp thorns - three inches or so - but that only provoked animals like giraffes and antelope to evove long tongues to get past the thorns. Thorns alone didn't work. So in the evolutionary arms race, the accacia trees next evolved toxicity. They started to produce large quantities of tannin in their leaves, which sets off a lethal metabolic reaction in the animals that eat them Literally killks them. at the same time, the accacias also evolved a kind of chemical warnign system among themselves. If an antelope begins to eat one tree in a grove, that tree releases the chemical ethylene into the air, which causes other trees in the grove to step up the production of leaf tannin. Within five or ten minutes, the other trees are producing more tannin, making themselves poisonous.\n \n \"And then what happens to the antelope? It dies?\"\n \n \"Well, not any more,\" Levine said, \"because the evolutionary arms reace continued. Eventually, antelopes learned that they could only browse for a short time. Once the trees started to produce more tannin, they had to stop eating it. And the browsers developed new strategies. for example, when a giraffe eats an accacia tree, it then aviods all the trees downwind. Instead, it moves on to another tree that is some distance away. So the animals have adapted to this defense, too.\"\n \n\n Interesting example if he is correct. I presume that he is.\n \nThe explanation that Levine provides, sounds more like something Lamark would say. A change in the enviorment produces a need for change in organisms.\n\n But it's not. It is natural selection acting on genetic variability. The trees developed thorns, they were an advantage and long thorns were even more of an advantage - thus, differential reproductive advantage. \n \nLike in the second sentence of the third paragraph, Levine uses the word, learned. The problem is that with the usual mind set of what we think the word learned meant, it would mean that Levine meant that antelopes concluded somehow that eating in the same place for long periods of time is not good, and that knowledge is passed to the next generation somehow. The problem is that even if the antelopes learned that, it is a \n \n That and among other things too.\n\n I agree. But scientists do tend to use words like that, they just don't use them with the same meaning as everyone else. Two evolutionary biologists might use the word \"learn\" when they don't mean a learned behavior.",
