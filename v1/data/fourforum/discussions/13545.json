   "Good thing we spent the $700Billion that we needed to prevent the unemployment rate from hitting 8%, huh?:xcensored\n \n \n\n Unemployment rate jumps to 10.2 percent; highest since 1983\n By Neil Irwin\n Washington Post Staff Writer \n Friday, November 6, 2009; 12:27 PM \n More than one in 10 members of the American workforce were unable to get a job in October, the Labor Department said Friday, the first time in nearly three decades that the unemployment rate has soared into double digits. \n The unemployment rate rose to 10.2 percent, department said, up from 9.8 percent in September, the highest level since 1983. Employers also continued slashing jobs, though at a slower rate than September, showing that even though the economy is expanding, the job market remains dismal.\n",

You might get a kick out of this article published at the end of October.\n \n \n\n Updated October 29, 2009\n White House Blasts AP for Story Alleging Gov't Overstated Stimulus Jobs 'by Thousands'\n by FOXNews.com \n \n Administration slams what it calls a \"misleading\" Associated Press story alleging the government significantly overstated the number of jobs created or saved under Obama's $787B stimulus program\n \n \n The Obama administration on Thursday slammed a report from The Associated Press alleging the government had overstated by thousands the number of jobs it has created or saved with federal contracts under President Obama's $787 billion recovery program.\n \n The White House seized on an initial report from a government oversight board weeks ago that claimed federal contracts awarded to businesses under the recovery plan already had helped pay for more than 30,000 jobs. The administration said the number was evidence that the stimulus program had exceeded early expectations toward reaching the president's promise of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs by the end of next year.\n \n But the 30,000 figure is overstated by thousands -- at the very least by nearly 5,000, or one in six, based on AP's limited review of some of the contracts -- because some federal agencies and recipients of the money provided incorrect job counts. The review found some counts were more than 10 times as high as the actual number of jobs; some jobs were credited to stimulus spending when, in fact, none were produced.\n \n Within minutes of the publication of AP's story, the White House released a statement at 12:15 a.m. Thursday that it said was the \"real facts\" about how jobs were counted in the stimulus data distributed two weeks ago.\n \n \"This story draws misleading conclusions from a handful of examples,\" Ed DeSeve, an Obama adviser helping to oversee the stimulus program, said.\n \n \"Tomorrow, more than 100,000 recipient reports will be posted on Recovery.gov,\" DeSeve said. \"Unlike the small number of reports reviewed by AP, these reports have been reviewed for weeks, errors have been spotted and corrected, and additional layers of review by state and local governments have further improved the data quality.\"\n\n \n Wishing doesn't make it so, Mr DeSeve.
