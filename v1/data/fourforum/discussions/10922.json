   "I just happened to catch the hearing on baseball and Roger Clemens and the 'steroid' use. I'd like to hear opinions on this topic.\nNo problem.\n \n \nWith all that's going on in the world today, does baseball steroid use matter?\nYes. Competitive sports should not be tainted with performance enhancing drugs.\n \n \n\n Do you care?\nTo the extent that young people are being taught that it's okay to cheat and risk permanent body damage by using steroids, yes I care. Steroids should not be allowed in any sports, pro or amateur.\n \n \n\n Should Congress be using tax payers' money on this type of thing?\nNo. Congress should have nothing to do with sports except to bet on games.\n \n \n\n Does Baseball matter at all, ...\nYes.\n \n \n \n...or is it the most boring sport ever that should have been abandoned with the invention of Television?\nThe attendance records at games across the country should tell you it's not the most boring sport ever. It's a great sport. It's just been tainted by people like Barry Bonds and others.\n \n I personally wouldn't give a dime for a DVD set of every game ever played, but it is exciting and lucrative to a lot of people. A shipload of money changes hands and helps the economy.\n \n I'm curious what the advent of television had to do with the need for baseball.",

   "Jim's trucking asked...\n \"I'm curious what the advent of television had to do with the need for baseball.\"\n \n Just my opinion, I've never been a fan of the game but,\n I've always had the opinion that baseball was best followed through the newspapers. With the highlights condensed and the statistics, which was what I figured attracted people to follow the game, in black and white for people to study and memorize, it seems that baseball's heyday would have been before the Television brought everything into our living rooms. It's such a slow game to watch live, I've seen the old clips when they actually used to smoke in the outfield. Being fast paced Basketball and Football seem to be more TV friendly, where as baseball to me seems like a newspaper kind of sport. Just my opinion, which may have been formed while sitting on the bench constantly at my little league games...emoticon_emb",

   "With all that's going on in the world today, does baseball steroid use matter?\n\n \n Not one bit. I've always believed that all baseball players should be allowed to use steroids. They should also give them aluminum bats. Then they could build larger stadiums; more seats = more tickets = more money. To me, it's an obvious course of action.\n \n \nDo you care?\n\n \n I guess I care enough to answer these questions. In fairness, I'm only answering because I don't think people should care.\n \n \nShould Congress be using tax payers' money on this type of thing?\n\n \n Never, for any reason.\n \n \nDoes Baseball matter at all, or is it the most boring sport ever that should have been abandoned with the invention of Television?\n\n \n I'm sure baseball matters to people who like it. Fortunately, I am not one of those people. I would much rather watch football. Hell, I could get into shuffleboard before I would watch a baseball game.\n \n PS - Going to a game is different. It's like going to a very expensive outdoor bar.",

But, I watched the hearing on MSNBC the other day some...was paid to do so.\n \n \nShould Congress be using tax payers' money on this type of thing?\n\n Yes! We need the circuses and congress focusing on this means they aren't focusing on the more important, dreadful things in the nation.\n If we bury our heads deep enough, they'll go away. But, while our heads are down there...we'll need some entertainment and someone to tell us that the entertainment is important.\n \n \nDoes Baseball matter at all, or is it the most boring sport ever that should have been abandoned with the invention of Television?\n\n If baseball didn't exist, I'd have to make my own club to bash people with...and, more importantly, an excuse to carry said club about.\n Living near Lou. KY. (They got a museum I drive by daily that deals with good ole Louisville Slugger) affords me a ready opprotunity to have both.\n As it stands, I have one of those small momento bats right here.\n When I was a youth...I broke one upside someone's head.\n \n I LOVE baseball.\n \n Just hate watching it.\n Or playing in a game that last longer than 5 minutes.\n \n And if they ban steroids...what kinda brutes are going to be available to bash people for you??",

   "\n With all that's going on in the world today, does baseball steroid use matter?\n\n Baseball, and society, has rules. Rules ought to be followed, for forms sake if nothing else. It's certainly not as important as a lot of other things, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't matter at all.\n \n \n\n Do you care?\n\n Personally? No, not so much.\n \n \n\n Should Congress be using tax payers' money on this type of thing??\n\n Congress? No. If there are federal laws against steroid abuse, and i'm guessing there are, then the appropriate agency should deal with it. There's no need for congress to get involved.\n \n \n\n Does Baseball matter at all, or is it the most boring sport ever that should have been abandoned with the invention of Television? \n\n Well, it certainly doesn't matter to you, and I doubt anything anyone here says will change your mind, so I'll pass on this question. :)",
