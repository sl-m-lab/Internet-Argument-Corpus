   "With regards to the Torah creation story, is Lilith a seperate individual from God, or is it just a title for God. If it is seperate, then this contradicts the \"triune\" (or Trinty) idea of God - God the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost) which is portrayed in many times throughout the Bible. As for your questions, you might want to ask them here if no one can answer or tries to answer them. \n \n With reference to the New Testament, Jew's don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah and Saviour of the world, so the whole Testament is different - I think. I'm not too sure about what Jewish people believe, so the above is just a guess based mainly on ignorance. If true, however, since Jesus is God's only Son (John 3:16), that would make the Christian New Testament divinely inspired.",

   "The Jewish creation story\n God saw that Adam needed a friend - woman. Some say that the earth was worried and asked. \"How shall I feed all her children?\" God replied, \"Fear not, together we shall find food\". So Lilith was made from the dust, also in God's image. But Lilith would not live with Adam and went her own way. So God made a woman before Adam's eyes, but Adam turned from her. Finally, putting Adam in a deep sleep, God took one of Adam's ribs and made Eve, and placed the couple in Paradise.\n On the seventh day, God finished his work and rested. And Paradise was blissful, until Adam and Eve ate fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God had forbidden them to do. God punished them, and cast our parents out of Paradise to struggle in this earthly life.\n \n The Break in the relation ship between God and first humans is however not seen as a final one. Through the Covenants with Abraham and Moses, the Jewish people have a close relationship with God; they are to act as a model of the way God wishes people to live and to use the world. The world is a larder full of good things but it is ours on trust and we must care for it as well as use it.\n \n http://www.innovationslearning.co.uk/subjects/re/information/creation/jewish_creation.htm\n \n The Christian Story\n Now the first man, Adam, was created by God out of soil and given life by God's breath. Adam named all the animals and birds that God had made, But Adam had no companion of his own so God caused hem to fall into a deep sleep and created woman - Eve- from one of Adam's ribs. God told them that together they could live in the Garden of Eden eating whatever they wished except the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But the most cunning animal, which God had made -the serpent -, tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. So Adam and Eve both ate and suddenly saw what they had done ant that they were naked. Covering themselves with fig leaves they tried to hide from God. But God knew of their sin and called out to them. Then he cursed the serpent and Adam and Eve, and in shame they were driven from the beautiful Garden. God told Adam he would now have to toil and sweat to work the very soil from which he had been created. Then God blocked the entrance to the Garden with a great fiery sword so that no one could enter in.\n \n http://www.innovationslearning.co.uk/subjects/re/information/creation/christian_creation.htm",

The two creation stories in Genesis are from Babylonia and Canaan. \n \n According to this site the Lileth reference comes from Babylonian sources: \n \n ...the Gods created the first people: a man and his wife Lilith. The Gods cast Lilith out of the garden because of a variety of transgressions. She retained her immortality and was believed to come awake only during the night and to feed on the blood of children and animals. She was perhaps the first vampire-like character. Eve was then created as the second wife. This ancient myth was adopted by the Jewish J tradition and inserted into Genesis, Chapter 1 circa 550 BCE. They stripped out the references to the first wife. Lilith is now only seen in Isaiah 34:14 where her name is variously translated \"screech owl\", \"night monster\" or \"night hag\".",

The Torah is just the first 5 books of the tanakh.\n \n 2) Lilith is more folklore, not in the torah itself. Folklore tradition and oral tradition is still much apart of Judaism, but many Chrisitans are by 'scripture alone'.. (but then they go into the trinity, for which there is no scriptural basis). She was edited out of the Genesis account when it was taken from\n the babalyonian sources. \n \n I suspect that many of the Jewish foundations were abandoned by the gentile converts to Christianity, and that this faction is what won during the political battles in the council of Nicea in 325 C.E.",
