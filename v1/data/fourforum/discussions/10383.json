   "I challenge evolutionists to show me ONE mutation ever documented in the history of science that has created a new, beneficial, selectable morphological addition to an existing body part....(one that alters physical, outward appearance in a beneficial way.)\n \n There are mutations that duplicate existing structures, mutations that reduce existing structures, mutations that deform organisms, and mutations that cause disease and death....Unfortunately for Darwinists, however, mutations can add nothing beneficial to the observable phenotype, which is the cornerstone of ToE.\n\n \n You've lost this several times already, but you keep trying new versions. It is an impressive testimony to your lack of skill that you still can't devise an airtight and loophole-free challenge. \n \n Moreover, it is worth re-emphasizing that no one but you thinks that evolution works the way you think it does. Thus the only real challenge here, which admittedly has eluded all of us so far, is getting you to face up to how wrong you are. Due to the time frames involved, the probabilities, and the way genes work, we do not expect to see many (or possibly any) instances of single mutations causing major external morphological changes. Beyond that, evolutionary theory, unlike you, recognizes that advantageousness (and disadvantageousness) depend on context, which can quickly change, and that a single modification can simultaneously confer reproductive benefits and disadvantages. Thus, despite its disadvantages, sickle cell is net advantageous for lineages that live in malarial regions (and lack modern medicines).\n \n But let's go with a couple more mutations.\n \n First, myostatin blocker in humans is a mutation that causes an impressive increase in muscle & strength that is externally visible and which as yet has no known downside. See http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5278028/ . (However, some disadvantages have been seen in cows with a comparable mutation.) I agree that reproductive advantages have yet to be established in people, as the boy is not even ten years old yet, but it seems reasonable that at some times and places in human history this could have been a very reproductively beneficial mutation, even if it in some way shortened his life to 25 years or so. Even if there are aqssociated disadvantages, it is plausible that other mutations could ameliorate these changes (as we see, for example, in the generation of significanat changes in protein morphology ( http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Protein+lineages:+randomness+was+crucial+to+ancient+genetic+changes.-a0168053723 ).\n \n Next, let's talk about the benefits of the loss of vision in one type of blind cave fish. This is external and morphological, but no doubt you'll complain that this is loss and degradation and thus not an improvement. However, not so fast: From http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_5_114/ai_n13811128/pg_1\n \nThe Hh gene controls not only the size of the eyes, but also the development of teeth, taste buds, the anterior part of the brain, and other craniofacial structures. Most intriguingly, Hh has an inverse effect on the development of eyes and taste buds: the smaller the eyes, the more taste buds are produced, which undoubtedly lead to an enhanced sense of taste.\n \n Collectively, we have worked with blind cave organisms for more than eighteen years, and one of us (Luis Espinasa) was working with blind cave fish in Jeffery's laboratory shortly after the publication of the momentous work on lens transplants. At the time, Espinasa's research was focusing on the bones surrounding the eye socket in cave Astyanax and how the bones are modified by the presence or absence of eyes. He noted that when a fish develops without eyes, the bones are shifted into the empty socket space, deforming the entire skull. Part of this deformation includes the bones of the nose. The width of the olfactory pit in blind fish increases on average by 13 percent, thus enlarging the surface of the olfactory epithelium, where the chemical receptors are lodged \n There's clearly no need for eyes in a cave, so this is not really a defect. Improvement in olfaction is clearly beneficial in a cave, and it comes from a novel arrangement of sull bones, so this enhancement is new and beneficial.",

The inheritance sure looks consistent with good old mendel to me!\n \n And then we find this article from 2000.\n \n \nScience 28 July 2000:\n Vol. 289. no. 5479, pp. 631 - 633\n DOI: 10.1126/science.289.5479.631\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n \n Central Role for the Lens in Cave Fish Eye Degeneration\n \n Yoshiyuki Yamamoto and William R. Jeffery*\n \n Astyanax mexicanus is a teleost with eyed surface-dwelling and eyeless cave-dwelling forms. Eye formation is initiated in cave fish embryos, but the eye subsequently arrests and degenerates. The surface fish lens stimulates growth and development after transplantation into the cave fish optic cup, restoring optic tissues lost during cave fish evolution. Conversely, eye growth and development are retarded following transplantation of a surface fish lens into a cave fish optic cup or lens extirpation. These results show that evolutionary changes in an inductive signal from the lens are involved in cave fish eye degeneration.\n \n Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742-4415, USA.\n * To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: wj33@umail.umd.edu\n \n The evolution of development is usually studied in distantly related species (1, 2). This approach has revealed conserved genes with universal developmental roles, but large evolutionary distances have obscured the mechanisms that generate morphological diversity. The evolution of development in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, a single species with eyed surface-dwelling (surface fish) and eyeless cave-dwelling (cave fish) forms, has also been studied (3, 4). The eyed and eyeless forms of Astyanax probably diverged from a common ancestor within the past million years (5, 6). Here, we show that evolutionary changes in an inductive signal from the lens are involved in cave fish eye degeneration.\n \n Although adult cave fish lack functional eyes, eye formation is initiated during embryogenesis (Fig. 1, A and B). The lens vesicle is formed but later degenerates, and the cornea, iris, and other optic tissues are absent or rudimentary (Fig. 1, C and D) (7, 8). The optic cup and neural retina are formed in cave fish, but the retinal layers are disorganized, growth is retarded, and photoreceptor cells do not differentiate. The degenerate eye sinks into the orbit and is covered by a flap of skin. Constructive changes have also evolved in cave fish, including enhanced lateral line and gustatory systems (4, 9).\n Fig. 1.

[View Larger Version of this Image (0K GIF file)]\n \n Cave fish lens cells undergo apoptosis before the arrest of eye development (3). Because extensive apoptosis has not been detected in other eye tissues at this time, lens apoptosis may be an important factor in eye degeneration. Alternatively, lens apoptosis and eye degeneration could be controlled by a signal from the optic cup, which is diminished in cave fish (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine the control of lens apoptosis, we transplanted a surface fish lens vesicle into a cave fish optic cup and vice versa (Fig. 2A) (10) and assayed for apoptosis by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling) (11). The lens vesicle of a donor embryo was transplanted into the optic cup on one side (transplant side) of a host embryo after removal of the host lens vesicle. The eye primordium on the other side (control side) served as a control. In another control, a surface fish or cave fish lens vesicle was transplanted into a surface fish or cave fish optic cup, respectively. Eyes typical of the respective hosts were formed in the latter control, showing that the operations do not affect optic development. The cave fish lens underwent apoptosis on schedule in the surface fish host (Fig. 2, F and G). Conversely, the surface fish lens vesicle did not undergo apoptosis and formed a differentiated lens in the cave fish host (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, apoptosis is controlled autonomously within the cave fish lens vesicle.\n Fig. 2. Lens vesicle transplantation and apoptosis. (A to C) Lens transplantation.

[View Larger Version of this Image (0K GIF file)]\n \n Eye development was stimulated on the transplant side of the cave fish host (Fig. 3, A to D) (12). Although no differences were apparent after 48 hours (Fig. 3A), a larger eye was detected on the transplant side after 8 days of development. After 2 months, a large eye (restored eye) with a distinct pupil was present on the transplant side, whereas the eye had degenerated and sunk into the orbit on the control side (Fig. 3, B and C). Sections of the restored eye showed an anterior chamber, cornea, iris, and lens (Fig. 3D). The epithelial cells of the cornea and lens expressed the transcription factor Pax6 (13), which is absent in the area of the cave fish eye that corresponds to the cornea (Fig. 4, A to C) (14). The following experiment was performed to be certain that the rescued eye parts were derived from host rather than donor tissues. A surface fish lens vesicle labeled with fluoresceinated lysine-fixable dextran (FLDX) was transplanted into an unlabeled cave fish optic cup, and the host was allowed to develop until a large eye formed on the transplant side. Sectioning showed that FLDX labeling was restricted to the lens, indicating that the restored eye parts were derived from the cave fish (Fig. 2, B and C). The results show that a surface fish lens can induce the development of anterior eye parts that have been lost during cave fish evolution.\n Fig. 4. Cornea and retina development following lens transplantation.

[View Larger Version of this Image (0K GIF file)]\n \n Neural retina development was determined by examining the expression of Pax6, Prox 1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and rhodopsin, which are retinal markers for ganglion and amacrine cells, horizontal cells, photoreceptor precursor cells, and rod cells, respectively (9, 14, 15). Pax6, Prox 1, and PCNA were expressed in the appropriate retinal cells in both surface fish and cave fish [Web fig. 1 (16)], although the retinal layers were disorganized and only a few rod cells were present in cave fish (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, the restored eye exhibited well-organized layers of neuronal and glial cells, as well as a layer of rhodopsin-expressing rod cells (Fig. 4G). The teleost retina grows throughout life by adding new cells from the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), which exhibits intense Pax6, Prox 1, and PCNA expression (9, 15, 17, 18). These markers were detected in the CMZ of the restored eye [Web fig. 1 (16)], implying that the retina is actively growing. Thus, the surface fish lens can promote normal patterning, growth, and rod cell differentiation in the cave fish retina.\n \n The effect of the cave fish lens on surface fish eye development was determined by reciprocal lens transplantations (Fig. 3, E to H) (19). After 2 months of development, adult hosts exhibited a normal eye on the control side and a small eye (degenerate eye) on the transplant side (Fig. 3, F and G), which failed to develop a pupil, cornea, anterior chamber, and iris (Fig. 3H). As determined by the retinal markers [Fig. 4H and Web fig. 1 (16)], retinal cell differentiation occurred in the degenerate eye; however, the retina was small and distorted (Fig. 3H) in relation to its counterpart on the control side. The same results were obtained following extirpation of the surface lens vesicle. Although lens modification cannot completely account for the cave fish retinal phenotype, the results show that the cave fish lens has lost the ability to promote eye development.\n \n We have shown that the surface fish lens is sufficient to rescue eye development after transplantation into the cave fish eye primordium. We conclude that a change in an inductive signal emanating from the lens is a major cause of eye regression in cave fish (20). Our results illustrate how an evolutionary modification in embryonic induction can result in dramatic changes in adult morphology.\n",

Not unheard of.\n \n \nEyes at a price\n Even as Baird and others track down the genes that make nematodes vary, Maryland's Jeffery has a gene in hand from his microevolutionary studies of a cavefish species found in Mexico. He has been looking at two populations of Astyanax mexicanus. One group lives underground and lacks functional eyes; the other lives at the surface and sees quite well. In exploring the genetic and developmental basis of this difference, he found a tradeoff: The blind cavefish had bigger jaws and more teeth than the surface ones. These traits, it turns out, are tied to the set of genes that also determine the development of eyes.\n \n Figure 2\n \n Figure 3\n Sensory seesaw. In cavefish, the regulation of one gene tips development to favor either eyes or bigger jaws and teeth.\n \n CREDITS: YOSHIYUKI YAMAMOTO AND WILLIAM JEFFERY/UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND\n \n This led Jeffery to think that eyes disappeared only because the bigger teeth and jaws proved so advantageous in this new environment. When he began looking for how this evolution occurred, he discovered that it didn't take major genetic changes to tip development in favor of one phenotype or the other. Instead, he and his colleagues found that a slight alteration in where a gene called sonic hedgehog was active in the developing head caused eyes to form or not form (Science, 23 June 2000, p. 2119). \"A fairly small change was able to give a fairly large phenotypic result,\" he points out.\n",

Shh activity is important at different time points during neural development in ventral and to some extent dorsal cells, i.e. the ventral neural tube, oligodendrocytes, the eye, the zona limitans interthalamica and the cerebellum. In humans mutations in SHH, located on chromosome 7q36, lead to holoprosencephaly, a genetically heterogeneous developmental defect, characterized by an impaired midline cleavage of the forebrain and craniofacial structures.\n \n The focus of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control Shh activation and regulation during brain development. To date, seven cis-regulatory Shh enhancers have been identified by interspecies comparison and functional transgenic reporter assays. These include three minimal Shh enhancers, comprising two floor plate enhancer and one brain enhancer, that are located within intron 2 and 10 kb upstream of the promoter, respectively. In addition, four long-range enhancers exist, that include three forebrain enhancers and one limb enhancer, localized up to 1 Mb away from the promoter. Genomic rearrangements of the Shh locus in human and mice represent attractive models to study the effects of perturbed Shh enhancer activity. We have recently demonstrated that the \"short digits\" (Dsh) mouse mutant is caused by an inversion, that separates the Shh promoter from all Shh long-range enhancers. Dsh-/- mice exhibit a full spectrum HPE, malformations of internal organs and loss of distal limb structures and are very similar to Shh-/- mice, indicating the importance of long-range Shh cis-regulation. In contrats to Shh+/- mice, that are normal, Dsh+/- mice display a limb and brain phenotype with shortened phalanges, an osseous defect of the frontal skull bones and enlarged lateral ventricles. The Dsh+/- limb defect is caused by a Shh misexpression in digital chondrocytes at E13.5, when Shh is normally downregulated at this site (Niedermaier et al. J Clin Invest, 2005: 115, 900-909). The Dsh+/- brain phenotype is currently subject to a detailed developmental analysis. In the future we are planning to analyze upstream regulation of Shh and its activation during brain development using a functional and transgenic strategy.\n\n \n \n http://www.rndsystems.com/mini_review_detail_objectname_MR02_SonicHedgeHog.aspx\n \n Provides additional review style info.",

   "Symbiote and chemist seem to have this largely in hand.\n \n There are lots of different species of blind cave fish, and lots of ways for them to lose vision and, in many cases, also to lose their eyes.\n \n You are misinterpreting William Jeffery's statement \n \nI propose an adaptive hypothesis to explain cavefish eye regression based the pleiotropic activity of midline signaling genes. Gene expression data and functional studies involving the negative role of Hh midline signaling during cavefish eye development strongly support this hypothesis. Enhanced Hh midline signaling in cavefish has a negative effect on eye development based on its ability to change the patterns of pax6 and pax2 expression, reduce the size of the eye primordia, and promote lens apoptosis and arrest eye growth \n\n 'An adaptive hypothesis' means that he is proposing evolutionary change that is pushed by positive selection, as opposed to alternative causes, for which several different hypotheses have been proposed in the past \n the actual benefits of blindness have been difficult to understand. Accordingly, different versions of the adaptation hypothesis attribute eye regression to energy economy, citing the high cost of making an eye (Culver 1982), to pleiotropic effects (Wright 1964), in which sensory organs beneficial to survival in the cave environment are enhanced at the expense of eyes (Barr 1968), or even to active destruction of eyes because of their potential liability in caves. \n All of those are hypotheses that rely on various forms of positive adaptation, plus we also have the old suggestion by Kinemura that features that are unneeded are at risk of being lost by genetic drift (i.e., non-adaptive, non-selectional evolutionary change). In all cases, mutations underlie the variations that result in the change. In this case, the Pax6 changes are under the regulation of other (regulatory) genes. \n \n He says this in an earlier paper in a way that should be clearer to you: \nDarwin was puzzled by eye loss in cave animals, and hesitated to invoke natural selection as a causal force in their regressive evolution.\n He's saying that Darwin's process of natural selection ('an adaptive hypothesis') does in fact account for the loss of eyes in blind cave fish. \n \n The remainder of your confusion stems from the fact that the word \"mutation\" does not appear where you expect it to in the 2003 paper. The problem is that all the stuff in the 2003 constitute various different mutations. List to Jeffery in an earlier paper where he asks the questions that the 2003 paper resolves (from http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/4/685.pdf ) \n The Astyanax system also offers the opportunity of genetic analysis. Genetic studies indicate that mutations in multiple genes are responsible for eye degeneration and that different gene loci may be mutated in various cavefish populations (reviewed by Wilkens, 1988).\n \n ............\n \n This phenomenon, an example of parallelism in related evolutionary lineages, could have evolved by mutations in the same or in different apoptosis related genes. Isolation and characterization of Astyanax cell death genes will be necessary to distinguish between these possibilities.\n \n .............\n \n As a means of downregulating Pax-6 in the lens, cavefish may have mutated a lens-specific cisregulatory domain in the Pax-6 gene. We are currently developing in vivo transgene expression procedures to test this possibility in the Astyanax system. \n\n \n So let's move on to the 2003 paper: \nA key discovery is that Hedgehog midline signaling is expanded and inhibits eye formation by inducing lens apoptosis in cavefish embryos.\n So the key thing is, what causes the apoptosis of the lens? (Also note the last of the questions from the earlier paper.)\n \n \nCell death is often triggered when cells are prevented from undergoing normal divisions. Therefore, it was expected that the lens and retina are stimulated to undergo programmed cell death because of arrested stem cell division. However, this is not the case. Analysis of cell proliferation in the cavefish lens and retina using the thymidine analog BrdU (Figure 3B, C), the DNA polymerase cofactor PCNA (Figure 3D, E), and the Rx and Vsx homeobox genes, which are expressed by recently divided CMZ cells, show that both tissues continuously produce new cells in the correct spatial location (Strickler et al. 2002). Because the cavefish lens and retina do not increase appreciably in mass, the newly divided cells must be targets of apoptosis. Accordingly, growth is not retarded because cell proliferation is inhibited. Instead, rounds of cell proliferation continue in the lens and retina, but the newly born cells do not contribute to the lens and retinal mass because they die prior to differentiation. Eventually, apoptosis outperforms cell division, at least in the lens, which eventually disappears in most adult cavefish (Soares et al. 2004).\n\n \n Furthermore, transplantation experiments showed that a surface fish eye transplanted into a cave fish stopped developing, just as the regular eye would have done, while a cave fish eye transplanted into a surface fish prior to the start to lens apoptosis continued to thrive. So the question is, what shuts down eye growth in the cave fish, since it is not the eye itself and does not involve loss of function mutations in the genes immediately involved in eye growth.\n \nTherefore, part of the mechanism of cavefish eye reduction involves a reciprocal change in pax6 and pax2 expression, resulting in modified optic vesicle patterning.\n \n The wide gap between pax6 expressing domains in the cavefish neural plate provides a further clue about how eye development is controlled in cavefish. During vertebrate development, the presumptive optic cup is initially determined as a single medial domain, which is subsequently split into two bilateral eye domains by Hedgehog (Hh) signals emanating from the underlying embryonic midline (Ekker et al. 1995; Macdonald et al. 1995). Thus, during normal eye development, Hh signaling inhibits pax6 expression in the midline to create two lateral eyes. In fact, mutants in sonic hedgehog, the single Hh midline signaling gene in humans (Belloni et al. 1996) and mice (Chiang et al. 1996), result in cyclopia, the development of a single medial eye. Teleost genomes have two hh midline signaling genes, shh and tiggy winkle hedgehog (twhh), with overlapping expression patterns (Ekker et al. 1995). Thus, the activity of both shh and twhh may be required to completely separate the eyes during teleost development (Chow and Lang 2001).\n \n Shh and twhh expression patterns were compared during surface fish and cavefish development (Yamamoto et al. 2004). The results showed that midline expression domains of both genes were expanded in cavefish relative to surface fish, as determined by comparing expression of the hh genes to that of pax2a and dlx3b, marker genes that define the boundaries of the anterior neural plate. At the neural plate stage, shh and twhh expression was expanded laterally along the anterior midline of cavefish embryos (see Figure 6A-D for shh). The shh expression domain is about 10 cells wide in cavefish at its greatest width, whereas it is only about 6 cells wide in surface fish (Yamamoto et al. 2004). Later in cavefish development, hh expression was expanded anteriorly, curling around the rostrum in the presumptive oral area. Yamamoto et al. (2004) also showed that expression patterns of genes acting downstream of shh and twhh in the Hh midline signaling pathway, such as patched, encoding a Shh receptor, and nkx2.1, encoding an Shh-dependent transcription factor, are expanded, suggesting that a general increase in midline signaling has evolved in cavefish. These results also imply that suppression of pax6 and eye development in cavefish is controlled by Hh midline signaling genes that function outside the developing eye.\n \n In summary, analysis of gene expression patterns has not identified nonfunctional genes during early cavefish eye development, as might be predicted by the neutral mutation hypothesis. Of course, those genes expressed in eye tissues that completely degenerate, such as the lens, are gradually down-regulated after the onset of apoptosis, but only after being expressed earlier in development. Although the expression domains of some genes, such as pax6, may be slightly reduced during early eye development, others, such as pax2a and genes of the Hh midline-signaling pathway, are increased. Last, the hsp90a gene is specifically activated during cavefish eye development. \n\n \n So the answer must be a change in regulatory genes rather than in the genes that do the immediate work. \n \n Next, they did a really cool experiment to test this possibility: they injected hh gene product into the eye on side of an early embryo of a surface fish, and indeed it failed to develop an eye on that side only. More specifically, \nYamamoto et al. (2004) carried out functional experiments in which twhh and/or shh were overexpressed in surface fish embryos by injecting excess amounts of their mRNAs. If hh genes control eye degeneration, up-regulation of Hh signaling proteins in surface fish would be expected to mimic the cavefish phenotype.\n \n The results confirmed this hypothesis (Figure 6E-L; Yamamoto et al. 2004). When hh mRNA was injected into one side of a surface fish egg or early cleaving embryo, shh expression was expanded along that side of the embryonic midline, and pax6 expression was down-regulated unilaterally in the corresponding optic vesicle field (Figure 6E). Later in development, shh expression was also expanded asymmetrically in the rostrum of these surface fish embryos (Figure 6F). As a consequence of expanded hh expression, unilateral changes in eye development, a smaller optic vesicle (Figure 6G), a smaller eye (Figure 6H), and an optic cup (retina) lacking its ventral sector (Figure 6I), were induced. When these embryos developed into adults, the eye was missing on one side of the head, and there was no response to a light beam focused on the orbit with the missing eye (Figure 6J; Yamamoto et al. 2004). Thus, blind cavefish were phenocopied by increasing the levels of hh gene expression in surface fish, implying a key role for Hh midline signaling in eye degeneration. \n\n \n Because one particular gene, hsp90a, is activated at this key time in cave fish, the authors propose that \"differential display and microarray approaches suggest that many genes are actually up-regulated in cavefish. Thus far, the changes in gene expression patterns detected are either activations (e.g., hsp90{alpha}) or subtle enhancements (e.g., shh) and reductions (e.g., pax6) in expression domains rather than loss of functions\" and \"it seems likely that activation of hsp90a may be an important downstream target of Hh signaling.\"\n \n Now we have to move on to a later paper for the next part,\n T.A. Hooven, Y. Yamamoto, & W.R. Jeffery, 2004, \"Blind cavefish and heat shock protein chaperones: a novel role for hsp90&#945; in lens apoptosis\", The International journal of developmental biology, 48(8-9):731-738: \n Astyanax hsp90 and hsp70 DNAs were isolated to use as probes to compare gene expression during surface fish and cavefish development. Hsp90&#946;, which encodes one of two hsp90 isoforms, was not expressed in the surface fish or cavefish lens, whereas hsp 70 was expressed in the lens of both forms, suggesting that neither is directly involved in lens apoptosis. In contrast, hsp90a, the other hsp90 isoform, was expressed in the cavefish but not the surface fish lens. Hsp90a expression peaked shortly before the beginning of lens apoptosis in three convergent cavefish populations, suggesting a close relationship with lens apoptosis. The absence of hsp90&#946; in the lens allowed us to use geldanamycin and radicicol, specific inhibitors of hsp90 chaperone function, to determine whether lens cell death requires hsp90a expression. Both inhibitors blocked TUNEL labeling in the cavefish lens, suggesting that hsp90a is required for apoptosis.\n\n \n \n \n \n It is also interesting to note the other changes in cavefish: \nCavefish have reduced the size of their optic tecta (Soares et al. 2004; Voneida and Fish 1984; Voneida and Sligar 1976), the region of the brain responsible for interpreting visual information. Likewise, the strong schooling behavior characteristic of surface fish has disappeared. These changes are likely to be secondary consequences of eye degeneration.\n \n \n A significant change in feeding behavior could be a key evolutionary alteration in cavefish (Schemmel 1980). Surface fish usually feed in the water column using visual cues. When feeding on the bottom in complete darkness, however, they orient their anteroposterior body axis perpendicular to the bottom and pivot to scan a limited area of the substrate (Figure 2A). In contrast, cavefish, which seldom feed in the water column, orient with their anteroposterior body axis at about a 45\u00b0 angle to the substrate when bottom feeding (Figure 2B). This orientation, along with changes in head and oral structure (Jeffery 2001), allows them to scan a larger substrate area than surface fish without pivoting, which is probably a more effective strategy for finding potential food items within detritus on the floor of cave pools. Likely in relation to feeding preferences, cavefish have also increased the size of the their jaws, the number of oral and pharyngeal tastebuds, and the number of maxillary teeth (Schemmel 1967, 1974; Jeffery et al. 2000; Jeffery 2001; Yamamoto et al. 2003). Accordingly, laboratory experiments have shown that cavefish are very efficient in feeding and will outcompete surface fish for a limited amount of food when they share a darkened aquarium (H\u00fcppop 1987).\n \n \n Other morphological changes, some related to behavioral differences, have evolved in cavefish. The size and number of cranial neuromasts has increased (Jeffery et al. 2000; Teyke 1990), possibly to more effectively avoid obstacles while swimming in darkness. There are also several differences in skeletal organization that do not have any obvious adaptation to the cave habitat. The size, shape, and organization of craniofacial bones, particularly those surrounding the eye socket, are altered in cavefish (Alvarez 1947; Yamamoto et al. 2003). Cavefish show one or two fewer rib-bearing vertebrae and a more compressed body shape than surface fish (Dowling et al. 2002). Finally, cavefish body scales are also compressed relative to surface fish scales (Wilkens 1988), perhaps to conform to their compact body.\n",

   "From William Jeffery, the author,\n \nThe Astyanax system also offers the opportunity of genetic analysis. Genetic studies indicate that mutations in multiple genes are responsible for eye degeneration and that different gene loci may be mutated in various cavefish populations (reviewed by Wilkens, 1988).\n \n ............\n \n This phenomenon, an example of parallelism in related evolutionary lineages, could have evolved by mutations in the same or in different apoptosis related genes. Isolation and characterization of Astyanax cell death genes will be necessary to distinguish between these possibilities.\n \n .............\n \n As a means of downregulating Pax-6 in the lens, cavefish may have mutated a lens-specific cisregulatory domain in the Pax-6 gene. We are currently developing in vivo transgene expression procedures to test this possibility in the Astyanax system.\n Then they did the work, narrowed it down, and reported the results in the 2003 paper.",
