   "By Carol Glatz\n Catholic News Service\n \n ROME (CNS) -- Waging a war against so-called \"rogue states\" does not and will not eliminate terrorism, but it feeds the violent fanaticism that leaders aim to eliminate, said an influential Jesuit magazine. \n \n \"In order to fight terrorism, it is necessary to shelve any notion of war -- worse when 'preventative' war -- against an Islamic nation\" and instead adopt other measures such as beefing up intelligence and freezing funds channeled to terrorist organizations, said an editorial in the magazine La Civilta Cattolica. \n \n The editorial, reviewed by the Vatican prior to publication and released to journalists discussed the consequences of waging wars against Afghanistan and Iraq in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States. \n \n Military action and invasion did not help the United States succeed in reaching its goals of capturing Osama bin Laden or the head of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, it said. \n \n And while elections and the establishment of democratic constitutions went ahead in both Afghanistan and Iraq, there still is no \"real control throughout (each) country,\" since ethnic factions \"have rapidly regained their power,\" the magazine said. \n \n After the war in Afghanistan, in fact, terrorist training camps resurfaced there which today draw young, \"aspiring terrorists\" living in Europe, it said. And Iraq, too, it said, has become a magnet for suicide bombers \"from everywhere\" to fight against \"the Western invaders,\" while, before the war, \"there were no terrorists in Iraq\" under Saddam Hussein's dictatorial grip. \n \n La Civilta Cattolica said \"waging war against countries that host, fund or train terrorist groups appears to be a grave political mistake because war not only does not destroy terrorism, it fuels and proliferates it.\" \n \n Forces from Western, non-Muslim countries invading Islamic countries create \"a serious offense against Allah\" because the situation represents an usurpation of his divine authority, which then motivates radical elements to \"defend Islam from Western aggressors,\" the editorial said. \n \n The Jesuit-run magazine said there are more effective measures in what will have to be a long-term struggle against terrorism. \n \n Leaders must emphasize that \"the fight against terrorism is not a battle against Islam\" and they must \"avoid political and military actions that might seem to embroil, humiliate, and deride Muslims,\" it said. \n \n Leaders must find a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which represents an open wound for many Muslims, it said, and leaders \"must give up the idea of imposing democracy on Islamic peoples.\" \n \n Democracy must come about from the citizens' own initiative and have the consensus of its own people as well as respect their culture and values, the magazine said. \n \n Intelligence operations and police efforts aimed at pinpointing terrorist cells must be given precedence in the fight against terrorism while national security agencies must be even more willing to coordinate efforts and exchange information, it said. \n \n Finally, it said, in order to deal a serious blow to terrorism, the channels or sources of funding for terrorist activity must be found and frozen.",
