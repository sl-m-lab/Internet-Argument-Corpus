   "George Bush is guilty of violating his oath of office in order to bring about the end of the sovereign, independent nation of the United States of America, so that another government could be put in place. This new government would be based on free trade and benefit corporations. In the process, Bush has allowed the invasion of America by Mexican nationals who supply the voters for Reconquista, an attempt to recapture the American Southwest by demographically overwhelming the region with immigrants and electing Chicanos who support this goal, which includes the ethnic cleansing of the gringos [white race]. These radical, racist mechistas now control a number of elected offices throughout the area, such as: Cruz Bustamante, Lt. Governor of California and Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles, both former members.\n \n George Bush has violated Article ll, section 1.8 of the Constitution, his oath of office \"to presrve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n \n In particular: Article 1, section 8.3. Congress has the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\" The President has pushed through Congress CAFTA [Central American Free Trade Agreement] and is attempting to have the FTAA [Free Trade Area of the Americas] passed. Both of these \"trade agreements\" along with the WTO and NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], transfer constitutional power from member states, including the United States, to multinational corporations. Tribunals and more than 30,000 pages of regulations now control commerce. Corporate tribunals and technical committees will have authority that will cover most aspects of life for citizens in the resulting megastate [if the FTAA passes]. This new megastate will encompass 34 nations of the Western Hemisphere, minus Cuba.\n \n Article lV, section 4. \"The United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion.\" The President has, with full knowledge of the consequences of his actions, failed to secure the border with Mexico in the midst of continued massive, illegal immigration, plus a loudly proclaimed invasion by \"Mexican/American\" radicals against the United States. Bush is doing nothing because within four years a new political union is scheduled to be in place and the borders between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico are to be open to commerce and people [see SPPNA below]\n \n Vicente Fox, President of Mexico, is fully behind open borders. In addition to providing cheap labor to America, the money sent home to relatives in Mexico is a safety valve for millions of poor, disgruntled citizens. Fox, a supporter of Reconquista, the recolonizing of the Southwestern U.S., has also given dual citizenship to Mexican/Americans who apply. They can vote in Mexican elections as well as influence American policy in the United States. Today, as a result, many elected offices in this region are held by Mexican/A mericans whose loyalty is not with the United States. \n \n George Bush wants open borders, not only because the new political union would allow citizens of all three nations [eventually] to live and work anywhere within the other nations, but because he needs tens of millions of immigrants to pay for the retirement of 78 million baby boomers, starting in 2008. Bush has quietly negotiated a Totalization of Social Security Agreement with Mexico that would make millions of illegal aliens and their dependents in Mexico eligible for social security payments [according to the GAO]. All he has to do is sign it. Not satisfied, Bush also wants a guest worker [amnesty] program passed. A recent PEW International poll found that if he is successful, nearly half the population of Mexico would cross the border.\n \n Meanwhile, the invasion of illegal Mexicans is spreading across America like a malignant cancer, from California to Florida and up the East Coast. This increase of foreigners, with no prospects for jobs, is putting an unmanageable strain on our healthcare, welfare, and criminal justice system.These immigrants are not assimilating by choice. They are, in fact, maintaining their language and culture. Associated with this is a general historical anger toward gringos. And with the success of Reconquista evident and a not uncommon topic in the Hispanic media, the future is assured. Balkanization and the breakup of the United States of America is well underway. The person who could reverse it, but will not, is George Bush. \n \n Article lll, section 3.1 Treason. Bush is conspiring with citizens and foreigners, leaders of corporations, members of his administration, and others to dismantle the government of the United States by passing illegal acts, under the guise of trade agreements, that take constitutional power away from Congress and the judicial system and transfer it to corporations.\n \n In addition, Bush has, as a prelude to the FTAA, secretly planned with President Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Martin of Canada, to establish a new political and economic union, the SPPNA [Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America], aka North America. This union was announced, with little fanfare, on March 23, 2005 by the three leaders meeting at Waco, Texas and included few details. It will be operational in 2010. This new North America is being planned and implemented without the knowledge or consent of the American people.\n \n The Council on Foreign Relations is responsible for the creation of the SPPNA with its sponsorship of the multinational task force on Building a North American Community. The task force recommends the appointment of a North American Advisory Council and a North American Inter-Parliamentary Group to help with the integration of the three nations of North America. \n \n These two bodies, like those in the European Union, could eventually transform into law-making institutions. They would bypass the various legislatures of the three member states. Laws passed by them would be binding on every individual in North America. The sovereignty and independence of the U.S. and every member state would defer to the new union of North America.\n \n And later, if the FTAA is accepted by the 34 nations of the hemisphere, 800,000,000 citizens would live under the sovereignty of the [to be named] megastate. As chapter ll, article 4.2 of the FTAA Draft Agreement makes clear, every level of government of each member state would have to change its \"laws, regulations, and administrative procedures\" to make sure they are consistent with the FTAA .\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/03/print/20050323-4.html\n http://www.cfr.org/publication/8121/building_a_north_american_community.html\n www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/print/20050627-2.html",

   "Normally I disdain stuff from the LaRouche people but I admit I am quite intrigued by the following:\n \n http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2006/3302alito_fuehrerprinzip.html\n \n \nJudge Samuel Alito and The `F\u00fchrerprinzip'\n by Jeffrey Steinberg \n On Jan. 5, 2006, in a front-page story, the Wall Street Journal identified Judge Samuel Alito, President George W. Bush's nominee to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court, as a leading proponent of the savagely unconstitutional doctrine of the \"unitary executive.\" The idea of the \"unitary executive,\" which forms the core dogma of the ultra-right-wing Federalist Society, to which Judge Alito belongs, is more properly identified by its modern historical name-the F\u00fchrerprinzip, authored by the Nazi regime's anointed \"Crown Jurist\" Carl Schmitt. Schmitt's doctrine, that the charismatic head of state is the law, and can assert absolute dictatorial authority during periods of emergency, has been used to legitimize every totalitarian regime in the West, from Hitler, through Gen. Francisco Franco in Spain, through Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile, to President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in the United States.\n \n The Wall Street Journal quoted Judge Alito from a November 2000 speech, delivered, appropriately, before a Federalist Society convention in Washington, D.C. The Constitution, Alito declared, \"makes the President the head of the executive branch, but it does more than that. The President has not just some executive powers, but the executive power-the whole thing.\"\n \n Judge Alito elaborated, \"I thought then\"-referring to his 1980s tenure at the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel-\"and I still think, that this theory best captures the meaning of the Constitution's text and structure,\" adding that, in his view, the Framers \"saw the unitary executive as necessary to balance the huge power of the legislature and the factions that may gain control of it.\"\n \n After reviewing the Wall Street Journal account, Lyndon LaRouche declared, \"If Judge Alito does in fact adhere to the views reported in the Wall Street Journal, he should not be allowed near any court-certainly not the United States Supreme Court-except as a defendant.\" LaRouche insisted that Alito's nomination must be decisively defeated in the Senate, or the Supreme Court will fall fatally into the hands of a cabal of outright \"Schmittlerian\" Nazis, led by Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Alito-all members of the self-avowed \"conservative revolutionary\" Federalist Society.\n \n LaRouche counterposed the outright Nazi doctrine of the Federalist Society proponents of the \"unitary executive\" (F\u00fchrerprinzip) to the American System principles invoked by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he was confronted with the awesome responsibility of preparing the United States for world war. On Sept. 8, 1939, at a press conference following his Proclamation of Limited Emergency, as war was erupting in Europe, FDR assured the American people, \"There is no intention and no need of doing all those things that could be done.... There is no thought in any shape, manner or form, of putting the Nation, in its defenses or in its internal economy, on a war basis. That is one thing we want to avoid. We are going to keep the nation on a peace basis, in accordance with peacetime authorizations.\"\nDoes this argument have a leg to stand on?",

   "Congress has ceded the power to regulate commerce and much more to corporate interests with the passage of NAFTA, CAFTA and the possible coup de grace, the proposed FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas). The only way to have a corporate regional trading state is to destroy the sovereignty of each member state. The best way to accomplish this in America is \"an end run around the Constitution, eroding it piece by piece.\" [Politics http://www.thesigintreport.com]\n \n NAFTA's big weapon against government is Chapter 11, which allows foreign corporations to sue a government if it passes laws that prevent a company from making a profit in that member state. Many of the suits under NAFTA and the WTO have been based on environmental laws. \n \n \"Corporate investors also have used NAFTA's investor-state enforcement system to challenge domestic court rulings, local and state environmental policies, municipal contracts, tax policy, federal controlled substances regulations, federal and state anti-gambling policies, a federal government's alleged failure to provide water rights, and even the provision of public postal services (Canada).\" http://www.bilaterals.org/article-print.php3?id_article=1353\n \n Nafta-created tribunals have handled challenges to U.S. court verdicts and ruled on them. And in one case (Mississippi), declared \"a Mississippi court's judgement at odds with international law, leaving the United States government potentially liable for hundreds of millions of dollars.\" http://www.globalisation.org.au/html/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1354\n \n Mexico and Canada have lost cases brought against them by foreign corporations and the U.S., under the WTO, has also lost to foreign corporations on conflicts between environmental laws and trade agreements.\n \n \"These cases show that there is a growing threat to democratic governance and state sovereignty as more and more state and local government policies, even court decisions, are targeted by NAFTA investors.\" [bilaterals.org above] \n \n John D. Echeverria, a law professor at Georgetown University, said: \"This is the biggest threat to United States judicial independence...\" [The Globalisation Roundtable, Nafta Tribunals Stir U.S. Worries, see globalisation.org above]\n \n Other scholars, commenting on the authority of NAFTA and WTO tribunals to review and rule on cases, \"above even the United States Supreme Court, is a significant development.\"\n \n Peter Spiro, Hofstra University law professor,, stated \"... it points to a fundamental reorientation of our constitutional system. You have an international tribunal essentially reviewing American court judgements.\"\n \n Abner Mikva, a NAFTA judge considering the Mississippi case: \"If Congress had known that there was anything like this in Nafta, they would never have voted for it.\"\n \n According to judges and legal scholars, \"... the tribunals have the potential to upset the settled American constitutional order.\"\n \n Chief Justice Ronald M. George of the California Supreme Court warned, \"There are grave implications here. It's rather shocking that the highest courts of the states and federal governments could have their judgements circumvented by these tribunals.\" \n \n The FTAA goes farther, incorporating regulations from NAFTA and other trade agreements that will take much of what is left of America's sovereignty.\n \n \"The FTAA's 'services agreement' grants private corporations sweeping new authority to overrule government regulations. Under the FTAA, all public services-schools, hospitals, prisons (and much more)- would be forced to open up for competition from foreign for-profit service corporations.\" http://earthisland.org/eijournal/new_articles.cfm?articleID=451&journalID=63\n \n Government services, such as water and sewer are open to privatization for profit. They are not held accountable. The record of private foreign takeover of public works is disgraceful throughout the world, with skyrocketing rates and violent reactions from the people, including the victory over Bechtel Corporation in Cochabamba, Bolivia. See: http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/econ/2003/0709water.htm\n \n How will sovereignty be affected by the FTAA? Chapter II, article 4.2 of the FTAA Draft Agreement states: \"The Parties (member states, including America) shall insure that their laws, regulations, and administrative procedures are consistent with the obligations of this agreement.\"\n \n This applies to all levels of government: city, county, state, and federal. Governments from all 34 nations of the FTAA must change their laws, etc, in order to conform to the many regulations of this agreement of face penalties imposed by an unelected tribunal.\n \n George Bush pushed CAFTA (Central American Free Trade Agreement) through Congress on fast track with an up or down vote and called them agreements instead of treaties, which would require a large majority vote to pass plus time to debate and study the fine print. Bush is trying the same deception with the FTAA. He knows that if Congress and the American people understood what he has planned for America, they would reject it overwhelmingly and take the necessary legal action against the perpetrators.\n \n \n \"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious, but it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly, but the traitor moves amongst those within the gates freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the valleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their garments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.\" Cicero",
