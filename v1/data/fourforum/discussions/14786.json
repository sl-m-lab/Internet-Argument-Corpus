Nothing can relieve the guilt of a slave owner, no matter how many other people did it.\n\n \n Slight problem with that. I don't know any former slave owners that're still alive; bankers and other mortgage and loan groups notwithstanding.\n \n Seriously, how many plantation owners who employed forced cotton pickers are still alive to stand trial for their misdeeds and condemned for their actions? None that I know of. And attacking somebody for what their grandparents did just isn't right.\n \n And then you've got the issue of high ranking slaves that actually owned slaves of their own during this time. So you had whites owning blacks, and at the same time you had blacks who owned other blacks. Think on that one.",
