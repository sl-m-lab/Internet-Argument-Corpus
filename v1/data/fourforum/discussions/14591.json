   "God did not create the universe, says Hawking - Yahoo! News\n \n LONDON (Reuters) - God did not create the universe and the \"Big Bang\" was an inevitable consequence of the laws of physics, the eminent British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking argues in a new book.\n \n In \"The Grand Design,\" co-authored with U.S. physicist Leonard Mlodinow, Hawking says a new series of theories made a creator of the universe redundant, according to the Times newspaper which published extracts on Thursday.\n \n \"Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist,\" Hawking writes.\n \n \"It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.\"\n \n Hawking, 68, who won global recognition with his 1988 book \"A Brief History of Time,\" an account of the origins of the universe, is renowned for his work on black holes, cosmology and quantum gravity.\n \n Since 1974, the scientist has worked on marrying the two cornerstones of modern physics -- Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which concerns gravity and large-scale phenomena, and quantum theory, which covers subatomic particles.\n \n His latest comments suggest he has broken away from previous views he has expressed on religion. Previously, he wrote that the laws of physics meant it was simply not necessary to believe that God had intervened in the Big Bang.\n \n He wrote in A Brief History ... \"If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason -- for then we should know the mind of God.\"\n \n In his latest book, he said the 1992 discovery of a planet orbiting another star other than the Sun helped deconstruct the view of the father of physics Isaac Newton that the universe could not have arisen out of chaos but was created by God.\n \n \"That makes the coincidences of our planetary conditions -- the single Sun, the lucky combination of Earth-Sun distance and solar mass, far less remarkable, and far less compelling evidence that the Earth was carefully designed just to please us human beings,\" he writes.\n \n Hawking, who is only able to speak through a computer-generated voice synthesizer, has a neuro muscular dystrophy that has progressed over the years and left him almost completely paralyzed.\n \n He began suffering the disease in his early 20s but went on to establish himself as one of the world's leading scientific authorities, and has also made guest appearances in \"Star Trek\" and the cartoons \"Futurama\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n \n Last year he announced he was stepping down as Cambridge University's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, a position once held by Newton and one he had held since 1979.",

   "Delusion is your bag, not mine. You're the one lining up to be a hot lunch for Satan and his demons.\n\n \n You've heard the story of Santa Claus Right?.. what about the Story of Mohammed?.. or the Story of the Mormon fonder Joseph Smith?...Do you believe any of them? or are these just Fairy tales?...\n \n Well let me tell you a story....\n * God inseminated a virgin named Mary, in order to bring his son incarnate into our world.\n * Mary and her fiance, Joseph, had to travel to Bethlehem to register for the census. There Mary gave birth to the Son of God.\n * God put a star in the sky to guide people to the baby.\n * In a dream God told Joseph to take his family to Egypt. Then God stood by and watched as Herod killed thousands and thousands of babies in Israel in an attempt to kill Jesus.\n * As a man, God's son claimed that he was God incarnate: \"I am the way, the truth and the life,\" he said.\n * This man performed many miracles. He healed lots of sick people. He turned water into wine. These miracles prove that he is God.\n * But he was eventually given the death sentence and killed by crucifixion.\n * His body was placed in a tomb.\n * But three days later, the tomb was empty.\n * And the man, alive once again but still with his wounds (so anyone who doubted could see them and touch them), appeared to many people in many places.\n * Then he ascended into heaven and now sits at the right hand of God the father almighty, never to be seen again.\n * Today you can have a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus. You can pray to this man and he will answer your prayers. He will cure your diseases, rescue you from emergencies, help you make important business and family decisions, comfort you in times of worry and grief, etc.\n * This man will also give you eternal life, and if you are good he has a place for you in heaven after you die.\n * The reason we know all this is because, after the man died, four people named Matthew, Mark, Luke and John wrote accounts of the man's life. Their written attestations are proof of the veracity of this story. \n \n Does this sound familiar? If you are a Christian, you probably believe this. I could ask you questions for hours and you will have answers for every one of them. You cannot understand how anyone could question any of it, because it is so obvious to you.\n \n Here is the thing that I would like to help you understand If you can: The four billion people who are not Christians look at the Christian story in exactly the same way that you look at the Santa story, the Mormon story and the Muslim story. In other words, there are four billion people who stand outside of the Christian bubble, and they can see reality clearly. The fact is, the Christian story is completely imaginary. How do the four billion non-Christians know, with complete certainty, that the Christian story is imaginary? Because the Christian story is just like the Santa story, the Mormon story and the Muslim story. There is the magical insemination, the magical star, the magical dreams, the magical miracles, the magical resurrection, the magical ascension and so on. People outside the Christian faith look at the Christian story and note these facts: \n \n * The miracles are supposed to \"prove\" that Jesus is God, but, predictably, these miracles left behind no tangible evidence for us to examine and scientifically verify today. They all involved faith healings and magic tricks.\n \n * Jesus is resurrected, but, predictably, he does not appear to anyone today.\n \n * Jesus ascended into heaven and answers our prayers, but, predictably, when we pray to him nothing happens. We can statistically analyse prayer and find that prayers are never answered.\n \n * The book where Matthew, Mark, Luke and John make their attestations does exist, but, predictably, it is chock full of problems and contradictions.\n \n * And so on. \n \n In other words, the Christian story is a fairly tale, just like the other three Stories I mentioned at the top.\n \n Now, look at what is happening inside your mind at this moment. I am using solid, verifiable evidence to show you that the Christian story is imaginary. Your rational mind can see the evidence. Four billion non-Christians would be happy to confirm for you that the Christian story is imaginary. However, if you are a practicing Christian, you can probably feel your \"religious mind\" overriding both your rational mind and your common sense as we speak. Why? Why were you able to use your common sense to so easily reject the Santa story, the Mormon story and the Muslim story, but when it comes to the Christian story, which is just as imaginary, you are not? \n \n Try, just for a moment, to look at Christianity with the same amount of healthy skepticism that you used when approaching the stories of Santa, Joseph Smith and Mohammed. Use your common sense to ask some very simple questions of yourself: \n \n * Is there any physical evidence that Jesus existed? - No. He left no trace. His body \"ascended into heaven.\" He wrote nothing down. None of his \"miracles\" left any permanent evidence. There is, literally, nothing.\n \n * Is there any reason to believe that Jesus actually performed these miracles, or that he rose from the dead, or that he ascended into heaven? - There is no more of a reason to believe this than there is to believe that Joseph Smith found the golden plates hidden in New York, or that Mohammed rode on a magical winged horse to heaven. Probably less of a reason, given that the record of Jesus' life is 2,000 years old, while that of Joseph Smith is less than 200 years old.\n \n * You mean to tell me that I am supposed to believe this story of Jesus, and there is no proof or evidence to go by beyond a few attestations in the New Testament of a Bible that is provably meaningless? \n \n No one (besides little kids) believes in Santa Claus. No one outside the Mormon church believes Joseph Smith's story. No one outside the Muslim faith believes the story of Mohammed and Gabriel and the winged horse. No one outside the Christian faith believes in Jesus' divinity, miracles, resurrection, etc.\n \n Therefore, the question I would ask you to consider right now is simple: Why is it that human beings can detect fairy tales with complete certainty when those fairy tales come from other faiths, but they cannot detect the fairy tales that underpin their own faith? Why do they believe their chosen fairy tale with unrelenting passion and reject the others as nonsense?\n \n You are delusional EZ.. not me....",
