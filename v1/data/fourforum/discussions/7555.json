If drug smugglers can dig extensive tunnels under the Mexico/US border and go months without detection, a terrorist could certainly have accomplished one successful mission out of ten tries. Sounds like more government number cooking and deception, the usual stuff to keep the general public pacified. We're shooting ourselves in both feet in Iraq and on the fiscal side, why would a terrorist even bother when we're doing such a great job?",

The bush administration arrested him and claimed he was planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the US. They never released any evidence of the claim, and held the guy for several years without charges. When it became apparent that the supreme court was going to grant him a review, the administration had him indicted in Florida. Conspicously absent from the charges was anything related to planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the US. We are just supposed to take the Bush admins word for it.

His timing of the statements release it a bit odd, as it comes at a time when Bush is under fire for his policys dealing with terrorism.\n\n \n I think Bush really shot himself in the foot with this one. I have to assume that he's done something in the last four years. However, by making a claim that most people are assuming to be an overstatement at best and a lie at worst, he's put people in the position of being extra sceptical about his claims. So now if he does present details about an actual accomplishment very few will simply accept it at face value. Any honest statements he makes will simply get lumped in with the \"10 incidents\" statement, which very few find credible.",

   "I say \"NO.\" He's just trying to make himself look good. A lot of what he says is an attempt to try and make him look good. Since last summer however, an increasing number of US citizens who speak up are thinking that he just looks \"stoopid\" (misspelled on purpose.)\n \n Actually, it would seem that what prevented any more terrorist attacks would have been the news/media. They would come on and say that they believe terrorist were about to bomb such and such a place. They could enter at this one location and go all around and kill a bunch of people and then the terrorist were probibly watching that and saying \"Hey, that's better than what I came up with.\"\n \n There is no way to prove for an absolute fact that the Bush administration prevented 10 terrorist attacks. The only way would be to find documents on what the terrorist specifically planned to do, what was the order given to prevent it, who carried it out and who gave the orders. We live in a world now where documents like that could be easily forge once again to make him look good.",

   "The only 2 that we really have information on is Farris and Padilla. Padila has been charged criminally now, and as I said, there is NO mention of any plans to attack the US in his indictment.\n \n As far as Farris goes, the guy was talkin gbaotu using an acetelyne torch to cut the suspension cables on the brooklyn bridge. By all accounts, aftert he realized that this would take hours, and the bridge would probably still not fall, the plan was scrapped. He also talked about derailing trains, but could not figure out a good way to do it. The Railroad uses devices called \"derails\" for this. There are two fo them at the end of EVERY dead end spur in the country, and usually piles of thems sitting around every rail depot in the country becuase workers have to put derails on the tracks when they are working a section of track to ensure that a train does not hit them. Stealing a derail consists of picking it up (they weigh abot 80 LBS) and putting it in the back of your vehicle. If you can't find one in a rail yard or depot, you have to steal one off the trckes, whcih involves throwing 2 locking levers before picking them up and putting them in your car.\n \n These were nto the discussions of a terrorist mastermind. They were the idle speculation of an idiot. \n \n I can only imagine this is why the Bush administration is so secretive. When you put all the details together, their prevented terrorist attacks tend to look unimpressive.",
