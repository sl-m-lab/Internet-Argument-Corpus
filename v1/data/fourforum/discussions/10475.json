   "Christ starts out by telling us how proud the RICH MAN (Chirst's Mr. Scrooge) was of his successful business. Very similar to the the Christmas Carol Story and how that MR. Scrooge loved his business and money (see Luke 12:16-19).\n \n ---------Luke 12:16-19\n 16 And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. 17 He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' 18 \"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19 And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.'\"\n \n One of RICH MAN'S friends/employees (Lazarus) was sufferring and needed help. Very similar to the little cripple boy in the Christmas Carol Story (see Luke 16:19-21)\n \n ---------Luke 16:19-21\n 19 \"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.\n \n Then the RICH MAN was told by GOD that this very day he was going to die. Many of GOD'S communications are made in dreams (Joseph and Samuel to name a couple). So I BELIEVE that message could have been a dream too just like the dream Mr. Scrooge had in the Christmas Carol (see Luke 12:20).\n \n ---------Luke 12:20\n 20 \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'\n \n In the Christmas Carol, Mr. Scrooge got to see what his future life was going to be like for him and the little cripple boy. In Luke 16:22-31 Christ talks about the future of LAZARUS and RICH MAN and their eternal resting places. I BELIEVE that was a vision/warning of what was to be if the RICH MAN didn't change his was. Once again very similar to the Christmas Carol. For all we know Christ's vision/warning might have been presented to the RICH MAN in a dream too (see Luke 16:22-31)\n \n ---------Luke 16:22-31\n 22 \"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' 25 \"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' 27 \"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' 29 \"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' 30 \"'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' 31 \"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'\"\n \n In the Chrismas Carol, when Mr. Scrooge got up the next morning he thought about what happened during the night and was happy to know it all happened in one night. He still had time to do something about it. In Christ's version the RICH MAN also thought about what was going to happen to him if he didn't change. So he thought about it and started thinking about what he could do to make his future happier once he lost his riches. Very similar to the plot in the Christmas Carol (see Luke 16:1-3).\n \n ---------Luke 16:1-3\n (NOTE: After the dream the RICH MAN became very religious and started thinking of himself as a servant of GOD NOT a rich land owner. So Christ started calling him a SHREWD MANAGER because he learned how to SAVE HIS SOUL. He learned heavenly treasures are MORE important the earthly possessions that CAN'T be taken with you when you die. Once again very similar to what Mr. Scrooge did after his dream in the Christmas carol.)\n 1 Jesus told his disciples: \"There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. 2 So he called him in (THE DREAM) and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.' 3 \"The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg--\n \n At this point Mr. Scrooge and Christ's SHREWD MANAGER (former RICH MAN) start changing their lives. They both start to care more about GIVING than RECEIVING. They start caring more about being kind to everyone because GOD is going to judge them one day soon. They both knew they only have a SHORT TIME to get on GOD'S good side (See Luke 16:4-7).\n \n ---------Luke 16:4-7\n (NOTE: Remember, RICH MAN is now referred to a the SHREWD MANAGER and the MASTER is GOD because the RICH MAN is now VERY RELIGIOUS and thinks of himself as servant of GOD NOT a RICH MAN.)\n 4 I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here (LOSE HIS LIFE), people will welcome me into their houses.' 5 \"So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 6 \"'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. \"The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.' 7 \"Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' \"'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. \"He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.' \n \n The ending to Christ's version of The Christmas Carol is actually the SHREWD MANAGER/RICH MAN'S final judgement (see Luke 16:8)\n \n ---------Luke 16:8\n \"The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly.\"",

   "Luke 16 for XXXXXX:\n \n 1Jesus told his disciples: \"There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.\n \n The rich man here is God, for God owns everything.\n \n 2So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.' \n \n All will be accountable to God in the end. In this case, God was upset with the man who was a poor steward of what was given him.\n \n 3\"The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg- \n \n Here the poor and evil manager thinks only of himself\n \n 4I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.' \n \n Rather than engage in honesty for a change, he seeks to exploit debtors to his Master (God). Conning them with his last moments in office as a manager into paying the Master (God) whom they owe only a small portion of the full ammount that is due.\n \n 5\"So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' \n \n 6\" 'Eight hundred gallons[a] of olive oil,' he replied. \n \"The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.' \n \n 7\"Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' \n \" 'A thousand bushels[b] of wheat,' he replied. \n \"He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.' \n \n Scammy McScammer, the poor steward, loses his Master (God) much in his con game. But, that's not his goal. His goal is personal advancement.\n \n 8\"The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. \n 9I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. \n \n We see that PERSONAL schrewdness is favored in a dishonest man. It's from scripture as this that we get the notion that \"God Helps Those Who Help Themselves\". We also are extolled to use 'borrowed' (all things belong to God) items of a materialistic nature to BUY friends and alliances. Because, as witnessed in mega-churches...numbers mean everything...and screw sound theology and a sopund doctrine.\n \n 10\"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. 11So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? \n 12And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own? \n \n Here we see a logic disconnect. The manager was repeatedly DISHONEST. In ALL of his transactions, he cheated the Master (God) but, since God's a XXXXX, it's all A-okay.\n \n 13\"No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.\" \n \n And this is true also. The manager served himself in ALL instances here.\n \n 14The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 15He said to them, \"You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God's sight.\n \n According to this parable, God would love the self-serving Pharasies who sought to elevate themselves in the eyes of man.\n \n \n I find it ironic that this parable seems to contradict the other one on Good Stewardship found in Matthew 25:14-30 (also Luke 19_\n Where God seems to want a RETURN on His investments...and won't even settle for breaking even.\n \n This parable also seems at odds with the one of the unmerciful servent in Matthew 18:21-35\n You know, where Debts are cancelled...not 'reduced'.\n \n I particularly LOVED this little ditty:\n Matt 18:34-35\n In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. \n \"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.\"\n \n Or how about Luke 19:27\n But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them-bring them here and kill them in front of me.\n \n Yep, Jesus says God will torture people who are unmerciful.\n This is even NT talk...and not any of that OT (it doesn't count anymore) clap-trap.\n Should stop any of those 'free gift of mercy and grace to all' arguments some liberals push.",

   "My initial post:\n \n \nIf HE does or doesn't help you, ISN'T IMPORTANT. What is IMPORTANT is: Are you on HIS TEAM or not? And can you afford to be on any other team and against HIM?\n \n Spending ETERNITY in hell is NOT a risk I'm willing to take. Once you get there, you DON'T get a second chance.

Just the reward of heaven?\n\n \n My answer with GOD'S HELP:\n \n At the Last Super, Christ taught the apostles and us to be SERVANTS to each other (he washed the apostles feet as an example). Earlier he told us if you want to be his disciple, you had to give up everything and follow him. He also said the last shall be first and the first shall be last. This world is ONLY a test to see what kind of an eternal reward we deserve. Will it be a feast like Lazarus experienced in the passage I referenced or punishment like the rich man experienced in the same passage?\n \n Are you willing to take up your cross and follow Christ for the reward of eternal happiness?

But do they mean it. \n \n Based on your response we DON'T need LAWS, traffic signals, speed limits, police, jails, court, .... People will be good. RIGHT?\n\n \n You have a point: NOT everyone does live like that. Laws are needed to protect society. But some of man's laws are EITHER hard to enforce, or in some cases just PLAIN wrong. I won't go into which laws, as that is a whole different discussion, and PEOPLE disagree about which laws are which.\n \n But that doesn't mean you have to invent an all-seeing higher power so that people will BELIEVE that someone is always watching them. This all-seeing being has laws that transend man's FEEBLE mind, which are truly just and all-encompassing. But then depending on who you are and what agenda you have, men (and women) still disagree about which of these laws are important. And in some cases those of GOD'S laws that man has decided are important are just plain wrong. Again, I won't go into which these laws are, because that would just be my OPINION and everyone has their own version of which laws are which.\n \n So, do I decide for myself how I'm GOING to live my life, making an effort to protect myself, whilst doing as much good and as little damage to others as I can, or do I pick a DEITY and then pick and choose which of his/her laws are important to me and LIVE by them (that's what people do)? I see little difference.

   "your reply is actually avoiding the issue. i have kids, and i make it very evident to my kids that i exist by my consitent presence and impactful intervention in their lives. the things that i own are constantly being used by me. \n \n conversely, to children that grow up without their fathers, in their minds and lives their fathers may as well not exist. similarly, if you own things that you neglect or don't use, it is no different from you not owning them at all.\n \n the point is that god, if he exists, acts as the derelict father of single-parent kids, or the neglectful owner of discount trinkets that he never even takes out of the original package. so to us, what is the point of considering his existence? if god has the option to father his children or utilize his property, why doesnt he?\n\n \n Just as we CAN'T help a drug user that doesn't want to quit\n We CAN'T help a drinker that isn't interested in stopiing\n So to we CAN'T help a person SAVE themselves if they DON'T want to be saved.\n \n Enjoy this life while you can. The next one is going to be HELL.",

   "what? \n \n i'm typing this very slowly\n \n #1 explain how does GOD intervene in human lives in a way that they can identify HIM?\n \n #2 how can you know if and when GOD has ever helped you do anything?\n \n #3 what does GOD do to demonstrate that HE created and owns anything in the world?\n\n \n The answer to question #1 is simple. When you're doing something really difficult that requires lots of perfect cuts and you know the job is over your head but the it all fits together. Or when every extra little piece just happens to the the right size and doesn't need cutting. That's when you know GOD'S helping you. And if you think the wind and weather is working against you, you'll know GOD is trying to stop you from making a mistake or you need time to learn something else before you continue the job.\n \n The answer to question #2 is when you're clearning an empty lot and find things (steel trash but tools for you) that you will later need to do another big project. Or when you've dug a trench for some pipe and GOD forces some rain in the DRY SEASON to fill part of your trench and dig a channel in a different direction. So you move you work to where HE wants it.\n \n The answer to question #3 is DON'T MESS WITH GOD. HE'S going to make man pay for every disaster man causes. For every one of man's disasters, GOD will use nature to AUTOMATICALLY correct the imbalance. After all GOD invented AUTOMATION. Man just recently had the intelegence to find that tool.",
