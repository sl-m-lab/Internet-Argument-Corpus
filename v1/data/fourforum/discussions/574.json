She has enough power in the industry to do more interesting stuff than she did when she was younger.\n \n She is however absolutely brilliant at marketing. And incredible business woman. And she is quite beautiful.\n \n As far as singers go though - there are many with better voices - Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, even the ever annoying Maria Carey has a better voice.\n \n My favorite female vocalist is lady named Johnette Napalatino. (She is also plays bass and guitar). She fronts a band called Concrete Blonde (and is about Madonna's age). I have seen her several times. Her voice is from another place. Absolutely astonishing. Whispering in your ear one minute and making your head explode the next. I see 2-6 shows a month and she is hands down the best singer I have ever seen.",
