The exception would be a raid array in either stripiong or dual mode. A few Raid setups actualy support SATA II. Our server at work supports it, and it cost nearly $600 extra for true SATA II support. If your machine truly supports it and has the processing power to handle it, SATA II makes the machine noticably faster.",
