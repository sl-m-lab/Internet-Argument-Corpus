I think they had some bias but they were simply out for the country's best interest really. Eventually by Bush's second term they began to realize that he's just a goof and he's fouling up pretty bad now. \n \n I personally think Bush is just a face and a name where as Cheney is the man with the power orchestrating things. \n \n I'm on a rant watch out...\n \n Iraq was necessary because let's face it, we've never had that many friends in the world to begin with besides our mother country (England). So it's the only way America survives by flexing it's arm and ####### all over the rest of the world. Our economy is always bolstered by war and what do you know Ta-Da! It also helps if you pick a rather weak enemy, one that people wouldn't mind that much being gone (Sadam) but I think US has overstayed their welcome. Now with us going in Gun's Blazing we got some other countries thinking twice about messing with us, of course we shook out all the fanatical nuts with Bush's comment about our God vs their God. However this is necessary since the soldiers will feel more justified in their killing of the \"infidel\". I support the troops 100% but I just think there is a lot of shady business going on. It just seems that if you make war a \"holy war\" your soldiers perform a lot better thinking they will be rewarded in heaven and that goes for both sides.

   "80% eh. Show me a poll.\n I know a soldier who was over there, they want us there.\n\n \n There are 2 problems with relying on the opinions of soldiers who have been in theatre (3 if you count the average IQ of american soldiers). The first is the fact that soldiers in any war tend to have an incredible capacity for self delusion. This is easily understandable. Either you are there fighting for whatever cause you feel is worthy, and ultimatly for the good of the people, or you are just a murderer. Nobody wants to be thought of as a murderer.\n \n The second problem is that the odds of a soldier in theatre having a realistic idea of the local populations opinion of them is slim to none. Not only do only 2% of american troops int he ME speak any form of arabic, you have the old \"smile at the guy with the machine gun\" going on. When an armoroed convoy turns the corner and comes down your street, it does not matter who is in the convoy or whether you like them or not. You smile and cheer and wave. When you are talking a US convoy, where they will stop and snatch you up and stick you in abu ghraib and torture you for being unfriendly, you try twice as hard to be friendly, at least until they are past and you can shoot them in the back.\n \n The last government sanctioned poll I am aware of that was released just as Bremer was leaving. It showed an overwhelming desire in the Iraqi people to get the US out of their country. The us response?

Elections do not a democracy make. \n \n Second EVERY SINGLE free country is free becase the movement was initioated from within. There is not one single example of a free and openly democratic government which was created by use of force from an outside nation.

Over half of baghdad households are still on generators. Water service is at less than 60% of pre war levels. The problem is that Iraqs utility infrastructure is composed almost entirely of European equipment, mostly French and German (much like thier oil equipment). In the Bush administrations childish efforts to punish nations that refused to join us in our illegal war by refusing to allow them to participate in reonstruction, we are not ordering parts from these companies. It is like trying to rebuild a Volkswagon but refusing to use German parts. \n \n My former company is making a KILLING right now building custom valve bodies and flow control apparatus for the Iraq water supply infrastructure. They are getting $2500 each for parts that can be purchased from the original French manufacturer for under $200. In addition to the rediculous waste of money, instead of ordering a box of 1000 of the things and getting them installed immediatly, they are turning out 10 a week.

Stop letting your special interest groups and their propaganda think for you and start thinking for yourself.\n\n \n Wrong answer. Compare the numbers yourself with timelines. If you discount MILITARY deaths, such as the deaths of Iranian soldiers, and Kurds who were activley in revolt, we have outkilled Saddam neraly 4 to 1 on a yearly basis. The huge body counts you see for Saddams reign are NOT civilian body counts, they are holding him personally responsible for every death int he Iran/Iraq war (a war that we ASKED him to fight and provided the weapons to do so) and putting down the Kurdish and Shia uprisings.

Bin Laden has praised bush on more than one occasion for spendign the billions of dollars,....billions of dollars that we cannot afford to spend, in fighting this idiotic and ill concieved war. Bin Laden has said from the very start, on multiple occasions, that AQ would NOT engage the US militarily, but would bait us and sit back and watch us bankrupt ourselves in an attempt to figth a phantom enemy. They lay their strategy out in the open from the very start. It was broadcast on international television, and some people are still too damn stupid to realize that the only way we can beat AQ is by showing restraint and only fighting battles that we can win. \n \n AQ used the EXACT same tactic in Afghanistan, and despite the fact that the Soviets controlled the entire country, they beat the soviets. They did not beat them through force of arms, they simply baited them then retreated and watched the Soviets spend themselves to death. Frankly, people who have not figured this out yet are absolute complete and utter fools. They are using valuable oxygen that the rest of us need. \n \n THIS is whay the rest of the world feels we are loosing the war on terror. This is why every time Bin Laden makes a speech, he declares that AQ is a little closer to victory. He got up and laid out his strategy for the whoel world to see, and we are following his playbook. He could not do a better job of defeating us if HE was in the whitehouse.",

At $12-billion to rebuild the trade center, it would take Al Qaeda two dozen of those to equal what we've spent in Iraq and five a year to equal our annual homeland security defense costs of $60-billion.

How about improving security? It now takes us about an hour to get through security, but are we really any safer anyway? Many have sneaked in the same weapons used in the attack as tests. Were they to try 9/11 again it would work unless the pilots could defend themselves. I have to agree with arming the pilots. they already have control of all of our lives, they are driving us.

They are spending OUR tax dollars to hire new people in small businesses. Do you like that?

I'm not aware of how much they make, but if they need to start paying more to get more people, I'm all for it. Mainly though they already supply you room and board, right? So it's not like they should be getting as much as someone with a full time job.

We also need to spend some money on education on AIDS. We heard a speaker who visited Africa and they said that most Africans thought that if you got AIDS you could get rid of it by passing it on to someone else so people would willingly have unprotected sex when they have AIDS and sometimes rape people to give them AIDS all the while they will still have it. But medicine is a good start, and I know there are also education efforts by charities.\n \n \n\n So, one would think you would be happy there's not been a terrorist attack on U.S. soil since then.\n\n Did Clinton have a terrorist attack on US soil? I'm not defending him, I'm just saying sometimes it's timing. He had one attack, which is more than Clinton had in 8 years in the office. Does that make Clinton a better President? What if 9/11 had happened during the Clinton years? Does that make him better? Worse? The same?\n \n \n Some of these things look like good things, but many of the things you list are bad things in my opinion. I also hate how he (and other members of the government, not just Bush) makes laws such as \"The Patriot Act\" and \"No Child Left Behind\". Why not \"the intrusion on privacy act\" and the \"No Child left untested\" acts? (really, I understand this, just when people say how great these 2 acts are I get angry).",

(interesting that this restriction imposed by the AWB effected NON-assault weapons.)\n\n \n There were and are states where hi-cap magazines are not allowed, ban or no ban. The law stated no more could be manufactured after X date and all manufacturers did was produce a supply of hi-cap parts that would serve the world for decades before that date. Manufacturing and stocking just the follower retaining plate for pennies allowed 'finishing' them at market demand pace. I could legally buy hi-caps for virtually any weapon I own during the ban at reasonable prices. As to 922 compliance (the appearance factor of an assault rifle), US manufacturers had already anticipated and filled that gap within a year of ban enactment. There are now many small and large companies producing AK variations with US stamp production receivers, hardware and furniture that merely switched back to assembling their products with less expensive imported parts and dropped prices. \n \n What the ban did accomplish was reopen and encourage development of the market for small, easily concealable handguns, including cheap, Saturday night specials all the way through quality pieces with low capacity magazines. It also sold hi-cap magazines where legal for every full-sized piece that came with 10-rounders. The hi-cap magazine ban actually put more firearms and magazines into the public market than pre-ban market conditions allowed. \n \n How effective any government legislation is depends on how its perceived by the general public based on media spin. If the general public wants to think current administration helped them regain some of their 2nd amendment rights, so be it. That same public said nothing about their civil rights being stripped away for no good reason because that was made palatable, so what's the difference what they think?",
