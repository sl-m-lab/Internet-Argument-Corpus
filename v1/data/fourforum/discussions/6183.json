   "Everyone's familiar with the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq. The current official number is around 1800. This number may be a deliberate misrepresentation, however. I read recently that the number of US soldiers who have died from wounds inflicted in Iraq is closer to 9000. Apparently, to count as \"killed in Iraq\" according to Pentagon accounting, you have to die on Iraqi soil. If you're wounded in Iraq, but die on an operating table in Germany, or even in the plane as it takes off, then you're on a different tally. \n \n Now, I got this information from Ted Rall, who I do not in general consider a reliable source. However, his writings often have a germ of truth in them, and this does sound like the sort of thing that the Pentagon would do. I've tried to confirm or deny this story, but with no luck so far. Has anyone heard anything similar, or have any ideas on how to check on this?",

   "I'vbe also heard the same story, but I looked it up and it's bogus. The current bodycount of 1843 is accurate. If the story were accurate there would be a lot of abgry families out there that would be demanding to know why their dead sons and daughters aren't mentioned in the casualty list.Such a thing would be plastered all over the news in no time if it were true.",
