(If that is what you're pushing.)\n\n \n Let's forget the 'fear' thing, I suppose (just an unnecessary jab).\n \n Most religions are built on the same philosophical assumptions that under-gird science, i.e. that there are objective 'things' outside of our experience, and that these objective things can be observed, tested, manipulated, etc, without alteration.\n \n The Christian Science worldview starts from much more subjectivist foundations, believing that all is essentially Mind (i.e. G-d and his creation), and taking quite literally the belief that G-d created man in his image and likeness, as it says in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible.\n \n In Christian Science, we start from a priori assumptions about man, based on the description of man and his relation to G-d, as stated in the Bible. If those starting assumptions are true, then the deductions made in Christian Science are also.\n \n Sickness, and sin ('sin' meaning literally 'to be apart from G-d,' as in the Biblical Greek), then, stem from our misapprehension of our relationship with G-d, rather than from physical causation. A Christian Science treatment, then, involves the relinquishment of our false concepts about ourselves and our origins. In bringing our consciousness into alignment with the divine (and in 'forgetting' the seeming conditions presented us by a material world), Christian Scientists are often able to treat sickness / sin.\n \n Admittedly, it takes some amount of faith to believe these initial assumption, but as a Christian Scientist I feel validated in my faith by the amount of healings I've been witness to, received, and seen documentary evidence of. Call it post hoc ergo propter hoc, if you'd like, but there are plenty of well-documented, medically verified healings.\n \n You mentioned that you believed my faith would result in my early death via a treatable disease, but people die every day from treatable illnesses even under medical treatment. Many people also enter hospitals with curable diseases, only to die from misdiagnosis, medical malfeasance, etc.\n \n I don't claim (nor does any Christian Scientist I know) that Christian Science treatment has been 100% effective. No reasonable person would hold medical treatment up to that standard; it seems fairly unreasonable to hold Christian Science up to it, as well.\n \n As a final note, I will not be debating Christian Science with you, but I will be happy to answer any questions you might have about my faith.",

   "Let's forget the 'fear' thing, I suppose (just an unnecessary jab).\n\n Could be because 'fear' is the term used by your cult to describe the reasons why people get sick, yet there is little to no scriptural support for doing so.\n I've heard WofFers make the same comments.\n \n \nThe Christian Science worldview starts from much more subjectivist foundations, believing that all is essentially Mind (i.e. G-d and his creation), and taking quite literally the belief that G-d created man in his image and likeness, as it says in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible.\n\n \n Basically, your cult has the very same foundations as the Word of Faith movement (contemporary evangelicals) as well as New Age beliefs (odd bedfellows, Heathenism and pseudo Christian Fundamentalism having the same origins in in the 1800's), that all is an illusion of the mind. So you take a 'mind over body' approach. Think happy thoughts, create your own reality.\n Only is doesn't work. Definatly with any real consistancy...more like, only works as a coincidence.\n I'd says it's a delusion.\n \n \nIn Christian Science, we start from a priori assumptions about man, based on the description of man and his relation to G-d, as stated in the Bible. If those starting assumptions are true, then the deductions made in Christian Science are also.\n\n \n Both WofF and New Agers often believe that WE ARE Gods...ie. Like begets like. God...made gods. Is that the take of your belief system? If so, any scripture other than a twisted view of 'God made man in His image'? to support this? New Agers say we're Spirit and are part of the grear spirit/ God head...and thus are small gods who can do anything.\n WofFers say God created us in his immage...with all the magical powers that God had. We lost those powers and can get them back...if all we do is demand them through our covenant with God and have faith in the magical power of our faith.\n \n \nSickness, and sin ('sin' meaning literally 'to be apart from G-d,' as in the Biblical Greek), then, stem from our misapprehension of our relationship with G-d, rather than from physical causation. A Christian Science treatment, then, involves the relinquishment of our false concepts about ourselves and our origins. In bringing our consciousness into alignment with the divine (and in 'forgetting' the seeming conditions presented us by a material world), Christian Scientists are often able to treat sickness / sin.\n\n \n As Said above, you wish away your illnesses...because they are part of a false reality.\n You also chose to create a relationship history with God that didn't exist says in a twisted interpretation of some parts of the bible.\n Forgetting is also an aspect of New Age beliefs, particularly when they wish to merge differing belief systems together, like stealing Hindu apspects of reincarnation. Somehow, we 'forget' when we enter this illusionary reality.\n \n \nAdmittedly, it takes some amount of faith to believe these initial assumption, but as a Christian Scientist I feel validated in my faith by the amount of healings I've been witness to, received, and seen documentary evidence of. Call it post hoc ergo propter hoc, if you'd like, but there are plenty of well-documented, medically verified healings.\n\n \n One of the interesting things about your sister faiths, this wishing away (Creative visualization for New Agers...having faith in your faith for WofF's) of what ails you. Creating your own reality. Must take an abundant amount of faith to convince you reality doesn't exist (it's called denial) and that your existance is an illusion. I've known several who've tried such...all have failed.\n Basically, when you aren't healed, you turn the tables on the poor victim and state it's their own fault for not having sufficient 'faith'.\n Abusive, more so at times when the recipient of the fake healers doesn't get well and are yelled at for not having faith. I can only hope that your faith system isn't as abusinve...but one practiced in secrecy such as yours leaves me doubting.\n \n Ironic that they 'healings' you've been witness to have been undocumented. Most such cases are. I'd hazard a guess that those professing sickness weren't ill to begin with or merely covered their sickness with a front of wellness to cover it. Many have died in denial of their illness, professing that they simply aren't sick any longer or, 'feel fine.' If you have such documentary evidence, post it or link to it. \n I'm sure the medical community would LOVE to have such to examine also. It'd be wonderful to shed ourselves of this false reality where medicine is needed by following your simple faith practice.\n \n \nYou mentioned that you believed my faith would result in my early death via a treatable disease, but people die every day from treatable illnesses even under medical treatment. Many people also enter hospitals with curable diseases, only to die from misdiagnosis, medical malfeasance, etc.\n\n I didn't say it would. But it could and there is evidence that it does.\n Soooo...you're equating lack of treatment due to your faith as being equal to lack of treatment without your faith having the same results??? If so, why waste time with your faith?\n Or, are you muddying the waters like a good cultist would.\n Personally, I'd disagree with your comment. Only those in 3rd world type countries die from treatable diseases, only those who fail to seek aid or those who deny they're ill and refuse treatment die from such.\n I like that you brought up misdiagnosis. I do agree that the medical profession is far from 100% accurate. I'd also attest that many 'miraculously healed' wern't ill to begin with but thought they were because they listened to a medical professional who said they were. Odd, that they place such faith in the medical sciences and believe they're ill because 'doctor said so' and they were feeling a little down.\n \n \nI don't claim (nor does any Christian Scientist I know) that Christian Science treatment has been 100% effective. No reasonable person would hold medical treatment up to that standard; it seems fairly unreasonable to hold Christian Science up to it, as well.\n\n For one, you're not using MEDICAL TREATMENT. The standards are different.\n Not much of a belief system then if it's not 100% effective. You're muddying the waters by comparing medicine (an illusion based on the illusory world) with the God...which art not an illusion. No?\n ANY reasonable person would want BETTER from your silly faith system than what is present. Why would I even bother subscribing to your beliefs if they don't work? More so if they don't work and you turn around and blaim me for my 'lack of faith'. Or, is it that you'd target the ignorant and those too poor to pay for health care? Those inately superstitious?\n How much money do you spend for this nonsense?\n I've read a couple of articles where CS practioners are extolled to charge for their services. How about tithing or donations to your faith system?\n Sounds like a waste of money.\n \n \nAs a final note, I will not be debating Christian Science with you, but I will be happy to answer any questions you might have about my faith.\n\n \n So far, I've been quite surprised by your initial openings. Illogical and unfounded as I believe they are but then you have to go and state you won't debate your beliefs. Afraid their origins will come out?\n \n It also shows an unwillingness to spread this 'truth' with others. Why has CCS decided to start a PR campaign with a new, cleaner image?\n \n It's also cultic you know. Like the Scientoligist, no desire to debate the basis of the faith. \n Sad really.\n \n You follow a cult leader, Mary Eddy Baker, as if she were the messiah...I guess she was close to it since she stumbled upon this truth and was divinly inspired to write about it.\n Even if they were ideas coined by Quimby who taught her and was into messmerism himself.\n \n From Quimby's loins grew aspects of New Age beliefs down one path, Christian Science with another path and Word of Faith with another.\n All heretical and cultic in aspects steming from New Thought.\n \n My what strange siblings.\n Also stranger since many deny a commonality of origin even though it's clear they share an origin and similar belief systems.",

Hmm, how do you spell tithing?\n\n \n I'm sorry if I was somewhat misunderstod (I was secretly posting while at work)\n \n Christian Science is an off shoot of New Thought movement founded by Phineas Quimby.\n \n Like the monotheist branch that starts with Judaism, then breaks off to Christianity and Islam with subsequent branching until you get a whole tree...\n Quimby's initial New Thought beliefs were mostly stolen/ plagerized by Mary Baker Eddy to form Christian Science. Later, E.W. Kenyon also stole most elements of Quimby's beliefs to form his version of 'Christian' religion. Kenyon was whole heartedly plagerized by Kenneth Haggin to form the Word of Faith movement (an allegation that is substantiated by fact and Kenyons own daughter IIRC even maintains it's not Haggin but Kenyon who is the 'Daddy' of Word of Faith).\n \n As you'll hear my rant a lot, WofF is a psuedo-Christian belief system based on assured health and wealth prosperity gospel.\n Sickness IS Sin. Poverty IS Sin. You use your 'magical' faith powers (denial) to cure yourself of this Sin (which is a satanic attack and not God's will...CS says it's an illusion).\n This belief system is rapidly spreading across the world From Asia to Africa to South America. Where most would see Pentecostalism, you'd often find the Wolfs instead. They have the money, motivation and infrastructure as well as an easy to digest message to spread. The largest mega Church in the US, Olsteen's in TX. is a WofF church. Ted Haggard (gay former leader of the National Association of Evangelicals, helped put Bush into office, former pastor of the Largest, most influential church in CO. is WofF). Even EZ and Arch have more in common with WofF than with any other Christian sect and the belief system they push subversively enters even Catholicism abd Baptist churchs. Go to a store and look in the Christian book section. 90-100% of the books there are WofF based garbage. I'd dare you to try to find something different in Wal Mart.\n \n Anyway, Quimby's New Thought beliefs also form the basis of many New Agers beliefs.\n Creative Visualization and aspects of Reiki healing being their take of 'wishing away' what ails you.\n \n All of this purportedly different belief systems have a COMMON point of origin.\n If you take the time out to attend any of these type of meetings, you'll find the underlying philosophy to be the SAME.\n \n Reality is an illusion.\n People have the inbuilt power to do anything and make their own 'reality' happen.\n \n The only thing that changes is the psycho babble jargon they use.\n \n \n I'm not saying many of the followers aren't nice, kind and compassionate people, I'm saying their belief system is based on cultic practices.\n \n Quimby practiced mesmerism (he didn't know it was hypnotism as that term wasn't being used) and used (now common) psychological manipulations to achieve results he didn't understand ~150 years ago. Being UNEDUCATED, yet intelligent, he decided to form a belief system out of his practices.\n He 'cured' Mary who went on to attach her own 'Christian' spin to the phenomena and basically become a cult leader who stated God was divinly inspiring her. \n \n Would you say the Scientology followers of L Ron Hubbard followed a cult leaders made up babble or had found the real deal?\n \n For clarifications, New Agers and WofFaithers BOTH state we are gods. CS theology (which is what Judeau was stating here);\n \nThe Christian Science worldview starts from much more subjectivist foundations, believing that all is essentially Mind (i.e. G-d and his creation), and taking quite literally the belief that G-d created man in his image and likeness, as it says in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible.\n\n \n is a round about way of stating that they are gods (little g) because they were made in Gods image and likeness. Thus they have Gods powers.\n There are several passages (often taken in ignorance) in the bible that some could use to support this belief.\n \n Remember LITTLE g. Subtle difference...but not by much. \n \n One of the practices I'd take issue with is all 3's belief in often getting paid for their 'healings'.\n \n CS from what I know, considers their practice legitimate medical healing and a profession.\n WofF push seed offerings (read gimme MONEY) as a proof of ones 'faith' and without proof of this faith, you don't have it...and if you don't have it, you won't be healed. because miraculous healing realy isn't about the \"anointed man ob gawd who has a special anointing to heal fill in blank\" it's about the faith of the recipient.\n New Agers often charge for their psychic alignments, reiki healings and what ever...because that's their job/career in life.\n \n According to the Christian bible...gifts are free to all. Jesus NEVER charged for healing and extolled his followers to go out and heal in his name.\n \n \n I'm not here to lay blame on intentions, just practices.\n Judeau stating they won't debate CS IS a cultic practice.\n Use of obsfucating psycho/spiritual babble is a cultic practice.\n Anything to seperate you from the 'other' (often non-beliers) is a cultic practice.\n \n Religion does this and more in spades.\n Not all followers of religion are as hard core as others in following these practices.\n Not all cults are dangerous.\n \n WofF and CS are because their followers often eschew conventional medical treatments in favor of 'alternative' cures.\n Cures that lead to death.\n There have been lawsuits and laws dealing with this and when ever a minor child is involved, debate rises up.\n Not too long ago TX. dealt with a girl who had cancer and judges ordered her to have treatment against the wishes of her parents. It didn't work and she was released back to her parents to seek something else. But, it made national head lines.\n \n One of the weird beliefs of WofF and CS is their stances that they can even raise the dead. \n Imagine trying to actually pull that off. Some have tried it.\n Look up Hobart Freeman. He was a WofF leader in Indiana who actually followed this #### 100%.\n \n Over the last few years, most have backed off of their absolutist claims. Thus, in the sermons you'll often hear \"If you had th you wouldn't be ill and if you got a symptom, an attack by satan, you could use your faith and get healed. But, if you lack sufficient faith, go ahead and see a doctor.\"\n \n There is the derision against one for 'not having the faith' thy should have as well as the disclaimer that saves them from liable 'go see a dorctor'.\n \n Judeau's claims of documented accounts of this healing are hogwash too.\n Their criteria for documentation is usually a couple of people (believers) agreeing that there was a problem and that their treatment cured it.\n \n Same claims and tall tales that you'll hear told in many sermons and commentaries of the WofF's and New Agers. I wish they had a Snopes.com for easily tracking down these hearsays.\n Nearly every case of documented healings are unreliable, flawed, proved to be a lie or never happened.\n Yet, even if you go out of your way to disprove the cases presented by them, they won't accept your judgement. They'll go right on preaching the same nonsense, stating you needed faith to see the healing of another or some equally stupid thing.\n \n I find it sad Simone that you, a known ranter against the 'fundies' would support a sister branch of their belief system. That you were convinced that they were somehow different to the Pat Robertsons and Jerry Falwells because they practice mostly in secret rather than in your face. That they change a word or 3 yet have the same philosophical basis and now they're different.\n \n But, maybe that's what bothers you most. \n The 'In your face' flauntings and attacks.\n \n In the end, other than the harm it does, I also don't have as much problem with CS. I do think their minors should be protected from their practices but, I'd believe the same in any case of NEGLECT and ABUSE regardless of faith (or lack thereof).\n I find them a quaint sect like I would the Amish and would simply leave them alone if they did the same to me. You rarely openly encounter them unliked the WofFers who seem intent on shoving Jack T. Chick tracts into your hand and bombard you with their beliefs and seek to shove them down your throat while making you pay for them.",

Such practices are cultic and can often lead to harm.\n When we have someone who refuses to discuss an extreme belief system that denies reality and refuses to take proven precautions for ones health and well being, and charges one for 'magic' done as a replacement healing...I'd be very suspicious of any 'good' that could come out of it.\n \n \nThere are several books written about the healings of Mrs. Eddy (as well as her students and others) documenting Spiritual healing.\n\n Actually, such 'documentation' holds NO water. At best, it's self reporting without any real means to check for accuracy in any claims of illness to begin with or in healing for those that are ill.\n If such miraculous healings were possible, people would be beating your doors down for such...as they did for the Christs healings (as stated in the bible) rather than die due to their failures.\n \nShe is by no means a Messiah any more than a priest or pastor is.\n She has made claims to be divinly inspired to write her book of psuedo-metaphysical garbage gleened from her own mentor. \n \nDuring our services, we read from the Bible, then we read from the Science & Health. The reason we read from her book is because she is no longer with us to explain her findings just like a pastor would do.\n\n And the Mormons read from the book of Mormon. \n You add to the bible as they do with useless garbage and psycho babble that an ignorant woman (not unintelligent) used to explain common mesmerism and hypnosis when a proper definition didn't exist. \n \n \nHer book was never meant to create a new sect of Christianity. She wanted others to embrace her discoveries but had to create a Church in order to get her discoveries out. And I am not G-d or a god. You will not see me trying to demonstrate my dominion by having a truck run over me or something inane like that. I am (as well as you) His reflection. The Scripture we base this on is Genesis 1:27 (KJV).\n\n Yet, she did make a new sect. And her findings were rather inept and unproven. \n The KJV is one of the poorest out there. \n However, your comments on God are very similar to those of the WofF and New Ager movements which share a common ancestor/founder. \n Do you wish to explain exactly what you mean in \n 1:27 \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them\" ? (KJV)\n Naturally, one would take the stock definition, that this explains our appearance, however, I've found out that many sects don't take this interpretation. They also use other passages (out of context and with ignorance of history) to support that men are little gods. \n Do you have any more passages with which to base your beliefs systems on? Or just that one?\n \n \nI am not sure why you are so militant when it comes to CS, but I will not take offense. If you need objective results to make you believe, Christian Science on Trial: Religious Healing in America is a good book.\n\n I'm not that militant but, it would have to do with those who repeatedly wish to deny reality as a mere illusion. Forgoing 'materialistic' answers for something invisible. When an adult does this to themselves it is lamentable, but when you enforce this upon your minor children and wards, it's abuse.\n \n I see this as akin to like finding members of the People Temple Resurgent who immortalize the teachings of Jim Jones and trying to inform them that Jim Jones was a cult leader in a massacre decades ago and having the followers deny it bitterly. (PTR doesn't really exist...I hope)\n Granted that's a crystalized form but similar abuses exist in New Age, WofF and CS groupings. Suicides, medical neglect (that's well documented) and psychological and spiritual abuse.\n \n \n One of the other odd things I note about your belief system is the claim that you're Christian and need to accept Jesus...yet deny sin exists.\n \n \"There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter.\n All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is All-in-all.\n Spirit is immortal Truth; matter is mortal error.\n Spirit is the real and eternal; matter is the unreal and temporal.\n Spirit is God, and man is His image and likeness.\n Therefore man is not material; he is spiritual.\" (S&H 468)\n \n Translate:\n \"There is no material universe, only a false illusion.\n The 'Mind' is all and is infinate. God is everything (we're part of everything, so we're also part of God).\n Supernatural existance is truth, material existance is a lie.\n Supernatural is God and man is in his immage. Therefore, man is also spiritual...since supernatual is infinate, man is part of God.\n \n Same gobbledegook taught by New Agers.\n \n How about<b></b>:\n \"Christian Science teaches that Jesus is divine but not God, and that Jesus' human nature is a separate entity from the divine Christ. \"Jesus Christ is not God, as Jesus himself declared, but is the Son of God\" (Science and Health, 361:12-13). \n \"Jesus is the name of the man who, more than all other men, has presented Christ, the true idea of God, healing the sick and sinning and destroying the power of death\" (Science and Health, 473:10-17).\n \n Doesn't sound like normal Christianity to me...more like Cultic Jehovah's \n Witnesses and Mormonism in the descriptions of who Jesus was.\n \n In the end, I'd state that this Mary Eddy Baker person didn't know what Science was nor what Christianity was. \n She borrowed those words, and subtly gave them new meaning. Such is a practice of cult leaders. Be deceptive. Bait and switch.\n A con is a con.",

More often than not, such rulings are designed for control and exploitation of the followers. I really should start a thread on this. Maybe wrap it up with Propaganda and bias. \n \n You state you find some things valid, list them then.\n Mary Eddy didn't do anything that others weren't doing also. There is no 'original' insight to plagarized and stolen works. Maybe expansion onto anothers ideas after they are dead and gone but, nothing truely original.\n She was one of many doing this during her time. That she may have been better at forming groups of followers or reenacting Quimby's mesmerism practices, but there are plenty of cults that existed at the time. Some just died quicker than CS (and CS has been on the decline for the past 20 years)\n \n Judeau doesn't have a choice in debating me.

The reader may actually learn something they didn't readily know.\n 1) That blind unquestioning adhearance to one's faith can be damaging in the face of repeated failures of said faith. \n 2) That the actual history of said faith(s) is often unknown even by the practioner. Would you have known that New Age 'enlightened' beliefs that are a hodgepodge of other faiths have the same origins as Christian Scientist as well as the Word of Faith movement (that more often than not represents the majority of the evangelical movement today)?\n \n \nOne's time is better spent in other pursuits. And, the problem is that no matter how much time one spends in carefully explaining one's belief system, the person who is supposed to understand the explanation usually chooses deliberately to misunderstand everything that has been said and then erupts in a flood of disparagement.\n\n Like you, I'm mostly here for personal enjoyment. If I influence someone or am influenced by others for the better, great. This medium allows me to vent. Because in work, I have to write free from bias. \n But, there is no deliberate misunderstanding. The information I stated is often stated by other believers themselves. If I am in error, all she has to do is clearly illustrate where the error is. I've quoted some of her book on how they view the Christ. Basically, while she says they read from the bible and are Christians too, they alter what the bible actually says or deny parts of it.\n \n This phenomina is quite common, hence my use of pseudo-Christianity. Nearly every person can make claims to being 'A Christian' (even athiests) yet not follow any real tenants of that faith. When one simply says 'I'm a Christian' without adding on any mitigating beliefs that contradict the historic meaning of that term, they are being dishonest to others.\n If I were to go into my bible-speak jargon mode and talk to you, chances are, you'd believe I was a fundy. Especially when my politics are similar to theirs in some key areas. (This happens quite a lot to me...even when I had hippy long hair). Yet is the farthest from the truth. \n Why do people make such claims when in fact believe something different or altered? More than likely it's for some gain or to hide from some possible retribution. \n \n \nEveryone is allowed the privilege of privacy in regard to one's private beliefs--and one of the things I truly like about Christian Science is that CS practitioners do not actively proselytize on behalf of their faith.\n\n Of course they are allowed their privacy and faith freedoms.\n They don't actively push to others as you noted. I even mentioned this to you before in a past post. Maybe that's why you support her and dislike their sister faith (evangelical fundamentalism/ WofF). The problems I note is when they run the risk of harming their minor children by pushing the faith from within. I really don't worry too much since they are on the decline. But, it's good practice for fighting the WolFs who believe similar and are far more abusive and predatory with it.\n \n \nAlthough, I myself, confess to a delight in throwing out various tenets of required faith solely for the purpose of disparaging them.\n\n I also find you humorous at times. Even if I do imaging you to look like an archetypical witch bending over the keyboard cackling rather than over a cauldron. Once in a while, you even have something valid to say.\n \n \nBut, I'm not trying to convert anyone to anything.\n\n Of course you aren't.

   "H'lo there. I am a Wiccan.\n \n The story of how I came into that faith is a bit complicated. I was raised in the Christian faith by my parents and struggled for several years with being a lesbian and hearing the condemnation in my church toward my homosexuality. I didn't tell anyone until I got out of high school, when - after years of agonizing over my natural feelings and attempting to force myself to be a heterosexual, even going out on dates and having sex with males (praying every night that God would help me change and not be \"sinful\") - I came out to my close friends and then to my parents.\n \n My mother was very accepting of me being a lesbian, but my father, an extremely devout right-wing christian, has never accepted me, and only recently have we even started to talk again (even now, he does not speak to the woman I have married - he refused to come to our marriage).\n \n As I entered college, I met a woman, who was a Wiccan, whom I became close friends with. She answered every question I had about Wicca, and over time led me into becoming a Wiccan when I realised that it was truly the correct faith for me. As we got to know each other, I learned that she, too was a lesbian, and our relationship deepened and whattaya know: now we've been married for 18 years and have a four year old son (Artificial Insemination).\n \n -----\n \n My personal Wiccan faith involves a belief in a creative force in the universe (it can be called \"The One\" or, in my preference, \"The All\"). I believe that all Gods and Goddesses of all religions are attempts by that particular culture to describe different aspects of The All. I believe in the God and the Goddess - male and female aspects of The All. I also worship a Celtic pantheon, each god and goddess of the pantheon a particular part or description of the God and the Goddess (which in turn are aspects of The All). I have great respect for Nature and do my best to prevent harm from coming to it.\n \n Well, that's a quick summary of what I believe as a Wiccan and how I came to be a Wiccan - if you've got any questions, just ask.",

Let's expand on the love concept a moment and rationalize the possibility. God is Love. If God is love, then those that are loved are blessed. It would stand to reason that Love being God means being loved is an interaction with God. Could it be? Would such a thing stand under the rigger of logic? We know that prayer has no effect. If Prayer had an effect, it could be measured and reactions from it could be monitored. No reasonable and truthful study on prayer has had any effect and in fact. Christians knowing they are being prayed for had had negative effects. Prayer is not love. If we analyze people in history and simply relate the numbers that loved them against their outcomes in health and prosperity we can easily find a relation. Rock Stars can live very rugged lives and yet live beyond an average person's time under the same conditions. Am I saying I have an understanding of God? I don't know God (unless my concept is correct); I know what I like and my understanding seems to be rational even logically. Maybe the best thing you can do for anyone is love them. Find some deep and real love for them and share that with others. I really believe any study on such acts will have results that can be observed. This concept of God fits with many faiths through out the world. Buddha was a wonderful man that taught loving ways clearly. And if God is love, then the works of anyone that prescribes to a loving concept would mean their works are indeed inspired by God. Because? God is love.\n \n Does such a concept disturb the Christian concept of God? Sure; but does it disturb Jesus' concept of God?\n \n Jesus called himself the son of man. Yet seemingly in contradiction he proclaimed his father is in heaven. How can that be? I am a son of man. I was born Human. Jesus posed a question to his mother; \"Who is my sister, my brother or my mother?\" Isn't that an odd thing to ask knowing you're the son of a God? The question becomes ridiculous if you consider Jesus to be the only son of a living God. A wise Pharisee asked Jesus; \"How can a man enter heaven?\" Jesus' stated; \"I tell you truly, no man can enter the kingdom of heaven less he be born again!\" Born again? Or mothers would be killed! But I agree with Jesus. No man can enter a paradise unless he indeed is born again. How do rationalize the meanings behind the statements Jesus made? Very simple really; Jesus gave us all the answer to his concept in quite a cleaver way. Jesus was asked for a prayer. All the profits would give a prayer for people to quote and this tradition even goes on to this day. The Catholics can read prayers from their saints. Well, Jesus prayer was brilliant to say the least. It explained everything you'll need to know about his concept of God and himself.\n \n OUR father who art in heaven (Oh yes, our father. Doesn't that open a new door to your concepts?) Haloed be thy name. My father in heaven with a Haloed name?? Only one haloed name to the Jews; God. So hold up a second. I am the son of man? And now, I am the son of God. Wow, interesting. The act of being born again doesn't mean you're born without a mother and a father. Your father and mother is love. And you beat every faith on the earth back far enough to find this common element; Love. Wouldn't it be a kick in the pants if all you needed to talk to God is love and a mirror?\n \n So what is the difference between a Palestinian and a Jew? Nothing at all; In fact, you can't even tell them apart if you look at the indigenous Jews and the Palestinians. They are mirrors to themselves.\n \n I truly believe; God will never join anyone's club. God is not a religious man. If God where, the evidence would be overwhelming. It would be from God after all. \n \n So for the faithful; you can proclaim a man's name all day. State some creed and do some freaky ritual. And you will only be walking away from God, not to him. Though love can not be defined; the things that are not love can easily be determined. Their fruits rot in a field of broken dreams and dead bodies. Love never isolates or even works by means of concepts. What do I think you'll be asked at a gate before heaven? Where is your love? Only love enters here. And you had better have some!",

The study also indicates that public school performance gaps between minorities and genders are virtually non-existent among homeschooled students.\n .....\n \n In 2003, the National Home Education Research Institute conducted a survey of 7,300 U.S. adults who had been homeschooled (5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included:\n \n * Homeschool graduates are active and involved in their communities. 71% participate in an ongoing community service activity, like coaching a sports team, volunteering at a school, or working with a church or neighborhood association, compared with 37% of U.S. adults of similar ages from a traditional education background.\n \n * Homeschool graduates are more involved in civic affairs and vote in much higher percentages than their peers. 76% of those surveyed between the ages of 18 and 24 voted within the last five years, compared with only 29% of the corresponding U.S. populace. The numbers are even greater in older age groups, with voting levels not falling below 95%, compared with a high of 53% for the corresponding U.S. populace.\n \n * 58.9% report that they are \"very happy\" with life, compared with 27.6% for the general U.S. population. 73.2% find life \"exciting\", compared with 47.3%.[49]\n \n (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling)",
