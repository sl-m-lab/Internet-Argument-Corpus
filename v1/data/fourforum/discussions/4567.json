Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.\n \n The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.\n \n Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now.",

   "...but widely accepted as an indication of a true oath.\n\n But totally unrequired and unnecessary. Whether it is a witness at a trial or a deposition, member of a jury or a grand jury, use of the Bible and even the words, \"...so help me God.\" are not required. Any person may refuse the Bible and the words and instead opt to make an affirmation. All that is necessary is to inform the judge that you prefer to do so. Everyone else may take the oath and then anyone who desires makes an affirmation. In the affirmation there is no \"swearing,\" merely a promise. The affirmation carries the same expectations and penalties as the oath. A friend did so in a court once. He didn't know what kind of reaction from the attorneys and judge to expect. He got no reaction whatsoever. The clerk just put down the Bible and administered the affirmation.\n \n This is from Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, regarding the President:\n \nBefore he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:--\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n Use of a Bible and inclusion of the words, \"...so help me God.\" is a matter of the preference and desire of the President being sworn.\n \n Also, Article VI includes the following:\n \nThe Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\n\n So it seems that the framers of the Constitution didn't think that a Bible was necessary.",
