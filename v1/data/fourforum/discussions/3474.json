That's like teaching a kid a word but saying you have to wait until you're older to use it. It's a word, it has a meaning, it has a time and place to be used, and if someone wants to use it, who cares? If I say you're a piece of shi* instead of **** does that hurt anyone?\n \n On the general topic: In general, I would like to know why small children should be censored from anything (barring religious beliefs as reasons). I'm not saying I'm for not censoring them at all, but think about it. If you are not allowed to see or be informed of sex or violence at all, what happens when they come upon it in the real world. Maybe they've seen a gun somewhere and know it's bad but never really connect it to death as in permanent. This can lead to school shootings where a kid finds a gun laying around and doesn't realize what he's doing. The same is true of knives and other things. I've always thought if they know the truth then they can know why things are true. I always hated it when my parents would say \"don't go out after dark because bad things will happen to you\". Of course every chance I got I went out to see what kind of bad things would happen. The point is every kid will learn about bad words, sex, violence, etc. and it's better if you are up front and tell them the facts instead of allowing them to experiment with that sort of thing. I don't know about censoring porn and stuff, but I think it's rediculous for example teachers aren't allowed to talk about sex/STD's/safe sex until 10th grade. By then some people have already tried it. And in some states (mostly in the South) they are only allowed to teach abstinence until marriage.

   "Tigeroo - I could not disagree with you more vehemently. The only thing government should sensor is information that if known could jeapordize national security. Outside of that this is a FREE nation. Maybe YOU think kids should not see A, B and C - but you keep that to YOUR kids and let ME make decisions for MINE. I do not need or want the you or the government meddling with raising my kid. The idea that they would stresses me vs de-stresses me. I don't agree that children should be kept \"innocent\". Nobody is and the real world isn't like that. Not only does my son know about sex, he knows that there are people who use it to hurt kids, he knows about good and bad touch and he knows ways to keep himself safe. An uniformed individual is not one that will survive or stay safe. This world is full of ugly things. I think kids need to know that. Sex, profinity and violence are part of life. I want my kid to know that. I don't watch porn, nor do I approve of games or film that rely soley on gratuitious violence for their entertainment value. My son has heard me swear, and I have had to admit to having acted badly and have to apologize for doing so. This is all part of how my son learns my values. Pretending the things I disapprove of aren't out there will teach him nothing.\n \n For the record he is a rockin kid.",

   "If they know they are bad words why shouldn't they use them? That's like teaching a kid a word but saying you have to wait until you're older to use it. It's a word, it has a meaning, it has a time and place to be used, and if someone wants to use it, who cares? If I say you're a piece of shi* instead of **** does that hurt anyone?\n \n On the general topic: In general, I would like to know why small children should be censored from anything (barring religious beliefs as reasons). I'm not saying I'm for not censoring them at all, but think about it. If you are not allowed to see or be informed of sex or violence at all, what happens when they come upon it in the real world. Maybe they've seen a gun somewhere and know it's bad but never really connect it to death as in permanent. This can lead to school shootings where a kid finds a gun laying around and doesn't realize what he's doing. The same is true of knives and other things. I've always thought if they know the truth then they can know why things are true. I always hated it when my parents would say \"don't go out after dark because bad things will happen to you\". Of course every chance I got I went out to see what kind of bad things would happen. The point is every kid will learn about bad words, sex, violence, etc. and it's better if you are up front and tell them the facts instead of allowing them to experiment with that sort of thing. I don't know about censoring porn and stuff, but I think it's rediculous for example teachers aren't allowed to talk about sex/STD's/safe sex until 10th grade. By then some people have already tried it. And in some states (mostly in the South) they are only allowed to teach abstinence until marriage. Do you really think you can keep a high school kid from having sex by simply saying it in a classroom? I don't think so, but you can teach them the risks and then they can make an informed decision. I don't see what cencorship acheives, and if a parent wants to not allow the child certain things, that's their choice. But the government has no reason to restrict what a child can or can't read.

I am impressed , you are indeed way ahead of your time mentally , keep up the good work. I agree totally with your post, but I will give you some enlightment on the part where you have no stand on the censorship of porn as of yet. ...\n \n One has to remember that when a pre-teen or even teen is exposed to porn material , they are left with a \"impression\" like we all are when reading a good book or watching a good movie. Porn being viewed by pre teen that has not yet been exposed to the \"decent \" side of sexuality, will be left with a definite impression after getting a porn flick rolling on the dvd or monitor....\n \n Sadly though, that \"impression\" will not be one that will attribute to a healthy view of human sexuality. What it will do to for this \" sexually curious \" young person , is jade their view on the subject matter. So many young males carry a jaded, promiscous \"view\" of the female gender because of the way they have seen perform in porn flicks. True, in the adult world , there are women (and men) that lead private lives in their bedroom that depict what one sees on the porn screen, but thats another topic all togther....\n \n \n But, in the real world, the porn world is just not so . Women do not open the door to the pizza boy, and give him his tip on their knees. Women do not get naked while running their car thru the carwash, just to give the 18 year old male attendant a thrill when the dryer curtain peels back. Women deserve respect and should always be treated like ladies, until they say its okay to do otherwise. :) Porn has its place, and that place is viewed by adult people , in the privacy of their own homes. ...\n \n Sexual education should be taught first, understood, then the young people will at least be armed with knowledge as to what is real, and what is fantasy in the world of sexuality. Kids are just way to subceptible to getting jaded by the fantasy world porn presents , and they can become addicted to it also, as they can any other vice .

   " \n The Zen beauty of our lives. Everything is subjective.\n\n \n Everything is  not  subjective. People just believe in relativism, but it's not a very good theory. It's false when it comes to epistemology and just crappish when it comes to Ethics.\n \n \n \n \n\n But without a basis to define \"good\" how could we identify \"evil\"?\n\n \n Good and Evil are based on objective or rational justifications which lead to a health, functional, flourishing community. THere are obviously many things, unless you are blind or just being a troll, that are obviously counter-productive to this universal goal.\n \n \n\n The fact that both the holocaust & slavery were once \"legal\" and yet are acknowledged to be \"evil\" proves the subjectiveness of our lives.\n\n \n All this proves is that Humans are stupid and irrational by nature, not that morality actually IS relative.\n \n THe fact that they were legal never had anythign to do with morality. That which is legal isn't necessarily moral. Morality transcends the law. I don't understand what you are saying. \n \n To me, it seems as if you are saying: It was legal, therefore it proves the subjectivity of morality.\n \n Ethical Relativism isn't a good ethical theory, because it leads to no where and isn't normative: Relativism, including Conventional Ethical Relativism are descriptively valid,but not normatively valid.\n \n \n \n\n Imagine if the 10 commandments was written with negative messages, stealing is good. Murder ok. Adultery wonderful... Those would be our \"norms\".\n\n \n Whether or not there is a \"norm\" doesn't make morality. That's conventional ethical relativism, which is only valid from a descriptive sense. Ethical Relativism commits the is/ought fallacy.\n \n It's an inefficient roadmap for behavior, and it's logically contradicting of itself in many instances.\n \n IT also leads to destructive consequences, which also make it ineffective as a normative system.\n \n I dont' follow the 10 commandments. THey are meaningless. They don't say WHY it's wrong. The WHY it's wrong is gathered through objective analysis of the maxims.\n \n Morality is a product of culture, but morality is a TOOL, it has a purpose. It cannot logically go against that purpose. You wouldn't create a tool to help you, which intentially harms you when you use it or leads to your own destruction. If it does, you throw the maxim away as you would throw the tool away.",

You don't get to determine what is moral for everyone.\n \n According to your logic, no one can say taking your sister and raping her repeatedly untill you slit her throat is immoral. Sorry.

I also think the argument of subjective vs objective is a distraction, it's not what is important here.\n \n - Our morality, that is, our definitions of what things are good, and what things are bad, must be justified through reason and supported with evidence.\n Example: Survival is important. When someone kills someone else, and they aren't obviouslly fighting for survival, they have gone against what we feel is important..i.e. survival.\n Example2: Owning more than 2 sex toys should be punishable by law. This is not justifiable, if it's not killing someone or taking away someone else's right to choose, it's not justified. If it's based on religious beliefs, by definition, it's not justifiable, and would again be thrown out.\n \n - Laws are one way, possibly the best way, to help reduce the disposition of people with regards to comitting \"bad\" actions in a society, but are NOT an absolute.\n \n - Laws are not morality, in that not everyone shares the belief that all laws support what is good, however, for some in society, laws are probably based closely on their personality morality. If you happen to agree with the justification for a law, you probably hold that it's also correct morally. We hope laws must be just as justified as morality is justified (above), and we happen to have a good document that helps shape our morality...the constitution.\n Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, minority rights. If we support our laws with referring back to these basic claims, then we can navigate the complexities of society and behavior a lot better than without. Not all laws are justified, nor in support of the constitution, so neither laws, nor the morality they may be based on, are ultimately \"correct or good\". Again, they are only good if your personal morality happens to be in agreement with them.\n \n Remember, some people, often devoted religious people, do not recognize the basic rights afforded by the constitution, nor do they feel they have to justify their actions, or morality. So it's our definition of how we define what is good or bad, how we define what is MORAL, that is the real question.\n \n -Mach",

After all, our current president is a man of gawd, born again in fact, and is said to have won the election because of his support of Christianity.\n \n Christian fundamentalist:http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/fund.html\n The Bible is the sacred text of the Christian Fundamentalists.
