   "That's not the point. marc9000's asseration is based upon that a threat does not exist if there is no backing. Let's examine a very simple case. I'm going to kill you unkerpaulie. But I make no action. The threat is empty. Does the threat still exist? yes, because I clearly made a threat to your life. \n \n Um. if a threat of hell is empty because the backing cannot be proven in the present.\n\n an empty threat has no effect on you, as an empty glass has no effect on your thirst. the analogy is valid. even if the threat exists, it cannot affect you, but it still exists. but it has no effect.",

   "You've got a real screwed up idea of things there, John. Recommend you read Romans chapters 1-4...\n\n \n Yup, done that. Didn't find a single mention of China or India. You say Jesus's mission on earth was to set 'us folks' straight; I suggested that leaving whole continents, whole civilisations - face it, 99.9% of the world population - out of the loop was at best incompetent.\n \n You're going to respond, I imagine, by saying that it was then the job of others to spread the word over the centuries. Pretty tough on those it never reached, though, don't you think? The entire Mayan civilisation rose and fell without ever hearing that every one of them was going to fry in hell forever unless they accepted Jaysus as their Lawd'n'sayvyuh. Did god not like Mayans, or what?",

I really feel bad for you that you butcher up these issues so badly.\n \n Jesus is Lord!\n\n \n The Pauline passage in question does not say what the Study Note claims it does. Paul refers to a requirement to 'do by nature things required by the law' and to 'show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts'.\n \n Staying, for the moment, with the Mayans. They sacrificed to gods such as Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue, of whom they also made graven images. They assuredly did not, therefore, 'do by nature things required by the law' or 'show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts'. So, they're all in hell, right? \n \n Or does the Paul quote really mean that anything goes for a people, as long as the word hasn't reached them? That Aztec priests who tore the hearts out of human captives and offered them to Quetzalcoatl, are now in heaven, 'cos they knew no better at the time? If so, the advice for any remaining unreached people should be to keep the missionaries at bay at all costs: just as long as you haven't heard the word, you can do what you like and still be saved.\n \n By contrast, the Study Note simply says 'Their judgment will be on other grounds', with no mention of the law. This still seems at best arbitrary, since the people in question can have no way of knowing what those grounds might be. If it's a matter, as you suggest, of having a clear conscience, the Aztec priest I referred to is home and dry, since he will have known that tearing live kids' hearts out was righteous.\n \n Finally, I note that you still evade the issue of whether a deity sending a clone of itself to earth so that it can sacrifice itself to itself and thereby enable itself to give everyone a fresh start actually makes any sense at all, regardless of how incompetently it may have been done. I reiterate that it does not.",
