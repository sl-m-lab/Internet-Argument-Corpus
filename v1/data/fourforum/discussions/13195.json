   "[Soapbox on] A new report form the prestigious Tither Constitutional law Center finds: All of this false reporting from the Left Winged Fring(ers) about HATE groups (now called Hat(ers), because the Left(ers) did a focus group and found adding ers to the end of any group demeans that group) is only motivated because A Black Man inhabits a White House! And now the Left(ers) are out of their mind with fright because of him! \n \n Ohhh! That sounds scary! Maybe we can get some political mileage out of that! Maybe America will no longer pay attention to their Constitutional Rights if we MAKE them a Fringe group and add ers to the name of a group we create for them! Ohhh! That sounds scary!\n \n   Hate on the rise in United States \nA new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center indicates the militia movement that spawned the likes of McVeigh and Nichols now exists in the form of a thriving &#8220;patriot&#8221; movement. \n \n This next generation of hate incorporates elements of the militias, gun advocates, &#8220;nativists&#8221; opposed to immigration, tax protesters, and &#8220;birthers,&#8221; who have questioned the place of birth and citizenship of President Obama.\n \n The election of the nation&#8217;s first Black president appears to have motivated the extreme right, as gun sales have increased and there has been an increase in militia activity since Mr. Obama&#8217;s election. Much of what is driving these groups to frenzy is a Black man&#8217;s occupation of the nation&#8217;s highest office. \n \n Sound familiar? Subliminal. Someone who posts here.  The Left(ers) (note the addition or ers in order to demean them) are pushing this false claims, and may, in fact, create the Riot they seem so desperately hoping for! \n \n If you are so right, why do you have to add ers onto everything? Or, why do you have to have focus groups and spin it? I mean, after all, you think you are right.\n \n Keep it up divid(ers)! United we Stand, and Divided we Fall! Or is that what you actually hope for? Do it for the Children! Preach HATE for anyone who uses the words Freedom and Constitutional Rights! Better yet, add ers to their names so America will HATE them! Do it for the Children![/soapbox]",

It is Scarchasm.\n \n...is this entire soapbox a complaint that those who question Obama's nationality have been called 'birthers'? Or that someone has pointed out that gun rights advocates seem to have been panic-buying firearms in case the White House bans them?\n \n I'm struggling to see your point here. \n\n What do you, or anyone else for that matter, care about what I do with my money? What do you care about how much I spend on Constitutionally recognized as protected items? Does anyone care that I purchased a First Amendment Computer? NOPE!\n \n If Americans, who had to pass a background check in order to purchase those 2nd Amendment recognized as protected items, wish to avail themselves to that Constitutional Rights, what is the big deal? Why do we hate a Black Man in the White House, if we do? \n \n Can't we be against his policies, and not be raciest? Are Americans NOT allowed to ask questions, and ask for assurances? I have never bought into the birth certificate thing but I am now curious because of the question raised. How does that make me a raciest? My wife is from the Philippines, but I question what us going on at the boarder, and that rightfully interest me because of our security. How does that make me anti Latino, when my wife's origin is from Spain? \n \n We have totally divided ALL Americans into lunatic fringes just for political points. Much of it has little to do with reality.\n \n I oppose much of Obama's policies, but yet it is not a racial thing! I oppose healthcare reform right now, because of the Unconscionable amount of money being spent as deficit spending, and believe another Trillion or probably more will Kill our Children's future. Why am I not prudent with a good point? Why does that make me a raciest? \n \n I do like Motocross and that could make me a race ist, but the fastest man on the planet right now is Black, and I love the fact that James Stewart is an American kicking everyone's tail! But I am a Raciest?",

   "Here is an interesting article:\n Enemies, Foreign and Domestic\n \n \nPresident Obama, through his policies, many written by Obama's associates and \"Czars\", not members of congress, has begun the process of systematically dismantling the last shreds of authority the constitution holds. The \"stimulus package\" has resulted in the morphing of the US Government into a competitor with business. This is, to my reading, a clear violation of the commerce clause of the US Constitution found in section 8:\n \n To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\n \n Nowhere in there does the language even intimate, \"and go into competition with...\".\n \n The Healthcare Bill, again written by people outside of elected office and not read by any of its supporters in congress (Congressman Waxman actually ridiculed his constituents who asked him to at least read the bill), is another attack on the constitution. Some of its provisions could even reach as far as moving into taxation without representation as it would create an oligarchy of extragovernmental authority with the ability to penalize with taxes. Obama has expressed his approval of that portion of the bill.\n",
