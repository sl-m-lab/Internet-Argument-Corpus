   "I disagree with spanking. I believe in corporal punishment. Yes, there is a difference.\n \n Spanking is the actual hitting of the child. Corporal punishment combines spanking WITH other forms of discipline. I don't think a child should be spanked every time he misbehaves, but if a child continually does the same thing, something more than a grounding or time-out is needed.\n \n Corporal punishment also involves talking with the child following the administration of the spanking, telling him what he did wrong and how he could have handled the situation better.\n \n If you examine the research studies done regarding spanking, most study just that: spanking, NOT corporal punishment. A UCLA study released in 1999 showed that the number of violent adults in children where corporal punishment was administered was slightly less than the entire population.\n \n The problems with many of these studies lie in that it was spanking only that was administered: in many cases too much and in many cases with sharp objects designed to inflict harm in the child. I fee that both of these are wrong and should be considered child abuse. However, I do not think that spanking, when combined with other forms of discipline, is bad.",

Frankly, you would have to either spank repeatedly or very hard in order to bruise someone's bottom and hence, a hand print on the bottom is a good indicator that someone lost control.\n \n Spanking is, at times, IMHO, almost a necessary act. For example, if my child is running into the road, I would much rather my child connect the pain of a quick slap to his butt or the humiliation of such a spank with going in the road, rather than his finding out what it feels like to be hit by a car. \n \n I agree with wjim, though.

   "This is posted under society debates as well, Here's what I posted there:\n \n (for any references I used - to other posts, just visit the society post.)\n Hank and Gilligan, I have to agree with the both of you. Like you, Gilligan, I had an occasion every now and then were I 'deserved a spankin'. I'm sure all of us have had those moments. When parents sit down and try to talk to little children and explain to them what they did wrong, there's very little chance that they are actually comprehending anything that is being said to them. (uh. because they're young) If they do comprehend, then I doubt they're of the majority. This is simply because they're young. Spanking is simple, and if done properly (sounds funny....) then it does its job. Punishment (as I learned in psychology...) has to occur immediately after the 'crime' is committed. Otherwise it does no good. The phrase \"you'll hear about this later' is almost a joke to me... it simply doesn't do much good.\n Now if you spank a child often and unnecessarily, then it's not going to do any good... and if there is little or no reason for it, then it could be considered abuse. Also, the child is not going to learn from it, and may become 'immune' to it. (not to the point where they don't notice pain, but where they fail to associate pain with punishment) \n Over all, I think spanking is a reasonable way to get to the point with a child. Like said above, it gets their attention.\n I know more and more parents are moving away from this method, and where I work, I see the results obviously. There are more children 'ruling' the parents and getting away with everything. It's becoming common to see this, and it can get annoying when you have little kids running around screaming and breaking things and the parents are trying to talk calmly to them, and OF COURSE they're not paying the least bit of attention. I know some people think it's wrong to hurt another person, but it's either hurt them a little to do them good, or they're going to do more hurting in the long run.\n Some will argue that they've raised perfectly behaved children without a spanking, and their children have never gone wrong. Well, for one, they're underrepresented as it seems, and two, there is always an exception.\n \n __________________",

A child can't learn how to make moral judgements this way. They will, however, learn a bunch of lessons about hitting people.\n \n If your kid is running out into the road and you grab him to stop him from being hit by a car you've already prevented the accident. Hitting the child doesn't do anything to teach them about how dangerous roads can be.\n \n \"Spanking\" is simply not effective as a way of dealing with children. It does not teach them \"right from wrong\" at all.

Seeking guidance from professionals that have done extensive studies on the results of spanking children is imperative, even though seldom done. It seems most think they have some kind of inherent ability to know this or depend on their parents methods who never had training themselves.\n \n An occasional single slap with the open hand on the bottom of a 1-3 year old to warn against some dangerous activity is acceptable if necessary.

Yeah, you don't want to be selfish, you want to let the kid play.. and you want them to be safe. What do you do?\n\n \n Hi Sara\n \n I assume you are sarcastically asking me that question so I&#8217;ll respond. I have raised two kids and now have a 7-year-old. Although we live on a somewhat busy street, my daughter and her friends play in the back where there is a lake. When she was four years old, I would have never told her to not go to the lake and left her outside to play by herself. But if I had, I would have had my eye on her the whole time. And the first time she made a move towards the lake, I would have hauled her in the house with the understanding that she could not play with the other kids in the back until she could learn to stay away from the lake. In addition when she was four, there were several things she really liked to do. Watch Barney, spend the night with her grandma, have the little boy next door over to play, and some others like that. It was very easy to limit any of those as discipline for the important things like you are talking about. But I promise you I have never let any of my children do something I told them not to do FOUR times until I became angry and struck them. I would have taken care of the situation the first time with some discipline. And I would in no case consider it selfish. I would consider it good parenting. What I would consider selfish is letting the situation go until I got frustrated and started hitting the child because I didn&#8217;t want to take the time to handle the situation.\n \n Anyway that&#8217;s what I would do, and how I raised my kids. The two grown ones are very responsible citizens and the young one I rarely have any trouble with. Of course I spend a lot of time with her as I think that is important.",

Personally, I prefer my child feel the sting of my hand on his butt teaching him not to play with fire, than the pain of burns, as well as the possible property damage. usually, instructions are given because the parent has the child's best interest at heart. and I believe that the pain of a spanking in exchange for the pain of imprisonment is an easy decision for me.\n \n I think the problem isnt abusive spanking, but poor discipline techniques on a whole\n \n as far as the 3-year-old is concerned, at 3 a child does know the difference between obedience and disobedience, and can follow simple instructions. at this age they are also testing boundaries of what they can get away with, not because they are devious, just because they are curious, and they want to explore freely without the fetters of parental supervision. yet they depend on parental presence and approval at this age.

   "I think that spanking should be used as an absolute last resource. but the threat of spanking should be backed up by the real thing. simply telling a child what to do obviously doesn't work, and though forms of \"soft\" punishment should be used when possible, it is obviously not as lasting as the effect of physical pain. dont get me wrong, Im by no means condoning abuse, but no discipline can be effective without the existence of a consequence. Personally, I prefer my child feel the sting of my hand on his butt teaching him not to play with fire, than the pain of burns, as well as the possible property damage. usually, instructions are given because the parent has the child's best interest at heart. and I believe that the pain of a spanking in exchange for the pain of imprisonment is an easy decision for me.\n \n I think the problem isnt abusive spanking, but poor discipline techniques on a whole\n \n as far as the 3-year-old is concerned, at 3 a child does know the difference between obedience and disobedience, and can follow simple instructions. at this age they are also testing boundaries of what they can get away with, not because they are devious, just because they are curious, and they want to explore freely without the fetters of parental supervision. yet they depend on parental presence and approval at this age. I think that firm discipline is important. and more than that, spanking a child at this age will very improbably give the child trauma or emotional scars. children barely remember anything at that age\n\n \n I would just reply that most people in prison have experenced the pain of spankings quite often.",

   "Depends on the age and the kid and the parent.\n \n Toddlers (1-3): The best thing to do is to distract them if they are doing something that is not OK. Sometimes, if their safety is on the line, a smack on the rear will be effective. Granted, it will not teach them \"the road is dangerous\", it will only teach \"if I go there I will get smacked\". However, kids at that age can't really comprehend \"the road is dangerous\" anyway.\n \n Little Kids (4-7): You can start reasoning with this group. Try that first. Then there are time-outs, removal of privelege and spanking. It depends on the parent (what they are comfortable wth) and it depends on the kid. My kid, you can smack his rear all day long and he is still gonna do what he wants - take the the Play Station - and he feels the pain. My cousin's daughter is the same, but her other daughter is the opposite.\n \n Older kids 8-12: Similar to little kids. However - at this age I think they should start facing real consequences if possible. In the grown up world if you mess up you don't get hit. So, for example, when my son broke a window - he had to work to pay for the damages (I paid - he worked for my sister and me).\n \n 13+ - too old for spankings - period.",

   "I am lucky so far. I only have one daughter. She is 18 months old, and if I tell her NO firmly an point at her she bursts into tears. I have not had to spank her (I think she may be a little young for it anyway). The time will come, though, that she doesn't listen to NO. When that time comes, I fully intend to back up NO with a firm swat to her little butt (as heartbreaking as that will be).\n \n I have not seen any reports or studies on spanking. If somebody could provide some links, I would like to look them over. I do know that my wife has some young cousins whose parents don't believe in spanking, and they are snotty little terrors. They make their parents lives a living hell. Other people I have known that raised their kids the same way got the same results.\n \n I approach raising children the same way I approach training dogs. Reward them when they are good, punish them when they are bad. First offence = verbal response. Second offence = jerk the pinch collar. I am fairly certain it is illegal to put a pinch collar on a child, so you give them a swat instead.\n \n Corporal punishment is a very effective, though underutilized form of correction. In my younger years I did a lot of bar room brawling. Somebody woul do something I considered offesive, I would politley as them to stop. They would not. I would ask less politely. A heated verbal exchange would follow, followed by extreme physical communication techniques (beating the snot out of the offending party). \n \n Now I am older and calmer. If I find somebodies behavior offensive, IO generally ignore it. If I can't ignore it, I make a polite suggestion that they modify said behavior. If that does not work, I usually drop it. Occasionally, at the \"polite suggestion\" phase, the offensive party wishes to advance immediatly to the extreme physical communication phase. This is invariably some college gothead who thinks he invented dirty fighting on his way to the bar. I live in a college town, and prefer bars that are a little on the wild/disreputable side (I have yet to see a priest in any of my favorite haunts).\n \n My wife has strict rules about fighting. I am required to first attempt to de-escalate the situation. I am then required to attempt to leave. After those two conditions are met, I am only allowed to participate in extreme physical communication techniques if the other party has landed a solid blow. \n \n I have noticed in my own private study that when you ask people to modify their behavior politely, even when you support your request with logic, they often fail to comply. The ones that DO comply when you ask, generally are back doing the SAME thing the next weekend. \n \n When you ask somebody politely to modify their behavior and they respond negatively and escalate the situation to the extreme physical communication level, and end the night in the local emergency room, they generally do not repeat the offensive behavior at a later date.\n \n This is because they have learned that there are potential consequences to their actions that go beyond a firm talking to. \n \n Now, I am not advocating hospitlising your children as a means to teach a lesson. I am saying that when talking fails, it is time to go to stricter methods. Personally, I think that young children have trouble associating the loss of TV privelages with playing with an outlet. It is far easier for them to understand \"I can't play with the outlet because dad will smack me\" than \"I can't play with the outlet becasue it will lead to loss of privelages\".\n \n I have yet to hear a kid say \"I can't watch TV because I did such and such\" (and I am the second of eight children, all of whom were spanked and amazingly all grew up to be productive members of society with clean criminal records). I have heard \"I won't do it because dad will whip my butt\".",

Speaking seems much more useful the younger the child. Very young children cannot be reasoned with, so an example of where spanking is necessary is when a child will not learn to avoid something dangerous. \n \n From what I've seen of the studies, careful use of spanking is a good parenting strategy. The bad kinds of parenting are either permissiveness/neglectful which produces spoiled, impulsive children; erratic parenting which produces impulsivity; and loveless, cruel parenting which may produce children who are obedient in the sense of avoiding getting caught, but have poorly developed consciences, and may suffer from problems with self-esteem, warmth toward others, and a defiant, rebellious orientation. \n \n The best parenting focuses on guilting children when they do wrong within an overall context of love. Over the years this technique develops a strong conscience in a child. Spanking works if it done in a way which does not cause the child to turn against the parents.",

   "That \"kid running into the street\" example is so tired. For one, most spanking situations are not like that. Second, why don't they just take the kid inside? What kind of absurd parenting strategy is it to let your kid run repeatedly into the street until you can't take it anymore and you hit them?\n\n \n \n I can remember 2 times in the last 10 years that I spanked my son... One was after the earthquake.. we were in the grocery store parking lot, he was 4... there was madness everywhere. He darted out into the line of traffic... I spanked him in that instance. He never did it again. I did not beat him, nor did I even leave a mark.. I needed to get his attention fast, the second time was just last Christmas... he said something to another child that was completly out of line so I smacked him on the butt... needless to say he was shocked and felt really bad about what he had done.. I know because I hid around the corner to watch what happened after I left the room, and he was sincere in his reactions that followed...\n I dont think any parent lets their kids run into the street, that is more absurd... Kids dont always think about cause and reaction.. why do you think the ball rolling out into the street is such a common mistake?\n The point is, that sometime you need to get the attention fast so they know its a bad thing.\n I understand your point about anger and I know there are parents out there that do abuse, I was a child in that situation and subjected to things that were clearly abusive, I dont believe that spanking should be used in every situation, but I do think there are times when it is needed. Spanking and beating are way different. I would never beat my child, but a smack on the rump in a dire situation is not out of line.",

   "\n \n Be honest- parents spank their kids because they're angry, and because they can. The kid can't fight back. Everyone gets angry, and in that adrenaline rush I understand the compulsion to hit someone much smaller than you. We're all human, but learning to control your anger is an essential part of maturity. Not to mention that hitting is just plain ineffective as a parenting strategy.\n\n \n I never EVER spank my children when I am angry because I love my children and want them to know that a spanking is the last straw and not that I would strike them in anger.You are right,the kid running into the street issue is getting old.But lets take this into the classroom.My children know that they are there to learn and respect their teacher,but little johnny has no respect for anybody and constantly disrupts the class,well the teacher cant punish him,or the principal,so they send him home to mommy.Mommy thinks that spanking is abuse so she gives johnny another time out.Next day,samething,and dont tell me this doesn`t happen because I have seen it with my own eyes.Little johnny has no resect for anyone because his mommy was more concerned with being his friend than his parent.When I was in school,if you disrupted the class the teacher took you out in the hall and gave you a swat on the rump.Most of the time it would end there,but some kids liked to push it to the limit,so on strike two,they were sent to the office and the principle would dish out the swat,funny thing was,nobody wanted to get a swat from the principle cause HIS HURT!But you know what?Everybody liked him and respected him because they knew he was just doing his job!Todays children (not all,but alot)have no respect for their teachers,principles,adults,or anybody who is an authority figure!Why?Because they were never taught to repect authority!I cant wait until little johnny gets a job,just waiting for his boss to give him a time-out for doing something wrong!",

I was not arguing that the street scenario was the most common type of spanking situation, or that parents don't ever spank for the wrong reasons.

The fact that almost ALL parents use spanking at one time or another is an indication that it is very difficult to parent never using it. The important parenting issue is not whether one spanks or not, but rather parents consistently correct problem behaviors in a loving, secure atmosphere. If someone spanks a child, it is essential that the child learn that the parent loves the child but the misbehavior is not acceptable. And a loving enirionment is just as essential for children who are not spanked as those that are. One poor parenting strategy would be a parent who never spanks, but who disciplines by always treating a child coldly and constantly rejects the child psychologically. An essential part of spanking is to show love after the fact and in general in a reliable way, so the child knows that he is loved but his behavior is not. \n \n The problem with some parents who don't spank is that they are under the assumption that punishment in general is bad, and the only acceptable parenting is reward and encouragement. Well, it is very difficult and usually unrealistic to teach children to stop behaving badly without negative consequences for it. Children who are never punished do not learn to stop inappropriate behavior. Of course, there are many kinds of punishments that a parents use, and no doubt some people use spanking way too much or impulsively, but spanking is one strategy that at times may get the desired behavior out of the child that other methods may fail to produce. \n \n So punishment for bad behavior within an a context of unconditional love is absolutely necessary for children to learn to behave appropriate.

   "The fact of the matter that there is nothing wrong with spanking.\n\n (emphasis mine)\n \n From Dr. Irwin A. Hyman-\n \n My summary of the research and the clinical experience of over 30 years follows:\n \n * Corporal punishment should not be used in schools, since there is convincing evidence that it is a significant contributing factor to emotional, legal and social problems.\n \n * Frequent and harsh spanking is consistently found to be present in the lives of boys who are aggressive and disobedient, who lie, cheat, are destructive with their own and others' belongings, and who associate with friends prone to delinquency.\n \n * Frequent and harsh spankings can cause young children to bottle up their feelings of fear, anger, and hostility. In later life these children are unusually prone to suicidal thoughts, suicide, and depression.\n \n * Despite the age or gender of the child, the family's social class or ethnicity, whether the child was hit frequently or rarely, severely or mildly, whether there were high or low levels of interaction and affection in the home, and regardless of the degree to which specific situational variables may have mitigated the effects of the punishment, spanking consistently contributes to lowered self-esteem.\n \n * In toddlers, many punitive approaches, including spanking, do not result in compliance, but end simply with the administration of punishment. (Studies show that preschoolers who are hit are more likely to be more impulsive and aggressive than those who are not spanked. Furthermore, toddlers can be taught, using behavioral techniques such as associating their word for pain with the street or electrical outlets, to avoid those dangerous situations. Childproofing the house and monitoring toddlers will avoid the so-called necessity of spanking to teach children to avoid danger.)\n \n * Children who are physically punished are more likely to grow up approving of it and using it to settle interpersonal conflicts. Even children who have experienced \"normal\" spankings are almost three times as likely to seriously assault a sibling, compared to children who were not physically disciplined.\n \n * Contrary to popular belief, studies of corporal punishment in schools indicate that it is not used as a last resort. In fact, it is too often the first punishment for nonviolent and minor misbehaviors. Beatings for minor misbehaviors can cause many stress symptoms in children.\n \n * Younger children are hit most often; spanking slowly decreases until late adolescence. This contributes to feelings of helplessness, and resentment that may lead to withdrawal or aggression toward caregivers.\n \n * Boys are hit much more frequently than girls, thereby sustaining sexual stereotypes.\n \n * In schools, minority and poor white children receive \"lickings\" four to five times more frequently than middle- and upper-class white children. This contributes to racism and classism in our society.\n \n * Regional comparisons show that the highest proportion of corporal punishment in America occurs in states of the South and Southwest. Florida, Arkansas and Alabama have consistently been among the leaders in the frequency of hitting schoolchildren. It is unreasonable and unfair that children's location should determine the degree to which they may be legally victimized.\n \n * Corporally punished schoolchildren, especially those with emotional and academic disabilities, have suffered all types of injuries including welts, hematomas, damage to almost all external and many internal body parts, and death.\n \n * Studies demonstrate that eliminating corporal punishment does not increase misbehavior in home or school. Systematic use of positive alternatives, however, has been shown to decrease misbehavior significantly.\n \n Studies of reference-\n \n REFERENCES\n \n Anderson, Eliajh. 1999.

The effect remains with the victim forever and becomes an unforgiving part of his or her personality a massive frustration resulting in a hostility which will seek expression in later life in violent acts towards others. The sooner we understand that love and gentleness are the only kinds of called-for behavior towards children, the better. The child, especially, learns to become the kind of human being that he or she has experienced. This should be fully understood by all caregivers.\n Ashley Montagu, Anthropologist\n \n \"Corporal punishment of children actually interferes with the process of learning and \n with their optimal development as socially responsible adults. We feel it is important for public health workers, teachers and others concerned for the emotional and physical health of children and youth to support the adoption of alternative methods for the achievement of self-control and responsible behavior in children and adolescents.\"\n Dr. Daniel F. Whiteside, Assistant Surgeon General, Department of Health & Human Services (Administration of President Ronald Reagan)\n \n \"Punitive measures whether administered by police, teachers, spouses or parents have well-known standard effects: (1) escape: education has its own name for that: truancy, (2) counterattack: vandalism on schools and attacks on teachers, (3) apathy: a sullen do-nothing withdrawal. The more violent the punishment, the more serious the by-products.\"\n B. F. Skinner, Ph.D., author, Professor of Psychology, Harvard\n \n \"Corporal punishment trains children to accept and tolerate aggression. It always figures prominently in the roots of adolescent and adult aggressiveness, especially in those manifestations that take an antisocial form such as delinquency and criminality.\"\n Philip Greven, Professor of History, Rutgers University\n \n \"I have always been an advocate for the total abolition of corporal punishment and I believe the connection with pornography that is so oriented has its roots in our tradition of beating children.\"\n Gordon Moyes, D. D., Pastor, Uniting Church, Superintende\n nt of the Wesley Central Mission, Sydney, Australia\n \n \"The much-touted 'religious argument' to support corporal punishment is built upon a few isolated quotes from the Book of Proverbs. Using the same kind of selective reading, one could just as easily cite the Bible as an authority for the practice of slavery, the rigid suppression of women, polygamy, incest and infanticide. It seems to me that the brutal and vindictive practice of corporal punishment cannot be reconciled with the major themes of the New Testament which teach love and forgiveness and a respect for the beauty and dignity of children, and which overwhelmingly reject violence and retribution as a means of solving human conflicts.\"\n Thomas E. Sagendorf, United Methodist Pastor, Toledo, Ohio\n \n \"The development of self-control, which we call conscience, results from the appropriate interaction of children with their caretakers. Children's experience of love and respect promotes the development of conscience, whereas the experience of fear or pain, as results from spanking and paddling, interferes with this development. Physical punishment of children must end if our society is going to become one that is governed by conscience and self-control rather than be governed by their opposites.\"\n H. Patrick Stern, M.D., Asst. Prof. of Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Behavioral Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.\n \n \"Infliction of pain or discomfort, however minor, is not a desirable method of communicating with children.\"\n American Medical Association, House of Delegates, 1985\n \n \"Slavish discipline makes a slavish temper... Beating them, and all other sorts of slavish and corporal punishments, are not the discipline fit to be used in the education of those we would have wise, good, and ingenuous men.\"\n John Locke, 1632-1704, \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education,\" 1692\n \n \nThe fact that almost ALL parents use spanking at one time or another is an indication that it is very difficult to parent never using it.\n\n Nonsense. My parents never, ever spanked me, and I've never, ever spanked a child. My own or any child in my care. I've worked in various child care capacities, been a daycare worker for up to 12 children at a time, and I've never ever spanked any of them. \n \n \n The problem with some parents who don't spank is that they are under the assumption that punishment in general is bad, and the only acceptable parenting is reward and encouragement. Well, it is very difficult and usually unrealistic to teach children to stop behaving badly without negative consequences for it.\n\n Bad behaviour has negative consequences naturally. That's why it's bad behaviour. It is human nature to want to please, and unless that is perverted, children respond very quickly to fear or anger from others. They don't need to be hit to learn.\n \n \nIt is libelous to argue that parents in general spank out of a motivation to hurt a child because they are helpless and can't fight back, like bullies who target the the smallest kid on the playground.\n\n It is simply factual. A pre-pubescent child is smaller than an adult most of the time, and is legally under their power. Hitting the child is an abuse of that physical and legal power. \n \n \nThe kids that tend to turn out the worst are those who had cold, rejecting parents who let them do whatever they want.\n\n Child abuse and neglect are seriously damaging to society as a whole. \n \n The fact that plenty of parents raise healthy children without ever hitting them is proof that spanking is not necessary to child rearing. As it is both unnecessary and damaging, it should be stopped. Parents should no more spank their children than let them get sprayed with DDT as bug repellant. This practice was common in rural areas, before people found out that the pesticide was poisonous and carcinogenic. Now that people know better, sending their children to run behind the DDT truck would be abusive. No matter how you slice it, it's not good parenting.",

That doesn't mean I think it should never be used, and I would never DREAM of criminalizing it. \n \n The research I've read indicates that the most common scenario for bratty kids is permissive/neglectful, cold parenting punctuated with irrational, erratic, severe physical punishment. The lack of confidence, low self-esteem comes from parental coldness or rejection, not spanking. Children who are raised in love but with strict parents who sometimes spank as part of a consitent parenting strategy turn out just fine. \n \n One thing that seems to be key is to try to do a much \"guilt\" parenting as opposed to \"pain\" parenting. Kids develop stronger consciences with messages like \"I love you, but am so disappointed in you\" or \"You are better than that\" than with messages like \"You are busted kid, and you have suffer the consequences.\"",

Alice Miller convincingly showed the influence of punishing child-rearing on the rise of fascism in Germany and the enthusiasm with which the German population engaged in the extermination of Jewish people.\n \n Again, statistical data shows that people are harmfully affected by spanking. Any data that can be found which does not show direct harm (which is rare) suggests that positive intervention is at least equally effective. This is the important question- if numerous studies showed that tomatoes were poisonous (though perhaps not immediately fatal), would you still feed them to your children? How can you argue that you are choosing your parenting strategies based on the child's best interests if you are willing to ignore significant data just because you happen to prefer hitting your children?\n \n \nCorrelation doesn't equal causation, but the absence of it disproves causation and there is an absence of a correlation between the declining popularity of spanking and improved social health.\n\n It is also possible that other parenting strategies replacing spanking are no less harmful. That wouldn't make spanking okay.\n \n Again, see Sweden as an example. Spanking was made illegal in 1979, and this was accompanied by a massive educational campaign.

Durrant, Ph.D.-\n \nThere is evidence from two qualitative studies that although Swedish parents tended to be rather permissive in the early 1980s, this has changed and they now are generally quite skilled in using democratic childrearing methods (Haeuser, 1988, 1990). Further, rates of child abuse appear to have declined; the number of referrals to St. G\u00f6an's Hospital in Stockholm, which receives all child maltreatment cases, had declined by 1989 to one-sixth of the 1970 rate (Haeuser, 1988). By the mid-1980s, Swedish rates of physical discipline and child abuse were half those found in the U.S. (Gelles & Edfeldt, 1986; Haeuser, 1988), and the Swedish rate of child death due to abuse was less than one-third the American rate (Gregersen & Vesterby, 1984). \n\n \n \nThat doesn't mean I think it should never be used, and I would never DREAM of criminalizing it. \n\n Would you advocate that we decriminalize assault on adults as well, or do you believe that hitting is only for children? I am not being facecious.\n \n \nThe lack of confidence, low self-esteem comes from parental coldness or rejection, not spanking. Children who are raised in love but with strict parents who sometimes spank as part of a consitent parenting strategy turn out just fine.\n\n Again, the research disagrees with you.\n \n \nOne thing that seems to be key is to try to do a much \"guilt\" parenting as opposed to \"pain\" parenting.\n\n Why use either?\n \n \n And no, I haven't been brainwashed or whatever anyone would like to claim. It works, it's not wrong, leave it alone.\n\n That statement doesn't to much to convince either that you're right or you're not brainwashed. Surely if this is your rational mind speaking you can do better than \"it works, leave it alone\".\n \n Not to mention that all available data disagrees with you.\n \n \nA firm, hard quick spanking for an act the child knew was wrong never emotionally damaged anyone but those who wanted to be damaged.\n\n Wow, so now people who are damaged by bad parenting just \"wanted to be damaged\"? Talk about your victim-blaming... Again, this is an extremely irrational statement. Psychological damage is not dependant on whether a person \"wants to be damaged\", it has to do with the circumstances of the trauma.\n \n Being continually told that your parent is hurting you because they love you is arguably much more traumatic than being hit by a parent who clearly doesn't care about you but having other adult influences who are consistantly loving.",

   "Finally, the Swedish experiment to reduce child abuse by banning spanking seems to be failing. In 1980, one year after this ban was adopted, the rate of child beatings was twice that of the United States.[30] According to a 1995 report from the government organization Statistics Sweden, police reports of child abuse by family members rose four-fold from 1984 to 1994, while reports of teen violence increased nearly six-fold.[31]\n\n This is ridiculous. They give the statistics of spanking after only one year as \"proof\" of failure.

Perhaps it has seemed so obvious that eliminating parental spanking would reduce the child abuse rate that people have felt that no evaluation was needed. If so, this summary of available evidence should shake us out of our premature complacency. The role of parental discipline responses in preventing aggression in parent and child is surprisingly complex (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Patterson, 1982; Snyder & Patterson, 1995). We need better research to understand the complexities involved in parental discipline, including its relationship to child abuse. We need to discriminate effective from counterproductive forms of discipline responses, including the role of different forms of corporal punishment in increasing or decreasing the risk of child abuse. We also need better evaluations of policies designed to change parental discipline, given that the effects of the Swedish anti-spanking law seem to have had exactly the opposite effect of its intention.",

   "Those who oppose corporal punishment do not normally do so on the basis of a single argument. Usually they muster a battery of reasons to support their view. They do not root their arguments in particular theories of punishment -- theories that justify the institution of punishment -- and say why corporal punishment fails to meet the theoretical requirements. In many cases, this may be because they lack a theory of punishment. However, it should be said in their favor that having a theory of punishment is little help, by itself, in determining whether corporal punishment is ever morally acceptable. This is because the traditional theories of punishment in themselves do not commit one to accepting or rejecting corporal punishment. A number of issues mediate the application of the theories to the question of corporal punishment. For example, for consequentialist theories of punishment, the relevant considerations include the effectiveness of corporal punishment, either as a deterrent or reform, and the extent of any adverse side effects. For retributivists, punishment is justified if it is deserved. Retributivists are not concerned about the consequences of punishment, but they do consider the means of punishment. Thus, an important question for them is whether corporal punishment is an unacceptably cruel or degrading form of punishment. Retributivism per se says nothing about what constitutes an unacceptable form of punishment, just as utilitarianism itself cannot tell what kinds of punishment are effective or harmful. Thus we cannot turn to the theories themselves for answers to these questions. I shall not probe the theoretical foundations or venture any view about which theory of punishment is correct. This is because I take the theoretical background to be largely beyond the scope of this paper. There is a vast literature on whether punishment can be justified and I cannot hope to contribute to that here. Instead, I restrict my attention to the question of corporal punishment. \n \n The arguments raised by those who believe that corporal punishment should never be inflicted are that corporal punishment 1) leads to abuse; 2) is degrading; 3) is psychologically damaging; 4) stems from and causes sexual deviance; 5) teaches the wrong lesson; 6) arises from and causes poor relationships between teachers (or parents) and children; and 7) does not deter. I shall now consider each of these arguments in turn.4 \n \n a. Corporal punishment leads to abuse\n Opponents of corporal punishment make regular reference to the frequency and severity of physical punishments that are inflicted upon children. They suggest that corporal punishment \"escalates into battering,\"5 or at least increases the risk that those who punish will \"cross the line to physical abuse.\"6 \n \n Clearly there are instances of abuse and of abusive physical punishment. But that is insufficient to demonstrate even a correlation between corporal punishment and abuse, and a fortiori a causal relationship. Research into possible links between corporal punishment and abuse has proved inconclusive so far. Some studies have suggested that abusive parents use corporal punishment more than nonabusive parents, but other studies have shown this not to be the case.7 The findings of one study,8 conducted a year after corporal punishment by parents was abolished in Sweden, suggested that Swedish parents were as prone to serious abuse of their children as were parents in the United States, where corporal punishment was (and is) widespread. These findings are far from decisive, but they caution us against hasty conclusions about the abusive effects of corporal punishment. \n \n The fact that there are some parents and teachers who inflict physical punishment in an abusive way does not entail the conclusion that corporal punishment should never be inflicted by anybody. If it did have this entailment, then, for example, the consumption of any alcohol by anybody prior to driving would have to be condemned on the grounds that some people cannot control how much alcohol they consume before driving. Just as we prohibit the excessive but not the moderate use of alcohol prior to driving, so should we condemn the abusive but not the nonabusive use of corporal punishment. \n \n b. Corporal punishment is degrading\n One argument that is intended as an attack on both mild and severe cases of corporal punishment makes the claim that physically punishing people degrades them. I understand degradation to involve a lowering of somebody's standing, where the relevant sense of standing has to do with how others regard one, and how one regards oneself. It is the interplay between the way we understand how others view us and the way that we view ourselves that produces feelings such as shame. Thus one way in which one might be degraded is by being shamed. \n \n In order to respond satisfactorily to the objection that corporal punishment is degrading, clarification is required about whether the term \"degrade\" is taken to have a normative content, or, in other words, whether it is taken to embody a judgment of wrongfulness. If it is not, then it will not be sufficient to show that corporal punishment is degrading. It will have to be shown that it is unacceptably so before it can be judged to be wrong on those grounds. If, by contrast, \"degrade\" is taken to embody a judgment of wrongfulness then a demonstration that corporal punishment is degrading will suffice to show that it is wrong. But then the argumentative work will have to be done in showing that corporal punishment is degrading because it will have to be shown that it amounts to an unacceptable lowering of somebody's standing. \n \n Either way, the vexing question is whether corporal punishment involves an unacceptable lowering of somebody's standing. Here it is noteworthy that there are other forms of punishment that lower people's standing even more than corporal punishment, and yet are not subject to similar condemnation. Consider, for example, various indignities attendant upon imprisonment, including severe invasions of privacy (such as strip-searches and ablution facilities that require relieving oneself in full view of others) as well as imposed subservience to prison wardens, guards, and even to more powerful fellow inmates. My intuitions suggest that this lowering of people's standing surpasses that implicit in corporal punishment per se, even though it is obviously the case that corporal punishment could be meted out in a manner in which it were aggravated. If corporal punishment is wrong because it involves violating the intimate zone of a person's body, then surely the extreme invasions of prison inmates' privacy, which seem worse, would also be wrong. It is true that corporal punishment involves the application of direct and intense power to the body, but I do not see how that constitutes a more severe lowering of somebody's standing than employing indirect and mild power in the course of a strip-search, for example. It is true too that the prison invasions of privacy to which I have referred would be inflicted on adults whereas corporal punishment would be imposed on children, but again I fail to see how that difference makes physical punishment of children worse. In the case of young children especially, it seems that the element of shame would be less than that of adults given that the capacities for shame increase between the time one is a toddler and the time one becomes an adult. Therefore, if we think that current practices in prison life are not wrong on grounds of degradation, then we cannot consistently say that all corporal punishment is wrong on these grounds. \n \n c. Corporal punishment is psychologically damaging\n It is claimed that corporal punishment has numerous adverse psychological effects, including depression, inhibition, rigidity, lowered self-esteem and heightened anxiety.9 \n \n Although there is evidence that excessive corporal punishment can significantly increase the chances of such psychological harm, most of the psychological data are woefully inadequate to the task of demonstrating that mild and infrequent corporal punishment has such consequences. One opponent of corporal punishment who has provided data on even mild and infrequent physical chastisement is Murray Straus.10 His research, which is much more sophisticated than most earlier investigations into corporal punishment, does lend support to the view that even infrequent noninjurious corporal punishment can increase one's chances of being depressed. However, for two reasons this research is inadequate to the task of demonstrating that mild corporal punishment is wrong. First, the studies are not conclusive. The main methodological problem is that the studies are not experiments but post facto investigations based on self-reports.11 Murray Straus recognizes this12 but nevertheless thinks that the studies are compelling. The second point is that even if Professor Straus's findings are valid, the nature of the data is insufficiently marked to justify a moral condemnation of mild and infrequent corporal punishment. For instance, the increase of depression, according to his study, is not substantial for rare physical punishment. The increments on his Mean Symptoms Index of depression are only slight for one or two instances of corporal punishment during one's teen years. The increments are somewhat more substantial for three to nineteen incidents of corporal punishment but, surprisingly, for twenty to twenty-nine incidents the Mean Symptoms Index falls again nearly to the level of two episodes of corporal punishment.13 The chances of having suicidal thoughts, according to this study, decreases marginally with one incident of corporal punishment during adolescence, then rises slightly for three to five episodes of corporal punishment. For ten to nineteen instances of physical punishment the likelihood of having suicidal thoughts is approximately the same as it is for those who are not beaten at all during adolescence. The probability increases markedly for more than twenty-nine episodes of physical punishment during one's teens,14 as one would expect when many beatings are administered. Professor Straus does not provide data about how physical punishment during (preteen) childhood affects the likelihood of depression, which would have been interesting given that one might expect corporal punishment to be psychologically more damaging to adolescents than to younger children. \n \n Given that even the data suggesting that very rare instances of mild corporal punishment do have some negative effects also suggest that the effects are not substantial, there is a strong likelihood that they could be overridden by other considerations in a consequentialist calculation. In other words, showing some negative effects is not sufficient to make a consequentialist case against all corporal punishment. Other considerations, including possible advantages of corporal punishment, would have to be taken into account. Moreover, because the available evidence shows no serious harm from mild and infrequent corporal punishment, there seem to be poor grounds for suggesting that for retributivists the punishment should be regarded as unacceptably severe. \n \n d. Corporal punishment stems from and causes sexual deviance\n Those who want to outlaw corporal punishment often argue that there are disturbing sexual undercurrents in the practice.15 This objection is, in part, a special instance of the argument about adverse psychological effects. In part it is a separate, but related objection. The argument is that corporal punishment stems from some sexual perversity (on the part of the person inflicting the punishment) and can in turn cause sexual deviance (in the person punished). In some versions of this argument, it is claimed that sadomasochistic relationships can develop between the beater and the beaten. In other versions, only one party -- usually but not always the beater -- may experience sexual excitement through the beating. The beaten person may become sexually repressed. It is no accident, the argument goes, that the buttocks are often chosen as the site on the body to which the punishment is administered. \n \n Those who advance the objection that corporal punishment fosters masochism are rarely clear about the nature of the masochistic inclinations that they say are produced. Yet, it is crucial to be clear about this. Studies show that most people have been sexually aroused, either in fantasy or in practice, by at least some mild masochistic activity, such as restraint or play fights.16 Thus, some masochistic tendencies seem to be statistically normal. That does not preclude their being undesirable, but it is hard to see how, in an era of increased tolerance of diversity in sexual orientation and practice, we can consistently label mild masochism as perverse. If such inclinations increase opportunities for sexual pleasure without concomitant harms, then there is at least a prima facie case for the view that such inclinations are not to be regretted. And if one objects to those masochistic inclinations that seek gratification in more serious pain, injury, and bondage, there is no evidence of which I am aware that mild and infrequent corporal punishment fosters such inclinations. The available evidence linking corporal punishment and masochism makes the connection only with milder forms of masochistic fantasy and practice. \n \n It is, of course, a concern that some parents or teachers might derive sexual gratification from beating children, but is it a reason to eliminate or ban the practice? Someone might suggest that it is, if the anticipated sexual pleasure led to beatings that were inappropriate -- either because children were beaten when they should not have been, or if the punishment were administered in an improper manner. However, if this is the concern, surely the fitting response would be to place limitations on the use of the punishment and, at least in schools, to monitor and enforce compliance. Here we are not without examples to follow. For example, given the intimacy of a medical examination, the doctor-patient relationship is one that is prone to sexual undercurrents. Needless to say, it is a disturbing thought that doctors may be sexually aroused while examining patients, but we cannot (easily) monitor that. Our response then, is to lay down guidelines to curb any abuses that might ensue. I am aware that medical examinations are necessary in a way in which corporal punishment is not, but corporal punishment might nonetheless fulfill an important function. \n \n e. Corporal punishment teaches the wrong lesson\n It is often said that punishing a wrongdoer by inflicting pain conveys the message that violence is an appropriate way to settle differences or to respond to problems.17 One teaches the child that if one dislikes what somebody does, it is acceptable to inflict pain on that person. \n \n This implicit message is believed to reach the level of a contradiction in those cases where the child is hit for having committed some act of violence -- like assaulting another child. Where this happens, it is claimed, the child is given the violent message that violence is wrong. The child is told that he was wrong to commit an act of violence and yet the parent or the teacher conveys this message through violence. \n \n Not only are such messages thought to be wrong in themselves, but it is claimed that they are then acted upon by the child who is hit.18 In the short term, those who are physically punished are alleged to commit violence against other children, against teachers and against school property.19 As far as long term effects are concerned, it is alleged that significant numbers of people who commit crimes were physically punished as children. It is these arguments that lie behind the adage \"violence breeds violence.\" Three defenses of (limited) corporal punishment can be advanced against this objection. \n \n First, there is a reductio ad absurdum. The argument about the message implicit in violence seems to prove too much. If we suggest that hitting a wrongdoer imparts the message that violence is a fitting means to resolve conflict, then surely we should be committed to saying that detaining a child or imprisoning a convict conveys the message that restricting liberty is an appropriate manner to deal with people who displease one. We would also be required to concede that fining people conveys the message that forcing others to give up some of their property is an acceptable way to respond to those who act in a way that one does not like. If beatings send a message, why don't detentions, imprisonments, fines, and a multitude of other punishments convey equally undesirable messages? The argument proves too much because it proves that all punishment conveys inappropriate messages and so is wrong. It is a reductio because this conclusion is absurd. Those who want to replace punishment with therapy would not be immune to the reductio either. Providing therapy would convey the message that people with whom one disagrees are to be viewed as sick and deserving of treatment. \n \n This leads to the second argument. The objection takes too crude a view of human psychology and the message that punishment can impart. There is all the difference in the world between legitimate authorities -- the judiciary, parents, or teachers -- using punitive powers responsibly to punish wrongdoing, and children or private citizens going around beating each other, locking each other up, and extracting financial tributes (such as lunch money). There is a vast moral difference here and there is no reason why children should not learn about it. Punishing children when they do wrong seems to be one important way of doing this. To suggest that children and others cannot extract this message, but only the cruder version that the objection suggests, is to underestimate the expressive function of punishment and people's ability to comprehend it. \n \n There is a possible response to my arguments. Perhaps it is true that, conceptually, the message that punishment conveys is more sophisticated. Nevertheless, those who are beaten do commit violence against others. It might not be that they got this message from the punishment, but that being subject to the willful infliction of pain causes rage and this gets vented through acts of violence on others. This brings me to my third response. There is insufficient evidence that the properly restricted use of corporal punishment causes increased violence. Although Murray Straus's study suggests that there is a correlation between rare corporal punishment and increased violence, the study has some significant defects, as I noted earlier, and the significance of his findings has been questioned in the light of other studies.20 Nevertheless, Professor Straus's findings cannot be ignored and they suggest that further research, this time of an experimental sort, should be conducted. Note again, however, that even if it were shown that there is some increase in violence, something more is required in order to make a moral case against the corporal punishment that causes it. On a consequentialist view, for example, one would have to show that this negative effect is not overridden by any benefits there might be to corporal punishment",

Where I believe that opponents of corporal punishment are wrong is in saying that physical punishment should never be inflicted. The popular as well as the educational and psychological debates about corporal punishment are characterized largely by polarization. Those who are opposed want to rule it out entirely. Those who are in favor tend to have a cavalier defense of the practice that is insensitive to many reasonable concerns about the dangers and abuses of this form of punishment.

   "And it is funny how you are given proof that it failed miserably in Sweden,but you choose to ignore the facts and spout off that only 1 study doesn`t prove anything.How about the increase in crime,assaults,etc.\n\n Well, since you asked- (emphasis mine)\n Child Abuse in Sweden\n By Joan E. Durrant, Ph.D. 1\n April 9, 2003\n \n For a number of years, various media have carried reports stating that child abuse has increased in Sweden since the passage of the 1979 corporal punishment ban. This statement, which was recently given new life in the Canadian Charter Challenge to Section 43 of the Criminal Code, is completely erroneous. All available evidence indicates that Sweden has been extremely successful in reducing rates of child physical abuse over the past few decades and that reduction has been maintained since the passage of the corporal punishment ban. The purpose of this brief report is to disseminate accurate information on this issue.\n \n 1. Reporting Rates vs. Rates of Actual Abuse\n The claim that child abuse has increased in Sweden is primarily based on misinterpretation of assault report statistics. It is the case that reporting of child physical assault has increased in Sweden since the 1970s - as it has in every nation that has raised awareness of the issue of child abuse. Reporting rates are by no means equivalent to rates of actual abuse. They are sharp reflections of/strongly tied to shifts in public awareness.\n \n For example, in the early 1960s, it was estimated that about 300 children were being maltreated in the U.S. By 1990, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect had officially recorded 2.4 million reported cases. By 1993, they had recorded almost 3 million cases. It is highly unlikely that actual child maltreatment increased by a factor of 10,000 in that period. It is also highly unlikely that only 300 children were maltreated in the U.S. in the early 1960s.\n \n It is a well-known fact that when mandatory reporting laws, public education campaigns, and other measures are implemented to increase awareness, reporting will increase. This is the goal of such measures. The Swedish reporting figures have been cited as if they are actual rates of abuse, which they are not.\n \n Recently the Swedish National Crime Prevention Council examined 434 cases of assaults on young children within the family that were reported to the police in 1990 (all cases) and 1997 (every other case). It was found that the proportion of cases involving serious injuries sustained by children in this age range had decreased substantially. The majority of reported assaults result in minor injuries or no injuries at all. On the basis of an extensive analysis of the data, the National Crime Prevention Council concluded that there has been an increase in the propensity to report cases of assault on young children, and that it is this increase that is responsible for most, if not all, of the rise in the number of such offences reported to the police@ (Nilsson, 2000, p. 68).\n \n 2. Prevalence of Child Physical Assault Across Time\n Studies conducted at various points in time demonstrate that the prevalence, frequency and harshness of assaults against children have declined dramatically in Sweden over the last two generations. Substantial proportions of women who became mothers in the 1950s struck their children at least weekly (e.g., 55% of mothers of 4-year-old daughters; 20% of mothers of 8-year-old sons) (Stattin et al., 1995). Among 3- to 5-year-old children of that generation, implements were used by 13% of mothers (Stattin et al.,1995).\n \n In contrast, 86% of youth who were born in the 1980s report never having been physically punished (Janson, 2001). Of those who were, the vast majority experienced it no more than once or twice in their childhoods (SCB, 1996). Virtually no children are hit with implements in Sweden today.\n \n It is important to note that legislative reform began many decades ago in Sweden. The corporal punishment ban was the end, not the beginning, of legal changes in that country. Most notably, the provision excusing parents who caused minor injuries to their children through physical punishment was repealed from the Swedish Penal Code in 1957. The explicit ban on physical punishment was implemented 22 years later.\n \n 3. Child Abuse Fatalities\n The incidence of homicides of children under the age of 5 can provide an estimate of child abuse mortality, as it is these children who are most vulnerable to fatal injury and the contribution of other forms of external violence is minimized among this age group. Between 1975 and 2000, the average annual number of homicides of children aged 0 to 4 in Sweden was 4. The average incidence between 1995 and 2000 (2.8) was lower than that between 1975 and 1980 (4.0) - despite population growth.\n \n The World Health Organization (2002) provides homicide incidence figures for children aged 0 to 4 in Sweden (1996), Canada (1997) and the United States (1998).2 These figures are:\n \n Sweden: 3\n Canada: 24\n United States: 723\n \n (Canada's population is approximately 3 times larger than Sweden's. The U.S. population is approximately 20 times larger than Sweden's.)\n \n Child homicides attributable specifically to physical abuse (excluding homicide-suicides, neonaticide and postnatal depression) are virtually non-existent in Sweden. Between 1976 and 2000 (the most recent year for which statistics are currently available), a total of 4 children died in Sweden as a result of physical abuse. \n \n Summary\n There is no evidence to support the claim that child abuse has increased in Sweden since corporal punishment was banned there in 1979. In fact, Sweden has maintained a very low rate of child abuse internationally for more than 25 years.\n \n Three Important Points\n \n 1. It is important to note that Sweden's law was intended to affirm children's rights; it was not expected to end all abuse of children for all time. North American assault laws have not eliminated assaults against adults, yet we recognize their importance in setting a standard of non-violence for the society, sending a clear message, and affording protection to those who have been harmed. This was the fundamental intent of Sweden's corporal punishment ban.\n \n 2. Legislative reform in Sweden began in 1928, when corporal punishment was forbidden in secondary schools. It was 1957 when the legal defence of reasonable correction was repealed from Sweden's Penal Code. The ban must be viewed within its historical context to be understood.\n \n 3. Since Sweden passed its ban on corporal punishment in 1979, 10 other nations have followed: Finland, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Cyprus, Croatia, Latvia, Israel, Germany, and Iceland. The purpose of these bans is to explicitly recognize children's rights to protection under the law - the same rights that adults take for granted. In addition, Italy's highest court has ruled that \"the use of violence for educational purposes can no longer be considered lawful.\" \n \n 1 Joan E. Durrant, Ph.D., is a Child-Clinical Psychologist and Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Family Studies at the University of Manitoba. She is an internationally recognized expert on the Swedish ban. Over the past decade, she has conducted extensive research on this law and has lived in Sweden for extended periods to gain a full understanding of its history, implementation and effects.\n \n 2 Rates per population are not available for Sweden and Canada due to their low incidence. Incidence rates are presented here for the most recent years for which data were available in the WHO World Report on Violence and Health (2002).\n \n References\n Nilsson, L. (2000).

   "Where is Evidence That Non-Abusive Corporal Punishment Increases Aggression?\n John S. Lyons\n University of Northwestern Medical School \n Chicago, IL, USA\n \n Robert E. Larzelere\n Father Flanagan's Boys' Home \n Boys Town, NE, USA\n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n Abstract\n Two recent reviews of parental corporal punishment have found little sound evidence of detrimental child outcomes such as child aggression. This paper explores whether the 1979 Swedish law against all corporal punishment has reduced their child abuse. Sweden's 1979 law was welcomed by many as a much needed policy toward reducing physical child abuse. Surprisingly, this search located only five published studies with any relevant data. The best study found that the rate of child abuse was 49% higher in Sweden than in the United States, comparing a 1980 Swedish national survey with the average rates from two national surveys in the United States in 1975 and 1985. By comparison, a retrospective survey of university students in 1981 found that the Swedish child abuse rate was 21% of the USA rate in the 1960s and the 1970s, prior to the anti-spanking law. More recent Swedish data indicate a 489% increase in one child abuse statistic from 1981 through 1994, as well as a 672% increase in assaults by minors against minors. The article discusses possible reasons for this apparent increase in child abuse and calls for better evaluations of innovative policies intended to reduce societal abuse and violence.\n \n Poster presented at the XXVI International Congress of Psychology, Montreal, August 18, 1996\n \n Send correspondence about this paper to: Robert E. Larzelere, Psychology Dept., 985450 Univ. of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198; Email: rlarzelere@unmc.edu; (402) 559-2282\n \n Where is Evidence That Non-Abusive Corporal Punishment Increases Aggression?\n Two recent reviews of the literature on parental corporal punishment have found few methodologically sound studies. Further, hardly any of the soundest studies found detrimental child outcomes associated with corporal punishment. This paper explores whether there is evidence that the outlawing of corporal punishment by parents in Sweden and other countries has had any discernible effect, particularly on child abuse and, to a lesser degree, on child outcomes such as aggression.\n \n Lyons, Anderson, and Larson (1993) attempted to review all journal articles on corporal punishment by parents from 1984 through 1993. Only 24 of the 132 articles (17%) included any empirical data on corporal punishment. Less than half of those (11) investigated corporal punishment as a possible cause of some other variable. Most (83%) of the studies were cross-sectional, and only one made any attempt to exclude child abuse from the measure of corporal punishment.\n \n They concluded that there was empirical evidence supporting one of three hypotheses: Several studies found that parents were more likely to use corporal punishment themselves if their parents had used it. There was no sound evidence that corporal punishment was ineffective, nor that it was associated with child aggression.\n \n Larzelere (in press) built on their review by extending the search of peer-reviewed articles to the period 1974 to 1995 plus older articles that met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were designed to exclude studies that were cross-sectional or whose measures emphasized the severity of usage of corporal punishment. Only 18 studies were found that both met the two inclusion criteria and limited the sample to children under 13 years of age. The 8 strongest studies found beneficial outcomes of corporal punishment, usually in 2- to 6-year-olds. The 10 other studies were prospective (6) or retrospective (4). Three of them found detrimental outcomes, but only 1 of those 3 made any attempt to exclude abuse from its measure of corporal punishment. Further, none of the 10 studies controlled for the initial level of child misbehavior. This seems to be an important methodological problem, since the frequency of every type of discipline response tends to be positively associated with child misbehavior, whether the associations are cross-sectional or longitudinal (Larzelere, Sather, Schneider, Larson, & Pike, 1996; Larzelere, Schneider, Larson, & Pike, in press). Finally, no alternative discipline response in any of the 18 studies was associated with more beneficial child outcomes than was corporal punishment, whereas 7 alternatives were associated with more detrimental child outcomes, mostly in 2- to 6-year-olds.\n \n These reviews suggest that the empirical linkage between nonabusive corporal punishment and aggression comes only from cross-sectional studies, studies of teenagers, studies measuring particularly severe forms of corporal punishment, and, perhaps, studies of punitiveness. This led us to ask how well current societal experiments are working in countries that have outlawed all forms of parental use of corporal punishment.\n \n In 1979, Sweden passed a law prohibiting all corporal punishment by parents. This was hailed as a crucial step in the effort to reduce child abuse (Deley, 1988; Feshbach, 1980; Ziegert, 1983). Several countries have passed similar laws since then (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Austria, and Cyprus), and organizations have formed to advocate against parental corporal punishment throughout the world (e.g., End Physical Punishment of Children [EPOCH]: Radda Barnen, no date).\n \n This movement represents one of the most sweeping changes ever advocated by social scientists. In the United States, for example, about 90% of parents have spanked their 3-year-old children in the past year (Straus, 1983; Wauchope & Straus, 1990). Some social scientific research has been used to support the anti-spanking position (e.g., Hyman, 1995; Straus, 1994), but the reviews summarized above have found such support coming primarily from methodologically poor studies. Given the inconclusiveness of relevant research and the importance of the issue, it is desirable to know whether child abuse has decreased in Sweden following their 1979 anti-spanking law. Accordingly, this article asks two inter-related questions: (1) To what extent have social scientists evaluated the effect of the 1979 anti-spanking law in Sweden, and (2) what do those evaluations indicate about the effects of the anti-spanking law in reducing child abuse? We also report one finding about Swedish trends in assaults by minors discovered during our study.\n \n Literature Search for Evaluations\n Two procedures were used to find evaluations of the effects of Sweden's anti-spanking law. First, PsycLit was searched from 1974 through June of 1995 for all publications that included \"Sweden\" or \"Swedish\" and either \"punishment\" or \"spanking\" in their abstracts. Second, Social Sciences Citation Index was used to identify all articles citing Gelles and Edfeldt (1986) through April 1995, because their study reported a well-done survey of Swedish child abuse rates one year after the anti-spanking law was passed.\n \n \n \n Empirical Evaluations of Sweden's Anti-Spanking Law\n Five published studies and one unpublished paper were found that included any empirical information relevant for evaluating the 1979 anti-spanking law. Ziegert (1983) published a conceptual, preliminary article on why the law should be effective. His only empirical data was from a Swedish opinion poll showing that the percentage of respondents considering corporal punishment to be necessary had dropped from 53% in 1965 to 35% in 1971 to 26% in 1979 and 1981. In an article comparing Swedish and American use of corporal punishment, Solheim (1982) reported that 26% of Swedish respondents considered corporal punishment necessary in 1978. Like Ziegert (1983), Solheim's (1982) article was mostly nonempirical, discussing such issues as court decisions about corporal punishment in schools, the 1979 law, and expert opinions. Together these two articles show that the decline in support for the necessity of parental corporal punishment in Sweden preceded the 1979 law, and it did not decrease thereafter, at least through 1981.\n \n A third article reported the rate of child homicides in various European countries, comparing 1973/1974 with approximately 1987/1988 (Pritchard, 1992). Note that this compared statistics before and after the 1979 law. The Swedish child homicide rate was the sixth lowest of the 17 countries at both time periods. However, it nearly doubled from 1973/1974 to 1986/1987. Sweden's 93% increase in its child homicide rate was the fifth largest percentage increase among the 17 countries. It should also be noted that the rate of accidental baby deaths in Sweden was the lowest of the 17 countries at both time periods. Unlike the child homicide rate, it decreased by 67% between the two time periods, although 10 of the other 16 countries decreased their accidental baby death rates by an even larger percentage.\n \n A fourth article compared child abuse rates among university students at one Swedish university compared to one American university as reported in a 1981 survey (Deley, 1988). Because these were retrospective reports, they were child abuse rates during the 1960s and the 1970s as these students were growing up, a time period preceding the 1979 law. The critical question asked whether a spanking had ever left physical marks that lasted for more than 10 minutes. Two percent of the Sweden students reported receiving such physical marks from a spanking, compared to 9.5% of the American students. Although this is far from a representative sample, this suggests that the child abuse rate in Sweden was only 21% of the American child abuse rate in the 1960s and 1970s (i.e., 2.0 divided by 9.5 = .21).\n \n The fifth and best study used telephone surveys of a nationally representative sample of Swedish parents to measure the rates of spanking and of child abuse in 1980 (Gelles & Edfeldt, 1986). It used the Conflict Tactics Scale, which was also used to measure the prevalence of spanking and child abuse in two National Family Violence Surveys in the USA (Straus & Gelles, 1986; Straus, Gelles, & Steinmetz, 1980). Gelles and Edfeldt (1986) compared their 1980 Swedish survey only with the 1975 National Family Violence Survey. They concluded that a smaller percentage of parents were spanking their children in Sweden than in the United States, but that there were no significant differences in child abuse rates.\n \n It would have been more appropriate, however, to compare their 1980 Swedish survey with the 1985 National Family Violence Survey in the USA (Straus & Gelles, 1986), which reported a 47% lower rate of child abuse in the United States than in 1975. For one thing, the 1980 Swedish survey was closer to the 1985 USA survey in its method, because both used telephone interviews. In contrast, the 1975 USA survey used face-to-face interviews. Table 1 gives the percentage of Swedish and United States parents reporting the use of various forms of physical aggression in both national surveys in the United States and the national survey in Sweden. In contrast to Gelles & Edfeldt (1986), we report whether the Swedish rate was significantly different from the mean USA rate from both the 1975 and the 1985 surveys. This approach represents a compromise on the issue of which USA survey is the most appropriate comparison, and it assumes that the 1980 rates in the USA might have been halfway between the 1975 and the 1985 rates.\n \n See Table 1\n \n As can be seen, significantly fewer Swedish parents spanked or hit their child with an object, compared to USA parents. Nonetheless, 27% of Swedish parents reported spanking or slapping their child in the past year, reflecting imperfect compliance with the law. In contrast, most of the more serious types of physical aggression occurred more often in Sweden one year after passing the anti-spanking law than they did in the United States. The rate of beating a child up was three times as high in Sweden as in the United States, the rate of using a weapon was twice as high, and the overall rate of Very Severe Violence was 49% higher in Sweden than the United States average from the 1975 and 1985 surveys. Except for weapon usage, all of these differences were significantly different using a test of differences between proportions (Downie & Heath, 1974, chap. 13), p < .05. In addition, the rate of pushing, grabbing, or shoving was 39% higher in Sweden than the average rate in the United States, p < .001. Thus, the rate of spanking was significantly lower in Sweden than in the United States, but the rate of other forms of physical aggression, including child abuse, was significantly higher in Sweden than in the United States.\n \n Because there were so few published studies with relevant empirical data, we also included an unpublished field study by Haeuser (1988) and sought additional data from Swedish sources. As co-founder of EPOCH-USA, an organization advocating the banning of all corporal punishment in the United States, Haeuser (1988) explicitly wanted to \"promote positive visibility of this Swedish law in the U.S. and garner U.S. support for the possibility of promoting U.S. parenting norms which avoid physical punishment\" (p. 2). Her paper was based on her 1981 and 1988 field visits to Sweden, using extensive interviews of 7 parents and 60 personnel in government, health and human services, and schools.\n \n In the summary, she concluded, \"Most, if not all, believe the law has not affected the incidence of child abuse\" (p. iii). Specifically, she reported that concerns about sexual abuse and youth gang violence had superseded concerns about physical child abuse by 1988. She also reported that she observed toddlers and young children often hitting their parents in her 1988 visit.\n \n According to her, \"In 1981 both parents and professionals agreed that parents had not . . . found constructive alternatives to physical punishment [within the two years since the law was passed]. For most parents the alternative was yelling and screaming at their children, and some believed this was equally, perhaps more, destructive\" (p. 22). Haeuser went on to report that most Swedish parents had developed firmer discipline techniques by 1988.\n \n Haeuser (1988) concluded that the child abuse rate was lower in Sweden than in the USA based on Swedish police statistics of 6.5 cases of physical child abuse per 1000 children in 1986. Haeuser compared this to a \"U. S. rate of 9.2 to 10.7\" per 1000 (Haeuser, 1988, p. 34), but acknowledged, \"Since the Swedish police data omits child abuse cases known to social services but not warranting police intervention, the actual Swedish incidence rate is probably higher\" (p. 34).\n \n However, the American survey that she cited (National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect [NCCAN], 1988) indicated that the basis of the rate of 9.2 or 10.7 per 1000 differed from the Swedish police statistic in two ways. First, the USA rate included sexual and emotional abuse as well as physical abuse. Second, the USA rate included not only cases known to police, but also cases known to at least one professional across a wide range of occupations, including those in child protection services, public health, education (schools, daycare centers), hospitals, mental health, and social services. If limited to only physical abuse, the USA rate was only 4.9 or 5.7 known to at least one of these professionals, depending upon the definition of physical child abuse. If limited to all three kinds of abuse known specifically to police or sheriffs, the USA rate was only 2.2 per 1000 (NCCAN, 1988).\n \n The most relevant statistics we have obtained from Sweden are police-record trends in physical abuse of children under 7 years of age (Wittrock, 1992, 1995). Those records showed a 489% increase in the child abuse rate from 1981 to 1994 (see Figure 1). The same police records also indicated a 672% increase in assaults by minors against minors (under 15 in Sweden) from 1981 to 1994 (see Figure 2).\n \n Discussion and Conclusions\n Although the Swedish anti-spanking law was intended to reduce child abuse, the best empirical study since then indicated that the rate of child abuse in Sweden was 49% higher than in the United States one year after the anti-spanking law was passed. Does this mean that the anti-spanking law increased the rate of physical child abuse in Sweden? Deley's (1988) retrospective data indicates that the Swedish physical child abuse rate was 21% of the USA rate in the 1960s and 1970s. This suggests that the anti-spanking law not only failed to achieve its goal of reducing child abuse, but that the child abuse rate increased from 21% to 149% of the equivalent USA rate, a seven-fold increase relative to the decreasing rate in the United States. We doubt that the increase was actually that substantial, because Deley used a retrospective measure with a small unrepresentative sample. Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that a sizeable increase in the Swedish child abuse rate occurred around the time of the 1979 anti-spanking law. The other studies indicate no changes in attitudes about corporal punishment nor in child homicides due to the 1979 law.\n \n Was the apparent increase in the Swedish child abuse rate only a temporary increase following their anti-spanking law? More recent data on Swedish child abuse rates would help answer that question. One piece of subsequent data was the 6.5 cases of physical child abuse per 1,000 children in official 1986 Swedish police statistics, which was substantially higher than the 2.2 per 1,000 known to police or sheriffs in the USA. The other available evidence is the sharp increase in physical child abuse in Swedish police records from 1981 through 1994, along with a similar sharp increase in certain assaults by minors.\n \n Why might Sweden experience an increasing child abuse rate and an increase in assaults by minors after outlawing corporal punishment? Haeuser's (1988) description of some parental frustration and yelling in 1981 might indicate an increased risk of escalation to abuse at that time. This is reminiscent of Baumrind's (1973) observation of permissive parents. Compared to authoritative and authoritarian parents, permissive parents were the most likely to report \"explosive attacks of rage in which they inflicted more pain or injury upon the child than they had intended. . . . Permissive parents apparently became violent because they felt that they could neither control the child's behavior nor tolerate its effect upon themselves\" (Baumrind, 1973, p. 35). Permissive parents used spanking less than did either authoritative or authoritarian parents. So it could be that the prohibition of all spanking eliminates a type of mild spanking that prevents further escalation of aggression within discipline incidents (see Patterson's [1982] coercive family process). Haeuser's (1988) report suggests that Swedish parents later developed new, firm discipline responses that reduced escalations to yelling and possibly to child abuse. But adequate data on the resulting child abuse rates are lacking.\n \n In conclusion, the available Swedish data indicate that we cannot reduce child abuse just by mandating that parents stop using corporal punishment. Parents also need new, effective techniques to replace corporal punishment if it is to be outlawed. It is even possible that mild corporal punishment may play an important role in preventing escalation to abuse for some parents.\n \n The other surprise is that there has been so little empirical evaluation of the effects of Sweden's anti-spanking law. Perhaps it has seemed so obvious that eliminating parental spanking would reduce the child abuse rate that people have felt that no evaluation was needed. If so, this summary of available evidence should shake us out of our premature complacency. The role of parental discipline responses in preventing aggression in parent and child is surprisingly complex (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Patterson, 1982; Snyder & Patterson, 1995). We need better research to understand the complexities involved in parental discipline, including its relationship to child abuse. We need to discriminate effective from counterproductive forms of discipline responses, including the role of different forms of corporal punishment in increasing or decreasing the risk of child abuse. We also need better evaluations of policies designed to change parental discipline, given that the effects of the Swedish anti-spanking law seem to have had exactly the opposite effect of its intention, at least in the short term.\n \n References\n Baumrind, D.

There is definitly more extreme child abuse out there but spanking is still wrong.\n\n \n \n Now see I think this spanking thing has gotting out of control!! There is nothing wrong for punishing a kid when they have done something wrong. There is a difference between punishing a kid and beating a kid. I do think to try something else first is good though. Like putting a kid on the couch for a while, making them take a time out and then if that doesn't work and they don't listen then yes spank thier bottom. That is why kids act the way they do now days. They act up and their parents dont do anything about it. Parents have to put their foot down and let the kid know the right things to do and the wrong things to do. When parents don't put their foot down they end up on a T.V. talk show talking about how their kids wont listen to them. I wonder why? Blue",

Most people who get into fights get away with a warning or at worst public serveice. What's my point? Violence is a part of this world. I'm not advocating beating kids but what would happen if you went into a pub and told someone to \"go **** themselves\"? More than likely you would get hit.

   "Greetings to Jim and All:\n \n Jim << Is spanking a form of child abuse? I was just wondering what everyone thought about this issue? I will post my feelings on here eventually, but I'd like to here what you have to say first.\n \n Terral's reply << First off, Scripture says: \n \n \"Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; the rod of discipline will remove it far from him.\" Proverbs 22:15.\n \n \"Do not hold back discipline from the child, although you strike him with the rod, he will not die.\" Proverbs 23:13.\n \n \"The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.\" Proverbs 29:15.\n \n Personal experience with my father and the rod has shown all of the above to be absolute truth. Disciplining our children is not about us and our feelings about it, but about them and their future. It is in the child's nature to test the boundaries we place around him. He or she discovers their own identity by knowing where the limits exist. At the start, the borders are the bars of their crib, then play pen, and for some their own room. \n \n Specific rules always apply to their ever growing environment; like when we allowed them to stay home alone for the very first time, or the first time they drove away in a car. They know who they are by the rules we and society place upon them, and by the consequences of breaking those rules. Should they learn the meaning of the word \"NO\" through a spanking? Or by sitting in a jail cell down the road?\n \n Allowing your children to grow up in a permissive society, without rules and stiff consequences, leads to a generation desperately searching for their own identity. Instead of looking within, they look outwardly into the same permissive society that deluded them at the start. And that leads to the next generation being raised by their grandparents, who get to make the same mistakes all over again. \n \n If anyone seeks the certain demise of a nation, then find a way to separate discipline and their children. Who is to say this very plan is not being carried out by our enemies in America as we speak? Do not fall for their propaganda. \"Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days.\" Prov. 19:20. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Yes, I was beaten as a child by a very angry mother. While in my 20's and 30's I was so busy with college, the military, work, etc, I didn't deal with my childhood issues. My issues came up in the form of depression, anxiety, rage...it took a lot of time and a lot of therapy to get down to the core issue and face what was going on and start the recovery process. I'm still in recovery and have been for years.\n \n But before recovery, I figured it would be best not to have children based on some pretty sick, twisted ideas such as: if I don't have children, they will never be hit (by me or anyone else); that if I didn't have children, I wouldn't have to learn positive parenting skills (which would bring up my own childhood abuse issues); if I ever got angry, I wouldn't have to control my temper as a child wouldn't be around to be harmed; and the sickest reason of all? I could deprive my parents of grandchildren from me (they love and treat grandchildren 100% better than their children). I figure I could also keep my parents from harming my children by not having any.\n \n So I guess this is not a topic I'm ready to debate...too many stories in here hit too close to home for me.\n \n I'm doing a lot better and found a fiance that understands me (because she went through the same things as I did). She's taught me how to trust again and to love and that it's okay to not agree with something. It's sad that it's taken so long for someone to come along and model this behavior for me, but at least I've learned.\n \n I still feel loss for the years I could have raised children at one time, but I knew I didn't have the skills to raise healthy children.",

So, if I tell my child to do (or not do) a certain thing and they refuse, then I should ask them what sort of discipline should apply? As stated earlier here (and in other threads) &#8220;talking&#8221; seldom ever gets the job done. Neither does restricting privileges or removing them completely. Growing children, those whose brains can understand authority, can also comprehend rebellion and childish reasoning. This eventually leads to other harmful traits such as situational lying, habitual complacency and systematic indifference. They begin to use those traits to &#8220;get what they want&#8221;. Does this translate to evil? No, not necessarily, but can, depending on the character of the child, promote lawlessness. This is sometimes revealed through subtle mannerisms. Even though the child shows all the signs of &#8220;being good&#8221;, these characteristics can be detrimental later in life. It actually becomes a &#8220;way of life&#8221;.\n Parents have to decide in which direction their children are headed. If the parent allows bad behavior, then the term &#8220;parent&#8221; is misused.

The next day the boy gets a match and starts a fire at the neighbor&#8217;s house, which is quickly extinguished. Gets an additional week and is prohibited from attending a sports event. The next day the boys catches an outbuilding on fire and it burns down along with a neighbor&#8217;s garage. The boy&#8217;s playthings are removed and he is now restricted to only schoolwork, no sports events, no TV for a month. He is also sent to a counselor that prescribes some sort of drug, which puts the boy into a mild depressive state, accompanied by lethargy. The parents love the child, see the affects on their son and demand another route, which means taking him off the medication. After finding no other medication that will deter his actions other than those that completely &#8220;put him out&#8221;, they decide to &#8220;live with&#8221; his actions. A few days later he is back to setting fires.\n \n This is not a mentally disabled child; he is normal&#8230;except he gets no physical discipline whatsoever.

Unfortunately though, it is not a trait that is commonly found in parents because most of us are normal parents with normal kids. Then again there are children who have amazing characteristics where being bad or doing wrong is just not in their vocabulary.\n \nThe simple fact is this - allowing parental tyranny, while outlawing other types of tyranny, is an inconsistency.

   "Yep. And why is it ok to hit a child and not an adult? Hitting an adult is a felony-hitting a child is \"parenting?\" emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I agree with you there, but hitting a child that's not your own is actually called child abuse. But I agree. And especially when parents just get angry because the child acted against them they aren't trying to \"discipline\" their child, they're trying to hurt them. And acting out of rage and without self-control can leave a lasting effect on a child. They are acting as tyrants and acting on terror for controling their child. But here's a relevant story:\n \n I don't remember this but my mom told me about it the other day. We were in a grocery store, I was a little toddler, and my mom and grandma were with me. I guess I did something bad and my mom smacked me. So my mom got home and then the doorbell rang. There was a policeman at the door and someone must have called the police for child abuse against me. My grandma answered the door and told the officer \"I'm a high school guidance councilor, I know the difference between child abuse and discipline\". In this case she was probably right, but what if it were different? A parent is able to do anything to their kid and of course the adult is trusted over the kid so all they have to do is say it was discipline and was done out of love for the child. By the time the child is 10 he/she is scared to death of their parents who have constantly ruled out of fear and taken complete control over them. Even when someone reports something like this to the police, there's no formal trial or anything, the police do nothing more than ask the parent if they abused their child. Who would say yes?\n \n And then there's the way they talk to you. In my case, my dad tells me and my brother to \"SHUT UP!!!!\" a lot but even in a family conversation, a simple \"shut up dad, I'm talking\" is unthinkable. When asked why the double standard \"we're the parents, when you grow up you can treat your kids like that\". In my mind that's total BS. Especially when a kid is old enough to think for themselves, the parents should be held to the same level of respect as the child. The adults can make the rules, but they should at least have to treat kids with respect. The days of children being seen and not heard are over. Parents should be role models for their children, and we wonder why so many teenagers curse fluently in public and are so disrespectful, we only have to look in the environment they were raised in.",

   "That's a gross understatement. A weak parent does not eqaul a good parent.\n \n Not if they wish to continue to grow up. \n \n btw - you're confusing discipline with beating. I suggest you read the entire thread. You'll see that there's a misunderstanding in the use of spanking as discipline from those who are not parents. Do you fall in that category?\n \n How many teenagers have you reared? I'd bet they're not all the same. You can't use the same parenting skills on different children. Parenting is full-time job and changes are required 100% of the time when children are 100% different.\n \n Now - if children were programmable....\n\n \n Oh, I sense a lot of anger in you young Paduwan :)\n \n \"Not if they wish to continue to grow up\"... that's harsh. \n \n If you hit somebody you hit somebody, there's very little you can do to change that. You can call it something else, like discipline if you like but it still doesn't change the fact that you're hitting your child. \n \n There's a great story told by Astrid Lindgren, our most famous writer of childrens' books. A mother was angry with her son and told him that she was going to spank him. She told him to go out in the woods to find something she could spank him with. He goes out, doesn't really know what to look for and returns home with a small rock that he tells his mom she can throw at him if she wants to hurt him for being bad. The mother broke down crying. \n \n Look, I can see the difference between occasionally hitting your child and beating them senseless. And yes, I have met people who got beaten when they were young and who became great grown ups. That doesn't change anyting. Cause if you moderate your physical discipline to the point where it's very safe and controlled you are doing two things. You're still hitting the child although you're actually so calm and controlled that you could easily have come up with something just as efficient that did not include any violence. And you're showing the kid that even when you're calm you will hit them. It's a really strange message.\n \n Anyway, in Sweden where I live it's illegal to hit your child so that's the end of that. If you hit your kid here your child can call the cops on you, I'm not joking. Where is your authority then, heh? Too late to think about that then. It would have been smarter to have thought about it before hitting the kid, right?",

I would say that at age 12 (or thereabout) a child that has been disciplined properly will no longer behave in such a manner as to warrant a spanking.

   "To answer the question directly: it can be. Unfortunately I've seen far too many children get screamed at and spanked (not beaten) in anger, both in public and in private. The potential for damage in those situations is pretty clear. \n \n It wasn't so evident in my case. My parents are and were wonderful, loving, caring parents who wanted only to raise my siblings and I in the best way possible. The followed James Dobson's books pretty much to the letter. Actually I think they were alot less harsh than he allows for. No spanking in anger. Talk before and after about why the punishment is being given. Affirm love for the child. \n \n What they could not have possibly known, nor could have I at the time, was that I was born with an organic mental illness (mental illness is probably much more common than most people think, i just want to mention that). It didn't matter how perfectly my parents orchestrated the spankings, or how careful they were not to spank in anger, not to spank too long or too hard. I viewed being spanked (hurt) by my parents as betrayal. I lost trust for them. And after not very long I was just plain angry. The more they spanked me the more I hated them, and the more I hated them the less I listened to them. As I got older I learned the art of deception in order to keep from being spanked. The more I got away with it, the better I got at it. They tried other punishments as well, like grounding, removing priveledges, being sent to my room, and none of these worked either. I would often decide that the behavior was worth the consequence. By the time I was a few years into grade school I was violent with siblings and peers, rebellious, deceitful, manipulative, and more than anything I was one ###### off kid. I cooperated only when I *wanted* to cooperate.\n \n When I was 11 or 12 they stopped spanking me for good thought it was a gradual decline. They continued to use other punishments which had little effect other than to make me angry and less cooperative. I fought bitterly with my parents on a regular basis, and started hitting both of them. They would have to literally sit on top of me and hold my arms to restrain me until I was too exhausted to continue fighting. As I got old enough to be allowed to I started leaving the house for extended periods of time just so I could be alone. By anyone else's account at that time I was a pretty good kid. I no longer got into fights in school. I got good grades, never smoked, drank or used drugs, wasn't having sex, wasn't even dating. It wasn't because I was afraid of punishment, because I had *no* fear of punishment. I just wasn't interested in those things. But i was full of rage which I directed both at myself and my family at the drop of a hat. So after school I would finish my homework, then ride off on my bike and come back around bedtime. In the winters I'd go to the barn and read or draw. My parents just let me go since I wasn't doing anything wrong, and it was the only peace they got from me. At 16 I started working after school and on weekends, and I was rarely home after that. \n \n It took diagnosis, medication, and many years of adulthood and insightful reflection for me to piece together my trainwreck of a childhood. Initially I hated my parents and felt they had knowingly abused me. I now realize that they had been doing the best they knew how and could not figure out how they had failed me. They never EVER had a clue that they were hurting me, and they never ever would have hurt me intentionally. They were only trying to teach me right from wrong, the same way they'd been brought up, and in the only way they knew how. I am very close with my parents now. I love them and have always loved them, even when I was angry at them. It has not been an easy road getting there, but I have the relationship with them now that I always wanted, and that's all that matters to me today.\n \n So that's about me. The second part to my story is my little girl. She is six now. After my childhood I always knew I wouldn't spank. Aside from that I was largely clueless as to what else there was. What I wound up with was largely borne from trial and error, and like most parents it continues to involve some trial and error. Like me, my daughter is pretty emotionally volatile, and like me she does not respond well to force. But how do you get a child to listen to you when they seem to push against every step with equal force? \n \n So my parenting \"philosophy\" can basically be summed up in the following example: My manager at work would do absolutely anything for any one of us who works there. It's almost unheard of for her to write anyone up or fire them. She isn't demanding. She treats us as equals in every way, and is very unformal compared to any other manager I've had. You'd expect because of this that employees would walk all over her and take advantage of it. They don't. I would do absolutely anything she asked of me, even things I'd prefer not to do, not because I fear termination if I don't , but because she is my friend and I would never want do anything to let her down. She has absolutely EARNED my respect by never failing to treat me with respect, and I have a responsibility to live up tot he level of respect that she shows me. Throughout my childhood the adults in authortiy who had the greatest positive impact were the ones who treated me with total respect no matter what. I didn't want to do anything to disappoint them.\n \n So that's the kind of relationship I've worked to build up with my daughter. \n \n Earlier in the learning process for me I tried some pretty benign punishments to get her cooperation. Time out. Take a toy away. That kind of thing. It was like trying to push water uphill. It simply does not work. If I made the punishment worse she continually dug her heels in harder. The goal of discipline is to change behavior. Her bahavior wasn't changing, it was actually getting worse, so I had to change my approach. \n \n I'm no pushover. No-one can truly respect someone who doesn't have respect for themself. I set very few rules for her in general. Homework before tv. Bedtime is non-negotiable on schoolnights. Clean up after yourself. Brush and floss. Maybe one or two more... I give her as much autonamy as is safe and responsible, and in turn she does what I ask her to do nearly all the time. Occasionally I have to remind her. Failing that, an expression of frustration on my part is as far as it ever goes. She may not be happy about doing what I ask, but she does it. She doesn't have to be happy, but she does have to listen to me. The older she gets the more cooperatve she becomes. A few times she's pushed the limits and spoken to me disrespectfully when she was angry. I just say \"Hey. I don't speak to you that way, and that's not the right way to speak to me.\" Discipline problems are non-existant. She's never had a discipline problem in school or pre-school. Absolutely no complaints about her behavior, ever. Her teachers love her. Her babysitter loves her. She gets along well with all the other kids. She's a cooperative, happy, caring child. People always tell me I have an awesome kid. She still has her moments like any kid does, but as long as I maintain respect for her and don't lose my cool they are over with very quickly. We have a very relaxed and happy home, and my daughter is an absolute joy to raise. emoticon_love",

If hurting your child is the only way you can find to discipline him/her, then you shouldnt be a parent in the first place.\n \n \n If it is ok to spank a child, then it should be ok to go into a public area and start spanking random people, which i believe is not legal.\n \n We are too imperfect to hurt people for their actions, we must find other reasons of discipline. The barbaric thinking that children need to be spanked in order to be disciplined is disgusting. I was never spanked as a child, my parents were strongly against any beatings or spanking, or hurting your child in any way. I grew up healthy, not \"tough\", but healthy.
