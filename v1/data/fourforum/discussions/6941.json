   "The date of this post appears to be November 22, 2005:\n \n http://www.onepeoplesproject.com/112205christmas.htm\n \n \nCHRISTMAS UNDER ATTACK: A MANUFACTURED CRISIS\n Ah it's that festive time of the year again. Time to deck the halls with boughs of holly, put up the ol' Christmas Tree, and use all of that to score political points with your Christian Reich base. This has been pretty much ignored because of how stupid it is, but someone has to say it, now that the usual suspects are singing that ol' Christmas refrain about how they are not allowed to celebrate Christmas - it's a phony concern. This year its them bullying Wal-Mart into saying \"Merry Christmas\" in their displays instead of \"Happy Holidays\" in respect to those customers who don't celebrate Christmas. . . . Last year the Rev. Jerry Falwell claimed \"secularists\" \"hate Christ\" and want to \"steal Christmas from America.\" This holiday season, Falwell's Lynchburg, VA.-based Thomas Road Baptist Church has joined forces with a Christian legal outfit, Liberty Counsel, for its \"Friend or Foe Christmas Campaign.\"\n \n Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly -- under fire for recent explosive comments seemingly condoning the destruction of Coit Tower, San Francisco's monument to heroic firefighters, argued on his program that viewers should shun stores that are \"anti-Christmas.\"\n \n William Donahue's New York-based Catholic League for Religious and Civic Rights launched a fevered, and short-lived, boycott of Wal-Mart when the stores' website recognized the terms Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, yet turned the words Christmas season into holiday season. Wal-Mart apologized for the mishap. . . .John Gibson, the host of Fox News Channel's \"The Big Story,\" has penned a new book called The War on Christmas (Sentinel, October 2005), which is devoted to the controversy. . . .Fox on board\n \n On the Fox News Channel, ranting about liberals out to destroy Christmas is as ubiquitous and inaccurate as the station's \"fair and balanced\" credo. Last year, according to Media Matters for America, \"In a 'Talking Points Memo' devoted to \"[h]ow Martin Luther King would view things today,'\" O'Reilly said that King \"would be appalled by the secular culture\" and by \"the attacks on Christmas, the demonizing of Christianity.\"\n \n In addition to plugging Gibson's book, Fox's Bill O'Reilly recently ranted about the anti-Christmas practices of two major retailers, Sears/K-Mart and Kohl's.\nUnfortunately, you have to pay bucks to access O'Reilly's site and I ain't gonna do that!",

   "Christianity in Early America\n \n Congress appointed chaplains for itself and the armed forces, sponsored the publication of a Bible, imposed Christian morality on the armed forces, and granted public lands to promote Christianity among the Indians. National days of thanksgiving and of \"humiliation, fasting, and prayer\" were proclaimed by Congress at least twice a year throughout the war. Congress was guided by \"covenant theology,\" a Reformation doctrine especially dear to New England Puritans, which held that God bound himself in an agreement with a nation and its people.\n \n The Liberty Window\n \n At its initial meeting in September 1774 Congress invited the Reverend Jacob Duch\u00e9 (1738-1798), rector of Christ Church, Philadelphia, to open its sessions with prayer. Duch\u00e9 ministered to Congress in an unofficial capacity until he was elected the body's first chaplain on July 9, 1776. \n \n Proposed Seal for the United States\n \n On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams \"to bring in a device for a seal for the United States of America.\" Franklin's proposal adapted the biblical story of the parting of the Red Sea (left). Jefferson first recommended the \"Children of Israel in the Wilderness, led by a Cloud by Day, and a Pillar of Fire by night. . . .\" He then embraced Franklin's proposal and rewrote it . Jefferson's revision of Franklin's proposal was presented by the committee to Congress on August 20. Although not accepted these drafts reveal the religious temper of the Revolutionary period. Franklin and Jefferson were among the most theologically liberal of the Founders, yet they used biblical imagery for this important task.\n \n A picture of the seal showing a relief of Moses and the parting of the Red Sea is in the following link:\n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/vc006418.jpg\n \n Congressional Thanksgiving Day Proclamation\n \n Congress set December 18, 1777, as a day of thanksgiving on which the American people \"may express the grateful feelings of their hearts and consecrate themselves to the service of their divine benefactor\" and on which they might \"join the penitent confession of their manifold sins . . . that it may please God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance.\" Congress also recommends that Americans petition God \"to prosper the means of religion for the promotion and enlargement of that kingdom which consisteth in righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.'\" \n \n Morality in the Army\n \n Congress was apprehensive about the moral condition of the American army and navy and took steps to see that Christian morality prevailed in both organizations. In the Articles of War, seen below, governing the conduct of the Continental Army (seen above) (adopted, June 30, 1775; revised, September 20, 1776), Congress devoted three of the four articles in the first section to the religious nurture of the troops. Article 2 \"earnestly recommended to all officers and soldiers to attend divine services.\" Punishment was prescribed for those who behaved \"indecently or irreverently\" in churches, including courts-martial, fines and imprisonments. Chaplains who deserted their troops were to be court-martialed. \n \n Aitken's Bible Endorsed by Congress\n \n The war with Britain cut off the supply of Bibles to the United States with the result that on Sept. 11, 1777, Congress instructed its Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from \"Scotland, Holland or elsewhere.\" On January 21, 1781, Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken (1734-1802) petitioned Congress to officially sanction a publication of the Old and New Testament which he was preparing at his own expense. Congress \"highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion . . . in this country, and . . . they recommend this edition of the bible to the inhabitants of the United States.\" This resolution was a result of Aitken's successful accomplishment of his project.\n \n Christianizing the Delawares\n \n In this resolution, Congress makes public lands available to a group for religious purposes. Responding to a plea from Bishop John Ettwein (1721-1802), Congress voted that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren . . . or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\" The Delaware Indians were the intended beneficiaries of this Congressional resolution.\n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html\n \n Obviously, the progressive secularist's have long forgotten (or never had a clue) what our early American Government was really like.",

   "Religion and the New Republic\n \n The religion of the new American republic was evangelicalism, which, between 1800 and the Civil War, was the \"grand absorbing theme\" of American religious life. During some years in the first half of the nineteenth century, revivals (through which evangelicalism found expression) occurred so often that religious publications that specialized in tracking them lost count. In 1827, for example, one journal exulted that \"revivals, we rejoice to say, are becoming too numerous in our country to admit of being generally mentioned in our Record.\" During the years between the inaugurations of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, historians see \"evangelicalism emerging as a kind of national church or national religion.\" The leaders and ordinary members of the \"evangelical empire\" of the nineteenth century were American patriots who subscribed to the views of the Founders that religion was a \"necessary spring\" for republican government; they believed, as a preacher in 1826 asserted, that there was \"an association between Religion and Patriotism.\" Converting their fellow citizens to Christianity was, for them, an act that simultaneously saved souls and saved the republic. The American Home Missionary Society assured its supporters in 1826 that \"we are doing the work of patriotism no less than Christianity.\" With the disappearance of efforts by government to create morality in the body politic (symbolized by the termination in 1833 of Massachusetts's tax support for churches) evangelical, benevolent societies assumed that role, bringing about what today might be called the privatization of the responsibility for forming a virtuous citizenry. (Library of Congress)\n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel07.html\n \n In 1800 major revivals that eventually reached into almost every corner of the land began at opposite ends of the country: the decorous Second Great Awakening in New England and the exuberant Great Revival in Kentucky. The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the camp meeting. The revivals were organized by Presbyterian ministers, who modeled them after the extended outdoor \"communion seasons,\" used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days. When assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern United States, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination. (Library of Congress)\n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel07.html\n \n The \"Bible Commonwealths\"\n \n The New England colonies have often been called \"Bible Commonwealths\" because they sought the guidance of the scriptures in regulating all aspects of the lives of their citizens. Scripture was cited as authority for many criminal statutes. (U.S. Library of Congress)",

This construction forbids the state from outlawing specific religious practices and forbids state discrimination on the basis of religion. If public school officials open school facilities for after-school use, they cannot single out religious groups for exclusion. Similarly, eligibility for publicly funded programs cannot be conditioned on the absence or existence of religious affiliation. If the State of Washington grants college scholarships to its best students, then it cannot exclude religious individuals who choose to major in theology. \n \n \"No privileges, no penalties\" also lends itself to establishment jurisprudence. No-establishment would prohibit the state from singling out religious citizens for special legal privileges. Special tax exemptions for religious organizations alone, for example, would be disallowed (although religions could qualify for tax-exempt status as nonprofit corporations or under some other, nonreligious criterion). Legislative chaplains drawing state salaries also would be forbidden. The Founders' conception of what constitutes an impermissible religious establishment, however, did not include the public recognition of God by state officials. For the Founders, a legal privilege meant receiving material benefits or possessing special rights unavailable to the typical citizen; legal penalties meant fines or imprisonment. By prohibiting religious establishments, the Founders intended to end things like special religious taxes, religious qualifications for public office, and the enforcement of religious orthodoxy through Sabbath-breaking laws. The public recognition of God and voluntary participation in ceremonies or rites that recognize God, even if led by public officials, were never thought to be impermissible. In fact, the Founders sought to solemnize the most important public events by deliberately including religious language and appeals to divine providence in the text of their speeches and documents.\n\n \n http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0312/articles/munoz.html",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/opinion/04sun3.html\n \n December 4, 2005\n Editorial Observer\n This Season's War Cry: Commercialize Christmas, or Else \n By ADAM COHEN\n Religious conservatives have a cause this holiday season: the commercialization of Christmas. They're for it.\n \n The American Family Association is leading a boycott of Target for not using the words \"Merry Christmas\" in its advertising. (Target denies it has an anti-Merry-Christmas policy.) The Catholic League boycotted Wal-Mart in part over the way its Web site treated searches for \"Christmas.\" Bill O'Reilly, the Fox anchor who last year started a \"Christmas Under Siege\" campaign, has a chart on his Web site of stores that use the phrase \"Happy Holidays,\" along with a poll that asks, \"Will you shop at stores that do not say 'Merry Christmas'?\"\n \n This campaign - which is being hyped on Fox and conservative talk radio - is an odd one. Christmas remains ubiquitous, and with its celebrators in control of the White House, Congress, the Supreme Court and every state supreme court and legislature, it hardly lacks for powerful supporters. There is also something perverse, when Christians are being jailed for discussing the Bible in Saudi Arabia and slaughtered in Sudan, about spending so much energy on stores that sell \"holiday trees.\"\n \n What is less obvious, though, is that Christmas's self-proclaimed defenders are rewriting the holiday's history. They claim that the \"traditional\" American Christmas is under attack by what John Gibson, another Fox anchor, calls \"professional atheists\" and \"Christian haters.\" But America has a complicated history with Christmas, going back to the Puritans, who despised it. What the boycotters are doing is not defending America's Christmas traditions, but creating a new version of the holiday that fits a political agenda. \n \n The Puritans considered Christmas un-Christian, and hoped to keep it out of America. They could not find Dec. 25 in the Bible, their sole source of religious guidance, and insisted that the date derived from Saturnalia, the Roman heathens' wintertime celebration. On their first Dec. 25 in the New World, in 1620, the Puritans worked on building projects and ostentatiously ignored the holiday. From 1659 to 1681 Massachusetts went further, making celebrating Christmas \"by forbearing of labor, feasting or in any other way\" a crime.\n \n The concern that Christmas distracted from religious piety continued even after Puritanism waned. In 1827, an Episcopal bishop lamented that the Devil had stolen Christmas \"and converted it into a day of worldly festivity, shooting and swearing.\" Throughout the 1800's, many religious leaders were still trying to hold the line. As late as 1855, New York newspapers reported that Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches were closed on Dec. 25 because \"they do not accept the day as a Holy One.\" On the eve of the Civil War, Christmas was recognized in just 18 states.\n \n Christmas gained popularity when it was transformed into a domestic celebration, after the publication of Clement Clarke Moore's \"Visit from St. Nicholas\" and Thomas Nast's Harper's Weekly drawings, which created the image of a white-bearded Santa who gave gifts to children. The new emphasis lessened religious leaders' worries that the holiday would be given over to drinking and swearing, but it introduced another concern: commercialism. By the 1920's, the retail industry had adopted Christmas as its own, sponsoring annual ceremonies to kick off the \"Christmas shopping season.\"\n \n Religious leaders objected strongly. The Christmas that emerged had an inherent tension: merchants tried to make it about buying, while clergymen tried to keep commerce out. A 1931 Times roundup of Christmas sermons reported a common theme: \"the suggestion that Christmas could not survive if Christ were thrust into the background by materialism.\" A 1953 Methodist sermon broadcast on NBC - typical of countless such sermons - lamented that Christmas had become a \"profit-seeking period.\" This ethic found popular expression in \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\" In the 1965 TV special, Charlie Brown ignores Lucy's advice to \"get the biggest aluminum tree you can find\" and her assertion that Christmas is \"a big commercial racket,\" and finds a more spiritual way to observe the day.\n \n This year's Christmas \"defenders\" are not just tolerating commercialization - they're insisting on it. They are also rewriting Christmas history on another key point: non-Christians' objection to having the holiday forced on them.\n \n The campaign's leaders insist this is a new phenomenon - a \"liberal plot,\" in Mr. Gibson's words. But as early as 1906, the Committee on Elementary Schools in New York City urged that Christmas hymns be banned from the classroom, after a boycott by more than 20,000 Jewish students. In 1946, the Rabbinical Assembly of America declared that calling on Jewish children to sing Christmas carols was \"an infringement on their rights as Americans.\"\n \n Other non-Christians have long expressed similar concerns. For decades, companies have replaced \"Christmas parties\" with \"holiday parties,\" schools have adopted \"winter breaks\" instead of \"Christmas breaks,\" and TV stations and stores have used phrases like \"Happy Holidays\" and \"Season's Greetings\" out of respect for the nation's religious diversity.\n \n The Christmas that Mr. O'Reilly and his allies are promoting - one closely aligned with retailers, with a smack-down attitude toward nonobservers - fits with their campaign to make America more like a theocracy, with Christian displays on public property and Christian prayer in public schools. \n \n It does not, however, appear to be catching on with the public. That may be because most Americans do not recognize this commercialized, mean-spirited Christmas as their own. Of course, it's not even clear the campaign's leaders really believe in it. Just a few days ago, Fox News's online store was promoting its \"Holiday Collection\" for shoppers. Among the items offered to put under a \"holiday tree\" was \"The O'Reilly Factor Holiday Ornament.\" After bloggers pointed this out, Fox changed the \"holidays\" to \"Christmases.\"",
