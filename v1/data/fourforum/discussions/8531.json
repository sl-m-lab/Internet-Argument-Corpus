   "9/11 was orchestrated by the United States government and there are mountains of evidence to prove their complicity. The US government is using the events of 9/11 to further their imperialism in the Middle East as admitted in 2000 by the Project for the New American Century Organization where they called for a \"new Pearl Harbor.\"\n \n Please watch the thought provoking documentary Loose Change Second Edition to learn the truth behind the attacks. You will not regret watching this.\n \n - Why did the 9/11 Commission Report not mention the collapse of WTC 7 which was not hit by a plane? \n - Why does the owner of WTC 7 admit there was a demolition while the US government claims WTC 7 fell \"due to intense fires\" which were not present?\n - How did the WTC 1 collapse in under an hour when other buildings have burned for days with MUCH larger fires that the oxygen deprived fire in the WTC 1 and 2? They were the first sky scrappers in history to collapse due to fire.\n - Why are demolition squibs visible on video during the collapses of WTC 1, 2, and 7?\n - Why did dozens of police, fire fighters, and civilians report hearing explosions in the WTC before they collapsed?\n - How did both towers collapse at free fall speeds when the government promotes the \"pancaking theory\" which would not collapse at free fall speeds?\n - Why was NORAD given orders to \"stand down\" on the morning of 9/11 from the White House?\n - How did the most advanced air defense program in the world (NORAD) fail to intercept the \"hijacked\" airliners on 9/11 when it had successfully done so 67 times before?\n -Why are 4 of the \"hijackers\" still alive to this day?\n \n After you have watched Loose Change Second Edition, visitUniversal Seed to see other 9/11 documentaries where they delve into the actual physics of the collapses and other events. Please do your own research and you will see beyond any doubt that 9/11 was in fact an inside job.\n \n Loose Change Home Page",

And yes, I have seen the WTC footage plenty of times more than I cared too, like most Americans. It is actually estimated that at least 20% of Americans were inflicted with temporary PTSD( Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) from the constant flooding of horrific images broadcasted constantly from the media.\n \n Speaking of using a little brain power...how do you explain this, just before the collapse of WTC7? WTC7 squibs. Does a building collapsing \"due to fire\" usually shoot out horizontal plumes of debris seconds before it collapses? Not unless it's a demolition...\n \n You say you saw the collapse footage?

Structural damage plus jet fuel in a confined space with plenty of oxygen could easily heat the steel to a point of failure. The sheer weight of the floors and acceleration would explain the near vertical collapse.\n\n When a building is demolished, demolition charges are also needed on the top of the building as well as the bottom. I don't think you meant to type this, but you stated that the squibs could be explained by the \"implosion\" from the midde of the building. Implosions are used in demolitions and do cause squibs...so I don't quite understand that statement. I think it's just a wrong word choice.\n \n I don't know about you, but from the video I see the squibs blast simultaneously with the collapse. And yes, there was structural damage from falling debris from WTC 1 and 2 but there was absolutely NO jet fuel in WTC 7. The fires were supposedly ignited from falling debris. Secondly, the black smoke coming from WTC7 (as well as 1 and 2) indicates an oxygen deprived fire and will not even near the melting point of steel with office supplies as its fuel.\n \n If WTC 7 collapses due to fire, all of the main structural supports would have had to been severed at the exact same moment to have that perfect symmetrical collapse as seen in the video. Most of the fires were in the southern section of the building, so if it collapsed due to fire the building would have tipped towards the south during the collapse since the north supports were still in tact. \n \n Most controlled demolitions don't even go as well as the collapse of WTC 7 where there was almost no collateral damage. To say fire pulled off that perfect symmetrical collapse with such precision is impossible. Not to mention the building fell at a free fall speed with absolutely no resistance which pretty much destroys the pancake theory the government employs.\n \n Just out of curiosity, have you watched Loose Change Second Edition or 9/11 Revisited?

No way, no how. Sorry, but you're gonna need a bit more proof.\n\n First off, take the time and watch Loose Change. It's mainly for your own benefit since I will be discussing these issues and you will have a limited knowledge on it. It's always good to research the topic before arguing against it. And also please read all my posts on this thread so far since I outline some evidence about the WTC7 demolition. So please watch the documentary. It won't be a waste of an hour.\n \n To be honest, I still have no idea what you're trying to say about them causing the \"buildings\" to burn longer but I will try to answer it none-the-less. Both towers burned for roughly an hour before collapsing to the ground. The fires were isolated to about 5-10 stories and were oxygen deprived. Most of the jet fuel was exploded outside the building (hence the giant fireball) so most of the fire's fuel was office supplies. The towers then collapsed at free fall speeds, with multiple demolition squibs visible, and symmetrically onto its own footprints. There were dozens of firefighters, police officers, and civilians who heard and saw secondary explosions. I hope I answered your question somewhere within that rant because I have no idea what you meant, sorry. \n \n If you're familiar with little something called history, the question \"but why\" would be obvious. There are dozens of events in history where governments secretly attacked their own nation to effectively control their fear stricken citizens. The most well known event was during the rise of Nazi Germany. The Democratically elected leader Adolph Hitler ordered the tallest building in Germany, the Reichstag, to be burned to the ground. After the attack he placed all the blame on the Jews and Communists. The country was filled with fear and believed/did what ever the government told them. This \"attack\" was then the pretext to their invasion of various nations. Sound familiar? If you're interested, do some research into the American Gold of Tonkin incident.\n \n Operation Northwoods is also proof the American government is willing to carry out attacks on their own people. This declassified plan involved staging a terrorist attack on the US and blaming it on the Cubans to allow a reason to invade them. It involved using drone aircraft painted as a commercial plane and crash them into Miami and the capital, claiming it was a hijacking. The details later explain that they would report the plane was filled with college students vacationing in Cuba and will stage mock funerals for the victims. This is all real in black and white. This is proof the US was willing to do this during the Cold War. With today's advances in technology and heavily controlled media, this operation will only be easier.\n \n Too many big mouths to keep such an operation secret? Ever hear of the Manhattan Project? It involved thousands of scientists, spanned over a decade, and even confiscated entire towns for research. No one ever said a word about this...the president didn't even know until it was announced. What about all black military projects the government operates such as the development of the stealth bomber which overshadowed any military technology at the time? A little money and ALOT of government pressure can keep any mouth shut. This is a known fact, and history tested and proven.\n \n All these questions that you're asking are answered in Loose Change and all the other documentaries at UniversalSeed.Org. This is exactly the reason why you need to watch it before asking me questions. It should be you're job to research it and then ask me any questions you have. It is literally impossible for me to type the mountains of evidence supporting government complicity in 9/11. It will be allot easier for both me and you if you just watch the movie.\n \n I hope I answered all the questions you asked.",
