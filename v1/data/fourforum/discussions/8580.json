That children benefit when their parents are able to marry or enter into civil unions. \n \n The report was commissioned by the American Academy of Pediatrics Board of Directors, which has 55,000 members and remains an influential organization for pediatrics.\n \n The results were published the day before the New York Court of Appeals ruled against same-sex marriage. Without referencing statistics or research, the majority ruling found that \"intuition and experience suggest that a child benefits from having before his or her eyes, every day, living models of what both a man and a woman are like.\"\n \n Human Rights Campaign's Joe Solmonese noted what the doctors know and the courts don't. In a formal news release, Solmonese said, \"The nation's largest organization for pediatricians knows what it's talking about<b></b>: Marriage is good for all families.\"\n\n \n FOCUS ON THE FAMILIES REBUTTAL: \n \n http://www.family.org/cforum/news/a0041392.cfm\n \n \nFamily Experts Rebut Study That Claims Kids Need Gay Marriage \n by Wendy Cloyd, assistant editor \n \n \n Report ignores important measures of success.\n \n A study published this month in the journal Pediatrics claimed children do better when their same-sex parents are allowed to marry or enter a civil union. According to marriage and family experts, such reporting fails to recognize myriad reports that show kids do better in a home with a biological mother and father.\n \n The report, titled \"The Effects of Marriage, Civil Union and Domestic Partnership Laws on the Health and Well-Being of Children,\" was commissioned by the board of directors for the 55,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). It concludes:\n \n \"There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with one or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.\"\n \n But Glenn Stanton, senior analyst for marriage and cultural affairs for Focus on the Family, said the research avoided a more important question in its quest to affirm gay marriage.\n \n \"This report essentially says that research shows that gay and lesbian parents can be as loving and caring as heterosexual parents,\" he said. \"That is not the same as saying that children who grow up in homes in two-female or two-male adult homes do as well as kids who live with their mother and father in important outcome measures.\"\n \n The AAP is skirting some very important issues, he said. For example, the study claims \"there are more similarities than differences in parenting styles and attitudes of gay and non-gay fathers.\" \n \n While sexual orientation does not seem to affect whether parents prefer their kids to eat healthy snacks, get plenty of exercise, read books, limit television viewing and be kind to their friends, Stanton said there are other important factors the study tries to play down or simply ignores. \n \n \"We have to examine the impact of the very consequential differences that are there,\" he said. \"Same-sex homes intentionally deny children a mother or father in the home simply because adults desire such homes. \n \n \"Research by nonpartisan child-advocacy organizations has consistently shown that children do markedly better when raised by their mothers and fathers.\"\n",

   "I can't help but notice how the FoF is claiming that other studies \"refute\" the findings of the AAP study, but then the ONLY STUDY that is cited or linked to off of their statement is the AAP STUDY ITSELF.\n \n They repeatedly claim \"studies show...\", but then produce ABSOLUTELY NO STUDY which says what they claim is being said.\n And in the end, I don't really think they're looking to persuade anybody who is objective and wanting to actually SEE the evidence.\n They just want to give some Joe Schmoe who is against homosexuals and always has been and always will be some talking point so HE can make the claim, possibly even citing the FoF EDITORIAL as \"research\" itself.\n All they're doing is giving their own a reason to continue denying the facts, IMO.\n \n And of course, if you actually listen to some of the divisive XXXX that is being spewed in the halls of Congress for the \"gay marriage\" vote, you'll here the same old horse hockey being spewed there. Claims of \"studies show...\" while producing absolutely NO STUDY which supposedly claims what they say...\n \n Being politicians and all, they obviously are immune for being held accountable for their statements, but I would love to see somebody interview one of these guys and have the discussion start out with two simple words, \"What studies?\"",
