You have just stumbled upon a really bad (and decietful) link on the internet. Chomskys comment of \"conditions imposed by US tyrrany\" was not refering to any conditions imposed on americans, but rather the vietnamese, chilenians, nicaraguans, koreans etc that had been subjected to oppresions and wars fully supported or even orchestrated by various US governments. He talks about the third world and he talks about the starvation and poverty, but not about US citizens. Compared to the third world countries under despotic regimes supported, erected and protected by the US government, east europe was practicly a paradise. Eastern europe was not so bad in the eightiees. They still lacked fundamental political freedoms, but they had come a long, long way from the time of Stalin.\n \n I haven`t read much about Chomsky, and I`m not so sure that I would agree with his point of view, but in this case, he did raise a valid point.",

   "George Lakoff on Chomsky in 1973:\n \n If a nonlinguist reads nonspecialist articles about linguists such as the generally excellent piece by John Searle (NYR, June 29, 1972), he may get the impression that a linguist spends most of his time being concerned about rationalism (if he is a transformational grammarian) or behaviorism (if he is a structuralist). In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The rationalism-behaviorism issue enters rarely if at all into actual linguistic analyses, whether transformational or structural. The reason for this is that the behaviorist vs. rationalist dispute has no necessary connection with the structuralist vs. transformationalist dispute.\n \n In much of his writing, Noam Chomsky has conveyed the impression that structural linguistics was necessarily tied to behaviorism, while transformational grammar was necessarily rationalistic. This is false, though most popularizers of Chomsky's views have let the matter pass without comment. Chomsky's argument for rationalism, as Searle correctly observes, is based on the existence of linguistic universals (that is, features which are common to all human languages). Chomsky always cites examples of putative universals from transformational grammar, but the fact is that just about every other theory of grammar that has ever been seriously proposed has, either implicitly or explicitly, incorporated claims for extremely complex and sophisticated linguistic universals. This is true of structural linguistics, stratificational grammar, tagmemics, Montague grammar, generative semantics, etc.\n \n In fact, contrary to what Chomsky suggests, the most extensive studies of complex linguistic universals have been carried out within the framework of structural linguistics. The classic works of the European structuralists Trubetzkoy and Jakobson in phonology and of Joseph Greenberg in American structuralist syntax have been the foundation for all of the more recent (and less extensive) studies of universals done in the tradition of transformational grammar. Chomsky's claims in favor of rationalism over behaviorism do not rest upon his theory of transformational grammar being right and structuralism being wrong. One can make exactly the same argument using the structuralist universals instead, since the universals discovered in structural linguistics are more than complex enough for the purpose of the argument. . . .\n \n http://www.nybooks.com/articles/9956",

   "Chomsky replies:\n \n George Lakoff's response [NYR, February 8] to John Searle's article on linguistics [NYR, June 29, 1972] is largely a criticism of views he attributes to me. In fact, there is little resemblance between my views and what he believes them to be. More important, Lakoff presents a very confused picture of the issues that have been under discussion in the work to which he refers and an entirely fanciful account of the interests and concerns of various individuals and groups working in the field. I cannot take the space to disentangle each confusion and correct every misrepresentation, but a few examples may suffice to illustrate the intellectual level of Lakoff's attempt to correct \"nonspecialist articles about linguists.\"\n \n Lakoff's first and major example is what he calls \"the behaviorist vs. rationalist dispute.\" He states that I have \"characterized structural linguistics as being fundamentally behavioristic\" and \"necessarily tied to behaviorism,\" and that my argument for rationalism \"is based on the existence of linguistic universals.\" But structuralist theories have \"incorporated claims for extremely complex and sophisticated linguistic universals\" and these, Lakoff argues, are \"more than complex enough\" to refute behaviorism.\n \n The relevant background facts are, briefly, as follows. I and others have suggested that it is useful to distinguish two approaches to the study of language acquisition, call them E and R, where E incorporates (inter alia) the variety of proposals within structural linguistics and behaviorist psychology that bear on the issue, and R differs in fundamental respects. We have also argued that E and R express certain leading ideas of empiricism and rationalism, respectively, and that the results of transformational generative grammar support R over any variety of E. I will not try to explain or defend these views here (see Alan Gewirth, NYR, February 22, for some illuminating comment). Details are given in publications that Searle cites. I am concerned here merely with the logic of the argument.\n \n Notice first that the dispute is not between rationalism and behaviorism, but between R and E. Lakoff is, I believe, correct in stating that the universals postulated in one subvariety of E (structural linguistics) are \"complex enough\" to refute the claims of another subvariety (behaviorism). True or false, the matter has no bearing on the question at issue, namely, whether E or R is correct. Since Lakoff gives no citations, I cannot comment on his belief that I have characterized structural linguistics as \"fundamentally behavioristic,\" except to say that I hold no such view and have not \"conveyed the impression\" (as he claims) that there is a necessary connection between the two. I have clearly differentiated the two schools in discussing this issue (see, e.g., Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, 1965, p. 51f). Lakoff asserts that my \"portrayal of structural linguistics\" is \"inaccurate,\" but he seems to be quite unaware of what this portrayal actually is (cf. ibid.; Language and Mind, 1968, chapter 1; Current Issues in Linguistic Theory, 1964). Perhaps Lakoff is misled by the fact that I and others have subsumed structural linguistic and behaviorist approaches along with others under E, while making it quite clear that this general approach incorporates many diverse and sometimes conflicting views.\n \n Lakoff's statement that the argument against behaviorism \"is based on the existence of linguistic universals\" is completely wrong. Behaviorist approaches, obviously, imply the existence of linguistic universals. What is at issue is not whether there are linguistic universals but rather what they are-specifically, whether they bear on the choice between E and R. If one wanted to show that the results of structural linguistics refute behaviorism, he would consider the most \"complex and sophisticated\" structures investigated in the former and argue that these violate behaviorist universals, i.e., cannot be attained by mechanisms postulated by behaviorists. The natural candidate would be the class of structures given by Harris's morpheme-to-utterance procedures (Methods of Structural Linguistics 1951). However, in a further misrepresentation, Lakoff describes Harris (quite falsely) as \"an extreme case of a behavioristically oriented taxonomist,\" thus neatly closing off the best method for establishing his irrelevant claim.

And what are his excuses?\n\n \n I'll address your first assertion. You don't like U.S. foreign policy. I happen to believe it is exactly correct. I can't recall in all of human history where appeasement and pacifism has ever worked. Can you? BTW, Kyoto is junk science. Bush would have been an idiot to have approved it.\n \n As to Chomsky, he goes about the world saying the most outrageous things about America it makes me want to puke.

I would like to express the great joy that we feel in your accomplishments.\n \n \"We also saw the ruins of dwellings and hospitals, villages mutilated by savage bombardments, craters disfiguring the peaceful countryside. In the midst of the creative achievements of the Vietnamese people, we came face to face with the savagery of a technological monster controlled by a social class, the rulers of the American empire, that has no place in the 20th century, that has only the capacity to repress and murder and destroy.\n \n \"We also saw the (Ham Ranh) Bridge, standing proud and defiant, and carved on the bills above we read the words, 'determined to win.' The people of Vietnam will win, they must win, because your cause is the cause of humanity as it moves forward toward liberty and justice, toward the socialist society in which free, creative men control their own destiny.\n \n \"This is my first visit to Vietnam. Nevertheless, since the moment when we arrived at the airport at Hanoi, I've had a remarkable and very satisfying feeling of being entirely at home. It is as if we are renewing old friendships rather than meeting new friends. It is as if we are returning to places that have a deep and personal meaning.\n \n \"In part, this is because of the warmth and the kindness with which we have been received, wherever we have gone. In part, it is because for many years we have wished all our strength and will to stand beside you in your struggle. We are deeply grateful to you that you permit us to be part of your brave and historical struggle. We hope that there will continue to be strong bonds of comradeship between the people of Vietnam and the many Americans who wish you success and who detest with all of their being the hateful activities of the American government.\n \n \"Those bonds of friendship are woven of many strands. From our point of view there is first of all the deep sympathy that we felt for the suffering of the Vietnamese people, which persists and increases in the southern part of your country, where the American aggression continues in full force.\n \n \"There is, furthermore, a feeling of regret and shame that we must feel because we have not been able to stop the American war machine. More important still is our admiration for the people of Vietnam who have been able to defend themselves against the ferocious attack, and at the same time take great strides forward toward the socialist society.\n \n \"But, above all, I think, is the feeling of pride. Your heroism reveals the capabilities of the human spirit and human will. Decent people throughout the world see in your struggle a model for themselves. They are in your debt, everlastingly, because you were in the forefront of the struggle to create a world in which the chains of oppression have been broken and replaced by social bonds among free men working in true solidarity and cooperation.\n \n \"Your courage and your achievements teach us that we too must be determined to win--not only to win the battle against American aggression in Southeast Asia, but also the battle against exploitation and racism in our own country.\n \n \"I believe that in the United States there will be some day a social revolution that will be of great significance to us and to all of mankind, and if this hope is to be proven correct, it will be in large part because the people of Vietnam have shown us the way.\n \n \"While in Hanoi I have had the opportunity to read the recent and very important book by Le Duan on the problems and tasks of the Vietnamese revolution. In it, he says that the fundamental interests of the proletariat of the people of all the world consists in at the same time in safeguarding world peace and moving the revolution forward in all countries. This is our common goal. We only hope that we can build upon your historic achievements. Thank you.\"\n \n - Noam Chomsky, originally delivered on April 13, 1970 in Hanoi while he was visiting North Vietnam with a group of anti-war activists.

   "Surely lots of people killed over a range of terrorist attacks is no better or worse than if they were killed at once?\n The UK takes terrorism seriously - but that doesn't mean become madly paranoid, fact is Brittain probably won't get a 9/11 (if by that you mean large attack by Islamic fundamentalists) because we don't visably **** off the potential terrorists as much as the US, a large number of banks and institutions that could possibly sponsor the terrorists are based in London and our police are experienced with dealing with terrorists due to the IRA. 9/11 required the US to be unprepared - the UK has had quite a few potential 9/11s recently that have been stopped",

   "You stated that the UK did not take terrorism seriously, I pointed out that we have dealt with the IRA for decades and because of that History with the problems in Northern we have most draconian Anti-Terror Laws in the free World. This shows we take terrorism seriously, even if in fighting terrorism we restrict Civil Liberties.\n \n You stated that we need our own 9/11 to wake up about the threat from terrorism we have lived with terrorism for decades over 3000 people have died from Terrorists acts in the whole of UK during the Northern Ireland conflict. \n \n I have personally been affected by Terrorism from the IRA, my Girlfriend was caught up in the bombing in Manchester City Center during the early 90s. We have already had our 9/11 and at that time US citizens where funding the people that bomb City Centers, shot innocent people and terrorised whole communities.\n\n \n I've think this has already been stated by someone else but nothing on the order of 9/11 has yet afflicted British society. At the time you have two 110 story skyscrapers tumbling to the ground with the loss of 3,000 lives, you'll change your tune in a hurry. This happened to us prior to WWII. 85% of the American people were Isolationists and against entering WWII. Pearl Harbor made us take the blinders off. We are now in WWIV but most of Europe views this is just a remake of the \"phony war\" just prior to widespread hostilities of the real war to be launched. All it will take is just one nuclear bomb in London, Paris or Brussels to focus people's attention and then we will once again be on the same side. Right now we are divided. It all depends on whose ox is being gored. Europe's has definitely not been gored yet. But they are feeding the crocodile with their pacifist/appeasement policies.",

He wouldn't say no to a Islamic world, but its not what he is out to accomplish, despite the demonising tactics the US gov has used.\n Unless you are willing to look from the other point of view you can't beat terrorism, this doesn't mean submit to their demands but as we have seen attacking them and confirming their beleifs about you isn't the best plan.\n \n I have no problem with meddling with the middle east, quite how their theocracies and monarchies have lasted to the modern day I have no idea. But the tactics used in the Cold war and now in the war on terror are very short sighted, and in some cases just plain bad.\n The area has already been messed up, expecting a quick and easy solution to the problem is living in a fantasy land, its going to be a slow and painstaking process based more around politics and economics than any military action",
