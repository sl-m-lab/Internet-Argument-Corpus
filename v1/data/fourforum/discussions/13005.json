We do not have a democracy as many seem to believe but a Republic with the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land.\n \n [I]Regardless, the precedent has been set a great many times for situations where your 'inalienable rights' can be removed. Guantanemo Bay alone demonstrated this to extremes, whatever your opinion of it. It's power of due process.[I]\n \n There are at least two court cases that deal with crimes during war and they state that if the civil courts are operating they (crimes) must be heard in the courts of this land. Since that deals with citizens and not foreign criminals in war zones in foreign countries, treaties which are mentioned in the Constitution deal with proceedure under military law. The Geneva Convention applies in the majority of those cases unlike civil cases dealing with citizens. Our troops and others' troops must abide by these conventions and treaties made under the Constitution.\n \n The question then becomes 'where should the line be drawn on which rights should be removed?' At this point, we can cut nicely into the other thread, as we seem to be converging onto the same post. \n \n You assume that our Constitution protects foreign nationals and enemies when we are at war? Removal of rights was never an issue for citizens of this Republic. Amendment IX provided for State Rights and any not belonging to the State then belongs to the people. Amendment X reinforces the EXPANSION of those rights not the curtailment of any of them. To state that unalienable rights can be curtailed is a false admission that those rights come from government largess instead of from God and can therefore be reduced or diminished by government. They cannot! There is even a doomsday provision within the BOR which reserves to the people the right to restore the government to those founding principles.\n \n I post on the other thread and admit it would be easier to post on a single thread other than two but there is different context in the Criminal misuse thread. I welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns on this thread as I find you a reasonable person who has some misconceptions about our Republic and it's laws.",

As passengers screamed, diving to the floor, the man calmly emptied his gun, reloaded it and began shooting again. He did not utter a word, witnesses said........\n To riders on the train, most of whom boarded at 5:33 P.M. in Penn Station for what, at first, appeared to be an ordinary trip home, it was an unforgettable sight that began without any warning.\n \n \"He was just going bing, bing, bing, left to right, left to right,\" said Kevin McHugh, a Consolidated Edison manager from New Hyde Park, L.I., who was about six seats away when the gunman opened fire.\n Gunman Kills 5 on L.I.R.R.

(If you doubt this, count the number of law enforcement types you see next time you go to the range or on a hunting trip!) These officers know first hand that the kind of gun control popular among liberal activists will do nothing to reduce real crime or deter real criminals. They also know that the kind of extreme gun control measures being pushed by liberals today places an inordinate burden on law abiding shooting enthusiasts and legitimate gun dealers.\n \n And many veteran law enforcement officers can recount episodes where the intervention of an armed private citizen has saved lives # often the officer's!\n \n So Why Do so many Americans\n Believe Cops Want More Gun Control\n In part because that is what gun control advocates want you to believe. In their campaign to pass legislation the Brady Bill and the 1994 gun ban, for example, pro-gun control forces routinely called on cops to help make their case. Mostly big city chiefs and political appointees, (what we at LEAA like to call \"photo op cops\") these few police bureaucrats have helped create a public impression that America's cops favor gun control. (In some outrageous cases, police officers who actually opposed the legislation were forced by their superiors to appear in staged photographs as if they were solidly behind gun control!)\n \n Next time you see cops willingly participate in pro-gun control debate, notice how few of them are front-line street level officers.\n \n Recently, a Florida sheriff created headlines when he called for renewal of the 1994 Clinton Gun ban. He even demonstrated on nationwide TV the \"devastating effects\" that so-called banned weapons would have in the hands of criminals. It turns out the fully-automatic military weapon he demonstrated was not even covered by the 1994 ban.\n \n This \"law enforcement professional\" was then exposed for what he really was: a long time liberal politician who had been appointed to the office of sheriff as part of a political payoff. Nevertheless, people like this sheriff and other police bureaucrats, often appointed by liberal big city political machines, claim to speak for rank and file police.\n \n This is how LEAA Executive Director Jim Fotis Addresses the Issue:\n \n I'm a cop. I worked the streets. I learned how criminals act and how they think. I've used the sidearm my department issued to me. I've got the permanent physical reminders of a cop who more than once found himself in harm's way during years of active \"street\" law enforcement. I survived a \"classic shootout\" trading shots at a distance of roughly seven feet, something most cops don't survive. Believe me when I say I know viscerally the issues that most concern rank-and-file police. I'm not a political cop nor was I a fast-track desk jockey looking for my chance at a grin-and-grip color portrait autographed by the resident of the governor's mansion or the White House.\n \n Today, as the Executive Director of the Law Enforcement Alliance of America (LEAA), I represent other cops, corrections officers, private law enforcement, crime victims, and citizens across the nation who are fed up with the futility and hypocrisy of our criminal justice system.\n \n When I'm asked if cops support gun control, I respond with a clarification: If by gun control, you mean taking guns away from every sullen-eyed slack who pushed rock cocaine, ripped off old ladies, mugged a pensioner, murdered an equally low-life, gang banger competitor, or defined his social encounters in terms of robbery, rape or murder, the answer is a resounding yes! \n \n Every real cop I know is all for ripping weapons away from violent, criminal street-slime.\n \n But that is not what gun control means to the Brady's, the Clintons, Charles Schumer and, Dianne Feinstein. Their definition of gun control means restricting the rights of, and disarming, peaceable citizens. And the answer to that idea is a loud and clear, unambiguous \"NO\", at least from real cops.\"\n \n Cops for Gun Control: The Big Payoff Scheme\n The Clinton Administration was particularly successful at enlisting police support for gun control. They funneled millions of your tax dollars in political payoffs, disguised as \"research\" into the pockets of national law enforcement organizations.\n \n This era spawned several police \"type\" organizations with blatant anti-gun agendas, such as the so-called Police Foundation, followed by a host of clones, including the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF). One particularly heavily endowed group was International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), which has adopted a consistent anti-gun political agenda.\n \n Other police groups such as the National Sheriffs Association and the Fraternal Order of Police which, previous to the Clinton era, tended to be neutral or leaning toward a pro-Second Amendment stance, were influenced into taking pro-gun control stands by the river of political money flowing from the Clinton Administration and its allies.\n \n In one year during the Clinton Administration, the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs Association and the Police Foundation collectively hauled in $4.4 million in Justice Department grants. Before then the Department of Justice dollars flowed just as freely. The International Association of Chiefs of Police raked in over $630,000. National Sheriffs Association cheerfully pocketed $516,943. The Police Executive Research Forum netted $447,343. The Police Foundation accepted a more modest $221,634.\n \n Add up the totals [$1.8 million before, $4.4 million after] and you get a small peek at the economic and political clout the Clinton White House wielded in shaping public policy and buying national police groups into line. Every federal dollar dumped into law enforcement bank accounts is quite legal. Each has a perfectly \"rational\" explanation. It is merely coincidence that the police groups that scurried to do Clinton' bidding happen to be the same ones that were awarded the lucrative federal grants.\n \n Even though Clinton has been out of office for several years, the liberal influence over these police groups remains strong. Though, thanks to the efforts of LEAA and others, that influence is now declining. Several well known law enforcement groups have reverted to more pro-Second Amendment or at least neutral positions.\n \n \n \n ..

I have not been saying what you may have been hearing.\n\n \n The topic is GUN CONTROL DEBATES. The op in this case cited the thesis that guns are neither good nor bad but depends on the owner. It expanded to who has a right to ownership and whose hands were most able to be the most effective. By default, the court cases and Constitution are included as a test of proof. You have made some wild statements and claims and gone totally off topic while we keep plugging why the individual right to keep and bear arms presents NO GREY AREA and all is well and as it should be in our Republic. You, on the other hand, are out in left field without any 2A rights and Tony Martin got a raw deal there he would have been perfectly justified here for self defense. You don't like the topic and start getting kinky and insulting and get your as* tromped while doing so and try to excuse your behavior by claiming you are merely misunderstood and posting OT on the OP.\n \n That is bull****. Topics expand and contract. You made a case that only police training would qualify and proof was submitted to debunk your claim and even went farther with Supreme Court rulings to back up our claims. You have nothing but a smart mouth, a yob mouth, and you aren't engaged in debate based on points for proof. If you don't get your way, you stomp your foot like a small child and call everyone names to cover your own deficiencies and lack of reasoned debate. You played every card in the deck to gain sympathy but got your hand called and came up with no more chips.\n \n Many of our posts our bounced off of you for the education of people who read this forum searching for truth and answers of questions they may have. Quit trying to be a prima donna and think the world revolves around you and your feelings, especially your gun grabbing government which has made crime blossom out of control with their criminal protection scam. emoticon_xgood",

   "A firearm in mearley an inanimate piece of steel that has no mind of its own and cant function without the intervention of human control over it. So would I be wrong in the assumption than if a good person holds and uses a firearm, most likely it will only be used for good, just as if a bad person holds and controls the firearm it will most likely be used for something bad. So many of the anti-gun proponents basically claim that a firearm controls its owner rather than the other way around. So in essense there is no grey area in this, the person controls the firearm and is responsible for what he/she does with it. I have been around firearms my whole life and I have never once been a mindless ##### who is being contriolled by a firearm. So how is it that some claim that statistics show that people who own firearms are more than likely going to all of the sudden become some crazed lunatic who goes on a mass killing spree just for kicks.

Their fear is not of criminals or those who wish to do harm to them. It is fear that \"scare the bejesus\" out of them of people exercising free speech that they disagree with that frightens them. These people are bearing arms and have no criminal records. Yet they scare the \"bejesus\" out of the pro slavers. Or at least one of them. That they are helpless to restrict or restrain Doc and myself no doubt causes anxiety to say the least. Otherwise why have the \"bejesus\" scared out of one?
