   "Georgians undertake unexampled arrangements for limitation information about Georgia-Ossetia conflict spreading. Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs took decision about non-admission journalists in conflict zone! Well, I think you understand that this is freedom of speech violation; Georgian soldiers use very hard methods. Not only that all journalists who are trying to penetrate at the territory of South Ossetia form Georgian side blocking on the boarder but soldiers seize their equipment right up to mobile phone. \n As I know journalists who tried to enter into South Ossetia in contravention of Georgians frontier posts undergo cruel beating and confiscation of property, Georgian soldiers seizure all and personal documents too. To all appearances Georgian side on the threshold of total preparing to the conflict solving by force is trying to limit journalists' presence in conflict zone for the sake to exclude the possibility of preparing balanced and unbiased materials.",
