   "US forces practically invaded into Ukrainian Crimea. That's usual way of American solving all problems. As a matter of fact those \"exercises\" are excuse of occupation of Crimean territory. And Yushchenko does nothing and keeps silence according to US order.\n The point is that US had covenanted with Turkey secretly that this region will be annexed to Turkey. In its part Turkey pledged itself to support and to pursue in NATO (and in nearest future in EU) pro-American policy. In other words Turkey will be turned into another \"fifth column\" in different international organizations similar with Baltic countries and Poland. Which by the way also will snatch part of Ukrainian territory.\n So there is outrageous occupation of free democratic country just before world community's very eyes. And everybody keeps silence! Soon USA would begin repartition of the whole Earth and again everyone will pretend that he don't see anything!",
