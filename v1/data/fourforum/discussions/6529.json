Because her brain was deprived of oxygen, she lapses into what doctors call a persistent vegetative state. \n 1990 -1992: Her husband, Michael Schiavo, and her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, work together to find therapy that will help her improve, but she remains in a coma-like state. \n \n November 1992: Michael Schiavo successfully sues the physician who treated his wife before her cariac arrest. A jury awards the couple $1 million, with $700,000 of that designated for her perpetual care. \n \n May 1998: Michael Schiavo files a petition to end his wife's life support.\n\n http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBUR26HK5E.html\n \n From the Tampa Tribune.\n \n Please note that it was not until 1998 that Michael Schiavo sought to end his wife's life support.",

   "Bassman, how convenient for you to totally ignore the documented history of how Mr. Schiavo made attempt after attempt to seek help for his wife.\nThe thread seems to have drifted away from the original topic, but... \n \n I've got three serious problems with the Schiavo case.\n \n (1) Michael should not have been allowed to continue as guardian. Spouse as guardian is a reasonable default (it certainly works for me), but it should be open to challenge, for example between the time a couple has filed for divorce and the time the divorce becomes final. Once Michael moved on with his life, moved in with his girlfriend, and started a family with her, there is not a court in the country that would deny Terri a divorce. But Judge George Greer made certain that Terri had no one to speak for her.\n \n (2) Terri's wishes were not clear. Michael brought a couple of his family members in to testify that Terri would not wish to live as a vegetable. Terri's family brought in some of Terri's friends who testified that in the years immediately following Terri's collapse, they had heard Michael say on several occasions that he had no idea what Terri would have wanted. Judge George Greer chose to believe Michael's side of the issue and - on evidence too flimsy to support a $10 fine for jaywalking - sentenced Terri to death. Subsequent court reviews concerned themselves only with crossed t's and dotted i's, but none bothered to consider the facts of the case.\n \n (3) The method of execution was brutal, far beyond the \"cruel and unusual\" forbidden by the Constitution. (And it was an execution; Terri was not terminal, she was an extreme case of severely disabled.) Her mother was even forbidden to offer any comfort to her dying child, not even water for her lips or a sliver of ice to ease her swollen tongue. It's not clear whether Michael and the judge were afraid she would choke and die too soon, or whether they were afraid she wouldn't. If I'm ever in a position like that, I hope someone would grant me the mercy of a hot shot or a bullet in the head.",
