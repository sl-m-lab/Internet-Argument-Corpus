   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n American Peace Activist Found Murdered in Iraq\n Associated Press\n March 11, 2006 8:47 a.m.\n BAGHDAD, Iraq -- The body of the only American among four Christian peace activists kidnapped late last year was found near a west Baghdad railway line with gunshots to his head and chest, Iraqi police said Saturday.\n \n Tom Fox, 54, from Clear Brook, Va., was the fifth American hostage killed in Iraq. There was no immediate word on his fellow captives, a Briton and two Canadians. The U.S. command in Baghdad confirmed that Mr. Fox's body was picked up by American forces on Thursday evening, although it provided no information on the condition.\n \n An Iraqi police patrol was also at the scene, said Falah al-Mohammedawi, an official with the Interior Ministry, which oversees police. He said Mr. Fox was found with his hands tied and gunshot wounds to his head and chest. There were cuts on his body and bruises on his head, Mr. Mohammedawi said.\n \n The FBI verified that the body was that of Mr. Fox, and his family was notified, U.S. State Department spokesman Noel Clay said in Washington. \"The State Department continues to call for the unconditional release of all other hostages\" in Iraq, the spokesman said.\n \n At least four more people -- including an Iraqi journalist and a human rights activist -- were killed in drive-by shootings Saturday, police said.\n \n Amjad Hamid, who was in charge of educational programs at Iraqiya state television, was killed with his driver in Khadra, a dangerous, mostly Sunni west Baghdad neighborhood, the channel said. Waad Jabar, who worked for an Iraqi rights group, was gunned down with his bodyguard in Hawija, 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad, police said.\n \n Gunmen also ambushed a police patrol and an unidentified convoy of SUVs in two parts of west Baghdad, injuring at least three policemen and five civilian bystanders, police said.\n \n U.S. and Iraqi forces, meanwhile, conducted a series of raids in Baghdad and north of the capital, arresting 20 suspected insurgents early Saturday.\n \n Four suspects were detained at a west Baghdad mosque identified by the U.S. military as a possible Al Qaeda in Iraq safe haven. Four others were captured at other sites in the same area, the military said in a statement. The eight were suspected of kidnapping, manufacturing car bombs and financing and supporting terrorists, the statement said.\n \n A dozen more suspects were captured in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's ancestral hometown 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Baghdad, the military said. They were believed to be part of an insurgent cell responsible for the killing of dozens of Narhwan-area residents after the Feb. 22 bombing of a revered Shiite shrine in the central city of Samarra unleashed a torrent of sectarian killing.\n \n (More)",

   "A large weapons cache -- including artillery shells, mortar rounds, anti-tank missiles and homemade bombs -- also was seized during the raid, the military said.\n \n Justice ministry officials will meet Tuesday to discuss the fate of Abu Ghraib prison in west Baghdad after it is handed back to Iraqi authorities, said Deputy Justice Minister Busho Ibrahim Ali. The U.S. military said this week that it plans to start moving out thousands of detainees when a new lockup near the Baghdad airport is completed in two to three months.\n \n Abu Ghraib has become one of the most infamous prisons in the world, known as the site where U.S. soldiers abused some Iraqi detainees and, earlier, for its torture chambers during Saddam Hussein's rule.\n \n \"Personally, I prefer that a residential complex is built on the site in order to wipe out the associations of this name in the minds of the Iraqi people and replace it with something useful for people who don't have houses,\" Mr. Ali said.\n \n The previously unknown Swords of Righteousness Brigades claimed responsibility for kidnapping the four Christian Peacemaker Teams members who disappeared Nov. 26.\n \n Three of them -- Canadians James Loney, 41, and Harmeet Singh Sooden, 32; and Briton Norman Kember, 74 -- were seen in a video dated Feb. 28 that was broadcast Tuesday on Al-Jazeera television. Mr. Fox did not appear in the brief, silent footage.\n \n His body was found near a railway line running through Dawoudi, a mixed Sunni-Shiite area that has been largely shielded from the killing that has raged in other west Baghdad neighborhoods since last month's shrine bombing.\n \n Mr. Fox's Chicago-based group said: \"We mourn the loss of Tom Fox, who combined a lightness of spirit, a firm opposition to all oppression, and the recognition of God in everyone.\"\n \n Christian Peacemaker co-directors Doug Pritchard and Carol Rose said in a statement: \"In response to Tom's passing, we ask that everyone set aside inclinations to vilify or demonize others, no matter what they have done.\"\n \n (More)",

   "At least 250 foreigners have been kidnapped in the nearly three years since U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq, and at least 40 have been killed. In one of the most high-profile cases, Jill Carroll, a freelance writer for The Christian Science Monitor, was kidnapped Jan. 7 in Baghdad. She has appeared in three videotapes delivered by her kidnappers to Arab satellite television stations.\n \n Ms. Carroll's kidnappers initially threatened to kill her unless all female detainees in Iraq are released. They later amended their demands, which have not been made public. The Monitor launched a campaign on Iraqi television stations Wednesday asking Iraqis to help with her release.\n \n The unrelenting violence has complicated already tortuous negotiations for Iraq's first permanent, post-invasion government. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said Friday that he hoped leaders of all Iraqi factions would soon join him some place outside Baghdad to talk round the clock to resolve political feuds -- most visibly over the proposed second-term candidacy of Prime Minister Ibrahim al Jaafari, a member of the Shiite alliance that won the largest number of seats in Dec. 15 parliamentary elections.\n \n The stakes are high for the Americans, who want a strong and functioning central government in place quickly to enable Washington to begin removing some of its 132,000 troops this summer.\n \n Apparently taking up Mr. Khalilzad's call for an extraordinary gathering away from Baghdad's violence and tense political atmosphere, Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani issued an invitation Friday to convene in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish province he runs.\n \n Kamal al Saidi, a Shiite legislator in Mr. Jaafari's Dawa Party, said there was no objection from the bloc to going to Irbil, but \"we want to know the reason behind this invitation.\"\n \n Mr. Barzani's invitation was publicized moments before his fellow Kurd, President Jalal Talabani, issued a decree calling the new parliament into session March 19 for the first time since it was elected. The meeting will set in motion a series of deadlines for forming a government.\n \n \"There is a serious crisis, and if we don't agree on a government of national unity there will be dangerous consequences, a catastrophe. We could have civil war,\" Mr. Talabani said in an interview with al-Arabiya television.\n \n As if to underline Mr. Talabani's concerns, police and the U.S. military reported at least 20 more killings Friday, including a U.S. Marine who died in a car bombing in Fallujah. At least 2,306 members of the U.S. military have died since the beginning of the Iraq war in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count. The figure includes seven military civilians.\n \n Copyright \u00a9 2006 Associated Press",

There are many thousands of other US military personnel that have been seriously wounded. \n \n A week or two ago I heard - although it was just an informal number - that the US casuality figure was around 25,000.\n \n \n Well, at least we found and eliminated those weapons of mass destruction!\n \n Well, at least we've restored peace to Iraq!\n \n Well, at least we've made it so that Iraqis don't need to live in fear!",
