Many pastors on the radio try to say that if you aren't a Christian you will rot in hell, critisizing people for claiming Joe Gibbs is god (new Redskins head coach). I have never had any experience with them telling people not to read, but it doesn't surprise me. Basically people will interpret the bible any way they can to suit their will. It is important to know that not all Christians are like that and some people on this forum have said they don't think they should learn evolution. That part I don't like.\n \n There is plenty of scientific proof that evolution occured. As far as I'm aware it's only presented as a THEORY. Something with evidence but not definately true. Why don't we just ban math because god never did math. While we're at it we should ban computers because they are doing things that god only inteded humans to do. We are able to program artificial intelligence (AI) into them and god didn't want them to have intelligence or he would have made them.\n \n A historical eample:\n \n The Wright brothers, if you were meant to fly, god would have given you wings.\n \n There are many more examples of people trying to use religion, Christianity in particular, to take advantage of other people because they can't prove it false.

   "I was listening to the Focus on the Family with James Dobson radio program yesterday and he called for a boycott of Proctor and Gamble products--specifically Crest toothpaste and Tide laundry soap--because he claims they are publically supporting homosexual rights. http://www.family.org/cforum/fnif/news/a0033736.cfm\n \n This is a new twist on the demonization of P&G in which the company has shown in court to be fostered and foisted upon consumers by Amway Products, a company that makes various competing products. For years P&G has fought allegations that they are devil worshippers and their company logo, the Moon and Stars, is a demonic symbol. P&G was able to submit as evidence a transcript of top Amway officials discussing, via their internal communication system, a new push to spread the vicious, tired old lie again:\n \n \n Exhibit F, transcript from Amvox communication system: ... Remote Message from Jeff Musgrove \"Randy, this is Jeff -- hey you may have already received a message like this, uh, before but, um, figured I'd send it to you just in case you haven't. It's, uh, pretty interesting. Anyway talk to you later. Love you man. Bye, bye.\" Wednesday, 10:25 P.M. Remote Message from Roger and Susan Patton \"Hey Jeff, it's Roger Patton. \"I wanna run something by you real quick that I think you will find pretty interesting. Just talking to a guy the other night about this very subject and it just so happens that a guy brings information in and lays it on my desk this morning, so here it goes. \"It says the president of Procter & Gamble appeared on the Phil Donahue Show on March 1, '95. He announced that due to the openness of our society, he was coming out of the closet about his association with the church of satan. He stated that a large portion of the profits from the Procter & Gamble products go to support his satanic church. When asked by Donahue if stating this on television would hurt his business, his reply was 'there are not enough Christians in the United States to make a difference.' And below it has a list of the Procter & Gamble products which I'll read: \"Duncan Hines, Folgers, Gleem, Bold, Crisco, Jif, Bounce, Puritan, Always, Cascade, Secret, Attends Under Garments, Cheer, Sure, Oil of Olay, Joy, Head N Shoulders, Wondra, Comet, Pert, Camay, Dawn, Prell, Coast, Downy, Vidal Sassoon, Ivory, Gain, Luvs, Lava, Mr. Clean, Pampers, Safeguard, Oxydol, Pepto Bismol, Charmin, Spic N Span, Scope, Puffs, Tide, Crest, Zest, Top Job \"It says if you are not sure about a product, look for the symbol of the ram's horn that will appear on each product beginning in April. The ram's horn will form the 666 which is known as satan's number. I'll tell you it really makes you count your blessings to have available to all of us a business that allows us to buy all the products that we want from our own shelf and I guess my real question is, if people aren't being loyal to themselves and buying from their own business, then whose business are they supporting and who are they buying from. Love you. Talk to you later. Bye.\" \n \n http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/dst/Amway/AUS/p&g.htm\n \n Then Amway, in stark contrast, promotes itself as a paradigm of Christian virtue with its motto, \"God, family, country.\"\n \n I have had my fill of this conspiracy. Instead of boycotting P&G products and writing to P&G officials to protest as James Dobson is urging his listeners, I'll stock up on the products.\n \n Here's my question: Does it bother you, as a Christian, to be associated with James Dobson?",

   "\"...Faiths which intentionally keep their followers ignorant and stupid of reality just makes me shake my head...\"\n \n So you wrote, Justine, and, though we stand on opposite sides of the fence re: identifying ourselves as Christians, I agree with you willingly.\n \n I am reminded of Romans 12:2, which urges: \"be transformed by the renewing of your mind...\" I read this as offering several meanings, several lessons at once, including...that one should expect that, on becoming Christian and proceeding in that walk, one continues (or should continue) to have an active intellectual life...and that the development, the exercise of the mind is properly, prescribedly, part of the Christian life. A Christian, say I, should seek actively to develop (among other faculties) the mind, because not to do so is to sneer at one of God's gifts.\n \n Hearing a senior official of my local church (Evangelical Methodist) proudly announce that he does not read (outside the Bible) left me somewhere between scratching my head and constraining a certain fury. I'd started teaching Sunday school that day with a preliminary premise I'd thought would go quickly acknowledged with an \"of course.\" The Christian, I said, should be encouraged in intellectual development, and should in particular be \"encouraged to read widely and well.\" I dashed that off and started to move to the next and more germane premise in whatever argument I was erecting. The elder in question made one of those \"Now just a minute...\" gestures. To my considerable amazement, he actually asserted that he didn't \"see any value\" in a Christian's reading, and that he felt the Christian should NOT be encouraged to read as I'd suggested.\n \n I had nearly no reply. What, Justine, does one say in reply to such puerility?\n \n The same man, predictably a Young Earth Creationist, had massively misconceived what evolution is. Like many in his camp, he'd mistaken the term 'evolution' to encompass the Big Bang theory of cosmology, theories of the origin of life, etc. He quickly trotted out \"Nobody's seen a duck turn into a dog\" and \"So you think I'm descended from a chimpanzee?\" and dangled these before me like rotting radishes. But he later asked me, genuinely, 'So what IS evolution? How does it work?'\n \n So I ask again, what does one reply? My first reaction was to think of saying, \"Well, here's this book...\" Damn! He won't read. Thinks reading shouldn't be encouraged. Indeed, would, given the choice, encourage the Christian NOT to read. This in turn quite entails encouraging the Christian NOT to acquire a postsecondary education. Here, therefore, Justine, IS your case of the church (as represented by one elder) seeking consciously to keep members in ignorance.\n \n The God I envision would say: Get out there. Do science. Do criticism. Do art. Conceive. Collect evidence. Construct theories. Use your faculty of Reason. Apply logic, God would say--I invented it for you guys to have.\n \n The world constructed by the elder I describe above seems to me a small and brittle place. A world just a week older than we are. Therefore, a world not so frighteningly stretched through time. A world controllable in history. A world that reminds me of the plastic dioramas adolescent boys build around the plastic model kits they put together and paint. God, too, seems smaller. More man-shaped. More like you and me. More knowable, describable, containable, predictable. A world in which doubt is banished because intellect and intellectual pursuits are banished to the margins, if not outside the kingdom altogether.\n \n I'm never embarrassed by Christian faith. I am, however, acutely embarrassed when Christian elders, preachers, teachers, evangelists and authors trot out rent and threadbare arguments, rash pronouncements, and lunatic leaps of misbegotten reason. When I was, up till middle age, a fairly militant atheist, I thought many of the pronouncements of 'conservative Christians' quite silly. Having squeezed my fat little buns through the eye of the needle, by the grace of God, I find myself not one whit less repelled by such rhetorical scat, and must indeed now blush in the background as I hear it repeated.\n \n Embarrassed by my faith? Never. But, Lord, I am appalled by our religion.\n \n My ex-wife and I asked for years: Where DO intelligent, well read evangelical Christians go to church in (our home town) Memphis? Bless her heart, she gave up looking. As for me, I carry on at my own wee church, assigned by default to the role of 'half-fast' resident radical.\n \n Would love to hear anyone's thoughts. Bless you!",

(In fact, I'm obtuse enough I don't quite grasp what it is you want me to do. Apologies.)\n \n Jan Crouch--speaking of the 'character,' not the woman per se--is a kind of hyperbolized Preacher's Wife. First, she is ever subordinate to Paul, but has her own queenly presence. Second, she cries and quakes her voice at the drop of a hat, representing the perpetual readiness of emotion that the Christian Woman is supposed to have; this is a symbolic and prescriptive instantiation, as I read it, of the belief, popular among conservative Christians, that women are inherently \"more emotional\" than men. Third, she is a hyperbolized superbabe--voluptuous, in a Jane Russell sense, exaggeratedly huge hair, quasi-royal (and oddly 'goth') attire, and her makeup is, of course, a kind of mask. I get the impression Jan Crouch is in fact physically much smaller than the aggrandizing volume of hair, clothing, etc. implies., but is 'visually redesigned' to be more imposing.\n \n The visual rhetoric of their TBN stage is interesting. When Jan and Paul are about together, there often has been a pair of chairs, curiously throne-like, to seat them. Often, the stages filmed have exhibited astonishing opulence (though by no means a tasteful one) in decor. In some times past, amid all the ormolu and gilt, I've been interested to note a lack of explicitly Christian emblems of the typical sort. It's as if they've made visible physical 'richness' a kind of subliminal emblem for the faith. (A matter quite reflective also of Hinn.)\n \n It's all a strange--and seemingly highly deliberated--mode of re-presenting the faith. Curious images indeed.\n \n And not an image, I suspect, that the Big Guy had in mind...\n \n Bradley",

   "Max, I barely know how to work this discussion group thing--first time I'v e been on one. Sorry I don't know how to check the link, as you ask. (In fact, I'm obtuse enough I don't quite grasp what it is you want me to do. Apologies.)\n\n \n In your reply to my question on whether you were speaking of microevolution or macroevolution you wrote, \"Yes, I most certainly am.\" I take that to mean you were speaking about both. But in your post there was a web link that I thought you put there to connect me somewhere else and further explain your answer. Perhaps that link was put in there inadvertently when you posted??",

   "One of the questions I've had since this thread appeared is this:\n \n Why should we not think Christian radio perfectly mirrors the masses of Christianity?\n\n \n On this topic, I always wonder what people are thinking when they say that evolution is wrong, god created the world in seven days, and so on.\n \n Most of these people have no idea what evolution actually is, and it has been proven many times over again. Evolution is basically when people live in an environment (or animals) they adapt and change to be fit for survival. If some people adapt different things than the one that is able to survive the best lives on and the other will presumably die out. I would like to see where evolution and creationism aren't able to be both true. What if god created the world and evolution with it. Monkeys and chimpanzees are very similar to us in genetic structure and it's possible some changed and turned into humans (over a long period of time, a couple million years) and now we're here. It reminds me of a Calvin and Hobbes comic where Calvin says that since he's a math atheist he should be excused from math. Evolution has been proven. And as I said, where does the bible contradict evolution? Many people think that evolution is evil because it's against the bible, not that they actually know what evolution is, because they don't read (or just won't read an evil book).",

   "I have read and been told that much of evolutionary theory is factual. I have also been told that much of it is flawed. At any rate, here are some philosophical reflections on it:\n \n \"If there was ever a moment when man was only an animal, we can if we choose make a fancy picture of his career transferred to some other animal. An entertaining fanasia might be made in which elephants built in elephantine architecture, with towers and turrets like tusks and trunks, cities beyond the scale of any colossus. A pleasant fable might be conceived in which a cow had developed a costume, and put on four boots and two pairs of trousers. We could imagine a Supermonkey more marvellous than any Superman, a quadrumanous creature carving and painting with his hands and cooking and carpentering with his feet. But if we are considering what did happen, we shall certainly decide that man has distanced everything else with a distance like that of the astronomical spaces and a speed like that of the still thunderbolt of the light.\"\n \n \"It is the simple truth that man does differ from the brutes in kind and not in degree; and the proof of it is here; that it sounds like a truism to say that the most primitive man drew a picture of a monkey and that it sounds like a joke to say that the most intelligent monkey drew a picture of a man. Something of division and disproportion has appeared; and it is unique. Art is the signature of man.\" \n \n \"When all is said, the main fact that the record of the reindeer men attests, along with all other records, is that the reindeer man could draw and the reindeer could not. If the reindeer man was as much an animal as the reindeer, it was all the more extraordinary that he could do what all other animals could not. If he was an ordinary product of biological growth, like any other beast or bird, then it is all the more extraordinary that he was not in the least like any other beast or bird. He seems rather more supernatural as a natural product than as a supernatural one...For in the plain matter like the pictures there is in fact not a trace of any such development or degree. Monkeys did not begin pictures and men finish them; Pithecanthropus did not draw a reindeer badly and Homo Sapiens draw it well. The higher animals did not draw better and better portraits; the dog did not paint better in his best period than in his early bad manner as a jackal; the wild horse was not an Impressionist and the race-horse a Post-Impressionist. All we can say of this notion of reproducing things in shadow or representative shape is that it exists nowhere in nature except in man; and that we cannot even talk about it without treating man as something separate from nature. In other words, every sane sort of history must begin with man as man, a thing standing absolute and alone.\"\n \n \"In the land lit by that neighboring star, whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things, motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave like a race of demons...It is customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.\"\n \n \"The more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.\n The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of being a stranger here on the earth...He has much more of the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter...Alone among the animals he feels...the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular instinct called religion.\"\n \n \"Suppose that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it as a fearful wild-fowl indeed...That bird would tell the augurs, not of something that would happen, but of something that had happened. That something would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind  could conceivable have foreseen it...There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"\n \n THE EVERLASTING MAN  by G.K. CHESTERTON",

   "Billsco, I tend to thinks that Christian radio DOES mirror American Christianity, at least to the extent that Christian radio mirrors that segment of American Christianity WHICH SUPPORTS CHRISTIAN RADIO.\n \n This frightens me. There are surely intelligent commentators out there. R.C. Sproul and his 'Renewing Your Mind' program surely count. I often disagree with R.C., but he generally seems quite intelligently argued. He engages.\n \n Others try. Hank H's 'Bible Answer Man' seems to try. But the whole trope of the show, and its implication \"I have all the answers,' grates. Note: It's not the \"Bible QUESTION man.\" It's ANSWER man. \"Here's the correct interpretation--now go away and believe it\" seems too often the mode of 'help' given. Papal infallibility replaced by Hankian infallibillity.\n \n Other radio shows appall me. Examples...\n \n ...the preacher who, on a major national show, is applauded for not permitting women to wear pants in his church\n \n ...John Hagee's brittle, hyper-Republican reactionism: \"Get the US out of the UN and the UN out of the US\"--for fear, one gathers, that the UN is the thin edge of the \"world government\" wedge, and its Secretary General (or one of his ilk) the antichrist\n \n ...the preacher who pronounces it \"unseemly\" and \"unbiblical\" for a woman to work after marriage\n \n ...those several radio-preachers who, beyond arguing against evolutionary theory, link it with satanism, communism, feminism, the \"homosexual agenda,\" child molestation, drink and drugs, bestiality, and vaguely specified Dark Forces poised to seize our women, our children, our very nation, yadda yadda...\n \n Had I not an interest in studying the rhetoric of the Christian right as represented on the radio, I couldn't stand to listen to certain of its more vocal citizens. Were only the programs themselves the object of interest, they'd simply be, variously...funny...laughable...ridiculous...absurd...a swell source of 'howlers' for logic courses...and pitiable.\n \n Sadly, however, in an America now experiencing an observable decline in literacy and critical skills, an America in which repetition is replacing reason as the principal persuasive tool, the rhetoric of the Christian right seems to be taking hold, rather in the quiet manner of a very slow-setting cement.\n \n B\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne of the questions I've had since this thread appeared is this:\n \n Why should we not think Christian radio perfectly mirrors the masses of Christianity?\n",

   "Maximus about your post.\n \n I'm not saying I totally agree or even know exactly the theory of evolution, but the main point is that some monkeys, apes, whatever, became intelligent, it helped them survive, so they stayed that way. (of course this took maybe millions of years gradually) I'm just wondering why we think we're the only intelligent species on the planet. We say because we have our own language yet other animals talk to each other. Birds chirp, dogs bark etc. We don't know if it's intelligent conversation or random yapping. (I'm sure if they are intelligent they wonder why we make these weird sounds out of our mouths or wonder if it's a language or not :) ) anyway we also say we act a lot smarter, it seems that many animals could be intelligent and just faking it. We say despite our best efforts, we can't figure out a pattern in their language. What if that's intentional? They won't say real words while we're studying them. I heard laboratory rats are getting smarter over time when we test them. They're gettin stronger and smarter. Think about some of the species.\n \n Dogs: Doesn't take a genius to figure that out. We give them food, shelter, time to play, they don't have to do anything. Why admit we're intelligent when we get all that for free? To quote a movie trailer for \"Good Boy\" \"They may think they're in charge, but you don't see us picking up their poop. Same with cats and other pets.\n \n Bees: They may die when they sting us, but as a species they really are acting smart if they want to become dominant. They know if we think they're intelligent we'll actually organize and we would win. Instead they use guerrila tactics and we don't respond other than to fear them. We always think they're going to sting us. Slowly they're building up a fear of them in us and one day they'll just come out of their hives and take over the world. Same with wasps, hornets etc.\n \n Lions, tigers, other endangered predators: They are reproducing in the jungle somewhere where we can't see. They pretend they are endangered so we'll leave them alone and soon they'll have enough of their species to take us by force.\n \n Mice, rats, other rodents: They go into holes and we don't worry because when they're there at least they aren't around us. Meanwhile they are planning to take over the world in the mouse holes. They have to act dumb so they pretend to really like cheese so they always send the mouse they don't like out to die in the trap and make us think they got the \"one\" mouse in the house and they're sure to be careful not to be seen again.\n \n Fish, ocean animals: They are deep in the ocean where we don't go very often and are quickly reproducing. They have scientists trying to figure out how to build a mask that can add hydrogen to the oxygen above water and they can come out of the water and take us one by one, because no one will believe there's a walking fish until they see it. Then it's too late. The fish probably also gave us all the ways to manipulate pictures on a computer so people won't believe us even if we got a tape of it.\n \n \n While we are the dominant species, if they were truly intelligent, they wouldn't let us know they were intelligent. The pets are probably trained to eavesdrop because it would be easy for them to pick up our language over the years. We had problems with the guerrila tactics in Vietnam, we're having problems in Iraq, and we would have problems with those tactics from one other species. Just hope they don't all join together and fight us, then we'd be dead.\n \n \n OK, this isn't totally serious, but I heard on the news that a monkey died and the other monkeys waited until another car of the same color went by and threw nuts at it supposedly thinking it was the car that killed the other monkey.\n \n Of course they were probably showing a small step just to make us think they were a little intelligent so they wouldn't be so suspicios of them, they still were so stupid they got the wrong car.\n \n And I do think it's possible that other animals have languages, but that they're intentionally hiding them? or they're all plotting to take over the world? I really don't believe that. :)",
