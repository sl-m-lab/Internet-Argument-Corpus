   "I don't normally post non-mainstream news sources, but I saw a link to this and found it interesting. \n \n (Los Angeles, California) For the first time the leading candidates for the presidency will hold a televised debate devoted solely to LGBT issues. The one-hour event will be held on August 9 and broadcast on gay network LOGO at 9:00 pm ET (6:00 pm ET) and through live streaming video at LOGOonline.com. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have confirmed they will participate. Several other Democratic candidates also may join the debate. The debate will be conducted with a live audience in Los Angeles. On the panel questioning the two Democrats will be Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese and singer Melissa Etheridge. The debate was put together by LOGO and HRC.\n \n \"In the 2008 presidential election, issues of concern to the LGBT community have already been at the forefront of the national conversation,\" said Solmonese. \"From the repeal of \"Don't ask, Don't Tell\" to the recent signing of a civil unions bill in New Hampshire, there is no doubt that voters will demand answers to important questions affecting our community.\"\n \n The panelists in a statement said they plan to cover a range of issues including relationship recognition, marriage equality, workplace fairness, the military, hate crimes, HIV/AIDS and other important issues. The LGBT vote is considered a decisive electoral force and according to exit poll data make up approximately 4 percent of the voting population. Los Angeles was chosen as the site for the event because of the state's early primary election, on February 5th, 2008. \n \n \"We're honored to give the presidential candidates an historic opportunity to share their views directly with the LGBT audience,\" Brian Graden, President, Entertainment, MTV Networks Music Group, and President, LOGO said in a statement. \"This forum continues MTV Networks' tradition of engaging vital niche audiences with voting and the electoral process.\"\n \n In addition to questioning by Solmonese and Etheridge people will be able to pose their own questions through LOGOonline.com and HRC.org. LOGO is the owner of 365Gay.com. http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/07/071007debate.htm",

   "I think this is great. The LGBT population may make up only 4% of the voting population, but there is a larger percentage when you consider the family and friends and supporters of LGBT's. Participating would be a smart move.\n\n \n I think the fact that gays only make up 5% or so of the population makes supporting, or not, gay rights a particularly telling trait. Gays and their supporters simply don't make up a particularly strong block. Ignoring gays is really unlikely to cost anyone a national election. After all, it's not like all gays vote the same way, or base their votes strictly on their sexuality. Proof: there are gay republicans. Taking a strong stand in favor of gay rights is to speak out for protection of the underrepresented in general, it makes a statement that the candidate in question believes in protecting the rights of the individual, any individual. Likewise, anyone who speaks out against gay rights is pretty much saying that they are willing to sacrifice an unpopular segment of the population if they think it will be to their political advantage.",

What is it exactly they do? I see no progress on the national level. I have been pi$$ed off at them ever since they remained cozy with Billy-boy after he agreed to don't ask/don't tell and SIGNED DOMA. They seem very good at black tie dinner with celebs, but that's about it. \n \n I have chosen to keep my donations local since. Until the other night, when this cute guy from HRC showed up at my door. I kinda melted and re-upped my membership. (I am a whore.)\n \n Seriously, have you (or anyone else) any encouraging words about them. I do like the logo.",

   "I really have respect for this man and hope the HRC reconsiders what I believe to be a mistake. He points out exactly what I said in an earlier post that his presence would make the other candidates have to speak more candid or more open to their positions. \n \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sen-mike-gravel/why-i-wasnt-invited-to-t_b_55931.html\n \n Why I Wasn't Invited to the Debate on Gay Issues\n \n Yesterday the Human Rights Campaign announced that it will not invite me to the first-ever presidential debate on gay issues because I didn't raise enough money. To say that I'm shocked is an understatement. I can confidently say, of all presidential candidates, I've been the most outspoken advocate for gay rights. \n \n My record speaks for itself. \n \n On Gay Marriage:\n \n This week The Advocate praised me for being \"unabashedly pro-gay marriage.\" But apparently this didn't matter to HRC, which invited Clinton, Edwards and Obama who all join George Bush in opposing marriage equality. \n \n On Don't Ask:\n \n Not only do I want to repeal Don't Ask, I wrote a Huffington Post lambasting Clinton for her refusal to call Don't Ask a mistake. No other candidate has dared to take on Hillary for her repeated whitewashing of Don't Ask as benign \"transition policy.\" Let's be clear, Don't Ask was a cowardly political calculation that reaffirmed the military's unjust discharge policies. I have also challenged my fellow candidates to join me in publicly pledging that whoever gets elected, he or she will issue an apology on behalf of the federal government to the 100,000 gays and lesbians who were discharged by the military for their sexual orientation. No other candidate has joined me in that pledge. \n \n On General Peter Pace:\n \n Obama, Edwards and Clinton at first refused to denounce General Pace's statement that homosexuality is immoral. I immediately called for that homophobe's resignation. Hillary had to be repeatedly pressed before she finally conceded that homosexuality wasn't immoral. I told the press \"love between a man and a man or a woman and a woman is beautiful.\" \n \n On Gay Pride:\n \n I proudly joined this year's San Francisco gay pride march and was the first major party presidential candidate to participate in a pride parade. \n \n Why am I so committed to gay rights? \n \n Fighting for a hated minority is a pretty dumb way to get elected president. And obviously it hasn't helped with my fundraising. But I want to live in a country where there are no second-class citizens. As long as our nation deprives gays and lesbians of basic rights, including marriage, we have not fulfilled the promise of the Declaration of Independence guaranteeing life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all Americans. \n \n So why wasn't I invited to the gay rights forum?\n \n According to a HRC spokesperson, I didn't raise enough money and therefore my candidacy did not meet their standard of \"viability.\" But that's strange -- CNN, PBS, NBC and the NAACP invited me to their debates without evaluating my financial viability. Ironically. I think the real reason why HRC didn't invite me is that I'm too vocal in my advocacy of gay rights. None of the top tier candidates would have been comfortable facing an opponent who consistently points out their refusal to embrace true equality for gays and lesbians. HRC simply bowed to the star factor. It's just a shame that this travesty was perpetrated in the name of the LGBT community. (Dennis, I'll be rootin' for ya.) \n \n Yesterday I got an email from a grateful supporter who worried that this snub would make me bitter and less committed to gay rights. Far from it, in fact I'm going to rejoin the battle with even more determination to advance the gay rights discussion during the other debates. So stay tuned, because this old soldier has only just begun to fight.",

So what about those that might actually get the nomination? Those are the people who need to be heard from.\n\n \n \n But Gravel will put Hilary, Barack et al.'s feet to the fire when it comes to gay political issues. HRC would prefer to suck up to the \"stars\" as Robbie said. They don't want a vigorous political debate, because the those who are more electable will have to actually make a stand. They will have to defend their indefensible positions. \n \n As in all \"debates\" these days, debate is not want is wanted. The candidates want air time. I suspect that the front runners wouldn't have shown if they knew Gravel was going to be there. I am going to write HRC and complain. \n \n I actually sat next to a state Representative at a gay fund raiser dinner once. I asked her why she had voted for some anti-gay legislature the previous year. She told me that if she had not, she may have not been re-elected and would not be in office to help her gay constituents.",
