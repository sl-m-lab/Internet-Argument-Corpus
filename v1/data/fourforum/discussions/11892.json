   "I did not write the following, but it sums up my motivations so well I decided to post it. It is a magnificent op ed piece.\n \n \n \n \n \n I dearly hope that Barack Obama is elected president. A McCain/Palin victory would be disastrous for our country and for the world. In a time that desperately needs wise leadership, I believe Obama has the potential to be one of the best US presidents in recent history (admittedly not a real high standard). But the operative word here is potential. I believe Obama also has the potential to be a colossal disappointment, just as the Clinton presidency deeply disappointed progressives who had high hopes coming out of 12 bleak years of Reagan/Bush I leadership.\n \n \n Which potential will be realized? It depends on the popular pressure Obama receives to do the right thing. We know he is under tremendous pressure by powerful private interests to do all the wrong things.\n We've seen how this pressure has pushed him toward more conservative positions on many important issues: from his support for FISA/telecom immunity, reauthorizing the Patriot Act, \"clean coal,\" and nuclear power, to his hawkishness around Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Russia, to his choice of advisors, many of whom represent anything but the \"change\" he claims to bring to Washington, DC.\n \n \n The rest of us need to push back. One way to promote a more progressive Obama administration is to show our support for a truly progressive, uncompromised candidate when we vote for president--like Cynthia McKinney or Ralph Nader--so long as that vote does not jeopardize an Obama victory.\n \n \n Here in Washington state, we can do that. (Yes we can!) Thanks to the undemocratic Electoral College--which makes our individual votes almost meaningless--combined with the comfortable margin of advantage Obama enjoys in the state (10% as of this writing), Washington voters can feel free to vote for the candidate we most agree with, without fear it will help elect McCain.\n \n \n Is voting your conscience \"unrealistic,\" as some would say? Let's be realistic about the Electoral College. As most of us know (but seem to forget), the only votes that count toward electing a president are Electoral College votes, which are awarded on a winner-take-all basis for each state. It doesn't matter whether Obama wins the state's popular vote by 100 votes or a million, he still gets exactly the same number of our electoral votes (all 11 of them). If your vote only widens Obama's margin of victory in our state, it contributes absolutely nothing to his chances of winning the presidency. Zero.\n \n \n ------\n \n My words: In the choice between Nader and McKinney, I support McKinney. Two reasons: She had the courage to speak truth to power while she was in Congress (e.g., she was the first to call for Bush's impeachment); and now she is working to build the Green Party with her campaign, rather than simply running as an independent. I may not agree with her on everything, but a vote for McKinney is a vote for strengthening the Green Party, which I believe our country needs.\n \n \n Some say you're wasting your vote if you vote for a candidate unlikely to win; I say that the real waste is to cast a compromised vote when that vote does absolutely nothing to help Obama reach the White House.\n Don't waste your vote: Vote your conscience. Vote for single-payer, universal health care. Vote for substantial cuts in the military budget. Vote for a truly green energy policy.
