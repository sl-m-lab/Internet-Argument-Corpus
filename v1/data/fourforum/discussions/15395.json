You are also right that these things create inefficiencies, specifically hold ups in production and trade.\n \n These however are not matters of rights but to put it simply the foolish acts of those who don't know what their doing or worse yet, do; but think they will come out on top anyway.\n \n A monopoly still can't force buyers to buy, and so even if they can stop trade they can't immoralize it if it does happen.\n \n There is simply objective way to tell if a price is artificially high or if the 'conspiracy' is merely reflecting real values, nor would it matter if there was because there is nothing you could morally do about it.\n \n For instance how could you tell the difference between cars of a certain type costing $5 to build a piece and costing $2 but all the builders selling at $5?\n \n Or how could you tell the difference between an employer taking advantage of a high supply of workers by paying them wages lower than their worth and a group of workers paid a fair wage who are just trying to bully the employer into paying them an unfairly large amount?\n \n If someone can build a car for $3 they will shatter the monopoly, just like if some worker thinks the low wage is fair they can shatter the monopoly of a union. We can't say 'oh well that would happen anyway so we are just going to make it happen'.\n \n If all the workers refuse a low wage, and there really aren't any others; you are going to need their agreement to trade regardless of what they are trying to 'pull'.\n \n If a certain company really is the only one that can produce something, they can set the price as high as anyone will pay because they represent the entire worth of that market.\n \n As far as claiming rare resources, you know I draw a line between property and claims. Further such cases are exceedingly more rare than people would have you believe. Let's just say hypothetically that one organization controls all of one resource, they still can't sell it at a higher price than the buyer thinks it's worth, so they are still bound by the free market; just not by the extreme precision of competition.\n \n Finally you put a conditional 'if monopolies...'

You are also right that these things create inefficiencies, specifically hold ups in production and trade.\n\n More than that, they distort the price system, the key component of Capitalism. Without with information wouldn't moving throughout the system, making it worthless. This distortion in information causes loss in profits and effectiveness in other companies, even if they are not directly involved in the business. This also creates selected shortages in certain areas. \n \n \nThese however are not matters of rights but to put it simply the foolish acts of those who don't know what their doing or worse yet, do; but think they will come out on top anyway.\n\n \n My premise is simple. The loss of money, jobs, and sometimes even ruined lives is a violation of their rights. If it is accepted that governments ruining economies with interference is wrong, then it accepted that any private citizen, or group of citizens, do so it is also wrong. A group of private citizens is essentially the basis of government, therefore their interference is exactly the same as private interference.\n \n \nA monopoly still can't force buyers to buy, and so even if they can stop trade they can't immortalize it if it does happen.\n\n \n Yes, Monopolies can force people to buy, in a literal sense, food is needed for life, you have \"choice\" about it. You could choose not to buy the high priced food, but that wouldn't make it right.\n \n \nThere is simply objective way to tell if a price is artificially high or if the 'conspiracy' is merely reflecting real values....\n\n \n I don't quite understand what your saying here. Are you saying there is, and if so, how? If not then why?\n \nFor instance how could you tell the difference between cars of a certain type costing $5 to build a piece and costing $2 but all the builders selling at $5?\n\n Price setting is relatively easy to spot. Prices rise suddenly, investigation into supplies turn up no evidence of shortages. The new price is the same across the board for all products of the given monopoly.\n \n \nOr how could you tell the difference between an employer taking advantage of a high supply of workers by paying them wages lower than their worth and a group of workers paid a fair wage who are just trying to bully the employer into paying them an unfairly large amount?\n\n \n Refer to last response. The same symptoms will be present with the Union. Although it is far more likely they'll make it public.\n \n \nIf someone can build a car for $3 they will shatter the monopoly, just like if some worker thinks the low wage is fair they can shatter the monopoly of a union. We can't say 'oh well that would happen anyway so we are just going to make it happen'.\n\n \n Although, monopolies are hard to maintain, they are not impossible. Especially when the resource is limited, like workers in a small town in Minnesota, or Diamonds that look like John Locke... Even if the opportunity to break a monopoly exists, it might not be taken. Sometimes even though you could beat the high price, you want to make more money, so you join the monopoly instead.\n \nIf all the workers refuse a low wage, and there really aren't any others; you are going to need their agreement to trade regardless of what they are trying to 'pull'.\n\n \n \n This is like saying if all governments refuse to stop driving interest rates down in a Keynesian manner, they we might as well accept it.\n \nAs far as claiming rare resources, you know I draw a line between property and claims.

Let's just say hypothetically that one organization controls all of one resource, they still can't sell it at a higher price than the buyer thinks it's worth, so they are still bound by the free market; just not by the extreme precision of competition..\n\n If its essential, or very near essential to human civilization, then the buyer will pay what ever it priced at because, technically, its worth infinity to the person. Say food, water, cloths. All these things, in a very scarce environment can make them extremely valuable. So they are not bound sufficiently.\n \n \nlower than their worth.... real values..\n\n This indicates that you think items, or work, in a capitalist society has any set value. That the market fluctuates up and down around it. This is just not true. The value of everything, jobs, food, pizzas, are determined by what people think its worth. Just because someone values something at a certain level, doesn't mean that they wouldn't pay more to get it. \n \nIts not only about wages.\n Its about health and safety. Its about unions lobbying politicians.\n Its about workers 'knowing ' their rights too.\n Unions should have many benefits for the worker.\n Anyway what is wrong with collective negotiating the price of labour?\n The company does not have to employ union labour\n\n There are health risks in the public school system? I just explained it is a form of price setting, that not only removes competition, but hurts the economy. Sometimes the company does. Nowadays, jobs are moving overseas because the majority of our work force is unionized, so the Chinese break the monopoly, and companies move their business elsewhere. Eventually, the unions will have no more customers.\n \nWhat I am saying is that Unions are not just for wage bargaining.\n If you are implying that the risk of the job are reflected in the wage then they are not .

This distortion in information causes loss in profits and effectiveness in other companies, even if they are not directly involved in the business. This also creates selected shortages in certain areas. \n\n Ok, big market inefficiencies? :p\n \n \nMy premise is simple. The loss of money, jobs, and sometimes even ruined lives is a violation of their rights.\n\n Unfortunately for that premise people don't have a right to money, jobs; or even a nice life.\n \n \nIf it is accepted that governments ruining economies with interference is wrong, then it accepted that any private citizen, or group of citizens, do so it is also wrong. A group of private citizens is essentially the basis of government, therefore their interference is exactly the same as private interference.\n\n It isn't 'wrong' to ruin a economy, it is wrong to violate rights; violating rights on a large scale ruins many things but don't confuse cause and effect. Governments, companies, and individuals all make mistakes due in no small part to the fact that the former two are composed of the later.\n \n \nYes, Monopolies can force people to buy, in a literal sense, food is needed for life, you have \"choice\" about it. You could choose not to buy the high priced food, but that wouldn't make it right.\n\n No monopolies cannot force people to buy. Reality forces them to eat; it also forces the fact that you need to grow or hunt to get that food. The only place buying was inserted into this chain is that you are paying for the hunting or farming of someone else in exchange for some wealth you possess. You would have to start stretching the imagination to think of farmers as buying the food from the planet with the work they put into their farm. You are essentially saying that by the act of farming and not giving people the food for free you are forcing them to buy it.\n \n \nI don't quite understand what your saying here. Are you saying there is, and if so, how? If not then why?\n\n I meant to say there is no simple way. The reason why should be obvious, since every value judgement even by experts is more or less subjective you can't possibly expect to know objectively how much something is worth nor would you have a right to overrule the buyer or seller on the matter. \n \n \nPrice setting is relatively easy to spot. Prices rise suddenly, investigation into supplies turn up no evidence of shortages. The new price is the same across the board for all products of the given monopoly.\n\n Then what are you going to do? Order the companies to stop conspiring? Has it occurred to you that every company is a conspiracy of individuals selling their net product at a single price no competition among them?\n \n \nRefer to last response. The same symptoms will be present with the Union. Although it is far more likely they'll make it public.\n\n You mean the symptoms of a price change and a reported stasis of assets.\n \n \nAlthough, monopolies are hard to maintain, they are not impossible. Especially when the resource is limited, like workers in a small town in Minnesota, or Diamonds that look like John Locke... Even if the opportunity to break a monopoly exists, it might not be taken. Sometimes even though you could beat the high price, you want to make more money, so you join the monopoly instead.\n\n ok...\n \n \nThis is like saying if all governments refuse to stop driving interest rates down in a Keynesian manner, they we might as well accept it.\n\n Provided all governments are doing it morally then yes it is like saying that.\n \n \nIf its essential, or very near essential to human civilization, then the buyer will pay what ever it priced at because, technically, its worth infinity to the person. Say food, water, cloths. All these things, in a very scarce environment can make them extremely valuable.\n\n True, what of it?\n \n \nSo they are not bound sufficiently.\n\n Why? What standard of 'sufficiently bound' are we using here?\n \n \nThis indicates that you think items, or work, in a capitalist society has any set value. That the market fluctuates up and down around it. This is just not true. The value of everything, jobs, food, pizzas, are determined by what people think its worth. Just because someone values something at a certain level, doesn't mean that they wouldn't pay more to get it. \n\n I do think things have 'set values' and of course I know that is based on my estimation of the values based on my knowledge and my interests. If someone will pay for something they think it is worth the money they paid, there is no way around that fact.\n \n When I referred to real values I meant that the workers might not think their work is worth more but given the opportunity to take more they do.\n \n So if things are worth what people think it's worth, why isn't labor what labor unions think it's worth?\n \n \nIf that is not possible, then it is a much more complicated issue.\n\n No it isn't, it's supremely simple. If there is only one place to work and it's XXXX; you have the choice between working in a hell hole or not working, and the company is responsible for the working choice but no others.",
