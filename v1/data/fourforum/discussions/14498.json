   "Beneficial? Absolutely not! That's like asking is a reduction in the number of auto mechanics or hospitals can be beneficial in nature.\n \n Cutting the number of legitimate business owners has absolutely no benefit to anyone. As a result of having fewer numbers of FFLs, the number of ATF agents is now in excess and they have far too much time on their hands, and as a result now have to justify their excessive size and budget.\n \n You still don't seem to understand that FFLs are a legitimate, lawful business. They aren't the problem with criminals being armed, they're just one of your favorite scapegoats to blame the problem on.\n \n Do you have any idea about how wrong it is when the nearest licensed dealer is a three hour drive away from where you live? It's even worse when you make the drive out there, only to find that the one shop in the area is closed for the day for whatever reason. You just wasted three valuable hours for nothing, and have another three hours to go in order to get back home.\n \n Making matters worse is when the licensed dealer is an ungodly distance away and you have no means of vehicular transportation. In a situation like this if you have no car then your Second Amendment rights are being unfairly infringed upon. That's no different than a poll tax, and isn't acceptable under any circumstances.\n \n Do you think it's beneficial to have a reduction in the numbers of police officers, firefighters, school teachers, street lights and garbage pickup?",

   "  Conclusion \n The Small Arms Survey 2003: Development Denied argues that firearms ownership by so-called &#8220;non-state actors&#8221; stunts human development.131 We suggest instead that corrupt and dictatorial government is a better explanation of underdevelopment. We have documented a reduction in annual growth rates by between 3.3 and 5.3 percent as a result of African government malfeasance on dealing with malaria and AIDS. \n \n The 2004 annual report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) highlights the man-made tragedy of underdevelopment: &#8220;Chronic hunger plagues 852 million people worldwide&#8230;Hunger and malnutrition cause tremendous human suffering, kill more than five million children every year, and cost developing countries billions of dollars in lost productivity and national income.&#8221;132 \n \n As Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights133 states, &#8220;Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing&#8230;.&#8221; The governments which keep their victim populations hungry and diseased are the true obstacles to development. Empowering victim populations is an essential precondition to development, and dis-arming victim populations, leaving them helpless against tyrants, simply makes things worse.\n \n On the outdoor pavilion of the UN grounds in New York City is a huge sculpture of a revolver with a knotted barrel.134 The sculpture symbolizes the UN&#8217;s current efforts to disarm the people of the world (or as the UN calls them, &#8220;non-state actors&#8221;). We suggest that it is time to discard that twisted sculpture which celebrates the destruction of a human right. \n \n The UN and the rest of the international community should stop trying to disarm the victims of tyranny. It is time for the international community to return its attention to the noble goals on which the UN was founded&#8212;the protection and advancement of human rights for all&#8212;in order to create conditions that optimize the potential for development of all the peoples and all their countries.\n\n Speaking of the U.N.

   "  Conclusion \n Speaking of the U.N. I wonder how that United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) is coming along?\n\n \n (SALW) = THE TYRANT PROTECTION ACT\n I went through the whole article after reading that. Fascinating read on how most tyrannical and corrupt countries deny NGActors not only the basics but also the means to empower themselves by owning the means to freedom from oppression, starvation and basic health care which the corrupt politicians and tyrants have stolen for their own use in utter disreguard of the inhabitants of their nation. ...and what a bibliography! I can still picture Hitler proclaiming, \"the State, there is no power but the State\"...of course he was talking about himself as the State. It is chilling to read that Congressman Rangel, who is facing serious criminal charges, has an article on WND today about the formation of mandatory service to the State(Federal Government) and is the same as the brownshirts in Germany in that era.\n \n \nGuard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined. - Patrick Henry, during Virginia's Convention to Ratify the Constitution (1788)\n\n \n J. CRIM. L. & CRIMINOLOGY 150 (1995)(non-government actors in the \n U.S. accounts for approximately 2.5 million instances of defensive gun uses from criminal attack, annually). For the non-relationship of arms density and social problems, see, e.g., Don B. Kates & Daniel D. Polsby, Long-Term Nonrelationship of Widespread and Increasing \n \n Firearm Availability to Homicide in the United States, 4 HOMICIDE STUD. 185, 185 (2000): \n \n These data do not show a correlation over the long term between the distribution of firearms in the population at large and homicide rates. The two variables do cross occasionally, but they do not do so consistently. Rather, the trend in the period 1973-1997 was one of very large increases in firearms accompanied by essentially flat, even diminishing, homicide rates. That is the general rule for the period since the end of World War II to date. \n \n See also Paul Gallant & Joanne Eisen, Trigger Happy: Rethinking the 'Weapons Effect', 14 J. FIREARMS & PUB. POL'Y 89 (2002), http:// www.saf.org/jfpp/jfpp14.pdf. \n \n \n This is all so much like Supreme Court Justice Douglass wrote in the http://www.constitution.org/wod/wod_por.txt",

The shop owners had to tell everyone why they were doing it, because people were really ticked off. \n \n I remember one incident myself, of having to go back to a dealer very far from my home in order to correct an abbreviation the owner found after I left for home.

But as a U.S. senator Obama hasn't pushed for a 5-mile limit and isn't proposing one as part of his presidential campaign. \n \n We asked the Obama campaign about his current position  on imposing a five-mile limit on gun shops but have received no response. \n\n emoticon_smile",

   "Red's Trading Post appears to be open and operating.\n\n Yep. But only after Reds spent a Ton of money defending it's self in Federal Court where the Judge had to slap the hand of the BATF several times. It cost Red's 200,000 dollars in lawyer fees, if I am remembering correctly!\n \n I don't like to link stuff from the NRA but this talks about the Congressional hearings and the subsequent legislation. The problem language is the word Willful definition.\n \n Congress meant that some criminal intent had to be present before the BATF was allowed to revoke. However, the BATF seem to take the word willful as meaning repeating mistakes and not catching errors on the 4473's. \n \n   Congressional hearings \n Virginia lawyer Richard Gardiner, who has represented many gun owners and dealers, focused on the way BATFE handles cases against federal firearms licensees (FFLs)--often seeking to revoke licensees for &#8220;trivial, immaterial violations&#8221; based on &#8220;undefined legal standards.&#8221; Gardiner described one case where a dealer lost his license even though BATFE itself agreed his records were 99.96% accurate. (The few errors posed no threat to public safety). In other cases, BATFE wrote dealers up for allowing abbreviations (such as &#8220;Y&#8221; for &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; for &#8220;no&#8221;) on firearms transaction forms.\n \n Next, Lt. Michael Lara&#8212;a 23-year veteran of the Tucson Police Department&#8212; recounted a personal horror story about BATFE&#8217;s enforcement priorities. After buying a gun as a gift for a law-abiding friend, Lt. Lara found himself facing federal felony charges as a &#8220;straw purchaser.&#8221; Lt. Lara lost his job, and didn&#8217;t get it back until after a three-month legal nightmare that cost him over $200,000 in legal fees, lost pay and other costs. BATFE never even questioned Lt. Lara before pursuing the charges&#8212;and at the end of the trial, the jury promptly acquitted him.\n \n At the hearing, subcommittee Chairman Howard Coble (R-NC) and ranking member Bobby Scott (D-VA) agreed on the need to focus BATFE&#8217;s efforts on enforcing current laws against serious criminals, while not pursuing petty violations or undermining civil liberties. \n \n That agreement bore fruit a week later, as the two congressional veterans introduced H.R. 5092, the &#8220;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) Modernization and Reform Act of 2006.&#8221; This bill would be a critical first step toward bringing federal gun law enforcement back to its correct focus on dangerous violators&#8212;not on honest people who make mistakes. \n \n H.R. 5092\n Reps. Coble and Scott&#8217;s H.R. 5092 totally revises the system of penalties for licensed dealers, manufacturers and importers of firearms. Under today&#8217;s thoroughly abused system, BATFE can only give an FFL holder a warning, or totally revoke the license. This bill would allow fines or license suspensions for less serious violations, while allowing license revocation for the kind of serious violations that would block an investigation or put guns in the hands of criminals. \n \n Among H.R. 5092&#8217;s other provisions, the bill:\n Allows penalties for intentional violations of the law, but not for simple paperwork mistakes. Congress thought it had fixed this problem when it passed the Firearms Owners&#8217; Protection Act of 1986, but the government has argued in court that the 1986 changes were &#8220;without practical significance.&#8221; \n\n   H.R. 4900 \n would end that problem by defining &#8220;willful&#8221; violations to mean intentional, purposeful violations of the law. It would also streamline the appeal process to give dealers a better chance to defend themselves in court.\n \n \n   Among its other provisions, S. 941 and H.R. 2296 would:\n Clarify the standard for &#8220;willful&#8221; violations&#8212;allowing penalties for intentional, purposeful violations of the law, but not for simple paperwork mistakes.\n\n \n I mean come on! We the People want to believe in our police, to include the BATF, We do not want our police to create criminals with word games.",

Assumptions and conjecture aside, little is known about the paths that firearms take between manufacture and misuse. Research on gun sources has been sketchy, and where data are available its interpretation is often tinged by unfamiliarity with patterns of transfer such as straw purchase and licensee misconduct. Surveys of gun possessors have afforded some insights, but accuracy seems lacking. Sources are collapsed into imprecise categories such as &#8220;family and friends&#8221; and &#8220;on the street&#8221;, thus begging elemental questions about the origins of firearms that are recovered by police.\n \n Licensed gun dealers have been mostly ignored. Whether for a lack of data, the absence of a suitable theoretical construct, or a tendency to assume that all transactions within the primary market are legitimate, inquiries have generally overlooked the paradox of regulated though corrupt sales.\n \n The present effort relied on two approaches that are relatively uncommon ingun research: gun tracing and content analysis of investigative casework. Gun recoveries by authorities in the Los Angeles area yielded data about the characteristics of seized firearms and their possessors. Information pertaining to the marketing and consumption of these weapons was obtained by tracing them to the extent possible. Case files of successful gun diversion investigations were also examined.\n \n Our findings portray a considerably different model of gun redistribution than the literature had led us to expect. Instead of a market predominantly comprising of petty criminals selling stolen guns, we encountered a setting rich with licensed and unlicensed entrepreneurs who bought guns directly from licensed sources in order to satisfy their customers&#8217; craving for new, large-caliberpistols. Episodes of large scale, commercialized gun diversion seemed commonplace, with eight instances involving more than 1,000 guns each. Though much less precise, recovery statistics were equally striking, with eight cases surpassing the 100-gun threshold.\n \n Other methods of gun acquisition that have received little academic attention, such as self-purchase and straw purchase, also seemed important. On the other hand, theft was considerably less salient than conventional wisdom implies. Notions of its prevalence were not supported by the trace study (6 percent of recovered guns were stolen) or by the casework (11 percent of diverted guns werestolen). Residential burglary was virtually ruled out as a major source for the secondary market. While stolen firearms modestly contributed to the pool of recoveries, none of the street dealers targeted in the casework peddled guns that originated from a house theft.\n \n Dealer corruption emerged as a surprisingly significant source of supply. Gun tracing disclosed that some retailers had not only failed to account for incoming guns but also ignored State registration requirements. Malfeasance by licensees was particularly evident in the casework, as 71 percent (13,667) of the diverted guns passed through 15 licensed dealers who made unrecorded or misrecorded sales to individuals and unlicensed vendors.\n \n Concerns that misconduct by just a few retailers can have a disproportionate impact were advanced during a recent scholarly review of national trace data(Pierce et al., 1995). Less than one-half of 1 percent of gun dealers were found to account for nearly 50 percent of all guns traced by ATF (Pierce et al., 1995, p. 15). Brief lag times (defined as two years or less between sale and recovery) were associated with less than 3 percent of licensees; these sources, in turn, were responsible for nearly 28 percent of all traced firearms (Pierce et al., 1995, p. 15). \n \n Willie Sutton robbed banks because those are the places where the money is. Corrupt licensees turned to wholesalers, and unlicensed dealers turned to licensed retailers, because those are the places where the guns are.

Mostly dealers operating out of residences.\n\n \n Mainly because of zoning laws, increase in fees and the Brady Laws that required heaps of paperwork. It had nothing to do with 49% of home business being criminal in nature as you would like to imply and there were more strings attached besides fees and a background check which cost more money. The BATF was set up to be a tax collection agency and only recently has taken on the actions of a law enforcement agency under homland security. Think require a license to exercise a right...\n \n \n\"Concerns about home dealers were well placed. Of the 15 retailers accused in the casework, only two were commercial gun stores. Ten were home businesses...\"\n \n \n They say less than 1% and after the \"49%\" got out of business it was 1-2% and now less than .01-.02% even with more review. You didn't mention the 3 hybrid stores either. In a rush? \n \n ATF Fact Sheet - Decline In The Number Of Federal Firearms Licenses\n \n Still no proof that reduction was a benefit! Noticeably absent any proof at all. You make some weird claims that has nothing to do with the topic. Trying to divert and substitute? emoticon_confused or just dazzle 'em with BS?",

   "Your own ideas?\n\n You always want to concentrate on the law-abiding who are Not the Problem! \n \n Lets us first start with the realization that gun control,   even MASSIVE gun control does not stop people from getting guns.  See the English and Australian studies. \n \n Next we concentrate on the people who commit crime. \n   Crime factors from the FBI website \n Historically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n \n \u00b7 Population density and degree of urbanization. \n \u00b7 Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n \u00b7 Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors. \n \u00b7 Modes of transportation and highway system. \n \u00b7 Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n \u00b7 Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n \u00b7 Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n \u00b7 Climate. \n \u00b7 Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n \u00b7 Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n \u00b7 Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n \u00b7 Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n \u00b7 Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n \n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.&#8221; \n\n   Fact 7: Crime, Violence, and Drug Use Go Hand-In-Hand \n From the DEA\n \n According to the 1999 Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) study, more than half of arrestees for violent crimes test positive for drugs at the time of their arrest.\n \n A 1997 FBI study of violence against law enforcement officers found that 24 percent of the assailants were under the influence of drugs at the time they attacked the officers and that 72 percent of the assailants had a history of drug law violations.\n\n The problem IS and always has been Drugs!\n \n   FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime  \n \n Gun Violence and Constitutional Issues \n The FBI statistics reveal that 75 percent of all violent crimes for any locality are committed by six percent of hardened criminals and repeat offenders.18 Violent crimes continue to be a problem in the inner cities with gangs involved in the drug trade.\n",

   "1994 I believe.\n\n \n You believe? You don't know for sure?\n \n \nFacts already in evidence, see post #39.\n\n \n \n\"Concerns about home dealers were well placed. Of the 15 retailers accused in the casework, only two were commercial gun stores. Ten were home businesses, while three operated from a hybrid location. It seems that the privacy and flexibility enjoyed by gun dealers who are licensed to do business from a private dwelling can make oversight a tough task, indeed (Cook et al., 1995; Larson,1994).\"\n\n \n Accused, but there's no mention of any actual conviction. Don't tell me you're taking a page from the Brady Bunch handbook, where somebody's guilty if they're accused, even if the case is eventually dismissed by the court. Unless they were actually convicted then there's nothing here.\n \n So there were 13 possibly corrupt dealers operating from the home. Out of how many total? Exactly how many FFL dealers operated out of their home in this study? What percentage does that 13 amount to in comparison?\n \n \nNo, I didn't.\n\n \n No? Your posts sure seem to insinuate that this is your statement.\n \n \nOn one of your regular stupidity expeditions?\n\n \n Well if tighter regulations help reduce crime then perhaps we should regulate every single business to the same degree you insist we do FFL dealers be held to. Imagine how many embezzlers we'd catch if government agents could make annual audits of all business records.\n \n \nPrivate property that an entire class of persons are prohibited from owning.\n\n \n The government's supposed interest in who's buying firearms from private citizens isn't sufficient enough to severely curtail a person's right to privacy. Especially when it's been shown that such records are made public in the more liberal states.\n \n \nI haven't.\n\n \n Yes you have, many times before. Anytime you voiced your support for the mandatory reporting law, you basically declared that all gun owners are the bad guys even when they're the victims of a crime. You refuse to trust them to be responsible on their own, so you insist that they be compelled by law to do what you consider to be the right thing.\n \n \nHard to prosecute but helpful in ongoing investigations.\n\n \n You've already admitted that the police are grossly outnumbered and underfunded in your state, incapable of addressing the causes responsible for the highest rate of drive by shootings in the nation. And yet you still call for mandatory reporting laws that will waste what few resources they have, by investigating the victims of violent crime?\n \n Very disgusting.\n \n \nThere were no legal outlets for alcohol during prohibition, not fewer.\n \n \n Hundreds of thousands of speakeasies. There was a bare minimum of 30,000 of these illegal bars in New York City alone. Such a high number of illegal outlets doesn't speak highly about the effectiveness of the law if the outlawed product is so easy to get.\n \n \nWhat lack?\n \n There are no legal outlets for child porn. Never have been.\n\n \n And yet both run rampant despite there being no legal markets to acquire them at. Anybody who understands this would understand that applying the same approach to guns would be a massive failure.\n \n \nBoth I'm afraid. Restricting folks from conducting firearm businesses with inventory and little security, out of their homes, is not necessarily about honesty.\n\n \n And yet you've provided absolutely no proof that a significant amount of conclusive evidence to show that home-based FFL dealers are more likely to commit fraud than their store front counterparts. All you've shown is that those in California are easily corrupted.\n \n \nName the shop closed for good over nothing more than paperwork errors.\n\n \n Red's Trading Post is good enough. The only reason they're still in business is because a judge told the ATF that the issued they raised weren't significant in nature.\n \n How many small companies can you name that're able to put up at least $200,000 for lawyer fees to clear their good name? \n \n \nMaybe that's not the intent.\n\n \n If that isn't their intent then the ATF is nothing more than a group of hired thugs, exercising authority they shouldn't have.\n \n \nWhere do you suppose large seizures of new weapons with serial numbers obliterated originate?\n\n \n Got any answers to that one?\n \n \n \nWhy would someone who bought a weapon from an untraceable source need to remove serial numbers?\n\n \n Maybe it was obliterated beforehand?",

CCRKBA joined the Second Amendment Foundation, National Rifle Association and other plaintiffs in the lawsuit that nullified the ban because it violates state statute. Now that the Second Amendment has been incorporated to the states by the U.S. Supreme Court, proposals like this one are even more dubious, he observed.\n\n Speaking of SF's attempted handgun ban. Since they decided to call it proposition H, having some obvious reference to preparation H, and since it was found unconstitutional, does that now mean that SF is the ones who are in need of that product? \n \n   Ammunition stores recovering from supply shortage \n For several months, gun and ammunition stores across the nation have struggled with a supply shortage that has hurt business and made life difficult for gun owners.\n \n \"It's actually picking up a little bit and (ammunition) is getting a little easier to get,\" said Ross Fuller, a salesman for Southern Outdoor Sports. \"There are still certain ones (that are in short supply), but most of it's been pretty easy to find.
