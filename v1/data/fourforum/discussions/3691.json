While we're at it, perhaps someone--congress maybe?--could actually pay attention to this part of the Constitution:\n \n The Congress shall have Power To...declare War\n \n The Iraq War isn't technically a war, you know. Congress never declared war, they just gave the president carte blanche to use military force against Iraq if necessary, then griped after he went ahead and did it. Meanwhile, we (along with the media) all call it a war even though war was never declared. Same thing happened for Korea, Vietnam, and ever other conflict the U.S. has been in after WWII.\n \n Meanwhile, I will continue to care about the right of all American citizens to vote. It's sorta democratic to want that, don't you think?",

   "Amos is right, it's a Federal law.

Each report so transmitted shall be referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate for appropriate action.

Such sixty-day period shall be extended for not more than an additional thirty days if the President determines and certifies to the Congress in writing that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of United States Armed Forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces. \n \n \n \n where dose it say that the ONLY way to send trrop into combat is by an act of Congress?\n \n (edit) sorry forgot to link my quotes, i just used your link.",

For example, where does it say that congress can abdicate their role in the checks and balances outlined by the Consitution and tell the president, \"We authorize you to do whatever you want--i.e., give you the king-like war powers the framers worked so diligently to avoid granting you--but we reserve the right to gripe about it later because we are unwilling to commit to a declaration of war. But let's call it a war anyway.\"\n \n In the case of Iraq, an operation that was planned in advance, not an 11th hour response to a recent attack, I see no reason whatsoever why war could not have been declared.
