The minimum is nothing, but you will always define it as a level greater than currently exists. Human wants are unlimited, and regardless of the level of housing, healthcare and education which exists, people will want more and better of all of them. Any government must decide what it will spend money on and at the expense of what else.\n \n \nsaying that the country should not pay health coverage of poors is nothing but criminal.\n\n \n Funny, I didn't see criminalisation of speech contrary to your purposes in your original proposal, must have been what you meant by \"freedom\".\n \n Finally, the democratic nature of such an interest does not lend itself to the detailed goals *you* have in mind. Everyone has their own ideas about what a good government is, and in a democracy their votes determine to a large extent what policies are implemented. That a \"democracy\" should result in the policies *you* want would be a miraculous chance, so it sounds to me that what you want is a dictatorship implementing your ideals that is a democracy in name alone, for example through the prohibition of speech advocating ideals contrary to your own and restrictions on who is allowed to run for election, or more subtly a prohibition on opposition parties wastefully using resources \"marketing\" themselves.\n \n The closest approximation to your ideals I can think of is the paradise of Castro's Cuba.",

He opens a sub-corporation of our company with all the benefits described previously.\n He sells services and products with no \"government\" tax since indirectly incorporated in no-tax haven, but pay the organisation taxes on corporation earnings and sales.\n Then he pays himself a salary and will pay he's country's taxes on it.\n \n \nIn order to enforce legislation, you need to have monopoly on violence in the territory this legislation is supposed to apply.
