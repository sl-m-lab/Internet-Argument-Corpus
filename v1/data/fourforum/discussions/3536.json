Here's the article. It has nothing to do with Christianity. It's about the constitution.\n \n http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/gwinnett/1004/26prayer.html\n \n Muslim students seek Friday prayer sessions \n \n By BRIAN FEAGANS\n The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n Published on: 10/25/04\n \n \n Isam Rashied memorized the Quran at age 13. Illnesses aside, Isam has has prayed at a mosque every Friday since he was a toddler.\n \n But the 15-year-old says he has hit a spiritual wall at Duluth High School. The Gwinnett County school hasn't been willing to excuse Isam and his 17-year-old brother, Imaad, from their last class period on Fridays for the weekly juma'a prayer required of Muslims.\n \n \n BRANT SANDERLIN/AJC\n (ENLARGE) \n Duluth brothers (from left) Imaad, Isam, Ammar and Taabish Rashied pray at home. Imaad and Isam's father wants them released early from Duluth High on Fridays for group prayers.\n \n EMAIL THIS\n PRINT THIS\n MOST POPULAR\n \n \n \n \"It's like stopping others from practicing their religion,\" said Isam, a freshman who until this year attended private Islamic schools that had the prayer.\n \n Schools around the country perform a delicate balancing act when asked to accommodate juma'a.\n \n Administrators have to balance respect for the religious practice with a responsibility to provide a sound education and abide by the principles of the separation of church and state.\n \n Bobby Crowson, chief of staff at Gwinnett County schools, said districts look at each case individually. \"Is the request that has been made reasonable, given our accountability for educating all children?\" he said.\n \n The Quran commands Muslims to pray in congregation, not alone, on Friday afternoons. And in the Atlanta region, most mosques hold juma'a prayer by 2 p.m., before schools let out.\n \n When asked to help Muslim students meet that obligation, metro area schools have responded with everything from a polite \"no\" to offers to set aside classroom space for prayer. Crowson will tackle the issue Wednesday. He's scheduled to meet with officials from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) to discuss the Rashied family's request and others like it in Georgia's largest school system.\n \n Dispute in Brooklyn\n \n Neither side wants to see the issue boil over as it did in New York City, earlier this month. Muslim students threatened to skip classes and claimed religious discrimination when Brooklyn International High School officials wouldn't excuse them for juma'a prayer during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that began Oct. 15.\n \n Duluth High has allowed the Rashied children to leave early on Fridays during Ramadan. The meeting Wednesday will help determine what happens after the holiday ends. Yusof Burke, director of CAIR's North Georgia chapter, said he wants to work out a compromise that could be used as a guide elsewhere in metro Atlanta.\n \n While some metro Atlanta Muslims have come to terms with their children missing juma'a, others have pressed schools for special accommodations, with mixed results.\n \n The dozens of Muslim students at North Atlanta High have two options: check out of school early or pray together in a designated classroom. At Clarkston High in DeKalb County, Muslims can pray during their lunch hour on a stage separated from the cafeteria by a curtain.\n \n In suburban Henry County, school officials have denied at least two requests to excuse Muslim students at noon on Fridays. Chattahoochee High in north Fulton County has refused a similar request. Rockdale County officials say they allow early departures, but don't know whether any Muslims are taking advantage of the policy.\n \n Schools have leeway\n \n The Supreme Court has held that while school officials don't have to excuse students for religious reasons,  they can if they want to, said Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center in Arlington, Va.\n \n Some administrators worry that if they grant permission to Muslims, they could get peppered with regular requests from other religious groups, Haynes said.\n \n But policies regarding the juma'a prayer are different, he believes. \"I can't think of another religious group who has asked for an accommodation where it's an obligation of faith,\" Haynes said. \"It's required by God. That raises the ante here.\"\n \n Many schools, such as those in Gwinnett, establish a quiet place where any student can pray, including Muslims performing their daily noontime prayer. The juma'a is more difficult to accommodate, however. Adherents have to pray together, not individually, so matching up students' schedules can become a problem.\n \n At schools such as Duluth High, Isam said there are not enough devout Muslims to meet the spirit of juma'a, which means \"gathering\" in Arabic.\n \n Isam and Imaad would like to be released by 1:30 p.m., 40 minutes before the last bell rings at 2:10 p.m. Their father, Khalid Rashied, said his sons could make up any missed exams or course work\n \n Rashied said he first asked for Imaad to be released for the Friday prayers three years ago, but was rebuffed.\n \n \"We were just asking them, if my child is getting an 'A' in the class, can you excuse him?\" Rashied said. \"I asked about every third Friday, but they wouldn't listen to that. Our religious leaders have said you cannot miss three Fridays in a row.\"\n \n After renewing his request this year, Rashied decided this school year to enlist help from CAIR.\n \n Some accept rules\n \n Many Muslim parents have simply accepted their schools' decision not to excuse students for juma'a prayer.\n \n Saeed Raees, whose daughter Madiha goes to Chattahoochee High, said officials at the Fulton County school feared that if they allowed Muslim students to leave early, it could open the door to similar requests from other religious groups. They didn't want to set aside a spot for group prayer in the school either, he said, because staff would be burdened with monitoring the session.\n \n \"Our belief is you make your best effort,\" Raees said. \"If it works out, great. If it doesn't, you will get your reward for trying.\"\n \n Madiha said she understands why the school was reluctant to permit her early release. Chattahoochee holds classes until 3:40 p.m., so she would have to miss all or parts of three classes: physics, Spanish and European history.\n \n Some schools that have allowed juma'a prayer on campus have reversed course for fear that they were violating laws governing the separation of church and state. In March, officials at San Jose High in California stopped 50 Muslim students from a years-long practice of holding juma'a in school.  The students rented a nearby game room and began praying there instead.\n \n Haynes, the constitutional scholar, said in-school prayer is attractive in an era of high-stakes testing and every-minute-counts attendance policies. Students miss a minimal amount of class time. But such arrangements also rub up against an entirely different set of prickly constitutional questions.\n \n Students should be free to pray during lunch hour and other free time, Haynes said, so long as the exercise isn't coercive upon others.\n \n He believes school officials should try to accommodate such requests, if at all possible.\n \n \"It's a way to say to Muslims, 'We want you to be a part of public education,' \" he said. \" 'We want you to be a part of our nation.' \"",

Can you imagine those Christians being so accommodating? ;) \n \n \n http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/gwinnett/1004/28muslimprayer.html\n \n \n \n Muslims, schools draw up prayer deal\n \n By BRIAN FEAGANS\n The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n Published on: 10/27/04\n \n \n Muslim students in Gwinnett County schools would be excused for Friday afternoon prayer under a tentative compromise reached Wednesday by Muslim leaders and officials in Georgia's largest school system.\n \n School officials proposed three options. Muslim leaders plan to circulate the choices at five Gwinnett mosques this weekend and choose one by next week.\n \n \n \n \n \n The compromise grew out a 90-minute meeting between Gwinnett Schools chief of staff Bobby Crowson, two local Muslim officials and Khalid Rashied, the father of two students at Duluth High School.\n \n Three years ago, Rashied couldn't get the school to excuse his eldest son from the final class period to attend the juma'a prayer required of Muslims on Friday afternoons.\n \n Rashied renewed his request this year and enlisted the help of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which set up the meeting Wednesday.\n \n \"The meeting was very, very nice,\" Rashied said. \"I think it should be resolved by Monday.\"\n \n The three options presented Wednesday are:\n \n &#8226; Using an existing program that allows students to miss the final class period each day for religious study off campus. Up to 200 students participate in the program now, Crowson said. Some attend an accredited institution and earn a half-credit for the class, he said, while others don't get any credit and have to enroll in an additional class to make up for the lost class time.\n \n &#8226; Taking an online class during the sixth and final class period, allowing the flexibility to attend congregational prayer on Friday.\n \n &#8226; Attending the first five periods of class, missing sixth period for prayer and returning for an after-school offering.\n \n Muslim leaders plan to report back to the school district with their preferred option Monday, Rashied said.\n \n \"We'll get together Friday night, put together our notes and see what the community thought,\" he said.\n \n Depending on which option they choose, the proposal would have to gain approval from the county Board of Education or the superintendent's cabinet, Crowson said.\n \n Also in attendance at the meeting Wednesday were Kemal Korucu, director of the Omar Bin Abdul-Aziz mosque near Norcross, and Yusof Burke, director of CAIR's North Georgia office.\n \n Burke said several other Muslim families are following the Rashied case closely. And he hopes to use an eventual compromise as a model in other metro Atlanta school districts facing requests to accommodate juma'a.\n \n Burke said he was particularly encouraged to hear that Muslims could take advantage of the same religious study program now used by students attending Bible class off-campus.\n \n \"We were pretty happy,\" Burke said. \"There were some good proposals.\"\n \n Juma'a must be completed before the sun reaches a 45-degree angle in the sky on Fridays. Most metro Atlanta mosques begin the congregational prayer by 2 p.m., before schools let out.\n \n Schools in Henry and Fulton counties have turned down families that have asked for early departure.\n \n The city of Atlanta school system, on the other hand, has allowed students to leave early. At North Atlanta High, students have held juma'a in a Muslim teacher's classroom, though the teacher has been asked not to participate.\n \n The proposed compromise in Gwinnett, while it would release students from a traditional class setting, would prevent teachers from having to manage excessive makeup work and wouldn't disrupt classes with check-ins and check-outs, the school district said in a release.",
