You cannot blame Evolution because of those who wish to distort it for their purposes.\n \n As for the Evolutionary underpinnings of Altruism, it seems that there are a number of theories, including the one you mention, but that this is still an issue with no one clear answer. A nice summary I found is at http://endeavor.med.nyu.edu/~strone01/altruism.html . It outlines various theories and then summarizes:\n \nAltruism is one of the great mysteries of social behavior in animals, as it appears to contradict our understanding of natural selection. Even one hundred years after the birth of Darwinism, scientists are still continuing to debate the causes and effects of altruistic behavior. Whether the mathematical models of group selection, the instinctive qualities of kin selection, or the trusting attributes of reciprocal altruism, are the prime explanations of the development of this behavior is still largely unknown. In the end, it will probably be found that it is the combination of all three possibilities that plays a significant role in the natural world.\n\n As for your various personally directed slights, I have every right to expect you to be able to defend your claims about people's views by referencing their posts.

   "Another opinion", 
   "I found another useful article about altruism and Evolution:\n \n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/\n \n Most of the article focuses on the various theories behind \"biological altruism\" (pretty much the same as in the previous article I quoted). However, one section does note the differences between \"biological altruism\" and \"real\" altrium. This is interesting enough that I will quote it here (from the section 4: But is it 'Real' Altruism?). Here, I have bolded the key points:\n \nThe theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism together go a long way towards reconciling the existence of altruism in nature with Darwinian principles. Indeed kin selection theory, in particular, is generally regarded as one of the triumphs of 20th century evolutionary biology. However, some people have felt these theories in a way devalue altruism, and that the behaviours they explain are not 'really' altruistic. The grounds for this view are easy to see. Ordinarily we think of altruistic actions as disinterested, done with the interests of the recipient, rather than our own interests, in mind. But kin selection theory explains altruistic behaviour as a clever strategy devised by selfish genes as a way of increasing their representation in the gene-pool, at the expense of other genes. Surely this means that the behaviours in question are only 'apparently' altruistic, for they are ultimately the result of genic self-interest? Reciprocal altruism theory also seems to 'take the altruism out of altruism'. Behaving nicely to someone in order to procure return benefits from them in the future seems in a way the antithesis of 'real' altruism -- it is just delayed self-interest.\n \n This is a tempting line of argument. Indeed Trivers (1971) and, arguably, Dawkins (1976) were themselves tempted by it. But it should not convince. The key point to remember is that biological altruism cannot be equated with altruism in the everyday vernacular sense. Biological altruism is defined in terms of fitness consequences, not motivating intentions. If by 'real' altruism we mean altruism done with the conscious intention to help, then the vast majority of living creatures are not capable of 'real' altruism nor therefore of 'real' selfishness either. Ants and termites, for example, presumably do not have conscious intentions, hence their behaviour cannot be done with the intention of promoting their own self-interest, nor the interests of others. Thus the assertion that the evolutionary theories reviewed above show that the altruism in nature is only apparent makes little sense. The contrast between 'real' altruism and merely apparent altruism simply does not apply to most animal species.\n \n To some extent, the idea that kin-directed and reciprocal altruism are not 'real' altruism has been fostered by the use of the 'selfish gene' terminology of Dawkins (1976). As we have seen, the gene's-eye perspective is heuristically useful for understanding the evolution of altruistic behaviours, especially those that evolve by kin selection. But talking about 'selfish' genes trying to increase their representation in the gene-pool is of course just a metaphor (as Dawkins fully admits); there is no literal sense in which genes 'try' to do anything. Any evolutionary explanation of how a phenotypic trait evolves must ultimately show that the trait leads to an increase in frequency of the genes that code for it (presuming the trait is transmitted genetically.) Therefore, a 'selfish gene' story can by definition be told about any trait, including a behavioural trait, that evolves by Darwinian natural selection. To say that kin selection interprets altruistic behaviour as a strategy designed by 'selfish' genes to aid their propagation is not wrong; but it is just another way of saying that a Darwinian explanation for the evolution of altruism has been found. As Sober and Wilson (1998) note, if one insists on saying that behaviours which evolve by mechanism such as kin selection and reciprocal altruism are 'really selfish', one ends up reserving the word 'altruistic' for behaviours which cannot evolve at all.\n \n Do the theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism apply to human behaviour? This is part of the broader question of whether ideas about the evolution of animal behaviour can be extrapolated to humans, a question that fuelled the sociobiology controversy of the 1980s. All biologists accept that Homo sapiens is an evolved species, and thus that general evolutionary principles apply to it. However, human behaviour is obviously influenced by culture to a far greater extent than that of other animals, and is often the product of conscious beliefs and desires (though this does not necessarily mean that genetics has no influence.) Nonetheless, at least some human behaviour does seem to fit the predictions of the evolutionary theories reviewed above. In general, humans behave more altruistically (in the biological sense) towards their close kin that towards non-relatives, e.g. by helping relatives raise their children, just as kin selection theory would predict. It is also true that we tend to help those who have helped us out in the past, just as reciprocal altruism theory would predict. On the other hand, numerous human behaviours seem anomalous from the evolutionary point of view. Think for example of adoption. Parents who adopt children instead of having their own reduce their biological fitness, obviously, so adoption is an altruistic behaviour. But it is does not benefit kin -- for parents are generally unrelated to the infants they adopt -- and nor do the parents stand to gain much in the form of reciprocal benefits. So although kin selection and reciprocal altruism may help us understand some human behaviours, they certainly cannot be applied across the board.\n \n Where human behaviour is concerned, the distinction between biological altruism, defined in terms of fitness consequences, and 'real' altruism, defined in terms of the agent's conscious intentions to help others, does make sense. (Sometimes the label 'psychological altruism' is used instead of 'real' altruism.) What is the relationship between these two concepts? They appear to be independent in both directions, as Elliott Sober (1994) has argued. An action performed with the conscious intention of helping another human being may not affect their biological fitness at all, so would not count as altruistic in the biological sense. Conversely, an action undertaken for purely self-interested reasons, i.e. without the conscious intention of helping another, may boost their biological fitness tremendously.\n \n Sober argues that, even if we accept an evolutionary approach to human behaviour, there is no particular reason to think that evolution would have made humans into egoists rather than psychological altruists. On the contrary, it is quite possible that natural selection would have favoured humans who genuinely do care about helping others, i.e. who are capable of 'real' or psychological altruism. Suppose there is an evolutionary advantage associated with taking good care of one's children -- a quite plausible idea. Then, parents who really do care about their childrens' welfare, i.e. who are 'real' altruists, will have a higher inclusive fitness, hence spread more of their genes, than parents who only pretend to care, or who do not care. Therefore, evolution may well lead 'real' or psychological altruism to evolve. Contrary to what is often thought, an evolutionary approach to human behaviour does not imply that humans are likely to be motivated by self-interest alone. One strategy by which 'selfish genes' may increase their future representation is by causing humans to be non-selfish, in the psychological sense.\n",

The research appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May.\n \n \"It's very unusual to get a complete story in biology -- one that marries careful field work with painstaking work in the laboratory -- and that's what we have here,\" said research co-author Joan Strassmann, chair of Rice's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.\n \n Rice's research involved the common soil microbe Dictyostelium discoideum. These amoebae can be loners in times of plenty, but when food is scarce they work together, forming colonies to ensure their survival. About one fifth of the individuals in a colony form a tall, thin stalk. The rest climb the stalk and clump together into a bulbous fruiting body that can be carried away to better environs by the wind or on the legs of passing insects.\n \n This simple social system poses an evolutionary conundrum for biologists; the members of the stalk give themselves up altruistically to support the colony, so what's to keep more selfish strains of D. discoideum from cheating the system, avoiding the stalk and out-reproducing their altruistic neighbors\"\n \n Strassmann and Rice evolutionary biologist David Queller have previously investigated how Dictyostelium colonies control cheating. For example, a study on D. discoideum showed that one gene governing cooperative behavior was also tied to reproduction. In another study, mutants that were genetically predisposed to avoid altruistic service in the stalk were also excluded from reproducing. A third study demonstrated that Dictyostelium purpureum preferentially associated with its own kin -- another mechanism that ensures altruism isn't taken advantage of by cheaters.\n \n The current study combined graduate student Owen Gilbert's careful field and lab work on natural D. discoideum clones with exacting studies of genetically engineered mutant strains conducted by former postdoctoral researcher Kevin Foster and postdoctoral researcher Natasha Mehdiabadi.\n \n \"This work required investigators skilled in both field biology and molecular biology, an all-too-rare combination,\" Strassmann said.\n \n Gilbert collected 144 D. discoideum fruiting bodies -- some of which were the first ever reported in the wild -- from 2003 to 2005 at the University of Virginia's Mountain Lake Biological Station in the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia. Back in the lab, Gilbert broke open the fruiting bodies and deciphered the genetic makeup of more than 3,000 individual spores. Though he found genetic differences between fruiting bodies, the spores within particular fruiting bodies were highly related.\n \n Foster and Mehdiabadi worked with a mutant form of D. discoideum called \"cheater A\" that was missing a single gene known to play roles in both group productivity and reproduction. On their own, cheater A mutants produced few or no spores, but in mixed colonies they could thrive by cheating and avoiding service in the stalk. Foster and Mehdiabadi found cheater A spread readily within low-related colonies, and exacted a high toll by reducing the colonies' ability to reproduce. In colonies with highly related cells, the cheater's individual advantages were outweighed by the overall health of the group, so the cheaters couldn't gain a foothold.\n \n \"The combination of these two studies confirms something that's been long predicted by kin selection theory -- a mutant that cheats when relatedness is low cannot and has not spread in the wild because of natural relatedness,\" Queller said.\n \n Gilbert said, \"Our results answer the big question of why altruism persists. It persists because high relatedness prevents the spread of socially destructive mutants.\"\n \n ###\n The research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation.\"\n \n at--\n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-07/ru-acc070507.php",

We are, in other words, defined both by \"nature\" and \"nurture\". \n \n Where lower animals are concerned, it seems that scientists view their behavior as being defined almost purely by \"nature\" in that their genes define their behavior and they do not have an independent reasoning process or culture that would direct them away from that instinctual behavior. For example, ants form themselves into complex colonies. The soldier ant is not seriously thinking about the fact that he is going to sacrifice his life for his colony - he just does it. Why does he sacrifice himself? Because his genes have determined his behavior patterns and he has no independently analytical mind which can counter that instinctual behavioral trends. When that soldier ant sacrifices himself for his colony, what do you call that? Scientists do call that altruism, and that is the type of altruism that they appear to be addressing. I doubt that you would find many scientists who would claim that human beings only experience that type of altruism.\n \n In low order species, all of their behavior is ultimately controlled by their genes since they have no independent analytical mind to tell them that their instincts are not right. We have such independent analytical minds, so we don't have to follow our instinctual reactions. I suspect that Darwinists leave the psychological motivations behind human altruism to psychologists to study and they themselves prefer to study the genetically influenced source of apparent altruism (soldier ant sacrificing himself) that exists in the great majority of the animal kingdom. Again, it is a matter of talking apples and oranges.\n \n\n **\n Ridiculous. I spoke of an impression formed from long general experience--years and thouisands of posts by hundreds of contributors. By what stretch of the imagination did you have any right to demand that I produce particulars out of all that?!?! Preposterous.\n **\n If that's true, then you sure started out on the wrong foot.\n **\n Not true. I had stated quite clearly how I came to that conclusion, but you pushed for something else, hoping that that push would score you some points at my expense.\n **\n You did not, and you are not, a \"neutral party\". You've clearly demonstrated where your sympathies lie.\n **\n You had a right to ask what made me form a general opinion, and I told you. You had no right to demand anything further than that. Such presumption amounts to impertinence and underhandedness.\n **\n Wow, you must have learned how to distort and falsify situations at the same place where the rest of these darwinists did.\n\n It continues to amaze me how offended you are that someone should \"dare\" question your claims. Questioning of claims is at the very core of intellectual discussion. If claims are never questions, discussions have a tendency to go around in pointless circles or degenerate into flames. Perhaps that is what you most enjoy - flame wars. Not I. I prefer a calm, rational discussion and, unlike you, am completely open to people challenging me to provide evidence for my claims.",

Here it is again--you keep mis-using the word \"instinctual\", where you very clearly intend, from context, the word, \"mechanical\", i.e., chemically [DNA] determined. Please stop making this mistake, as its repetition is very irritating.\n \n Instinctive behaviour is not chemical behaviour. It is _learned_, i.e., psychically 'impelled by need and refined by feedback teleological behaviour. Learned behaviour that has been systematized over generations and epigenetically inherited. It invariably depends upon the organismic processing of environmental inputs, not genetic throughputs.

In all cases it is psychology, not chemistry. Very little of it, however, is \"consciously chosen and thought-through\", and that tiny bit is limited to organisms like ourselves that have evolved to the stage where our psychical abilities include self-consciousness and analytical thought.\n \n \n\n Where lower animals are concerned, it seems that scientists view their behavior as being defined almost purely by \"nature\" \n\n \n **\n Another constantly repeated intentional semantic falsehood--you imply that \"nature\" is purely chemistry/physics, and that \"natural\" is synonymous with \"mechanical\", \"physical\", \"chemical\" and \"material\". You imply that all 'scientists' intend this semantic, when in fact only materialist/mechanist/positivist 'scientists' actually do. And you imply that 'nurture' is something apart from nature, i.e., something 'unnatural'. \n \n \"Nurture\" is very much a part of \"nature\". It can only be excluded from organisms that are incapable of 'learning' from others, or who have no others to learn from. But no normal organism is incapable of learning, and only very rarely do organisms have no others to learn from. And funnily enough, where there are no 'others' to learn from, there is no need for altruism, nor is there any to be found. Obviously.\n \n \n\n in that their genes define their behavior\n\n \n **\n By \"define\" you really mean, \"determine\", as in \"pre-determined\". That makes what they do inevitable, unavoidable, and mechanical. But I have no reason to believe, [the evolutionary psychology darwinists notwithstanding], that all organismic behaviour [in any organism, however simple it may be as a system], is genetically determined. So far as I know, the gene for the 'instinctive' migratory behaviour of, say, canada geese, [which do not always migrate], has yet to be identified. And where is this 'gene' for 'altruism'?\n \n \n\n and they do not have an independent reasoning process or culture that would direct them away from that instinctual behavior.\n\n \n **\n Analytical reasoning and self-consciousness are not necessary to life, and in fact seem to be present in very few organisms. Perhaps only fully present in ourselves. But most organisms, from eusocial bacteria to flocks of the afore-mentioned Canada Geese, have 'culture'. Instincts are epigenetically inherited habits. They are not immutable. They can evolve, because they did evolve. As they were learned.\n \n Darwinists will tell you that instincts 'evolve' whenever some random, accidental, anomalous genetic change or other that causes, for instance, some salmon to swim back to the exact stream in which they were born, and some monarch butterflies to visit a mexican forest that they have never seen. I'll need more detail on that before it makes any sense to me.\n \n \n \n\n For example, ants form themselves into complex colonies. The soldier ant is not seriously thinking about the fact that he is going to sacrifice his life for his colony - he just does it. Why does he sacrifice himself? Because his genes have determined his behavior patterns\n\n \n **\n Really? So you're claiming that 'soldier' ants have different 'genes' from their fellow ants? First I've heard of that. I always understood that 'castes' in eusocial organisms was an epigenetic, developmental matter.\n \n \n\n and he has no independently analytical mind which can counter that instinctual behavioral trends. When that soldier ant sacrifices himself for his colony, what do you call that? Scientists do call that altruism, and that is the type of altruism that they appear to be addressing.\n\n \n **\n So do I. You are the one making a distinction between human altruism and non-human altruism, not me.\n \n \n\n I doubt that you would find many scientists who would claim that human beings only experience that type of altruism.\n\n \n **\n Here you are employing a logical fallacy, by changing categories in mid-stream. The categories are, 1/ a kind of behaviour,[altruism] and 2/ that which causes that behaviour. Darwinists are used to this fallacy, as they constantly conflate evolution with that which causes it,-- so the fallacy comes naturally to them.\n \n Altruism is altruism, whether its a soldier ant or a fireman laying down his life for his fellows' benefit. The difference between us is that you claim that the ant does so because of some accidentally mutated gene, whereas the fireman has been socialised, i.e., taught, to do what he does. I claim that the trait, altruism, is the same in both, despite the fact that the fireman may actually stop, momentarily, to think about what he's doing, while the ant never does. And in neither case is genetic determism the explanation for it.\n \n \n\n In low order species, all of their behavior is ultimately controlled by their genes since they have no independent analytical mind to tell them that their instincts are not right.\n\n \n **\n Spoken as a true genetic determinist. I simply do not agree with you, and on two fronts--a/ I do not accept that any adaptive/productive organismic or organic behaviour [such as altruism, or any instinctive behaviour] originated with an accidental [random] genetic mutation. I assert that all such behaviours preceded any genetic storage of them. Thus instincts, altruism, fears, you name it, were first learned psychically, before being stored chemically. As such, they can be 'unlearned'. Which is exactly why altruism is not compulsory/determined, except in eusocial organisms where the 'identity' of the collectivity is always the 'identity' any individual part. Just like the good of any individual cell in us multi-cellular eukaryotes is identified with the good of the whole person.\n \n \n\n We have such independent analytical minds, so we don't have to follow our instinctual reactions. I suspect that Darwinists leave the psychological motivations behind human altruism to psychologists to study and they themselves prefer to study the genetically influenced source of apparent altruism (soldier ant sacrificing himself) that exists in the great majority of the animal kingdom. Again, it is a matter of talking apples and oranges.\n\n \n **\n I think that it is a case of Darwinists erecting false dichotomies and cartesian dualisms in order to insulate and protect their supposedly monist mechanist ideology from psychical reality.\n \n \n\n It continues to amaze me how offended you are that someone should \"dare\" question your claims.\n\n \n **\n What's with the \"dare\"?!?! I've been obver this and showed you why and how you were in the wrong. You cannot accept the blame,-- tuff.\n \n \n \n\n Questioning of claims is at the very core of intellectual discussion.\n\n \n **\n Characterizing my acquired opinion as a 'claim' that required 'verification' was and is absurd. Not to mention childishly snotty.\n \n \n\n If claims are never questions, discussions have a tendency to go around in pointless circles or degenerate into flames. Perhaps that is what you most enjoy - flame wars. Not I. I prefer a calm, rational discussion and, unlike you, am completely open to people challenging me to provide evidence for my claims.\n\n \n **\n \n Another self-righteous troll with pretensions to innocence and sanctity.

Here it is again--you keep mis-using the word \"instinctual\", where you very clearly intend, from context, the word, \"mechanical\", i.e., chemically [DNA] determined. Please stop making this mistake, as its repetition is very irritating.\n\n Looking up \"instinct\" in Google, most sites I referenced seemed to attribute it to both learned behavior and genetic influence. So, yes, I agree that instinctual behavior is not purely genetically pre-determined. \n \nOf course, any materialist, [i.e., anyone believes that 'psychical' reality is nothing but chemistry, misunderstood], will insist that our ideas, emotions, imaginations, and dreams are nothing but the chemically determined epiphenomena of genetically determined, 'brains'; but nobody rational need buy into that nightmarish zombie fantasy.\n\n Well, unless one includes the idea of the soul, then our mental existence is purely determined by our physical brains which perhaps is what you are calling a materialist point of view. I doubt that there are many biologists who would claim that our genetics purely determine what it is we think about (there is no Calculus gene, for example) but would agree that our genes do determine the general limitations and possibilities of our brains. \n \nAll \"altruism\" is a product of \"cultural and social development\"-- from amoebae through cellular apoptosis through eusocial bacteria to eukaryotes to the heroics of protective parent animals to those of your local fire brigade. In all cases it is psychology, not chemistry. Very little of it, however, is \"consciously chosen and thought-through\", and that tiny bit is limited to organisms like ourselves that have evolved to the stage where our psychical abilities include self-consciousness and analytical thought.\n\n I think you are attributing too much credit to the mental state of amoebaes to even say they have a \"psychology\". I suspect, though, that any discussion on that point would end up being a difference in definitions, which I really don't feel like debating right now. Let's just say that there is a difference in altruism as experienced by people (and potentially higher level animals) that consciously choose a path of altruism, than that altruism that is practiced by low level animals such as ants, which do not make any deliberate choice on that matter. Do you believe that soldier ants actively and deliberately choose whether or not to fight for their colony? \n \nAnother constantly repeated intentional semantic falsehood--you imply that \"nature\" is purely chemistry/physics, and that \"natural\" is synonymous with \"mechanical\", \"physical\", \"chemical\" and \"material\". You imply that all 'scientists' intend this semantic, when in fact only materialist/mechanist/positivist 'scientists' actually do. And you imply that 'nurture' is something apart from nature, i.e., something 'unnatural'. \n \n \"Nurture\" is very much a part of \"nature\". It can only be excluded from organisms that are incapable of 'learning' from others, or who have no others to learn from. But no normal organism is incapable of learning, and only very rarely do organisms have no others to learn from. And funnily enough, where there are no 'others' to learn from, there is no need for altruism, nor is there any to be found. Obviously.\n\n I used the terms \"nature\" and \"nurture\" mainly in their vernacular form - meaning the difference between what is inherent in us biologically vs that which we learn and have conscious independent control over. \n \nBy \"define\" you really mean, \"determine\", as in \"pre-determined\". That makes what they do inevitable, unavoidable, and mechanical. But I have no reason to believe, [the evolutionary psychology darwinists notwithstanding], that all organismic behaviour [in any organism, however simple it may be as a system], is genetically determined. So far as I know, the gene for the 'instinctive' migratory behaviour of, say, canada geese, [which do not always migrate], has yet to be identified. And where is this 'gene' for 'altruism'?\n\n As I understand it, most behaviors don't have one gene that defines them. Genetics is far more complicated, with certain genes being actives, others inactive, many genes acting interdependently to produce a particular function, etc. I will leave it to those well versed in Genetics to address any details on this point. Also, I do not claim that environment and the learning one gains from interaction with the environment do not play a role.\n \n My main point was to stress the difference between low level animals whose behavior does not really stray from its biologically determined role (such as ants) vs humans and higher level animals that exercise conscious choice. Essentially, if a soldier ant were to exercise true/psychological altruism, then that would imply that he is making a conscious choice. If it were a matter of choice, then you would think that there would be a large number of soldier ants or worker that would think \"Hell, no... I am not going to sacrifice myself for this lot...I'm outta here....\". . \n \nAnalytical reasoning and self-consciousness are not necessary to life, and in fact seem to be present in very few organisms. Perhaps only fully present in ourselves. But most organisms, from eusocial bacteria to flocks of the afore-mentioned Canada Geese, have 'culture'. Instincts are epigenetically inherited habits. They are not immutable. They can evolve, because they did evolve. As they were learned.\n\n Again, this would get into semantics of the word \"culture\". I know, from a few ealier posts of yours, that you define it very differently than most. I prefer not to get into that particular debate.\n \nReally? So you're claiming that 'soldier' ants have different 'genes' from their fellow ants? First I've heard of that. I always understood that 'castes' in eusocial organisms was an epigenetic, developmental matter.\n\n I cannot comment on the genes of one ant vs another, which genes are active in one type of ant vs another, etc. My main point is that the ant is not making a conscious choice in his actions. His actions are determined by his biology, which is ultimately limited by his genes. That does not say that his genes will tell him where to walk, etc. The genes form the basis of his physical capabilities, which then vary depending on the interaction with the environment. For example, the current genetics of ants prevent them from having analytical thinking. They do, however, supply him with the capabilities of sensing and reacting to various chemical signals. \n \nSo do I. You are the one making a distinction between human altruism and non-human altruism, not me.\n\n The distinction I am making is between consciously chosen altruism vs altruism due to automatic behavior - behavior that is determined by the being's biology which, yes, is ultimately limited by genes. \n \nHere you are employing a logical fallacy, by changing categories in mid-stream. The categories are, 1/ a kind of behaviour,[altruism] and 2/ that which causes that behaviour. Darwinists are used to this fallacy, as they constantly conflate evolution with that which causes it,-- so the fallacy comes naturally to them.\n\n I continue to claim that there is more than one type of altruism, as was outlined in that second link I mentioned earlier. One type is biological altruism, the other is psychological or \"real\" altruism. Psychological altruism need conscious deliberate choice. Biological altruism does not need conscious choice. The causes of these two type of altruism need not be the same.\n \nAltruism is altruism, whether its a soldier ant or a fireman laying down his life for his fellows' benefit. The difference between us is that you claim that the ant does so because of some accidentally mutated gene, whereas the fireman has been socialised, i.e., taught, to do what he does. I claim that the trait, altruism, is the same in both, despite the fact that the fireman may actually stop, momentarily, to think about what he's doing, while the ant never does. And in neither case is genetic determism the explanation for it.\n\n The fireman can choose not to do it all together and often chooses not to sacrifice himself. Where there is no choice, where is the implied \"goodness\" or real altruism? We admire those who are altruistic because they know full well that they don't have to do what they do but they choose to sacrifice themselves for others out of empathy and other personal reasons. That is not true of ants.\n \nWhat's with the \"dare\"?!?! I've been obver this and showed you why and how you were in the wrong. You cannot accept the blame,-- tuff. ...\n\n We apparently simply have different expectations of things one can say without justification. If someone makes blanket generalizations, I expect them to at least point to examples. You have no such expectations. This part of our debate is getting tedious, so I will skip it.",

   "\n Well, unless one includes the idea of the soul, then our mental existence is purely determined by our physical brains which perhaps is what you are calling a materialist point of view.\n\n \n **\n Yes, that is what would call the materialist POV. \n \"Soul\", or spirit, or psyche, or mind-- there are lots of words and ways of recognising that life is not simply chemicals interacting blindly. The word used is not important, and its full and proper meaning is an undecided question. But only materialists deny the actual existence of that aspect of reality.\n \n \n\n I doubt that there are many biologists who would claim that our genetics purely determine what it is we think about (there is no Calculus gene, for example) but would agree that our genes do determine the general limitations and possibilities of our brains. \n\n \n **\n Actually, everyday we are informed that the geneticists have now located \"the gene for\"--you name it. And although \"genes\" may have much to say about our 'brains' [but not everything], they do not determine them--not even in the purely physical sense.

Do you believe that soldier ants actively and deliberately choose whether or not to fight for their colony? \n\n \n **\n I think that self-awareness is key to any understanding of 'identity', and 'identity' is key to the understanding of that real quality we call 'altruism'. \n \n That means that eusocial lifeforms, such as bacteria, bees, ants, and so on, where the identity of each part is sublimated within the the identity of the whole, as an 'organism', [just as the individual identities of our own cells are sublimated to the identity of our persons as 'the organism'], is different from identity, self, as experienced by a multi-cellular, organically specialized, [as opposed to 'caste' specialized] organism. Identity among ants and identity among, say, wolves, is comparing, as you say, apples and oranges. Since 'identity', sense of self, ego, psyche, whatever, is so different, the expression of altruism is also different. But that does not make altruism, per se, different. Just as human mental-life is different from say, a shark's, does not mean that a shark does not have intelligence and volition, simply because they are experienced and expressed differently from what we humans experience and express.\n \n \n\n I used the terms \"nature\" and \"nurture\" mainly in their vernacular form - meaning the difference between what is inherent in us biologically vs that which we learn and have conscious independent control over. \n\n \n **\n Yes, I can understand that, but I am not sure that we agree upon, \"what is inherent in us biologically vs that which we learn and have conscious independent control over\", or where and how to draw a line between them. \n \n \n\n As I understand it, most behaviors don't have one gene that defines them. Genetics is far more complicated, with certain genes being actives, others inactive, many genes acting interdependently to produce a particular function, etc. I will leave it to those well versed in Genetics to address any details on this point. Also, I do not claim that environment and the learning one gains from interaction with the environment do not play a role.\n\n \n **\n Again I am in qualified agreement with you. My problem with geneticists, however is that they do not stick to their factual observations, but make some very poorly supported assertions about them, based upon their ideological expectations of them.\n \n \n\n My main point was to stress the difference between low level animals whose behavior does not really stray from its biologically determined role (such as ants) vs humans and higher level animals that exercise conscious choice. \n\n \n **\n But why do you want to stress that difference? Perhaps you have good reason, I do not know. I wish to stress the sameness of altruism throughout biology, because my concern is the essntial fundamental, universal quality found behind all the variety in life forms.\n \n \n\n The distinction I am making is between consciously chosen altruism vs altruism due to automatic behavior - behavior that is determined by the being's biology which, yes, is ultimately limited by genes.\n\n \n \n **\n You seem to be saying that you believe that human beings have freedom of action, i.e., 'free will', but that other organisms do not. Materialists claim that there is no real freedom, that all is chemically determined. I'm more of the opinion that all life is 'free' to some extent, physically constrained otherwise, and that the percentages vary.\n \n \n\n I continue to claim that there is more than one type of altruism, as was outlined in that second link I mentioned earlier. One type is biological altruism, the other is psychological or \"real\" altruism. Psychological altruism need conscious deliberate choice. Biological altruism does not need conscious choice. The causes of these two type of altruism need not be the same.\n\n \n **\n And I pretty much completely disagree with this opinion. \n \n \n\n The fireman can choose not to do it all together and often chooses not to sacrifice himself.

I am speaking of altruism as a natural biological phenomenon, every bit as real as self-centredness. I am not here to discuss the ethics of altruism, as that is not a biological issue. Of course, I do agree that altruism and self-centredness, considered as ethical issues, depend as all moral/ethical and even legal issues do, upon degree of understanding and freedom of choice. Which makes most biological behaviour amoral, if someone wants to debate that issue in the proper thread for it.",
