   "You might expect a thread with a title like this one to be about Fuhrer Obama, but not this time.\n \n Have you ever found American Nazism just a little odd. Apart from the racist rhetoric and the fact they call themselves \"Nazis\", these fellows have little in common with the dead movement they apparently believe themselves to be a part of.\n \n You'll find today's Nazis trying to ingratiate themselves into the anti-government militia movement. You may remember Bill White, \"chief\" of the American Nazi Party claiming Ron Paul was, like him, a Nazi. You'll find Nazis opposing Neoconservativism (on the grounds it is Jewish), President Obama (on the grounds he is black), environmentalism (on the grounds it is Jewish), the federal reserve (on the grounds it is jewish). You'll find Nazis trying to strike up alliances with fundamentalist arab muslims (on the grounds that the Jews are their common enemy) and encouraging them to commit acts of terrorism.\n \n You might excuse today's small-government, pro-arab, pro-terrorist, anti-environmentalist Ron Paul supporting nazis of their hypocrisy on the grounds that they are crazy whackos, but maybe there's a better explanation.\n \n Here's an informative article about some key nazi leaders and agents who are FBI plants;\n \n Prefabricated Fascists: The FBI&#8217;s Assembly-Line Provocateurs by William Norman Grigg\n \n Maybe, just maybe, the Nazi movement is genuinely all these crazy things that don't even make sense from a deranged nazi perspective, and the FBI has just \"infiltrated\" it. But more likely, it's been so thoroughly infiltrated that the entire thing is basically an FBI front, FBI financed, and it's FBI employees deciding what stupid nazi policy prescription to come up with next.\n \n So just remember, the next time some freak shows up here claiming to be an anti-federal-reserve nazi, maybe he isn't all crazy, maybe that's his job.",

   "There's another way this helps to prove the left-wing paranoia of \"right-wing militias\". I don't think very many FBI agents will do a violent act of terrorism that lands them in prison just because the government tells them to. But with this liberal method of demonizing your opponent, we might start hearing stuff about \"Right-wing extremist Nazi shoots up a bunch of innocents, gets off on a technicality.\"",

   "I don't know that it's a strictly left/right thing.\n \n I think from the FBIs perspective, the key threats are those who feel politically disenfranchised.\n \n During the Bush era, this was to a large extent the anti-war protest groups. The attempts by various law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to infiltrate marxist and left-anarchist groups during this time are public knowledge.\n \n You'll also recall during this time the Nazis claiming that neocons were Jewish, and joining in on these rallies with their standard anti-semitic XXXX.\n \n The media picked up on this and it wasn't uncommon to see someone quite innocently using the term \"neocon\" being smeared as a racist.\n \n Funny how quickly these nazis shift their policy focus to align with whatever group would be considered a threat; you don't see marxist groups rocking up to tea-parties now obama is in power.\n \n This conveniently provides whoever is in power with the excuse to claim their opponents are all a bunch of racists - I don't believe that's the \"goal\", but I doubt it would be seen as a downside.\n \n \n I don't think very many FBI agents will do a violent act of terrorism\n\n \n I agree, but I should be clear these people aren't proper \"FBI agents\", they're untrained, unstable individuals who have been threatened with prison time unless they cooperate. So you have the absurd situation where there's a guy financed and directed by the FBI making death threats to judges and hosting a racist radio show where he encourages killing minorities.",
