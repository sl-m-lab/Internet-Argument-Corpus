The great majority of people in the US claim to be religious, yet the polls on various issues show that the majority of people in the US hold a much wider range of views on moral issues than are held by the religious right. It is a pity that one does not hear enough from those with moderate religious views - so the discussions often appears to be more polarized than they actually are. After all, the choice in moral approach is not only between a purely secular or purely religious approach.
