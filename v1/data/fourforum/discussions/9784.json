You're talking about the man who protests funerals of soldiers, the dead miners from the Sago mine tragedy, and many others. He is simply an attention seeking loser, and I hope we don't give him too much. I would thought that we would have learned our lesson with this jackass. \n \n While I agree that he should be taken deep in the forest and beaten with a rusty muffler until he be dead, he is \"protected\" by his right to free speech. I really think there should be recognized limits to free speech when it comes to people like Phelps. He seems to get off on causing pain to the surviving victims.",
