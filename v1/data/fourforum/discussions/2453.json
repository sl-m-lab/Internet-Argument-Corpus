   "Hey all,\n \n Just a quick question about the US voting system. Just to put it into context,\n \n I am British, born to British parents, however my mother worked for the Diplomatic Service as a Translator and hence was working for the UN in New York when I was born. We moved back to Blighty when I was 3, but I still retain US citizenship and have hence applied for a postal vote for the upcoming elections, the ballot for which arrived yesterday. Unfortunately it appears quite different from the British system I am used to so I am a bit confused over a couple of things.\n \n Firstly it is for the 'primary' election in June, and not the general one in November. Now what is a primary? At first I thought it was a local election, but if that is a case why can I vote for the president in it?\n \n And secondly it seems to imply that both my presidential choice, and choice for the house of representatives must be from the same party. Is that correct? It seems rather strange for that to be the case, especially for someone like me who holds strong left and right wing views.\n \n I appreciate any light you guys can shed on this.",

   "\n Firstly it is for the 'primary' election in June, and not the general one in November. Now what is a primary? At first I thought it was a local election, but if that is a case why can I vote for the president in it?\n\n \n Hi Phunting,\n \n Sounds like you've received the absentee ballot for the Democratic primary in which John Kerry is the presumptive nominee. During our caucuses and primaries earlier this year, delegates were selected to attend this June event and cast their votes according to the dictates of their state's general voting. Why you have received this instead of the actual November ballot is puzzling. I suspect it's a mistake since the presidential ballots have not been printed yet, seeing Kerry has not been crowned by his party yet.\n \n We hold caucuses and primaries in an effort to further democratize the process of selecting our president, to try to include more citizens in the process. In the bad old days, power brokers used to do the selecting behind the scenes and then present the candidates for our consideration. Now anyone can run. \n \n \n\n \n And secondly it seems to imply that both my presidential choice, and choice for the house of representatives must be from the same party. Is that correct? It seems rather strange for that to be the case, especially for someone like me who holds strong left and right wing views.\n \n \n\n \n Further evidence to me of an absentee Democratic primary ballot.\n \n regards",

Maybe it's an official ballot for New York state if there are Representatives to choose. I hope there's instructions enclosed with whom to contact for questions. \n \n Primaries and their twin, caucuses, are a game of musical chairs. Instead of playing music, candidates flesh out their positions state by state. Those that sing a good tune to the listeners are assured a chair --which translates to money -- when the voting in each state occurs. The chairs continue to dwindle down to one, which will be given to the presumptive nominee. A national convention will then be held to make it official. He alone will appear on the national ballot as the Democratic choice for president (Dennis Kucinch, who is still running as a Democrat despite having no chair to sit in will not be on the ballot). This process winnows candidates down to one per party.The Republicans did not go through the process this election cycle only because no one wanted to challenge the sitting president. \n \n I hope \"musical chairs\" is not an exclusive American idiom, otherwise I've further muddied the waters.",
