   "Miss Beverly Hills 2010 Opposes Marriage Equality, Thinks Gays Should Heed Bible's Warning That They'll Be Put to Death\n \n Miss Beverly Hills 2010 Opposes Marriage Equality, Thinks Gays Should Heed Bible's Warning That They'll Be Put to Death - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n Via Boy Culture comes news of Miss Beverly Hills 2010 Lauren Ashley, who is the latest beauty queen from California to object to same-sex marriage.\n \n Laurenashley Says Ashley to FOX News: \"The Bible says that marriage is between a man and a woman. In Leviticus it says, 'If man lies with mankind as he would lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death and their blood shall be upon them.' The Bible is pretty black and white. I feel like God himself created mankind and he loves everyone, and he has the best for everyone. If he says that having sex with someone of your same gender is going to bring death upon you, that's a pretty stern warning, and he knows more than we do about life.'\"\n \n Ashley will be competing in the Miss California pageant in November. She's a big fan of Carrie Prejean, and has \"no hate\" for anybody, even her gay friends:\n \n \"That isn't really the issue. I have a lot of friends that are gay, and ... I have a lot of friends who have different views, and we share our views together.\"",
