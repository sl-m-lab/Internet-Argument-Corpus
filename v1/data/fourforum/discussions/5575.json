   "The Motives for the first Crusade\n \n Through religious passions and desires to aid their Christian brethren the first crusade came into being. What appeared on the surface to be a morally pure imperative took a wicked turn to a frenzied riot. The first crusade flowed toward the last portion of the Roman Empire like a river of blood. \n To understand more deeply the motives of these Christian crusaders one must examine the background from which the crusades emerged. Apparently battles were being fought before the official crusade had begun. A reading of a letter from Pope Leo IV reveals that some battles against the Muslims had already began. Presumably, Pope Leo IV had written a letter to the Frankish army following a question about receiving an eternal reward for service in the, \"...defense of Christians.\" (Patrologia Latina, 115:656-657, and 161:720). It was interesting that an interest was firmly in place about an eternal reward for those who would die in battle as early as 847 AD (Patrologia Latina, 115:656-657, and 161:720). There would appear to be a motive to fight in this war -eternal salvation. It is questionable whether the Pope thought that an encroaching Muslim world (in 847) was a serious threat to Christian Europe. \n A further confirmation was requested again in 878 AD by some bishops in the realm of Louis II (Patrologia Latina, 126:816). Again the Pope (John VIII) admits to a war being fought against the, \"...pagans or unbelievers....\" (Patrologia Latina, 126:816). The bishops wanted confirmation from Pope John VIII about those who had already died and those who would die if they would receive an, \"...indulgence for their sins.\" (Patrologia Latina, 126:816). The Pope had used a proof text from the bible to confirm his belief about indulgences for the dead, \"...in whatever hour a sinner shall be converted, I (Jesus) will remember his sins no longer.\" (Patrologia Latina, 126:816). It is interesting to note that the Pope is addressing an issue about the dead. Does that mean that only those who died in these battles are the ones who will receive an indulgence from sins?\n Even thou Pope Gregory VII wrote a letter considering the possibility of a crusade (1074 AD), the crusade was not official until later. Gregory refers to these Muslims as, \"a pagan race.\" (Patrologia Latina 148:389). Gregory thought it necessary to use a proof text from the bible to justify his position, \"...because he has laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\" (Patrologia Latina 148:329).\n The birth of the first crusade was made official after Pope Urban II gave his speech. The background that led to the official crusade seems to stem from a religious desire for an eternal reward, and the desire of the Popes to bring some kind of military aid to their brethren. Pope Urban II made public his desire for Christian Europe to march against the Muslims (Bongars Gesta Dei per Francos, 1, 382). The Pope had claimed that he spoke for god, \"...I or rather the Lord beseech you...\" (Bongars Gesta Dei per Francos, 1, 382). The Pope's aim was to have the Christian armies destroy the \"vile race\" from the lands of his friends. In addition the belief that one's sins will be forgiven if they die in battle is restated (Bongars Gesta Dei per Francos, 1, 382). The Pope also said that if aid was not given to the Greeks that God would surely punish them (Bongars Gesta Dei per Francos, 1, 382). It should be noted that before the Pope spoke about the crusade he mentions the evilness of those who rob the church whether by not faithfully paying alms or capturing the fortunes of church officials (Bongars Gesta Dei per Francos, 1, 382). According to Urban those who continue to rob the church will be cursed. After Urban's discourse about robbery he appeals for a reenactment of the truce. It is speculation that Urban II may have wanted to export an element of violence from Europe. If the Pope was intentionally getting rid of a violent element it certainly would add to his coffers. \n Other than Urban's speech there were further motivations. France had been in a severe civil war, which inflicted famine, and sickness (Readings in European History, Vol.I:316:318). People reported seeing signs such as prophets and heavenly signs. An account of one of these signs was possibly the Halley or Ikeya-Seki comet which ranges from 76.09 to 880 deferential years, \"...its brilliancy slanting down seemed like a sword.\" (Readings in European History, Vol.I:316:318). These religious overtures are an indication of the mental state of Christian Europeans at the time. The people had become transfixed about the crusade and a cause that seemingly was bigger than themselves. The crusade had given them a reason to leave their sorrows and possibly move into a brighter and better future. If the immediate future was not any better than their present at least the Pope had given them assurance of an eternal reward -from the mouth of god. \n In addition to a motivation for a release from famine, civil war, and religious fanaticism there was a motivation to power. There is a splendid account of Duke Robert making territorial progress in the remaining portions of the Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) where he had put it upon himself to put a puppet king on the throne. Anna Comnena chronicles the event,\n For now they recognized Duke Robert's aim, and saw that he had occupied the plain of Illyria, not for the purpose of pillaging towns and county, collecting a large store of booty, and then returning to Apulia, as rumor had reported, but that he was really striving for the mastership of the Roman Empire, and was anxious to take Dyrrachium by storm, to start with so to say. So Palacologus ordered the question to be asked from the walls: 'For what purpose had Robert entered their country?' He replied, 'In order to restore Michael, my kinsman, who was expelled from the Empire, to his former high position, to wipe out the insults heaped upon him, and generally to avenge him.' (The Alexiad 143).\n \n It seems that the Normans had developed a different agenda than the one Urban II had intended. Even after the besieged people replied that if they saw Michael they would do obeisance to him and hand over the city, but after seeing him they poured down insults and said that he was not Michael and the war continued. So much to the idea of aiding our brethren, it quickly turned into a crusade of power and plunder (Alexiad 143). \n In conclusion it is apparent that Europeans went on crusades for various reasons. One, there was instilled into the people a deep desire for an eternal reward. The Popes, Leo IV, John VIII, Gregory VII and Urban II had repeatedly stated and re-stated that by their authority they would receive an eternal reward. If nothing else these men appear to be hubristic, taking on the authority of god. This issue must be cultural as well as religious. These people really thought they needed this eternal reward, because their mindset was conditioned to think in terms of redemption and salvation. These people had a sense of guilt and associated with religious teaching. Two, it is speculation that the Pope wanted to rid Europe of a violent element that was having free reign over church property and money. Even thou a desire for money is speculation, it is good speculation. The Popes were not the only ones who wanted money, because apparently Duke Robert wanted some too. Anna Comena mentions that others had come to the Empire's aid only to pillage their towns, country, and collected large sums of booty. Three, there may have been a desire to rid Europe of aggressive people. Apparently a series of civil wars and Viking raids were having a serious toll on Europe. If the Popes were aware of a problem of aggressive people than it would make perfectly good sense to rid the world of them. Four, there was a desire to become powerful. The accounts of Robert attempting to marshal in a new empire is an interesting one. To people like Anna Comnena there was no doubt to the intentions of these Europeans -they want power. Finally there was a hunger for revenge. The Popes wanted revenge for the conquest and suffering the \"pagans\" had caused their Christian brethren. The Popes wanted to rid the world of that \"vile race\" and to do it by calling on the power of their influence of a (apparently) deeply religious community. This is not mere bandying of words, because such words as, those pagans, and vile race could only mean one thing -hate. \n What may have been intended to be a rescue mission to the dying lights of an Old Empire turned into a farce. The Popes wanted money, revenge and the elimination of some malcontents. The crusaders wanted power, prestige, revenge, the hope of a better life and if all else fails eternal life. The result was a waste of human life, money and a hastening death of the grandest and most excellent empire in world history. \n \n \n Work Cited\n Anna Comena The Alexiad.
