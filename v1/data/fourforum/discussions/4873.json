It doesn't matter that the higher income schmuck got in their mess because their HMO refused to pay the bills. One pays.

   "I think we are going to see a lot more of this kind of thing as our economy continues down the drain. Personal debt is at an all time high, and the fed is expected to continue raising interest rates until we hit 4.5%, despite an absolutely flat demand for expansion capitol. This does not bode well for the American public, especially those who were stupid enough to saddle themselves with adjustable rate debt during the recent period of low interest rates. \n \n Your average American is carrying more debt than they can hope to repay in the face of a declining economy and a weaker dollar, especially considering the increase in energy costs and food prices (which have just started to head for the sky) resulting from that weak dollar. \n \n Corporate interests, especially lending companies, are going to be pushing harder and harder for ways to ensure that they will be able to collect on the outstanding debt. Personally, I think the old bankruptcy laws were fine. They were essentially based on the fact that you cannot squeeze blood out of a stone. As Symbiote pointed out, the real problem here is not irresponsible consumers, but rather irresponsible lending institutions who voluntarily loan people more money than they can ever hope to repay. As far as I am concerned, if a bank is willing to make unsecured loans, and they do so to people who do not have the ability to repay them, and they (the bank) gets screwed out of their money, that is what they get for being XXXXXX.",

That should be a real wakeup call to all the folks out there making $40-$100k per year with no savings and very little equity in their homes who are driving around in their new car that they are upside down in.

We have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. Are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?\n\n \n Long term must be defined. If one looks at futurist projections, continent affiliation, the world is probably 25-50-years away from exhausting natural resources and low cost labor as a global trade format. My chronological age places me a position to where I look at 20-years as 'long-term'. \n \n When I look at the next 20-years, what attracts my attention is China. Their 10-year plans, the only substantial nation I'm aware of with the ability to enforce that degree of planning, intends to raise their per-capita income from a current $1k to $10k (present net value) by 2021. They're running an average 8% of real GDP growth, without national debt and positive trade balance, which makes that goal achievable. So I look at that per-capita income as a benchmark. \n \n Europe's EU is moving towards combining low labor cost nations with mature, high social cost nations, which, if they move fast enough and get most all of that continent's nations involved, will allow that affiliation to service niche markets, mostly middle/higher-end, but eventually lower the per-capita income of that affiliation to a level that will move closer to Asian (China) standards.\n \n The Americas, with Canada and S. America holding most resource assets and the US as the largest consumer of resources (importer and debtor), will eventually reduce standards of living in the US until S. America's resources are utilized to evenly distribute that continent's per-capita income levels. \n \n To answer your question, no, service level economies can't exist forever without lowering standards of living until an accepted, factual, two-tiered society is established. Trade is still the measure of national, or affilated wealth. That means value added exports move wealth from one entity to another. As usual, haves will dictate terms to have-nots.",
