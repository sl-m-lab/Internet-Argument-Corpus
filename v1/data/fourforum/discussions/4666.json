   "Both traditions are pagan in root.\n \n Christmas (to any biblical scholar worth his/her salt, not the actual birthday of Christ) takes place around the changing of the seasons because people were already celebrating THAT before magical super-beings like Jesus showed up in ancient folklore. The virgin birth story itself can be found in Babylonian and Zoroastrian mythologies (both pre-dating Christianity)\n \n Easter was originally known as \"Ester\", a celebrating of the Goddess of the same name. Like Christmas, it was a celebrated in recognition of the seasons changing. Spring - Beginnings. This is why symbols of fertility are used to illustrate the holiday: Rabbits & eggs.\n \n Celebrating the changing of the seasons makes some sense to me. Certainly more than does celebrating bizarre notions of an invisible creator of everything impregnating a middle eastern woman thousands of years ago, and an undead zombie saviour flying through the air.\n \n Happy Easter!\n \n Walk into the light...\n emoticon_idea emoticon_xchicken",
