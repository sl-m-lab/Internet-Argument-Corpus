(A trait of a good scientist is to consider opposing viewpoints and alternatives, not to ignore them.)\n \n 6) Show me even one instance of the National media coming out with a story that questioned Darwinism or explained the other side of the debate.\n \n 7) Show me one instance of a genetic mistake (random mutation/copying error) that that created a beneficial body part.\n \n 8.) Show me one instance where an accumulation of mutations created a new species.\n \n 9) Show me one instance of a mutation that formed a new organ or limb.\n \n 10.) Show me one instance of a mutation that created a beneficial, selectable modification to an existing structure.\n \n Gould: \"You don't make a new species by mutating the species. A mutation is not the cause of evolutionary change.\"\n \n 11) Show me one instance of natural selection proven by controlled experiment. Heck, show me one controlled experiment attempting to test natural selection.\n \n 12) Show me one instance of a new gene forming that codes a new protein and performs a new function.\n \n 13) Show me one instance of a new developmental pathway forming.\n \n 14) Show me in the fossil record evidence of millions of bizarre, experimental phenotypic monstrosities that no-doubt had to occur.

Its a good bet that since individuals within a species are not genetically identical that individuals across species will not be either. Anything else?\n\n \n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/96/9/5101.pdf\n \n ABSTRACT Darwin's finches comprise a group of passerine\n birds first collected by Charles Darwin during his visit\n to the Gala'pagos Archipelago. The group, a textbook example\n of adaptive radiation (the diversification of a founding population\n into an array of species differentially adapted to\n diverse environmental niches), encompasses 14 currently\n recognized species, of which 13 live on the Gala'pagos Islands\n and one on the Cocos Island in the Pacific Ocean. Although\n Darwin's finches have been studied extensively by morphologists,\n ecologists, and ethologists, their phylogenetic relationships\n remain uncertain. Here, sequences of two mtDNA\n segments, the cytochrome b and the control region, have been\n used to infer the evolutionary history of the group. The data\n reveal the Darwin's finches to be a monophyletic group with\n the warbler finch being the species closest to the founding\n stock, followed by the vegetarian finch, and then by two sister\n groups, the ground and the tree finches. The Cocos finch is\n related to the tree finches of the Gala'pagos Islands. The\n traditional classification of ground finches into six species\n and tree finches into five species is not reflected in the\n molecular data. In these two groups, ancestral polymorphisms\n have not, as yet, been sorted out among the cross-hybridizing\n species.\n \n \n The situation resembles that of\n the Lake Victoria haplochromine flock, in which at least some\n species are morphologically well differentiated, but cannot be\n distinguished at the molecular level (31, 32). Although molecular\n polymorphism does exist in the fish flock in both\n mtDNA (32) and nuclear DNA (33) segments, it is widely\n shared by different species (33). In the ground and tree finches,\n too, identical or closely related alleles (haplotypes) of mtDNA\n segments (34) and of allozyme-encoding nuclear genes (5) are\n shared by different species. ",

   "1) Show me one instance where science transplanted a group of animals to a new environment and observed them for multiple generations to see if new traits quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly emerged. \n\n \n Zoos are indeed a good example. Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates. And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo: the absence of any predators, and the absence of any prey. So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?\n \n \n2) Show me one instance of science testing/disproving lamarckian-style inheritance.\n\n \n This is a rather ambiguous and misleading request, though I'm sure you didn't intend it to be. The question is not 'does lamarckian-style inheritence ever/never occur', but 'where does epigenetic inheritance fit into evolution?'\n \n Many acquired traits are not inherited. Some are, through epigenetic mechanisms. Many inherited, acquired traits are not a helpful response to the stimulus; some are. So while epigenetic inheritance clearly plays an important role in evolutionary biology, it doesn't fulfil the Lamarckian vision of environmental/behavioural induction of adaptive phenotypic traits, and those traits being broadly inheritable, thus forming the backbone (sorry) of evolution.\n \n If you think I'm being mealy-mouthed about this, I assure you I'm not. I could answer your request with strict correctness by showing one example of an acquired trait not being inherited - but then I would be doing the spirit of the question an injustice.\n \n \n3) Show me one instance (controlled experiment) where science set out to prove/disprove darwinism on animals.\n\n \n Here you go.\n \n There are plenty more such studies in the bacteriological realm, but I expect you are looking for something on a more macro scale.\n \n \n4) Show me one instance where science dated a dinosaur with carbon 14 to rule out recent existence.\n\n \n How do you carbon-date a rock?\n \n \n5) Show me one instance of an evolutionist (any book, any website) admitting that \"evolution\" may not be evolution at all, but simply an individual organism's ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment - that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change....and instead of vertically, evolution first happens horizontally. (A trait of a good scientist is to consider opposing viewpoints and alternatives, not to ignore them.)\n\n \n Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened.\n \n \n6) Show me even one instance of the National media coming out with a story that questioned Darwinism or explained the other side of the debate.\n \n\n \n \"Scientists pick holes in Darwin moth theory\" by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph (March, 1999)\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate, though. ID? EAM? YEC?\n \n \n7) Show me one instance of a genetic mistake (random mutation/copying error) that that created a beneficial body part.\n \n\n \n What do you mean by 'part'? If you're asking for an example of a single mutation that created an arm or a leg where none existed before, then you're asking for evidence of something that the ToE in no way shape or form says is possible. The very fact you think such an event is necessary in order for evolution to have occurred demonstrates your ignorance of that which you oppose so vehemently.\n \n Sickle-cell is a pretty good example, though, if you're prepared to accept blood as a 'body part'. Mostly, sickle-cell is a bad thing; if you get two copies of it in your genome from your parents, you get sickle-cell anaemia which causes no end of trouble:\n \n \nAlthough several hundred HBB gene variants are known, sickle cell anemia is most commonly caused by the hemoglobin variant Hb S. In this variant, the hydrophobic amino acid valine takes the place of hydrophilic glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid position of the HBB polypeptide chain. This substitution creates a hydrophobic spot on the outside of the protein structure that sticks to the hydrophobic region of an adjacent hemoglobin molecule's beta chain. This clumping together (polymerization) of Hb S molecules into rigid fibers causes the \"sickling\" of red blood cells.\n\n \n With me so far? A point mutation to a gene. \"Ah, but it's not beneficial\", I hear you cry.\n \n Oh, but it can be. Sickle cell is very prevalent in tropical climates like Africa, because while two copies of the gene is a bad thing, a single copy confers malarial resistance, and in tropical countries malaria is responsible for more deaths than pretty much anything. If I recall correctly, mosquitos have caused something like half of all human deaths, ever. So in malarial regions of the world, the benefit of carrying sickle cell, to both you and your offspring, mitigates the increased child mortality rate sickle-cell anaemia induces.\n \n \n8.) Show me one instance where an accumulation of mutations created a new species.\n\n \n Strictly speaking, accumulation of mutations alone isn't what creates a new species; so long as a species interbreeds well, it can accumulate or lose an arbitrary number of mutations (variants of alleles); though it may change in form it will remain one species. Also, a species can split in two simply through allelic segregation: no strictly new mutations involved, just the segregation of alleles that used to be distributed throughout an interbreeding population into two seperate populations that don't or can't interbreed.\n \n It's a mistake to think of species as strictly delimited in the same sense as biblical 'kinds'; indeed, the whole notion of a 'species' is hard to define consistently. For instance, two species may (at the moment) be entirely interfertile but not choose to breed (phenotypic segregation), or they may be able to interbreed but have offspring that have a greater or lesser chance of fertility (eg horses and donkeys, lions and tigers), or they may be incapable of interbreeding. Trying to play it safe and say 'a species is a group of animals that can interbreed' also causes problems in the case of ring species. \n \n Imagine looking down on a hill from above, and imagine a clockface superimposed on it. A species starts at 6'oclock and gradually expands its range around the hill over many generations. By the time the two ends of the expansion meet, at 12 o'clock, it's possible that those two extremes of the population have ceased to be interfertile, despite 1 being still able to breed with 2, 2 with 3 and so on around to 12. One could then very easily create two species out of one by simply eradicating the population at 2 through 11.\n \n \n9) Show me one instance of a mutation that formed a new organ or limb.\n \n\n \n Not possible, and not predicted or required by the ToE either, so it's a strawman.\n \n \n10.) Show me one instance of a mutation that created a beneficial, selectable modification to an existing structure.\n\n \n Ah, this is a much better place to employ the sickle cell example. Also there are squillions of examples in evolutionary bacteriology.\n \n \n11) Show me one instance of natural selection proven by controlled experiment. Heck, show me one controlled experiment attempting to test natural selection.\n\n \n Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick :) Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.\n \n \n12) Show me one instance of a new gene forming that codes a new protein and performs a new function.\n\n \n Here you go.\n \n \n13) Show me one instance of a new developmental pathway forming.\n \n\n \n Not sure what you mean by that; can you elaborate?\n \n \n14) Show me in the fossil record evidence of millions of bizarre, experimental phenotypic monstrosities that no-doubt had to occur. Show me any from today. (I'm not talking defects...I'm talking new, beneficial body parts that appear in weird places for no reason.)\n\n \n The ToE doensn't predict such events, so it's pointless asking to see them; their absence doesn't help your case at all. And how exactly can one have a beneficial body part, which is nevertheless in some weird place for no reason?\n \n \n15) Explain to me why we don't see humans or dogs or alligators with accidental wings forming. (If the possibility was there for random mutations to produce wings on reptiles or mammals in the past, then it should also be happening now.)\n\n \n Oh dear; where do I even start?\n \n Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't.\n \n The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps, each one of them being useful, or at least associated with something useful. We don't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic, and probably epigenetic, change. What we do see are more mundane, less drastic variations which can accumulate over time.\n \n It's tempting to think \"wings evolving from arms; huh, what about the millions of years when they were neither; how could they have been 'fittest'?\" The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then' to 'now', as if the organism knew where it was headed. A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms, but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage, such as we see in flying squirrels today. If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important, those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected. The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern; who knows, in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today.\n \n So in a sense, 'flying squirrels' are your answer. I can't guarantee they'll evolve more and more wing-like structures over the next few million years, but it's possible.\n \n \n16) show me set of skeletons that transition from ape to man by way of small modifications.\n\n \n I can show you skeletons showing the transition from ape ancestors to man, if that's any use? Although you've already been shown them several times and had their painstakingly-dated chronological sequence explained to you, so I'm not sure why you want to see them again.\n \n \n17) Show me how a cell could evolve randomly: \n\n \n Very, very slowly, latterly from something almost like a cell, and before that from something a bit less like a cell, and so forth. The cell is not an irreducible organic 'atom', and did not have to spring into existence in one go.\n \n \n18. Show me some instances of mutations that add information to the genome:\n\n \n You've had problems with this in other threads. You've said that a modification to the genome is not new information, just 'altered' information, which makes no sense at all. You can't alter information. You can alter physical stuff so that it stops representing one piece of information and starts representing another, but the idea that the information has altered is way off base. I could turn any sentence into any other sentence - even into a sentence that has never been written before - just by tweaking the letters one by one. Is the end product not a 'new' sentence?",

   "From Supersport at Theology Web, 21 January 2007, http://www.theologyweb.com/campus/showthread.php?t=91038\n \n Here's how life really operates.....\n \n Take a look at this link: http://people.bu.edu/jtouchon/tadpole.htm\n \n In it you will see an experiment with tadpoles. Some tadpoles were raised in an enviornment with fish; some with dragonfly nymphs; and some alone.\n \n If you were to believe evolutionists, you would have to believe that a tadpole is a tadpole is a tadpole. And specific traits would only arise from the luck of the draw. But look at the above link. What really happens is tadpole generate different traits based on their predators. The tadpoles raised with dragonfly nymphs generated shorter bodies and different colored tails than those raised alone or with fish.\n \n Thus if a population of tadpoles were raised in a pond that was newly inhabited by dragonfly nymphs, it might APPEAR that tadpoles evolved new traits via selection....but what's really happening is phenotypic plasticity.\n \n My assertion is that much of what is considered \"evolution\" in the field is nothing more than a morphological response similar to what the tadpoles show in this link. Finch beaks, moth wing variation, lizard legs, and every other so-called \"proof\" of evolution would be no different.\n \n This is why it's extrememly important that science does controlled experiments. If the experiments are not controlled and populations of animals are merely observed generating new triats in the field after serveral years or generations, there is no scientific justification in saying the traits were formed via selection.\n \n Not only that, but why is it that science is willing to test plasticity, yet is not willing to carry the test out further to see if the offspring of tadpoles emerge with shorter bodies and redder tails? Why won't they test the concept that individuals can evolve?\n \n My final comment/question, aside from the fact that this tadpole example falsifies the linked explanation for evolution, is I would like you evolutionists to tell me how this is accomplished. I mean HOW does the tail of a tadpole change to red simply because a predator is around? How does that happen without the mind or some sort of intelligence being involved? I would like an explanation.\n \n Please also keep in mind that if all observed occurrences of evolution are actually just cases of phenotypic plasticity, then there's no sense in saying Selection actually occurs. If selection doesn't occur then evolution is falsified. \n\n \n From Justin Charles Touchon, author of \"Predator-Induced Developmental Plasticity of Hyla ebraccata tadpoles\", the study that SS is misrepresenting \n \n Dear Supersport,\n This will be my one and only post to this message board. It is my research you are falsely using to support your arguments. Please do not reference my work in this way in the future.\n \n Your interpretation of the plastic responses of tadpoles to chemicals produced by predators is false. Much research (not my own, look for research by Robert Denver) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey, or changing environments in general, activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color. It has nothing to do with the tadpoles \"desire\" to have a larger or redder tail, it is simply a physiological response. The tadpoles have not \"evolved\" during the course of their development, as you assert. An induced phenotype is not heritable, the ability to induce it is. The tadpoles with the red tails will not produce red tailed tadpoles when they are adults. Those with clear tails will not produce clear tailed tadpoles. They will both produce tadpoles that have the ability to make either phenotype.\n \n -Justin \n\n \n \n Moral: Do not feed the troll. \n He can't see beyond his preconceptions and won't understand what you say. You probably have better things to do.",

Anyone glossing over the fact that dinosaur soft tissue was found embedded in the bones, only to turn their head to the sky and wonder how it could have lasted 70 million years is a dang fool.\n\n \n This has been explained to you too many times to count. \"Red, soft tissue\" was not \"dug out of dinosaur bones\". I've explained this to you at least twice, and I know others have explained this to you as well. Mary Schweitzer herself denies your interpretation of her findings.\n \n This leaves only two conclusions: 1) you are a dishonest person who conciously lies to further your own agenda, or 2) you are unable to comprehend what is said to you, and it is in fact a wonder that you are able to operate a computer without electrocuting yourself and those around you.\n \n So, which is it SS? Liar, or just plain stupid?",

   "SS: [COLOR=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;]No they're not....do zoos document the changes in phenotype that no-doubt occur? This is not the zoo's job -- their job is not experimentation on animals -- that's science's job. Besides that, zoos do their darndest to house the animals in habitats that mimic the animals' natural settings.\n\n \n We've covered that: zoos do not include predators or prey in those environments. And even if they didn't document minor phenotypic changes, they would surely notice a porcupine being born with no quills, or a tortoise with no shell!\n \n \nNo it is not. Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. I'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.\n\n \n Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.\n \n \nHere you go.\n \n that's not a controlled experiment. try again.\n\n \n Er, yes it was, SS; try reading it again.\n \n \nyou don't...you break open the \"rock\" and carbon date the soft, flexible parts that somehow survived for 100 million years without turning to stone. (It would also help if you broke the big bones open and looked for such tissue...something science evidently never has done either until Mary S. did it a couple years ago.\n\n \n You're over-egging the pudding a little, SS:\n \n \nSo what about the \"soft\" tissue? Well, Humber makes a very common creationist mistake by asserting that \"Dinosaur tissue has been extracted from bone fossils and has been found to be both soft and flexible,\" which shows that he did not read Schweitzer's 2005 paper on her findings. There's really no excuse; it's available for free through the website of the journal Science, and the second sentence of the materials & methods section explains that Schweitzer did not stick in her thumb, pull out some Tyrannosaurus soft tissue, and say \"Gee what a good girl am I\" (and yes, I am aware that Schweitzer began this study under the guidance of paleontologist John \"Jack\" Horner). The opening of the supplement reads;\n \n Small (0.05-2 inches width) fragments of untreated compact and undescribed (1S) endosteally derived bone tissues were separated from Tyrannosaurus rex (MOR 1125) femur and collected under a hood, using aseptic methods. Tissues were demineralized (0.5M EDTA,pH 8.0) for 7 days, changing buffer daily. Material remaining after demineralization was rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 6.8) and imaged using a Zeiss dissecting scope with a digital camera and Axio Vision Software (other dinosaur specimens were demineralized according to this protocol but no further analyses were undertaken for this study).\n \n Rather than putting her hand in a pile of goo, Schweitzer separated the tissues and tried to remove as much mineral material as possible, leaving only the organic material behind. Indeed, this dinosaur (like many) was still in the process of fossilization when extracted from the ground, and there was significant enough mineral material around the tissues for Schweitzer to spend time dissolving them.\n\n \n The reason carbon dating is not being used on the remains is that even the most advanced C14 dating methods can only - even in principle - report a date within the last 60,000 years or so. Try to date something older and you'll get a result, but it won't be right. Nor will it be pegged to the 60,000 year end of the scale, like a redlined engine; it could come back with anything. The fossils in question have been dated via numerous other methods, all of which are in agreement - what the heck is the point of performing another test which you know will yield a 'young' result even if the fossil is old? What could such a test possibly tell us?\n \n Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - \n \n \nI say new, beneficial traits arise across a given population at the same time because the traits arise from within each creature. Likewise genes may be transferred from one species to another horizontally, without selection.\n \n\n \n The latter does happen, though not often enough to explain evolution. Again, your're bending over backwards to exclude one part of the ToE, but you're using other parts of the ToE to try and do so. And you can certainly 'say' whatever you like; what would help is some evidence.\n \n \nSickle-cell is a pretty good example, though, if you're prepared to accept blood as a 'body part'. \n \n I'm not....besides, sickle cell adds nothing benefical in the way of phenotype. We've been over this here. Have anything else?\n\n \n Sickle cell trait confers malarial resistance, a phenotypic benefit. I'm not going to go charging off finding more examples if you're just going to stick your fingers in your ears and pretend you can't hear me.\n \n \nStrictly speaking, accumulation of mutations alone isn't what creates a new species; so long as a species interbreeds well, \n \n well since you can't show me one case of speciation, with backup that the old and the new species can't interbreed and produce viable offspring, we'll just assume that it can't be done at all.\n\n \n I quite forgot to include my reference, so caught up was I in correcting your use of 'species' :) Sorry! The rest of the page also illustrates the difficulty in selecting criteria for judging what counts as a 'species'.\n \n You have to remember that speciation does not necessarily begin with cross-infertility, and there's no particular requirement that it ever occur - though the accumulation of different mutations and phenotypic variations in the two populations can make it more and more likely. After all, lions and tigers have been seperated for how long now, and they still retain a degree of interfertility.\n \n When considering this process, try to bear in mind is that it begins when two populations within a species don't interbreed, and ends when they can't. The duration of that process can be anything from a single generation to tens of millions of years; one should not expect to always be able to see the whole process occur within the practical duration of an experiment.\n \n \n \ncool, ok...we agree there. Do you think a mutation can create a partial organ or limb?...like say 1/100th of one -- and be selected for?\n\n \n Depends what you mean by '1/100th' :) \n \n If you mean 'a tiny fraction of the \"final\" structure', like one brick on the way to making a house, then no. If you mean 'a structure with a tiny fraction of the functionality', then yes. Take the heart, for example. Flatworms have no circulatory system at all; each cell absorbs its own oxygen directly from the environment, and nutrients are similarly delivered 'direct to doorstep' through a branching internal digestive tract. In terms of structure, flatworms are almost a colony of independent creatures. The morphology of the flatworm is limited by the requirement that all cells be close enough to the surface to 'breathe'.\n \n Lancelets have a circulatory system but no heart; blood is moved around the body through the action of muscles that have other primary functions. Passing oxygen and nutrients via an internal system makes new body shapes and sizes possible. In earthworms, again there is no identifiable heart as such, but there are muscles and structures dedicated to promoting the movement of blood through the circulatory system. It's pretty easy to find examples spanning the whole range of 'heart' complexity, and that's just in animals that exist today.\n \n \nPretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick :) Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.\n \n those are not animals and it's not RMNS....it's simply a fluid, adaptive genome at work. If RMNS worked in the petri dish then it should work by way of controlled experiments on actual animals -- which ToE scientists refuse to do.\n\n \n Sorry, but when mutations occur prior to exposure to a new environment, the 'adaptive genome' idea goes sailing out of the window. The mutation could not have been a stimulated response, and the numerical proliferation of offspring in the selective environment is NS at work.\n \n \nyes, it is of use -- show me.\n\n \n Ok, but first - since I've been so accommodating so far - tell me what you mean by 'transitional'. Include every criteria you would use to judge whether or not a sequence of fossils was transitional, and explain how it would be practically possible to test fossils against those criteria.\n \n \nHa! do you agree that the first winged animals came from non-winged animals or not? If so, what's the difference?\n\n \n The first winged animals came from animals that had structures very very nearly identical to wings. The first of those came from animals with structures a bit less like wings, and so forth. There was no 'holy ####, dude, where did you get those?' moment.\n \n It's as if you're looking at a chunk of stone, a statue, and a chisel, and saying \"There's no way one lucky hit with that chisel could produce that statue.\" Can't you see how absurd that is?",

   "Originally Posted by supersport View Post\n SS: [color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;]No they're not....do zoos document the changes in phenotype that no-doubt occur? This is not the zoo's job -- their job is not experimentation on animals -- that's science's job. Besides that, zoos do their darndest to house the animals in habitats that mimic the animals' natural settings.\n\n \n Sport, do you even think before you post? From the article thtat you cited earlier: \n'Artico' [the near-albino tiger] has been born from normal Bengal tigers with orange with black stripes, but because of a genetic mutation he is completely white, with no stripes [well, not exactly, but certainly less dramatic striping than usual]. ..... A white tiger with blue eyes and no stripes, one of only 20 worldwide, was born in captivity at a wild animal refuge in southern Spain ........ Baptized \"Artic,\" the young tiger's snow-like fleece and lack of stripes result from a genetic anomaly. Likewise a fragile stomach, which accounts for a steady diet of bifidus acidophilus yogurt -- half a kilo (one pound) per day ........ The Noah's Arc Refuge, near Alicante, waited three critical months before announcing Artic's birth due to his less than robust health. At a mere nine kilograms (20 pounds), \"he is small for his age,\" Domenech said. \"His sister Siberia, born from the same litter, and with whom he is living for the moment, is already much heavier.\" ........ In the wild, however, Artic would probably not last very long. Even if he managed to adapt his diet, his white coloration would make him an easy mark for predators, including man. ...... \"I don't plan to put him together with normal tigers,\" said Domenech, \"because they might kill him due to the fact he is different.\" \n\n \n So we have a mutation in a gene causing a phenotypic change. The animal is in a zoo, so normal fitness challenges are irrelevant. The tiger is weakened by the mutations, but not killed, and the albino mutation is obviously not helpful in the green jungle.\n \n Now, here's where you are wrong.\n \n 1) The zoo not only documented the change in phenotype, they publicized it.\n \n 2) It is indeed their job to document phenotypes, for breeding programs.\n \n 3) Zoos today do a better job with naturalistic habitats, but they can't or don't always match everything, e.g. day lengths and temperature regimes, % concrete in exhibit, presence of natural predators and parasites, exactly identical foods in all cases, etc.\n \n 4) Demonstration of importance of context in determining fitness: a mutation that is unhelpful to a tiger in the jungle could be very helpful to a Siberian tiger on the edge of a snowfield or ice cap or entering an ice age. The attendant problems would need to be fixed, but that could be small potatoes next to the huge camouflage advantage that an albino tiger might have hunting hares in the snow, as opposed to a normal tiger that needs to do the same thing. \n \n 5) You said, \"strange how this tiger, which has no stripes came from orange and black bengal parents.....also funny how this only seems to happen in captivity:\", but as Symbiote noted, albinism does happen in the wild, but they tend not to survive under normal circumstances. (But again, let's consider what might happen when an ice age is starting ....... )\n \n 6) In a complete misunderstanding of genetics and evolutionary theory, you said, \"uh, genius...ToE says fit parents will have fit offspring....that's the whole point of the thoery. If parents were just as likely to have unfit offspring then there's not really much point in selection, right? Right.\" In fact, genetics and the ToE say that the young will inherit a mixture of genes from the parents plus any new mutants. Recombination and mutation (sepearately or together) ensure variation in the youung. If both parents have greater than average fitness, their young on average willl also have greater than usual fitness, excepting mutations. This does not mean that all young will be better - that's \"on average\", meaning not guaranteed for every individual offspring. Recombination ensures that some offspring get better genes than expected while others get worse. But here's the kicker: \"better\" and \"worse\" depend on the context - if the environment or their condition in any way changes, the \"winning combination\" may change. It does no good to be 7 ft tall if the sport just changed from basketball to horse-racing.

The students are simply taught that Lamarckianism is an egregiously failed concept.\n \n Back in the 1890's August Weismann and Herbert Spencer argued at length over the possibility of Lamarckian evolution (Spencer for, Weismann against). Supporters of Herbert Spencer, notably the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, realized that this issue could only be settled experimentally, so he and his colleagues called for an institute to be set up to run the appropriate experiments. This ultimately lead to the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in New York, and it also persuaded a lot of biologists of all stripes to research the controversy and run experiments.\n \n Ultimately this all came to naught after 15-30 years because even the most ardent supporters of Lamarckian evolution recognized that they had had no successes in demonstrating Lamarckian evolution For example, Bumpus's four famous studies failed to detect any self-adaptation in transplanted stocks of animals. Specifically, Bumpus (1898) found increased variation but no beneficial self-adaptation in stocks of birds transplanted to new habitats where they lacked their previous heavy predation. In a subsequent study he transplanted both groups (the old original and the more diverse offshoot group) to a third location, and showed that each group continued true to type, notably including the higher variation of the group that had been released from heavy predation loads. This showed that the initial change had been evolutionary in nature, and that the creatures were unable to quickly modify themselves to a new ideal.\n ..........\n \n Starting around 1909, Francis Sumner was able to produce different development of traits in originally identical Peromyscus mice that were reared under highly dissimilar conditions. He even thought for a while that he had showed a degree of inheritance of these acquired characteristics. However, he realized after a long while (1932) that his results were unltimately far more easily explained as a result of mendelian genetics.\n \n All this and much more were viewed as absolutely devastating to the Neo-Lamarckian cause, and the whole field was transformed and replaced by the advent of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, as Fisher and Wright and others demonstrated how natural selection was consistent with mendelian genetics, and how the Cold Spring Harbor work was so much more easily understood by reference to Mendelian genetics.\n \n However, the effort to demonstrate Lamarckianism by carefully designed and cleanly performed experiments set an extremely important and beneficial standard for experimental biology thereafter. \n\n \n So, he's immune to new information that contradicts his beliefs. He doesn't care, he has his own predetermined conclusions bolstered by reading whatever creationist rubbish he can find, and he simply refuses to let anything else make an impression on him.",

   "In the current issue of Science:\n \n \n \nLAST WORD ON MOTHS\n \n A Cambridge University professor has completed a 6-year experiment with peppered moths that he says should conclusively rebut creationist claims.\n \n The story of Britain's peppered moth has long been a textbook illustration for evolution by natural selection. The pale moths evolved a black color for camouflage against predators as industrial pollution darkened the trees they rested on. With pollution cleanup, most of the moths went back to being pale. But creationists have used the tale to attack evolution because field experiments done in the 1950s by Oxford zoologist Bernard Kettlewell--used to illustrate the textbooks--were flawed, in part because he released the night-flying moths during the daytime.\n \n So in 2000, geneticist Michael Majerus started his own experiment (Science, 25 June 2004, p. 1894). He released black or white moths into cylindrical cages on branches at dusk. Before dawn, he removed the cages and counted how many moths subsequently disappeared from their resting places. He showed that selection now favors pale moths, with 21% eaten by birds, compared with 29% of the black ones, he reported last week at a meeting of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology in Uppsala, Sweden.\n \n Will that take any wind out of creationists' sails? \"It's probably not going to quiet them down,\" says peppered moth expert Bruce Grant of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, who points out that the evidence for natural selection in the moths was firmly in place long before Kettlewell came along with his vivid photographs.\n",

   "And now lets take a little look at human variability which arises from our own internal chromsomal duplicates - after all we have 23 PAIRS of chromosomes ya know!\n \n \nFor the first time, researchers have published the DNA sequence from both sets of chromosomes from a single person: none other than pioneering genome researcher J. Craig Venter. The new sequence suggests that there is substantially more variation between humans than previously recognized. It also pushes personalized medicine a step closer and stokes long-standing debates about genetic privacy.\n \n More than 7 years ago, Celera Genomics, a company then headed by Venter, and, separately, the international Human Genome Project consortium each described their first drafts of the genetic blueprint for a human. To save time and money, both teams combined samples from several individuals and created composite, or \"reference,\" genomes that contained only half of a human's DNA. Humans have a diploid genome with 23 pairs of chromosomes--with one of each pair contributed by the father and the other by the mother. The reference genomes effectively have the sequence information from only one member of each pair, the so-called haploid genome. The researchers assumed that this approach wouldn't sacrifice much detail. Wrong, says a massive 31-page paper published in the October 2007 issue of PLoS Biology by Venter, his colleagues at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, and collaborators from three different universities.\n \n According to the study, haploid genomes underestimate the amount of genetic variation between individuals by a factor of 5. \"We've just really underestimated this,\" says Venter. \"We all had very naive assumptions because we didn't have that much data to go on.\"\n\n \n http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254",

But, as you rightly ask, were they already random mutations, or did they respond to the antibiotic?\n \n You test this by noting where you saw resistant colony 'dots' forming, going back to the first culture and scraping samples from those same locations - which, logically enough, contain the closest relatives of the bacteria that showed resistance. You grow them for a while, spread them onto a new dish, and do the 'hairbrush' transfer again. This time you see far, far more resistant colonies forming on the antibiotic. By repeating this process you can achieve as close to 100% resistance as you like.\n \n However, one 'lamarckian' possibility remains: that what you've been doing is selecting bacteria that are able to respond successfully to the antibiotic. This was impossible to test earlier, since the resistant bacteria were needles in a haystack, and the only way to find them was to actually plate them on antibiotic. \n \n However, now you have a whole colony of bacteria able to resist/develop resistance to the antibiotic, none of which have ever been exposed to it. So you can now sequence the DNA of the bacteria that have not yet been exposed, and the DNA of those that have, and compare the two. And you find that the gene which confers resistance is present in both, proving that the trait is one of innate resistance, and not 'ability to develop resistance'.\n \n This proves that mutations do occur before they could be useful, and other experiments confirm that they do so at random with a small chance per cell division.\n \n \nHeck, stick a bacteria in the presence of an antibiotic and what does it do as a response? Mutate! How can evos suggest that the gene somehow gets the signal to mutate, yet has no idea how to mutate or what to accomplish by mutating?\n\n \n I'm not sure that's really an accurate assessment of what happens. Stick 'a bacterium' in the presence of an antibiotic and it'll almost certainly just die. Only by sheer weight of numbers do bacterial populations stand a chance of possessing a resistant variant.\n \n \nI think it's pretty clear by the evidence I've read that mutations such as resistance probably have an epigenetic origin, followed up by a genetic change. This means the mutation is nonrandom and the genome knows exactly what its doing.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you've been reading; perhaps you could link to it?",

Its likely that a point mutation could well result from chemical \"toxicity\" or radiation (via chemical toxicity). Its just that the toxicity is not due to the antibiotic to which the mutation confers resistance! It really is all chemistry you know, even copy errors are chemical in nature. All that one needs to know is that the mutation existed before exposure of the sensitive strain to the antibiotic and of course its useful to know its frequency in the population.\n \n As for links to the work I believe you have been provided same more than once.

The explanation of the experiment wasn't quite correct. First, as explained, a non-resistant strain of bacteria was cultured. Then by using a stamping process with a felt cloth, samples of the bacteria were transferred to a new culture dish that contained the antibiotic. Most of the transferred bacteria died except some isolated colonies. The antibiotic was then applied to the original culture dish and as a result, most of the bacteria died except for isolated colonies in the same relative positions in the original culture dish as the transferred bacteria in the new culture dish.

I'll find the links and post them here.\n \n EDIT: Ok, here's the original experimental paper. It's a PDF again, so WW won't be able to read it, but the following excerpt is informative:\n \n \nIt should be reemphasized that the indirect selection line itself has not been\n exposed to the phage at any time. Its history consists of the transfer cycle:\n broth to plain agar to broth, with side transfers from agar to velvet discs used\n to imprint phage agar. Each broth was tested for any stray phage that might\n lead to fallacious conclusions with no indication of its presence.\n\n \n So they explicitly tested for toxins that might induce adaptive mutation, and found there were none present. The mutations unambiguously occurred without the bacteria ever being exposed to phage, at a stochastic rate of around 1 in 10^9 cell divisions. I'm scratching my head trying to think what more compelling evidence you could hope for that the mutation wasn't an organismic, adaptive response, and coming up dry.",

That is how EAM apparently works. Vitality breathes the breath of change into selected cells (non sinners perhaps) and favors their off spring. Chosen bacteria as it were which go to the land of lactose and fructose. I don't think anyone has yet done an experiment which rules out elan vital as the source of the mutations - and of course elan vital being what it is ie omniscient then ANY changes in organisms which constitute an adaptation is known to it.
