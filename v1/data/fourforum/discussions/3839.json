   "\"I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist\" is a book out by Norman L. Geisler and Frank Turek\n \n Customer Review: \"[The Book..]..convincingly shows why atheism and other non-Christian views require a lot more faith than Christianity.\n \n Geisler and Turek build their case from the question of truth all the way to truth of the Bible. Along the way, in a readable and often entertaining way, they debunk relativism, agnosticism, atheism, Darwinism and New Testament liberalism. Their explanations of how the big bang, the design found in both the Universe and living organisms (like humans!), and morality point to God are worth the price of the book.\n \n I especially like the clarity they bring to the creation-evolution debate. Their point about how science is built on philosophy helps clear away much of the dust kicked into that often raucous debate. \"It's not about the Bible vs. science or religion vs. science\" they write, \"but about good science vs. bad science.\" Geisler and Turek show that it's actually the Darwinists who are practicing the bad science. Darwinists rule out intelligent causes before they even look at the evidence. In doing so, they ignore observation-- the very foundation of science-- much as the opponents of Galileo once did. That's bad science built on bad philosophy. \n \n I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist has four great chapters that systematically show why the New Testament documents are telling the truth. The authors show why we can be assured that the documents were written within a few decades of the evens which they report and contain historically-confirmed eyewitness details. They also cite non-Christian writers, archaeology, and list over 30 characters found in the New Testament that have been confirmed by secular sources. \n \n But they are at their best when they point out how the New Testament story is an unlikely invention. \n \n After listing a series of embarrassing gaffes of the apostles, Geisler and Turek ask the reader, \"If you were a New Testament writer, would you include these embarrassing details if you were making up a story? Would you write that one of your primary leaders was called 'Satan' by Jesus, denied the Lord three times, hid during the crucifixion, and was later corrected on a theological issue? Would you depict yourselves as uncaring, bumbling cowards, and the women-whose testimony was not even admissible in court-as the brave ones who stood by Jesus and later discovered the empty tomb? Would you admit that some of you (the eleven remaining disciples) doubted the very Son of God after he had proven himself raised to all of you?\" \n \n Geisler and Turek don't have enough faith to believe it's a made-up story. Neither do I. This is an engaging and affirming book with a vast scope. I highly recommend it!\n \n (See Hotlink at the Top)",

And, at the end of his life, he asked to be cruicified upside down (a merciful request, BTW) - who could make this scenario up?\n \n Why would 3,000 Jews believe in a dead Messiah? Why was the tomb empty? If Jesus was not the Messiah, who could believe the Gospel?\n \n Why would anyone risk being a Jewish heretic, and being cast out of Jerusalem? Acts 7 if memory serves me, or 8,9 as the believers in \"The Way\" - Jews for Jesus as it were, were expelled from Jerusalem.\n \n Some did stay behind with James, who was later beheaded 40 - 50 A.D. or so.

He described his worldview as secular and called it \"scientific,\" and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than \"carefully scrutinized observation what we call research.\" Therefore no knowledge, he said, can be derived from revelation or from intuition.

   "The disciples had to be portrayed as a bunch of ignorant, clueless boobs. All the more so to show the superiority of the \"master\". That one word was never written by any of the twelve is evident by this example alone: \n\n Whenever I hear a preacher (usually my brother) talking about something Jesus did in his life, it makes Jesus sound really full of himself and superior. \n Like: \"hey man, I came to your house and you didn't wash my feet or kiss my cheek, Hey, I'm da son a god ova here.\"\n \n \nWe read in MT 14:13 the miracle of feeding five thousand people with a couple fish and five loaves of bread. The disciples are bowled over with this development--speechless--despite already personally observing numerous over miracles, such as walking on water, untold healings, water transforming into wine, etc.\n\n Yeah, you'd think they'd get used to it.\n \n \nThen one brief chapter later, we are to believe Jesus is faced with feeding a mere four thousand people with nothing more than seven loaves and \"a few little fishes\". The disciples' response? MT 15:33: \"Where are we to get enough loaves to satisfy so great a crowd?\" \n \n If you personally had just observed five thousand people rubbing their bellies in satisfaction and fulfillment, would that be your question? Must we believe these twelve were nothing more than open-mouthed, clueless doofuses? Or is it more probable that it never happened?\n\n The disciples seem to have the least faith of all christians.\n They needed constant reminder of Jesus's power by displays of supernatural acts. When people questioned Jesus he didn't say \"Just have faith that I'm god/son of god.\" Instead, he pulled a David Copperfield.",

So there are billions and billions of planets in the universe. So it's luck that it happened on Earth, but not that they evolved.\n \n \n Let me try another example. You and a friend are playing cards. You are dealt 4 aces. You know your friend and trust him not to cheat. Do you automatically assume he rigged it since the odds against it are (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49)=3.69*10^-6=.00000369?\n Pretty unlikely but say you play a trillion card games in your life.

   "So Christianity is polytheistic and mormonism is a sect of that.\n That's what you're saying, right?\n \n And only Judaism and Islam are truly monotheistic.\n\n \n God is One.\n \n Quote:\n \n Throughout the centuries, the Christian community has carried on a dialogue with the Scriptures and the community&#8217;s experience, always searching for understanding and appropriate ways to express its beliefs. Naturally, individual theologians and Church councils made use of the philosophies and other insights of their age. \n \n During the first centuries of Christianity&#8217;s existence, questions about Jesus and the Trinity raised special interest. How can we speak of this human being who is also God? How can we speak of one God who is Father, Son and Spirit? (What many of us now simply accept as part of our Creed had to be hammered out over many years.) \n \n Three people who played a very important role in that process during the fourth century were St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Gregory of Nazianzus. Because they lived in Cappadocia (an area of present-day Turkey), these three saints are simply called the Cappadocians. For many of us in the West, their thought is not well-known. \n \n A key concept in their teaching about how the Trinity is both one and three is perichoresis, a term conveying dynamic and creative energy, eternal movement, mutuality and interrelatedness. The three divine persons are what they are by relation to one another. Some scholars like to use the image of dance to describe this term. In this divine dance there is an eternal movement of reciprocal giving and receiving, expressing the essence and unity of God. Moreover this interrelatedness of the triune God is not self-contained but is poured out in creation, Incarnation and final fulfillment. God is overflowing love, leading humanity and all creation into the divine dance of God&#8217;s life.",

   "O.K., much better and more logical is to cover......\n \n I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist - Chapter 3 \"In the Beginning There Was a Great SURGE\"\n \n A continuation of my comments on Geisler and Turek's book.\n \n This Chapter starts with Einsten and how his Theory of Relativity progressed, all the while Einstein's own \"faith\" is challenged.\n \n Einstein didn't like where his calculations were leading him. If his theory of General Relativity was true, it meant that the universe was not eternal but had a beginning.\n \n Einstein later called his discovery \"irritating.\" He wanted the universe to be self-existant [....] In fact, Einstein so disliked the implications of General Relativity [...] that he introduced a cosmological constant (which some have since called a \"fudge factor\") into his equations in order to show that the universe is static and to avoid an absolute beginning.\n \n By 1922, Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's fudge factor as an algebraic error. (Incredibly, in his quest to avoid a beginning, the great Einstein had divided by zero--something even schoolchildren know is a no-no!)\n \n He subsequently described the cosmological constant as \"the greatest blunder of my life,\" and he redirected his efforts to find the box top of the puzzle of life. Einstein said that he wanted \"to know how God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the rest are details.\"\n \n Now off to the Cosmological Argument proper:\n \n In logical form, the argument goes like this:\n 1) Everything that had a beginning had a cause.\n 2) The universe had a beginning.\n 3) Therefore the universe had a cause.\n \n Now for the justification of Premise 1:\n \n Premise 1 [...] is the Law of Causality, which is the fundamental principle of science. Without the Law of Causality, science is impossible.\n \n In fact, to deny the Law of Causality is to deny rationality. The very process of rational thinking requires us to put together thoughts (the causes) that result in conclusions (the effects). So if anyone ever tells you he doesn't believe in the Law of Causality, simply ask that person, \"What caused you to come to that conclusion.\"\n \n Back to Einstein:\n \n Until about the time of Einstein, atheists could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause.\n \n Next, the authors cover the Second Law of Thermodynamics:\n \n The Second Law is also known as the Law of Entropy, which is a fancy way of saying that nature tends to bring things to disorder. That is, with time, things naturally fall apart. Your car falls apart; your house falls apart; your body falls apart.\n [....]\n But if the universe is becoming less ordered, then where did the original order come from?\n \n \"If everything is material,\" I asked, \"then what is a scientific theory? After all, the theory about everything being material isn't material; it's not made out of molocules.\"\n \n Without a moment's hesitation he quipped, \"A theory is magic.\"\n \"Magic?\" I repeated, not really believing what I was hearing. \"What's your basis for saying that?\"\n \n \"Faith,\" he quickly replied.\n \n \"Faith in magic?\" I thought to myself. \"I can't believe what I'm hearing! If faith in magic is the best materialists have to offer, then I don't have enough faith to be a materialist!\"\n \n In retrospect, it seemed to me that this professor had a brief moment of complete candor. [....] In doing so, he provided another example of the will refusing to believe what the mind knows to be true, and howthe atheists' view is based on sheer faith. [....]\n \n Since I could see the professor was not really interested in accepting the truth, I didn't ask him any more potentially humiliating questions. But since we couldn't ignore the power of the Second Law on our own bodies, we both ordered desert.\n \n Nevertheless, we wanted to press the fact that atheists like Atkins must be able to explain how the universe began from absolutely nothing.\n \n Next is, the Fine-Tuning argument in the area of cosmic background radiation ripples:\n \n The ripples show that the explosion and expansion of the universe was precisely tweaked to cause just enough matter to congregate to allow galaxy formation, but not enough to cause the universe to collapse back on itself. Any slight variation one way or the other, and none of us would be here to tell about it.\n \n Jastrow writes, \"Now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ, but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.\"\n \n Therefore, there must be something outside of nature to do the job. That's exactly what the word supernatural means.",

   "There are trillions of planets out there.\n\n \n More Evidence of Fine-Tuning and ah, just the right Balance and Miraclous Order:\n \n Quote:\n \n \"If some god-like being could be given the opportunity to plan a sequence of events with the express goal of duplicating our 'Garden of Eden,' that power would face a formidable task,\" declare Ward and Brownlee. \"With the best intentions, but limited by natural laws and materials, it is unlikely that Earth could ever be truly replicated. Too many processes in its formation involved sheer luck . ... [T]he physical events that led to the formation and evolution of the physical Earth ... required an intricate set of nearly irreproducible circumstances.\" \n \n How so? Well, if you want any kind of life on a planet, you've got to have a sun, and not just any sun will do. It has to be the right distance from the center of the galaxy. If it's too close to the star-dense center, it will likely be sterilized by a supernova, an exploding star. If it's too far away, it will be too poor in heavy elements, the building blocks of a habitable planet. Your sun will also have to have the just right mass; otherwise, the planets orbiting it will be too close or too far away to sustain life. For these and other reasons, Ward and Brownlee declare, our rare earth required a rare sun. \n \n Shall we add the presence of Jupiter? If you don't want your planet to be bombarded by comets and asteroids, you'd better have a \"sweeper.\" Because of its great mass, Jupiter cleans interstellar debris from our solar system. Without it, the Earth would likely be continually pummeled &#8212; and therefore lifeless. Let's also add that, if Jupiter were any closer to its sun, as other Jovian-type planets generally are, it would have crushed the Earth. Another happy accident! \n \n We have a glimpse of how rare the conditions surrounding our planet are, but the conditions of Earth itself are rarer still. According to the authors, getting life, microbial life, might be relatively easy. Therefore, such non-complex life may very well be abundant in the universe. But complex life is both difficult to attain and maintain. To begin with, you need an atmosphere, surface water and a constant but narrow range of temperature. Attaining and maintaining these require an immensely complex dance of factors &#8212; the right amount of initial carbon available, a molten core of the right elements and temperature, the presence of a sufficient magnetic field and other factors too numerous to mention. \n \n In addition, if you want to maintain the conditions of life over sufficiently long periods of time, say, multiple millions of years, you have to avoid all kinds of catastrophes all too common on other planets. Earth, unlike many other planets, has managed to escape such destruction. \n \n On top of all this, we, the Earth, actually have complex life, the existence of which is far, far more unlikely than the conditions which allow it. When we string together the list of all these improbable conditions and events, the authors claim, the probability of creating a planet with complex life approaches zero. \n \n The actual presence of Earth, given the extremely complex and interrelated conditions which allowed its birth and continuation, is near miraculous.\n \n Science, it would seem, is leaning back toward faith: We really may be the only rational animal in the universe after all.\n \n Source::More",

   "In the winter of 1998, two separate teams of astronomers in Berkeley, California, made a similar, startling discovery. They were both observing supernovae &#8212; exploding stars visible over great distances &#8212; to see how fast the universe is expanding. In accordance with prevailing scientific wisdom, the astronomers expected to find the rate of expansion to be decreasing, Instead they found it to be increasing &#8212; a discovery which has since &#8220;shaken astronomy to its core&#8221; (Astronomy, October 1999). \n \n This discovery would have come as no surprise to Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966), a Belgian mathematician and Catholic priest who developed the theory of the Big Bang. Lemaitre described the beginning of the universe as a burst of fireworks, comparing galaxies to the burning embers spreading out in a growing sphere from the center of the burst. He believed this burst of fireworks was the beginning of time, taking place on &#8220;a day without yesterday.&#8221;\n \n SNIP\n \n \n But while Einstein imagined an unknown force &#8212; a cosmological constant &#8212; which kept the world stable, Lemaitre decided that the universe was expanding. He came to this conclusion after observing the reddish glow, known as a red shift, surrounding objects outside of our galaxy. If interpreted as a Doppler effect, this shift in color meant that the galaxies were moving away from us. Lemaitre published his calculations and his reasoning in Annales de la Societe scientifique de Bruxelles in 1927. Few people took notice. That same year he talked with Einstein in Brussels, but the latter, unimpressed, said, &#8220;Your calculations are correct, but your grasp of physics is abominable.&#8221; \n \n It was Einstein&#8217;s own grasp of physics, however, that soon came under fire. :ahem: In 1929 Edwin Hubble&#8217;s systematic observations of other galaxies confirmed the red shift. In England the Royal Astronomical Society gathered to consider this seeming contradiction between visual observation and the theory of relativity. Sir Arthur Eddington volunteered to work out a solution. When Lemaitre read of these proceedings, he sent Eddington a copy of his 1927 paper. The British astronomer realized that Lemaitre had bridged the gap between observation and theory. At Eddington&#8217;s suggestion, the Royal Astronomical Society published an English translation of Lemaitre&#8217;s paper in its Monthly Notices of March 1931. \n \n Most scientists who read Lemaitre&#8217;s paper accepted that the universe was expanding, at least in the present era, but they resisted the implication that the universe had a beginning. They were used to the idea that time had gone on forever. It seemed illogical that infinite millions of years had passed before the universe came into existence. Eddington himself wrote in the English journal Nature that the notion of a beginning of the world was &#8220;repugnant.&#8221; \n \n The Belgian priest responded to Eddington with a letter published in Nature on May 9, 1931. Lemaitre suggested that the world had a definite beginning in which all its matter and energy were concentrated at one point: \n \n If the world has begun with a single quantum, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time. \n \n In January 1933, both Lemaitre and Einstein traveled to California for a series of seminars. After the Belgian detailed his theory, Einstein stood up, applauded, and said, &#8220;This is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which I have ever listened.&#8221; \n \n Duncan Aikman covered these seminars for the New York Times Magazine. An article about Lemaitre appeared on February 19, 1933, and featured a large photo of Einstein and Lemaitre standing side by side. The caption read, &#8220;They have a profound respect and admiration for each other.&#8221; \n \n For his work, Lemaitre was inducted as a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium. An international commission awarded him the Francqui Prize. The archbishop of Malines, Cardinal Josef Van Roey, made Lemaitre a canon of the cathedral in 1935. The next year Pope Pius XI inducted Lemaitre into the Pontifical Academy of Science. \n \n Despite this high praise, there were some problems with Lemaitre&#8217;s theory. For one, Lemaitre&#8217;s calculated rate of expansion did not work out. If the universe was expanding at a steady rate, the time it had taken to cover its radius was too short to allow for the formation of the stars and planets. Lemaitre solved this problem by expropriating Einstein&#8217;s cosmological constant. Where Einstein had used it in an attempt to keep the universe at a steady size, Lemaitre used it to speed up the expansion of the universe over time. \n \n Einstein did not take kindly to Lemaitre&#8217;s use of the cosmological constant. He regarded the constant as the worst mistake of his career, and he was upset by Lemaitre&#8217;s use of his super-galactic fudge factor. \n \n After Arthur Eddington died in 1944, Cambridge University became a center of opposition to Lemaitre&#8217;s theory of the Big Bang. In fact, it was Fred Hoyle, an astronomer at Cambridge, who sarcastically coined the term &#8220;Big Bang.&#8221; Hoyle and others favored an approach to the history of the universe known as the &#8220;Steady State&#8221; in which hydrogen atoms were continuously created and gradually coalesced into gas clouds, which then formed stars.\n \n Source: &#8220;&#8216;A Day Without Yesterday&#8217;: Georges Lemaitre & the Big Bang.&#8221; - Click Here",

   "[/color][/size]It's important to have sources to back up what you say, but you should decide for yourself what you believe based on both sides, \n\n \n Zac'\n \n That is the whole point of discussing the book, I am one Theist, and we might have five or six Atheists on the other side!\n \n I do read all POV's\n \n Now, let's review!\n \n I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist - Chapter 3 \"In the Beginning There Was a Great SURGE\"\n \n A continuation of my comments on Geisler and Turek's book.\n \n This Chapter starts with Einsten and how his Theory of Relativity progressed, all the while Einstein's own \"faith\" is challenged.\n \n Einstein didn't like where his calculations were leading him. If his theory of General Relativity was true, it meant that the universe was not eternal but had a beginning.\n \n Einstein later called his discovery \"irritating.\" He wanted the universe to be self-existant [....] In fact, Einstein so disliked the implications of General Relativity [...] that he introduced a cosmological constant (which some have since called a \"fudge factor\") into his equations in order to show that the universe is static and to avoid an absolute beginning.\n \n By 1922, Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's fudge factor as an algebraic error. (Incredibly, in his quest to avoid a beginning, the great Einstein had divided by zero--something even schoolchildren know is a no-no!)\n \n He subsequently described the cosmological constant as \"the greatest blunder of my life,\" and he redirected his efforts to find the box top of the puzzle of life. Einstein said that he wanted \"to know how God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the rest are details.\"\n \n Now off to the Cosmological Argument proper:\n \n In logical form, the argument goes like this:\n 1) Everything that had a beginning had a cause.\n 2) The universe had a beginning.\n 3) Therefore the universe had a cause.\n \n Now for the justification of Premise 1:\n \n Premise 1 [...] is the Law of Causality, which is the fundamental principle of science. Without the Law of Causality, science is impossible.\n \n In fact, to deny the Law of Causality is to deny rationality. The very process of rational thinking requires us to put together thoughts (the causes) that result in conclusions (the effects). So if anyone ever tells you he doesn't believe in the Law of Causality, simply ask that person, \"What caused you to come to that conclusion.\"\n \n Back to Einstein:\n \n Until about the time of Einstein, atheists could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause.\n \n Next, the authors cover the Second Law of Thermodynamics:\n \n The Second Law is also known as the Law of Entropy, which is a fancy way of saying that nature tends to bring things to disorder. That is, with time, things naturally fall apart. Your car falls apart; your house falls apart; your body falls apart. [....] But if the universe is becoming less ordered, then where did the original order come from?\n \n \"If everything is material,\" I asked, \"then what is a scientific theory? After all, the theory about everything being material isn't material; it's not made out of molocules.\"\n \n Without a moment's hesitation he quipped, \"A theory is magic.\"\n \"Magic?\" I repeated, not really believing what I was hearing. \"What's your basis for saying that?\"\n \n \"Faith,\" he quickly replied.\n \n \"Faith in magic?\" I thought to myself. \"I can't believe what I'm hearing! If faith in magic is the best materialists have to offer, then I don't have enough faith to be a materialist!\"\n \n In retrospect, it seemed to me that this professor had a brief moment of complete candor. [....] In doing so, he provided another example of the will refusing to believe what the mind knows to be true, and howthe atheists' view is based on sheer faith. [....]\n \n Since I could see the professor was not really interested in accepting the truth, I didn't ask him any more potentially humiliating questions. But since we couldn't ignore the power of the Second Law on our own bodies, we both ordered desert.\n \n Nevertheless, we wanted to press the fact that atheists like Atkins must be able to explain how the universe began from absolutely nothing.\n \n Next is, the Fine-Tuning argument in the area of cosmic background radiation ripples:\n \n The ripples show that the explosion and expansion of the universe was precisely tweaked to cause just enough matter to congregate to allow galaxy formation, but not enough to cause the universe to collapse back on itself. Any slight variation one way or the other, and none of us would be here to tell about it.\n \n Jastrow writes, \"Now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ, but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.\"\n \n Therefore, there must be something outside of nature to do the job. That's exactly what the word supernatural means.\n \n Hmmmm",

   "I'm curious where the theory of relativity has to do with the universe expanding.\n\n \n I already posted, where, early in the evolution of Einstein's thinking and belief, he posited a static and ever existent universe.\n \n An expanding Universe, as I understand it, refuted this, and revealed a \"beginning\", later called the Big Bang.\n \n \nAnd a cause doesn't mean an intelligent being created it.\n\n \n I believe that our Universe makes more sense, with cause, meaning and purpose if created by God.\n \n Quote:\n \n God provides the best explanation of why the universe exists rather than nothing. \n \n Have you ever asked yourself why anything at all exists, or where the universe came from?\n \n Typically, atheists have said that the universe is just eternal, and that&#8217;s all. But surely this is unreasonable. Just think about it for a minute.\n \n If the universe never had a beginning, then that means that the number of past events is infinite. But mathematicians recognize that the notion of an actually infinite number of things leads to self-contradictions unless you impose some wholly arbitrary rules to prevent this. For example, what is infinity minus infinity? Well, mathematically you get self-contradictory answers. This shows that infinity is just an idea in your mind, not something that exists in reality.\n \n David Hilbert, perhaps the greatest mathematician in this century, states,\n The infinite is nowhere to be found in reality. It neither exists in nature, nor provides a legitimate basis for rational thought. ... The role that remains for the infinite to play is solely that of an idea.\n But that entails that since past events are not just ideas but are real, the number of past events must be finite. Therefore the series of past events cannot go back forever; rather the universe must have begun to exist.\n \n This conclusion has been confirmed by remarkable discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics. The astrophysical evidence indicates that the universe began to exist in a great explosion called the Big Bang about fifteen billion years ago. Physical space and time were created in that event, as well as all the matter and energy in the universe.\n \n Therefore, as the Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle points out, the Big Bang Theory requires the creation of the universe from nothing. This is because as one goes back in time he reaches a point at which, in Hoyle&#8217;s words; the universe was \"shrunk down to nothing at all.\" Thus what the Big Bang model requires is that the universe began to exist and was created out of nothing.\n \n Now this tends to be very awkward for the atheist thinker. For as Anthony Kenny of Oxford University says, \n \"A proponent of the [Big Bang] theory, at least if he is an atheist, must believe that ... the universe came from nothing and by nothing.\" \n ...but that&#8217;s a pretty hard pill to swallow. Out of nothing, nothing comes. So where did the universe come from? Why does it exist instead of just nothing? There must have been a cause which brought the universe into being. And from the very nature of the case, this cause must be an uncaused, changeless, timeless, and immaterial being which created the universe.\n \n Isn't it incredible that the Big Bang theory thus confirms what the Christian theist has always believed, that in the beginning, god created the universe?\n \n Now, I simply put it to you: Which do you think is more probable, that the Christian theist is right, or that the universe just popped into existence uncaused out of nothing? I, at least, don't have any problem assessing these probabilities.\n \n A Classic Debate on the Existence of God - By William Craig",

Or, first Matter? Big Bang?\n \n Please note that I submit that the Atheist also has a burden of proof explaining the origin of our Universe.\n \n I cannot prove God directly, but Thomas Aquinas goes a long way indirectly.\n \n And, I submit that Theism offers better answers to the most intractable questions of our Universe!\n \n God has the answers to the seven riddles!\n \n \n Saint Thomas has four versions of this basic argument. \n \n \n \n First, he argues that the chain of movers must have a first mover because nothing can move itself. (Moving here refers to any kind of change, not just change of place.) If the whole chain of moving things had no first mover, it could not now be moving, as it is. If there were an infinite regress of movers with no first mover, no motion could ever begin, and if it never began, it could not go on and exist now. But it does go on, it does exist now. Therefore it began, and therefore there is a first mover. \n \n Second, he expands the proof from proving a cause of motion to proving a cause of existence, or efficient cause. He argues that if there were no first efficient cause, or cause of the universe's coming into being, then there could be no second causes because second causes (i.e., caused causes) are dependent on (i.e., caused by) a first cause (i.e., an uncaused cause). But there are second causes all around us. Therefore there must be a first cause. \n \n Third, he argues that if there were no eternal, necessary, and immortal being, if everything had a possibility of not being, of ceasing to be, then eventually this possibility of ceasing to be would be realized for everything. In other words, if everything could die, then, given infinite time, everything would eventually die. But in that case nothing could start up again. We would have universal death, for a being that has ceased to exist cannot cause itself or anything else to begin to exist again. And if there is no God, then there must have been infinite time, the universe must have been here always, with no beginning, no first cause. But this universal death has not happened; things do exist! Therefore there must be a necessary being that cannot not be, cannot possibly cease to be. That is a description of God. \n \n Fourth, there must also be a first cause of perfection or goodness or value. We rank things as more or less perfect or good or valuable. Unless this ranking is false and meaningless, unless souls don't really have any more perfection than slugs, there must be a real standard of perfection to make such a hierarchy possible, for a thing is ranked higher on the hierarchy of perfection only insofar as it is closer to the standard, the ideal, the most perfect. Unless there is a most-perfect being to be that real standard of perfection, all our value judgments are meaningless and impossible. Such a most-perfect being, or real ideal standard of perfection, is another description of God.\n \n \nChemistry and physics\n \n \n Geology, Botany, Zoology(all human constructs btw)\n \n \n Chemistry and Biological evolution.\n \n \n Evolution.\n \n \n Evolution.\n \n I'm no scientist so forgive my simple understanding and possible error in terminology.\n\n \n Outstanding, and we are almost ready to jump into the next Chapter, the beginnning of Life.",

   "Well, IMO, the Atheists have crashed on the rocks of Reality!\n \n \nAn estimated 50 billion galaxies are visible to modern telescopes. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars broadly similar to our Sun. \n \n There is already quite a lot of indirect evidence of planets orbiting some stars at distances that would (or might) allow a form of life to evolve there. The proposition that life is not unique to this earth is based on probability. It is not impossible, but very, very unlikely that in the billions of possibilities only one place in the entire universe has produced the necessary and sufficient conditions for life to become established.\n \n I know this 2 cent's worth will make no difference to your fantasy about the origin of the cosmos, but I thought it worth posting anyway.\n\n \n Au Contraire! :)\n \n Let's play out the odds!\n \n Quoting from a Classic - God Exists debate, and quoting William Craig:\n \n God provides the best explanation for the complex order in the universe.\n \n During the last thirty years, scientists have discovered that the existence of intelligent life depends upon a complex and delicate balance of initial conditions that are simply given in the Big Bang itself. We now know that life-prohibiting universes are vastly more probable than life-permitting universes like ours.\n \n How much more probable?\n \n Before I share with you an estimation, let me just give you some numbers to give you a feel for the odds. The number of seconds in the history of the universe is about 10^18, ten followed by eighteen zeros. The number of subatomic particles in the entire universe is said to be about 10^80 .\n \n Now with those numbers in mind consider the following: Donald Page, one of America's eminent cosmologists, has calculated the odds of our universe existing as one chance out of ten to the power of ten to the one hundred and twenty-fourth power ---a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement.\n \n [Page's estimation is to be found in L. Stafford Betty and Bruce Cordell, \"God and Modern Science: New Life for the Teleological Argument\"' International Philosophical Quarterly 27 (1987): 416. In fact, as Page explained to me in personal conversation, Betty and Cordell get the number too low, misinterpreting 10^10(124) to mean (10^10)124, when in fact Page calculated 10(10(124)), an incomprehensibly huge number.]\n \n Robert Jastrow, the head of NASA&#8217;s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God ever to come out of science.\n \n [Robert Jastrow, \"The Astronomer and God,\" in The Intellectuals Speak Out About God, ed.

   "O.K. folks, we should move beyond Einstein, the Big Bang, and First Cause with most excellent Fine-Tuning to......\n \n Chapter 5 \"The First Life: Natural Law or Divine Awe?\"\n \n A continuation of my comments on Geisler and Turek's book.\n \n Naturalistic evolutionists claim that this one-celled amoeba (or something like it) came together by spontaneous generation (i.e., without intelligent intervention) in a warm little pond somewhere on the very early earth. According to their theory, all biological life has evolved from that first amoeba without any intelligent guidance at all. This, of course, is the theory of macroevolution: from the infantile, to the reptile, to the Gentile; or, from the goo to you via the zoo.\n \n Even back in High School, I remeber kids rolling their eyes at our Biology teacher. Who really ever believed the warm pool of chemicals theory?\n \n Believers in this theory of origin are called by many names: naturalistic evolutionists, materialists, humanists, atheists, and Darwinists (in the remainder of this chapter and the next, we'll refer to believers in this atheistic evolutionary theory as Darwinists or atheists. This does not include those who believe in theistic evolution--i.e., that evolution was guided by God.)\n \n Forget the Darwinist assertions about men descending from apes or birds evolving from reptiles. The supreme problem for Darwinists is not explaining how all life forms are related [....] The supreme problem for Darwinists is explaining the origin of the first life. For unguided, naturalistic macroevolution to be true, the first life must have generated spontaneously from nonliving chemicals.\n \n The incredible specified complexity of life becomes obvious when one considers the message found in the DNA of a one-celled amoeba (a creature so small, several hundred could be lined up in an inch). Staunch Darwinist Richard Dawkins, professor of zoology at Oxford University, admits that the message found in just the cell nucleus of a tiny amoeba is more than all thirty volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica combined, and the entire amoeba has as much information in its DNA as 1,000 complete sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica! In other words, if you were to spell out all of the A, T, C, and G in the \"unjustly called 'primitive' amoeba\" (as Dawkins describes it), the letters would fill 1,000 complete sets of an encyclopedia!\n [....]\n \n So here's the key question for Darwinists like Dawkins: if simple messages such as \"Take out the garbage--Mom,\" [...] require an intelligent being, then why doesn't a message 1,000 encyclopedias long require one?\n \n [...] when we look at the first one-celled life, the Principle of Uniformity tells us that only an intelligent cause could assemble the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias.\n \n \"Not so fast!\" say the Darwinists. \"You've overlooked time and chance as plausible explanations for how life spontaneously generated.\"\n [....]\n \n You say, maybe natural laws would do it if we gave them billions of years. No, they wouldn't. Why? Because nature disorders, it doesn't organize things (the fact that nature brings toward disorder is another aspect of the Second Law of Thermodynamics). more time will make things worse for the Darwinists, not better. \n \n How so?\n \n Let's suppose you throw red, white, and blue confetti out of an airplane 1,000 feet above your house. What's the chance it's going to form the American flag on your front lawn? Very low. Why? Because natural laws mix up or randomize the confetti. You say, \"Allow more time.\" Okay, let's take the plane up to 10,000 feet to give natural laws more time to work on the confetti. Does this improve the probability that the flag will form on your lawn? No, more time actually makes the flag less likely because natural laws have longer to do what they do--disorder and randomize.\n \n [Go on, get back up in that plane and throw that confetti 10 times, a hundred times!]\n \n That probability is virtually zero. But we believe the probability is actually zero. Why? Because \"chance\" is not a cause. Chance is a word that we use to describe mathematical possibilities. It has no power of its own. Chance is nothing. It's what rocks dream about. [Nothing is what rocks dream about - Plato]\n \n If someone flips a fair coin, what's the chance it will come up heads? Fifty percent, we say. Yes, but what causes it to come up heads? Is it chance? No, the primary cause is an intelligent being who decided to flip the coin and apply so much force in doing so. Secondary causes, such as the physical forces of wind and gravity, also impact the result of the flip. If we knew all those variables, we could calculate how the flip would turn out beforehand. But since we don't know those variables, we use the word \"chance\" to cover our ignorance.\n \n We shouldn't allow atheists to cover their ignorance with the word \"chance.\" If they don't know a natural mechanism by which the first life could have come into existence, then they should admit they don't know rather than suggesting a powerless word that, of course, really isn't a cause at all. \"Chance\" is just another example of bad science practiced by Darwinists.\n \n Ha!\n \n That last line should generate some passionate Religious response from the Darwin faithful!",

The reason the N's and the C's hook up the way they do is because of another science, chemistry.\n \n Not all atoms are stable. The most stable of atoms are the noble gasses, which have totally filled valence shells. However, unstable atoms play a little trick. They bind with other atoms and share/distribute electrons so that they can have a completely filled valence shell.\n \n Each nucleotide (the building block of DNA) is made up of three parts. A phosphate group, a nitrogenous base, and a pentose sugar.\n \n Each of these parts exist because of their stability. For instance, the pentose sugar is made up of five carbons, an oxygen (four C's and 1 O form a ring, and the other C is attached to the number 1 carbon), and many H's. When hooking up C's and O's, there are only certain possibilities that can be created with a fixed amount of energy.\n \n So, each of the parts that make up a nucleotide exists because that is a stable configuration.\n \n It isnt random. Not all combinations exist. That's like saying if i put a bunch of H and a bunch of O's together, there should be thousands of different molecules created, and only one would be H2O.\n \n SO, do NOT claim that DNA must have an intelligent creator because it cannot be random, because science does not claim its structure was the result of random creation.

   "Ok, one established thing that most creationist forget is that all sciences are related.\n \n So, when talking about the \"randomness of DNA\", i have to say this.\n \n The reason DNA is how it is is because of the elements it is composed of (Namely N, H, C, and a Phosphate group (PO4 -3)). The reason the N's and the C's hook up the way they do is because of another science, chemistry.\n \n Not all atoms are stable. The most stable of atoms are the noble gasses, which have totally filled valence shells. However, unstable atoms play a little trick. They bind with other atoms and share/distribute electrons so that they can have a completely filled valence shell.\n \n Each nucleotide (the building block of DNA) is made up of three parts. A phosphate group, a nitrogenous base, and a pentose sugar.\n \n Each of these parts exist because of their stability. For instance, the pentose sugar is made up of five carbons, an oxygen (four C's and 1 O form a ring, and the other C is attached to the number 1 carbon), and many H's. When hooking up C's and O's, there are only certain possibilities that can be created with a fixed amount of energy.\n \n So, each of the parts that make up a nucleotide exists because that is a stable configuration.\n \n It isnt random. Not all combinations exist. That's like saying if i put a bunch of H and a bunch of O's together, there should be thousands of different molecules created, and only one would be H2O.\n \n SO, do NOT claim that DNA must have an intelligent creator because it cannot be random, because science does not claim its structure was the result of random creation. Its structure and creation exists because of chemistry and the properties of the atoms that create it.\n\n \n You posted volumes of TRUTH Bro'\n \n Outstanding, it isn't random!

Molecular bonding depends on two factors, the strength of the force of electromagnetism and the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton. \n \n If the electromagnetic force were significantly larger, atoms would hang on to electrons so tightly no sharing of electrons with other atoms would be possible. But if the electromagnetic force were significantly weaker, atoms would not hang on to electrons at all, and again, the sharing of electrons among atoms, which makes molecules possible, would not take place. If more than just a few kinds of molecules are to exist, the electromagnetic force must be more delicately balanced yet. \n \n The size and stability of electron orbits about the nuclei of atoms depends on the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass.

   "In Germany, a research team used the new instruments to examine an enormous molecule, the yeast 26S proteasome. (Michael Groll et al, \"Structure of 20S Proteasome from Yeast at 2.4 A\u00b0 Resolution,\" Nature, 386 (1997), pp. 463-471.)\n \n Though not the largest molecule in existence, the yeast 26S proteasome contains over two million protons and neutrons and is the largest non-symmetrical molecule mapped to date. This molecule can only be described as a \"wonder.\" It serves as an intracellular waste-disposal and recycling system. Tiny molecules within the proteasome attach markers (called ubiquitin) to waste material (apparently the cell&#8217;s command center informs the marker molecules which proteins are ready for disposal). Since these ready-for-disposal proteins resemble tangled balls of yarn, the first job of the 26S proteasome, after identifying a tagged protein, is to unfold, untwist, and unravel it. This function is performed by an apparatus at each end of the proteasome.\n \n Once the targeted protein is straightened out, the proteasome drags it into its core and cuts the protein into segments. These segments are precisely measured by a \"ruler\" inside the proteasome. The cut-up pieces are then ejected from the proteasome, and a \"sanitation\" fleet (other proteins) drives by to pick them up and sort them, separating the stuff that can be reused from the stuff that cannot.\n \n The complexity of such systems&#8212;and these are just two of many&#8212;within both the tiny enzyme and the huge yeast reflect a mind-boggling quantity, not to mention quality, of information. \n \n Where did that information come from? \n \n Who structured these molecules and taught them to perform their functions?\n \n Did blind chance and random process? \n \n Are they simply self-programmed? \n \n Does anything in reality self-program without intelligent input?\n \n I see these discoveries as a formidable challenge to the assumption that life arose on its own over a few million years. Perhaps at least some scientists will be prompted by the new data to reconsider their conclusion, to accept the possibility&#8212;more accurately, the probability&#8212;that living molecules and all living creatures evidence the matchless brilliance and power of a Supreme Creator.\n \n (Dr, Hugh Ross)",

If some claim that the matter and energy in our universe has always existed, then they have a big problem. In short, the universe is \"winding down\".

However, theoretically, the universe as a whole is a closed system.

   "Indeed. Yet another problem that exists with a non-Biblical view of the universe is that of entropy. If some claim that the matter and energy in our universe has always existed, then they have a big problem. In short, the universe is \"winding down\". Our collegiate textbook, \"Biology - the Unity and Diversity of Life\" (Starr) states, and I'm paraphrasing, \"(because of entropy) eventually, energy conversions will cease to occur, and the mean temperature of the universe will approach absolute zero.\" Now some say that the earth is an open system and, as such, entropy does not occur here. However, theoretically, the universe as a whole is a closed system. So if the matter and energy of the universe is infinitely old (existed in some form before the Big Bang), then total entropy would have already occurred by now in eons past. Therefore, the universe, and matter and energy, must have had a beginning.\n\n \n We don't know if the universe is a closed system.

   "from About.com\n \n C.S. Lewis\n Clive Staples Lewis\n \n Dates:\n Born: November 29, 1898 in Belfast, Ireland\n Died: November 22, 1963 in Oxford, England\n \n Biography:\n C.S. Lewis was an author, a scholar of English literature and a famous Christian apologist. During the 1920s he was an Oxford don and chair of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature. At this time he would later say that he was an atheist but began to move towards a committed, evangelical flavor of Anglicanism.\n \n His fame as an author came on two fronts. One was his fictional works, the most popular of which is the Chronicles of Narnia collection of works for young people, seven books which incorporate Christian themes and doctrines allegorically. The second front of his fame as an author came with books which were more openly written in defense of traditional Christian doctrines. These include the popular The Screwtape Letters, a collection of letters of advice from a demon to his nephew, and the famous book, Mere Christianity which had begun as a series of radio talks in 1941\n \n Because of his simple style and advocacy of traditional, orthodox beliefs in a manner which is easily accessible, Lewis' apologetical works have become standard reading for Christians in the United States. He doesn't talk down to his audience; instead, he treats them as equals and writes for them rather than for philosophers and theologians. One of the consequences, however, is that his arguments often have extensive flaws in their logic and reasoning. His writings may serve as a basic introduction to basic Christian doctrines, but anyone who relies extensively upon them will be ill served in any serious discussion about Christian theology or religious philosophy.\n \n \n Endlessly quoting biased sources really has no utility in a debate.",

   "Time to play this game by Richbee's rules:\n \n I COULD tell you why the universe happened by chance, but let me show you what this website has to say instead:\n \n The Argument from Probability \n \n Before addressing the question of how the laws of physics can have come about in the absence of intelligent design, let me provide a response to the arguments from probability outlined above. \n \n If we properly compute, according to statistical theory, the probability for the universe existing with the properties it has, the result is unity! The universe exists with one hundred percent probability (unless you are an idealist who believes everything exists only in your own mind). On the other hand, the probability for one of a random set of universes being our particular universe is a different question. And the probability that one of a random set of universes is a universe that supports some form of life is a third question. I submit it is this last question that is the important one and that we have no reason to be sure that this probability is small. \n \n I have made some estimates of the probability that a chance distribution of physical constants can produce a universe with properties sufficient that some form of life would have likely had sufficient time to evolve. In this study, I randomly varied the constants of physics (I assume the same laws of physics as exist in our universe, since I know no other) over a range of ten orders of magnitude around their existing values. For each resulting \"toy\" universe, I computed various quantities such as the size of atoms and the lifetimes of stars. I found that almost all combinations of physical constants lead to universes, albeit strange ones, that would live long enough for some type of complexity to form (Stenger 1995: chapter 8). This is illustrated in figure 1. \n \n (picture found on website)\n \n Figure 1. Distribution of stellar lifetimes for 100 random universes in which four basic physics constants (the proton and electron masses and the strengths of the electromagnetic and strong forces) are varied by ten orders of magnitude around their existing values in our universe. Otherwise, the laws of physics are unchanged. Note that in well over half the universes, stars live at least a billion years. From Stenger 1995. \n \n Every shuffle of a deck of cards leads to a 52-card sequence that has low a priori probability, but has unit probability once the cards are all on the table. Similarly, the \"fine-tuning\" of the constants of physics, said to be so unlikely, could very well have been random; we just happen to be in the universe that turned up in that particular deal of the cards. \n \n Note that my thesis does not require more than one universe to exist, although some cosmological theories propose this. Even if ours is the only universe, and that universe happened by chance, we have no basis to conclude that a universe without some form of life was so unlikely as to have required a miracle.  \n \n http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/cosmo.html",

   "Debating is NOT about making people believe in what you believe. Leave that to the media spinners, the JW, and the wild protesters. Debating is NOT about being right or being wrong. Debating is simply a excercise of the mind. It's whether or not you can create an understandable argument.\n\n \n Oh my GAWD!\n \n You just don't get Christian Apologetics!\n \n My goal is to utterly refute Atheism, just like the Book we are discussing here.\n \n Are you surprised? \"I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be An Atheists\" - still true for me!\n \n And, how much Faith do you have?\n \n Atheism is irrational, illogical, incoherant and existentially self-destructive!",
