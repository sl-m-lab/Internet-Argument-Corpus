If in parallel, aren't there boost lag problems??",

If in parallel, aren't there boost lag problems??\n\n \n In drag racing, turbos are always run in parallel. (IIRC, diesel engines sometimes use a small turbo to feed a larger one.)\n By running two smaller turbos instead of a single larger one, turbo lag is reduced. But, to be honest, turbo lag isn't really a problem as long as you can generate sufficient backpressure at the starting line. With modern electronics and three-step ignition boxes, like the Big Stuff 3, it's muich easier that you'd think. Plus, the newer turbos have very low mass and resistance, so they spin up much quicker. We had to go to dual front calipers to keep the car from rolling through the beams as we built boost on the starting line. \n \n My son's an ace at the starting line. He won a $1000 race (LS-1.com) on a holeshot win against a nitrous car a couple of years back when he had small twins in a 94 Camaro w/an LS-1 motor, so, needless-to-say, he does the driving.",

You will pull out to pass somebody stomp on it, and it takes so long for the turbo to spool up that you wonder if the damn thing has broken. I have taken it in to be looked at, but they say it is fine. \n \n That is why I wondered about what kind of turbo system you would put on a drag car, where turbo lag would be a serious liability.
