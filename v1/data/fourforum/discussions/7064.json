Now they just need to explain why these fine folks would spend that money on high cost American consumables and why they would invest their money in a dying country instead of a growing country like India or China. In another 3 years the Chinese stock market will have grown and developed significantly. \n \n There is simply not much left in the US to invest in if you are looking for safe, concrete investments, which is what retirees are generally after. When you hear the Bush administration or their trained economists talking about our \"economic growth\", keep in mind that what theya re really talking abotu is economic expansion. The two are different things. Economic growth comes from increased output by your economy. Economic expansion often does not, but is instead based on margin lending. Our economic expansion has essentially been fueled byt he creeation of fiat money due t our low interest rates. We have essentially been running the printing presses full steam for the last several years. \n \n There is argument that this is acceptable because there is apparently demand for dollars, proven by our relatively low inflation rates. The problem with this thinking is that inflation rarely coincides exactly with economic expansion due to currency creation. It always comes after. It takes a while for the effects to become evident, and generally the full effect is not felt until that fiatmoney starts filtering down to the wage level. The effect is furtehr being forestalled in the case fo the US because nations ar holding large numbers of dollars in order to keep our economy running in the short term so they can continue to sell to us, as well as the demand created due to the fact that all oil transactions take place in dollars.\n \n If either one of those situations change, or even if consumer confidence drops in the US, we are finished. The problem is that change in both of those situations is inevitable. The chinese and japanese will only continue their efforts to keep the dollar as long as it is profitable for them to do so, and it will eventually become unprofitable. Oil transactions will only remain a strictly dollar event as long as that stays profitable, and since most oil producing countries buy their equipment and pay their expenses in Euros, taking dollars as payment will inevitably have to end as the dollars value creeps downward.",

   "IMo the biggest problem is the loss of our industrial infrastructure. A nation, just like a business, generalyl operates at either a net gain or a net loss. A nation builds wealth through exports. New money cones intot he coutnry, and even if it is not backed by precious metals as money once was, it is backed by the strength of that nations export economy. This is why balance of trade is so important.\n \n If, like the US, your nation is a net importer, they are loosing money. Your money is being shipped off to whatever nation the import goods came from. This is a problem in much of tyhe western world. As the west has grown rich, we have grown complacent. We have taken money that should have been used to upgrade and improve our industiral infrastructure tpo pay dividends to stockholders, or higher labor costs. The infrastucture crumbled and died.\n \n This is not just a problem in the US, the British most notably have the same problem,and like the US, they are trying to put a happy face on it.

That is why Marshall Fields is booming, people are spending today like their is is no tommorow. People seem to be forgetting about that future debt bill coming due, or about that far off day called retirement.\n \n \n Overall the American dream became a reality, it became the wealthiest large country on earth.

It doesn't seem all that long since I (in the pose of an \"average consumer\") avoided buying any article made in China or India on the supposition that it would not be a quality product: I relied on \"Made in Germany\", as a first choice, then \"Made in Japan\", with American and British manufactures next in my line of preference.

   "I would also like to point out that it isn`t merely a zero-sum game. Certainly, global competativity is a zero-sum game in that respect that it`s entirely relative to other nations competativity. But it is also about world produktion. The US has long been the economic motor of the world. This has benefited many nations (especially western and developed nations) economicly and has driven technical progress faster than anytime during history.
