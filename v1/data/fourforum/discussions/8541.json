   "Of course, by remaining indifferent to the crisis in the Middle East, the president is winking at some of his strongest supporters: people who were dropped on their heads as babies and subsequently read Left Behind one too many times.\n \n The Left Behinders are positively giddy over developments in Israel, as you can see from these (apparently now deleted) posts on the Rapture Ready message boards:\n \n \n ohappydayIs it time to get excited? I can't help the way I feel. For the first time in my Christian walk, I have no doubts that the day of the Lords appearing is upon us. I have never felt this way before, I have a joy that bubbles up every-time I think of him, for I know this is truly the time I have waited for so long. Am I alone in feeling guilty about the human suffering like my joy at his appearing some how fuels the evil I see everywhere. If it were not for the souls that hang in the balance and the horror that stalks man daily on this earth, my joy would be complete. For those of us who await his arrival know, somehow we just know it won't be long now, the Bridegroom cometh rather man is ready are not.watcherboyit has been quite a day today, if you caught all the news; I'm getting the feeling world tension is gonna be high for a long time with increased terrorism and nations being defiant. I don't think it will cool down until after the rapture when the peace deal is confirmed.\n ifnot4himReady, waiting and excited here! Still telling others whenever possible that the rapture could take place at any time because this world is in such a big MESS and evidently it goes through one ear and right out the other\n comicnurseMy brother has witnessed to some of his friends over and over. He finally prayed to God and asked Him to spare their lives when the rapture happens. Dan has told them, \"When the rapture happens, go to my house and read everything I have in this folder.\" They roll their eyes, but............I'll bet they run to find that folder when the rapture happens!\n WaitinI too am soooo excited!! I get goose bumps, literally, when I watch what's going on in the M.E.!! And Watcherboy, you were so right when saying it was quite a day yesterday, in the world news, and I add in local news here in the Boston area!! Tunnel ceiling collapsed on a car and killed a woman of faith, and we had the most terrifying storms I have ever seen here!! But, yes, Ohappyday, like in your screen name , it is most indeed a time to be happy and excited, right there with ya!!\n Woohoo! We're all gonna die! Meanwhile...\n \n \n harpazo1hey guys...with all that is going on, the excitement is palpable!!! I was (and have been) reflecting lately on what the actual rapture moment will be like (whenever it happens....lol).....i Know it's instantaneous but do ya think we'll have like a second of \"realization\" like (**horn blast**) and then thinking, \"OH IT'S HAPPENING!!! THIS IS IT!!\" Or we'll actually feel ourselves being lifted up and sailing through the air??? OR, do ya think we'll just like blink and be in the presence of the Lord that quick??? (yea i know i think about crazy stuff sometimes....lol) But sometimes when i consider the times, i almost can feel my spirit ready to leap outta my body (if that makes ANY sense....) oh well......back to the news.....just wondering what u guys thought......lol\n Jazzman27I kind of hope for the flying method. I would love to dop some loops on the way up!!\n Is it just me, or are these people one badly-worded sermon away from strapping on a pair of Nikes, downing some phenobarbital-laced vodka, and going to sleep with plastic bags over their heads?\n http://tinyurl.com/qukpw",
