   "An American Muslim convert who sought training in a jihad camp in Yemen drives by a Navy-Army recruiting office in Little Rock, Ark., and shoots and kills Pvt. William Long, standing on the sidewalk, wounding another. \n \n The assassin denies it's murder because Allah told him to kill members of the U.S. armed forces in retaliation for the U.S. killing Muslims. The jihad against America has come home to America again, and what is worse is Obama's FBI knew he was a jihadist and let it happen. \n \n A suposed \"pro-life\" activist shoots and kills the abortionist Dr. George Tiller in his Wichita church. The killer denies it's murder because he's just defending the babies who would have been aborted if the doctor continued his abortions. \n \n A \"white supremacist\" 88-year-old walks into the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., and shoots and kills museum guard Stephan T. Johns, who had opened the door to assist him. \n \n The violence has been taken by the Obama government media as a green light to advance the agenda. Everyone should remember Rahm Emanuel's disclosure that every crisis is an opportunity to advance the agenda. \n \n Abortion clinics all over the country got the protection of U.S. Marshals, even though Tiller was not killed at a clinic. Mean while talking heads and reporters for the government media pounded all pro-life activists as potential doctor killers. \n \n Following the Holocaust museum shooting, the very same talking heads and reporters pounded all conservatives as Jew-haters and potential killers. \n \n Gun control advocates got lots of media exposure with their \"I told you so\" message. No reporter asked why the shooting at the museum could have occurred in D.C. with its perfect gun ban law in place. \n \n Paul Krugman in the New York Times, screeched that Department of Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano's \"Right Wing Extremism Assessment\" was right on the money. This right-wing, Jew-hater killer just proves that all conservatives should be watched by the Department of Homeland Security. This is the treat assessment put out by Homeland Insecurity. \" The \"assessment\" proposed to watch Americans because of their political opinions, not because of any violence. \n \n As more facts on the museum shooting emerged, Krugman's rant began to look silly. The killer apparently hated just about everybody. Yes, he hated Jews and considered himself a white supremacist. But he also thought Christianity was a \"hoax,\" denied the Bible, praised Hitler, denounced Bush and Cheney, was a 9/11 conspiracy fan, had a target list that included the conservative publication \"Weekly Standard,\" and used Darwinism to support his anti-Semitism. A violent nut maybe, but certainly not an American conservative. Even worse for Krugman, Pvt. William Long's assassin told police in Little Rock that his was an act of jihad, a part of his religion. Did Krugman then denounce all Muslims as potential jihadists? \n \n Yet the leftist agenda advances. All conservatives are now suspect. Especially those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves and their loved ones.",

   "Well said Sarge! \n \n What is amazing to me is that the Left desperately want to pin this guy on to the us, on the Right. Claiming that since he was a Nazi he is ours.\n \n Ridiculous! My father fought the Nazis, and helped free the Jews in concentration camps, and all! Claiming that we loved this guy is stooping and pandering to the lowest form of Politicizing in our history! \n \n Just remember, if you create strife within America you reap what you sow! So belly up to the bar, and get some boys, because it is all caused by the discontent you sowed!",

   "More HATE SPEECH from the Left! \n \n  Fueling flames of hatred \n Where did he get his ideas?\n \n It is reasonable to ascribe some measure of \"credit\" to the National Rifle Association for creating individuals like the killer of a security guard at the National Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n \n Among his rantings and ravings is found the allegation that President Obama, a \"creation of the Jews,\" is planning to seize all of the people's weapons. Where would an individual get such a loony idea? Certainly not from the president, who has repeatedly stated he respects the Second Amendment.\n \n It is the NRA that is instilling fear and paranoia in its members by making the phony charge that the president is planning to rob members of their precious lethal weapons.\n \n Oren M. Spiegler\n\n \n Now I'm at fault? Political pandering at it's best! And as far as   Obama's anti-gun record goes, read it for yourselves!  \n Ban semi-automatics, and more possession restrictions\n \n Principles that Obama supports on gun issues:\n \n * Ban the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons.\n \n * Increase state restrictions on the purchase and possession of firearms.\n Source: 1998 IL State Legislative National Political Awareness Test Jul 2, 1998\n\n So go ahead! Throw the Baby out with the Bath Water! Throw your fellow Americans under the bus for political expediency! Just remember, we reap what we sow! emoticon_smile",

   "All of these liberals need to be careful regarding what they say and what they promote. In 1994 the liberal left lost control of congress for 12 long years after they passed the AWB. This time around it could be much worse. Obama and his cronies can't stay in office forever, they're eventually going to **** up and the conservatives will soon be in control once again.\n \n You wanna blame us for all of the ill will going on in the world? You wanna label a neo nazi white supremacist as a conservative, when the nazis killed millions of jews? You wanna label us as domestic terrorists simply because we don't agree with your taking away of individual rights? You're gonna regret this positions.\n \n We don't forget, we're not gonna forgive either. This time the liberals might find themselves subject to the same abuse and persecution they try and make us subject to. Who knows, there might even be a \"denying voting rights to liberal party members\" bill that gets signed into law.",

   "It&#8217;s the NRA&#8217;s fault. \n \n Speaking of legislation that would give the citizens of Washington their first vote in Congress since 1801. \n \n   We're Stronger for the Voting Rights Battle \nThe most recent barricade was erected by the National Rifle Association and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.). The D.C. Voting Rights Act was poisoned by a gun amendment that would strip the District of its gun laws and remove the city's authority to enact gun legislation in the future, effectively placing this historic bill in limbo. It will take political courage by Republican members of Congress and Blue Dog Democrats to unclog the NRA's stoppage of our legislative system.\n \n For years, D.C. voting rights advocates have pushed for monumental steps toward democracy, and along the way, they have been guided and supported by friends in the Wilson Building and the coalition led by DC Vote. Last week was no different. \n \n We have been overcome by messages of support as D.C. residents and grass-roots supporters across the country have pledged to keep fighting. They offer to put signs in their yard, stickers on their cars and posts on their Twitter accounts. In response, we tell them that we are taking the gun amendment head-on and that they should stay with us through this next battle. \n \n We are fueled for change,&#8230;&#8230;.\n\n We want representation in Congress, However, we don&#8217;t want to be forced Follow ALL of the Constitution! Why? Because being forced to Follow all Constitution, the Supreme Law of the Land, is just plain stupid! I guess. \n \n So, DC wants special treatment to violate the Law. Isn't that the definition of Criminal? \n \n Oh Lord. Please help us!",

   " Obama and his cronies can't stay in office forever, they're eventually going to **** up and the conservatives will soon be in control once again.\n\n Actually it is more than that. Yes conservatives will be back in power, but I have never seen so much discontent in America period.\n \n I don't know where we got off track but I think it is this. We are Americans, not Democrat or Republican. Our allegiance belongs to the Republic, not to any political group. While we fight and try to score some kind of political points with each and every event, America is burning. Sooner or later, while we bicker endlessly, the American People are going to be fed up with both parties, and move into something yet not discovered. \n \n Heck, the way China is rising in material wealth, and while we mortgage our Children's futures so that we do not have to feel the pain, maybe we will be just presiding over the destruction of the greatest society even known to man.\n \n All of this is possible unless we find the courage to work together for the good of all America, instead of just trying to play got ya with the other party.\n \n It is what I said a few days ago. United we Stand and Divided We Fall!\n \n However, I doubt the Chinese will be anywhere as benevolent as We the People were. But it seems clear that change is coming, but I sincerely doubt that is has very little to do with the kind of change Obama Envisioned! \n \n So belly up to the bar and Get Some discontent Boys! After all we all have earned it! \n \n We reap what we sow!",
