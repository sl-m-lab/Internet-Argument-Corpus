   "I do not think that homosexuality serves as any form of population control. Unless seen in numbers far higher than we currently see them, it would not be an effective means of population control. Further, under natural selection, population is controlled by the least capable dying off when their food source runs out or something along those lines, not by reducing the birth rate.\n \n Homosexuality may exist for a few reasons, in my opinion. First, it may be that a population with disproportionate numbers of males and females benefits from two members of the same sex pairing up to care for children where one or both parents are absent. On the same note, it may be that companionship alone in populations with disproportionate numbers of males and females is beneficial to the population. In this case, natural selection might choose a set of genes that occasionally creates homosexuality.\n \n Second, it may be that homosexuality is a common mutation that exists in our DNA.\n \n Third, it may be a population benefits from having a variety of sexual attraction so that each male will be attracted to a different female and vice-versa. In this case, it may be that if enough of those sexual attraction genes turn a certain way, the creature's sexual attraction may turn to members of the same sex. However, natural selection might not remove homosexuality completely in this case, because doing so could mean that there isn't a large enough variety in the sexual attraction in the heterosexual part of the species.\n \n Fourth, it may be that the heterozygous condition for homosexuality results in an increased chance of survival. For example, we can look at sickle-cell anemia in Africa. In Africa, sickle-cell anemia is far more common than in other places. It is a genetic disease caused by having two recessive genes. So if you remember those Punnett Squares, we can say:\n \n SS = Normal cells\n Ss = Normal cells\n sS = Normal cells\n ss = Sickle cells\n \n Now, one would think that natural selection would simply remove the recessive gene, leaving no one with sickle-cell anemia. In fact, that is what has happened in most other places in the world. But in Africa, this hasn't happened. The reason is that this gene has more than one function. The heterozygous condition (Ss or sS) gives protection from malaria, which is a common disease in Africa. So what we really have is:\n \n SS = Normal cells, no protection from malaria\n Ss = Normal cells, protection from malaria\n sS = Normal cells, protection from malaria\n ss = Sickle cells\n \n So natural selection weeds out both the SS and the ss gene combintions. It favors the heterozygous condition. And two heterozygous parents having a child will have a child that could either be SS or ss, so those gene combinations won't be removed through natural selection.\n \n This is just a simplified version of what could be happening across a large number of genes determining sexual orientation.",

   "\n by Bruce Bagemihl, PhD in Biological Exuberance\n \n The world is, indeed, teeming with homosexual, bisexual and transgendered creatures of every stripe and feather. More than 130 different bird species worldwide are literally XXXXX. Species include primates, marine mammals, hoofed mammals, carnivores, marsupials, rodents and insectivores, waterfowl & other aquatic birds, wading birds, shore birds, perching birds, songbirds and other birds, on every continent and ocean. All observed in the wild, not including any zoo observations.\n\n The proof is apparent. But, what are nature's intentions of allowing such a behavior? In the animal kingdom (mammals specifically) to control population, to preserve foodstuffs, where diseases and famine threaten, and due to loss of habitation, the males of the species will commit infanticide. Since human beings are not animals, imo, then homosexuality is one solution, but not totally. If that was the only reason for homosexuality, then all males, not just a few, would be born with a desire for same-sex relationships. Homosexuality among humans, like that of animals, has occurred since the dawn of time. With that in mind, and knowing that some males are born with feminine traits and some females are born with male traits, it stands to reason that \"nature\" has taken its course, developing behavior in opposition to the norm. This does not and will never indicate that homosexuality is unnatural. Normalcy is a condition which is accepted by certain groups whereby they expect a particular behavior and judge it accordingly. Natural characteristics, as I have stated, come with birth and must be overcome by that person if they so desire.\n \n Homosexuality in that sense, imo, is an indicator that nature has nothing to do with it in the long run. Sounds like I'm contradicting myself, but look at it like this: We are born with a certain nature and tend to live a normal life until we discover who we are. This comes along sometime in our early-teens. It is then that we can decide to accept and agree with it or reject it and change. It is our desire to be the way that we are, and should never be forced to change by someone, who, for the most part, don't have a clue who they are.\n \n Homosexuality is only wrong to those that believe in God and His Word.

If humans are not animals, why appeal to the \"animal\" kingdom as an example of something? Should we conclude something \"acceptable\" (if that's what you're arguing) about, say, the Twin Towers being on fire by appealing to trees burning in a forest, having been struck by lightening? \n \n You seem to be implying that nature's intention of \"homosexuality\" is to preserve foodstuffs, etc. In humans, this suggestion seems baseless. Is there any evidence to suggest, for example, that \"homosexual\" rates are greater in regions of famine, than in regions of plenty? The evidence very well could show the inverse relationship.\n \n \n If that was the only reason for homosexuality, then all males, not just a few, would be born with a desire for same-sex relationships.

While some genetic correlation seems to be present with gays, apparently there is even less (or none) with lesbians. \n \n \n This does not and will never indicate that homosexuality is unnatural. \n\n That's right.

The notion (raised elsewhere) that a countervailing genetic selective advantage (in being a \"carrier of homosexuality\") is interesting. However, my simplistic analysis shows that \"carriers\" would have to breed at twice the rate of non-carriers to support an 11% purely genetically based \"homosexual\" (non-breeding) population.

Individuals do not have a \"population control\" built into them, because we all exist seperately from one another and we all seek to spread our genetic makeup. Basically, each of us has our own genetic best interests at heart, and we want to spread them. That's the basics of evolutionary theory.\n \n If you want to transcend evolutionary theory and claim that there is some outside force controlling our society and exerting population control by increasing the incidence of homosexuality...that's really getting outside of the realm of \"nature\" and a hair's breadth away from advocating \"intelligent design\"",

   "First, let me say this: I think that my belief in God and because I am a Christian has clouded your judgment of my post.\n \nYour logic doesn't seem to follow. If humans are not animals, why appeal to the \"animal\" kingdom as an example of something? Should we conclude something \"acceptable\" (if that's what you're arguing) about, say, the Twin Towers being on fire by appealing to trees burning in a forest, having been struck by lightening?\n\n I am referring to the animal kingdom as a trigger of traits exhibited naturally. If you read closely I am trying to cut a path in another direction - in doing so, however, it became necessary to stay in the flow of the discussion, i.e.: Could it be population control and is this normal in the animal kingdom?\n Now, check your first reply and see if it sets well.\n \nYou seem to be implying that nature's intention of \"homosexuality\" is to preserve foodstuffs, etc. In humans, this suggestion seems baseless. Is there any evidence to suggest, for example, that \"homosexual\" rates are greater in regions of famine, than in regions of plenty? The evidence very well could show the inverse relationship.\n\n Again, read my post very carefully. I am not saying that homosexuality is an offensive reaction to nature.\n \n\"Nature\" has taken its course? Studies show that genetics does not determine \"sexual orientation\". While some genetic correlation seems to be present with gays, apparently there is even less (or none) with lesbians.\n\n That's your opinion - and I agree with it. Even so, desire is a natural occurrence, wouldn't you say? For example: Did chimpanzees, 3 million years ago, decide to walk upright or did genetics force them to do so? If there were an abundance of trees, close enough to swing from limb to limb in order to live, would there be a desire to walk upright?\n \nThat's right. On the other hand, flying planes into the Twin Towers is also natural, i.e., occurs in nature.\n\n I realize that Christians are considered ignorant, but this is really way out in left field. Insulting my integrity? You just as well send me a \"See Spot Run\" book...\n Flying planes into buildings will never be a building block for humanity - in other words - evolution will reject that behavior outright.\n BTW- Blowing your head off occurs in nature, but you can only do it once.\n \nA person is being formed continually by his environment. You don't seem to recognize this.\n\n Who doesn't seem to realize it?\n \nOnce again, you seem to be asserting that one is autonomous from his environment.\n\n In a sense, we are. Our brains are given signals by which it grows. If those signals are not given, the brain separates, or dies in certain areas, preventing any further growth even if sent massive signals...forever.\n But, I am not saying that we are totally independent of our environment. Notice I said, \"we tend to lead a normal life until we discover who we are\". In my opinion, despite our environment, we thrive to fulfill our desires.\n \nThere is no moral absolute or natural law against flying planes into the Twin Towers.\n\n Keeping this in context - to God there is.\n \nHowever, there is immense natural selective pressure against \"homosexuality\", so in that sense there is a \"natural law\" against it. The notion (raised elsewhere) that a countervailing genetic selective advantage (in being a \"carrier of homosexuality\") is interesting. However, my simplistic analysis shows that \"carriers\" would have to breed at twice the rate of non-carriers to support an 11% purely genetically based \"homosexual\" (non-breeding) population. Again, studies show that \"homosexuality\" is not (solely, or even dominantly) determined genetically.\n\n I agree, but that has nothing to do with nature. If lip plates were natural and if nature trumps genetics in every case, there would be no requirement for young Mursi women of Ethiopia to pierce their bottom lips.\n \nPerhaps you don't know what you saying. In many countries, they certainly do have the right.\n\n Even if I did know what I was saying - judgment has no place in religion.",

I'm not saying anything than that which is accepted by science except the animal/human relationship.\n Get over or around that part and accept is as my opinion. \n\n \n You said:\n \n \n The proof is apparent. But, what are nature's intentions of allowing such a behavior? In the animal kingdom (mammals specifically) to control population, to preserve foodstuffs, where diseases and famine threaten, and due to loss of habitation, the males of the species will commit infanticide. Since human beings are not animals, imo, then homosexuality is one solution, but not totally. \n\n \n My objection is:\n \n You seem to be implying that nature's intention of \"homosexuality\" is to preserve foodstuffs, etc. In humans, this suggestion seems baseless. Is there any evidence to suggest, for example, that \"homosexual\" rates are greater in regions of famine, than in regions of plenty? The evidence very well could show the inverse relationship. \n\n I'm looking for you to substantiate your apparent claim that homosexuality is related to population control, specifically to preserve food stuffs. A much simpler approach to preserve food stuffs is just to die in the uterus, and as soon as possible. Why emerge \"homosexual\" and consume more food stuffs? I'm looking for you to provide some data (or at least some kind or reason) to substantiate your apparent claim.\n \n \n This is exactly what closed-mindedness does for any debate - once a person that believes in Creation publishes his opinion - it's thrown out...nothing else falls within any guidelines. Do you agree or disagree? I think that's the crux of your argument anyway. Right? Since this a dumb Christian - dismiss it... \n\n Oh, I can see why you might feel that there is a knee jerk reaction to dismiss creation and christianity. However, I see no evidence that I'm doing that. I look at the logic. If it appears flawed, then I attempt to demonstrate that where the flaw is. [Please note that I questioned biccat's logic as well. Is he a creationist or a christian?] In this case, you seem to be insinuating that I'm attempting to poison your well. Instead of insinuating that my argument in fallacious, please quote the offending text. If you can't counter with logic, just concede. \n \n \n It is not known for certain what causes same-sex desires. Until then it's all an opinion - whether genetics or just plain human desire. \n\n This makes no sense. That's like saying: If one doesn't know the exact distance to the sun, that one cannot conclude that the sun isn't 3 inches from the earth's (mean) surface. The studies show that homosexuality is not purely (or even dominantly) genetic. It isn't \"all opinion\". It is a fact.\n \n \n Maybe I should have gone more into detail: Chimpanzee-like should have been used, since the creature discovered more favored that species than any other. And had it not been for the requirement of walking upright, then there may have never been a Lucy. \n\n You have conceded that it wasn't a chimpanzee, but avoided the main point: Bipedalism is not due to a desire. \n \n \n Again with this? Please... \n\n Yes, again, please. Please distinguish between a desire for a homosexual relationship and the desire to fly a plane into a building. Are those two desires equally acceptable, and if not, why not? Both desires seem to be have selective pressures against them, yet both desires are present in nature. Address the point or admit that you have no answer. Your insinuation that the point isn't worth debating seems to be exactly the kind of closed-mindedness that you objected to earlier. You seem to want to have things both ways. Support your position or abandon it.\n \n \n How do you know it will not? Do you have proof that homosexuality will destroy mankind? \n\n You missed the point. I'm asking for you to delineate homosexuality from crashing planes. I'm not saying that homosexuality will do anything. Your argument against flying planes into buildings can equally be used against homosexuality. I'm looking for a logical reason that crashing planes should be rejected and homosexuality be accepted. If you say, \"Flying planes into buildings will never be a building block for humanity\", then I can make the same statement about homosexuality. If you reject crashing planes, then why don't you reject homosexuality (since the reason given is exactly the same)?\n \n \n What if religion did not exist? Would mankind then become better or worse because of homosexuality? Would mankind evlove into another species where gender is not required for birth? \n\n I don't see what any of this has to with the question put to you: Why not reject homosexuality on the same basis given for crashing planes? (I don't know how religion got into this, since neither of us mentioned it right here.)\n \n \n Is suicide the same as homosexuality? You use a state of religious fanaticism for example. Remove that and what would cause someone to fly a plane into a building? I proclaim that the desire would vanish. \n\n So, we agree, at least in this case, that the desire is conditioned.\n \n \n Remove all outside influences, including religion, from a person that desires a same-sex relationship and that desire would remain. That, and that alone, is the crux of my post - despite your attempt to sabotage it. \n\n Your position is vacuous. Not all outside influences can be removed. However, I think in analogous situations, you will not get what you expect. People are apparently \"designed\" to be bipedal. However, when children are raised with dogs (instead of people), they move around on all fours. I'm not sure that sex between wild children and dogs has been documented, but it is surely not beyond the realm of possibilities. This sort of behavior (due to imprinting) is documented among other animals, and bestiality in humans does occur in nature. Once again, studies show that sexual orientation is not solely or even dominantly determined by genetics. In the absence of genetic determination, we are left with environment as at least a major factor. You may dispute it, but you have yet to provide a rational argument.\n \n \n No matter how we slice it, we are born with certain traits. We can overcome some of them, while other elements of our persona will remain. And as I have stated, it would seem that I am contradicting myself, but it was necessary in order to make a point. Did you miss that? Or is it another unecessary aspect of a Christian?\n The desire to overcome is inborn, yes. We all have that desire to overcome adversity - some more than others. \n\n The desire to overcome is inborn, e.g., to overcome homosexuality? On what basis do you make that claim? How do explain identical twins, only one of which is a homosexual? Why were they both not born with the desire to \"overcome\"? Your position makes no sense. \n \n \n Orientation may not be inborn - I truly have no idea. But, the fact that some men are born feminine is no secret. Since that is proven, then how does a female not desire a male - no matter how many \"things\" they have or don't have anatomically? \n\n It is a secret to me. What do you mean \"feminine\"? Where is it proven? The link between homosexuality and genetics is not strong, therefore your apparent conclusion is unfounded. \n \n \n Surely, surely, you missed my point. If genetics played a role in lip discs after so many hundreds of years of performance, then the young girls would be born with at least peirced lips... \n\n \n It is you that missed the point. You said: \n \n In my opinion, despite our environment, we thrive to fulfill our desires. \n\n I questioned whether the desire to wear lip-discs was inborn (using your example as counter example here). Are desires inborn or they not inborn? \n \n \n As I stated: \"In context.\" . \n\n What context? Your personal context? How does that make crashing planes an absolute wrong? Their personal context says something else.\n \n \n Again, your bouncing around the subject as if I were trying to catch your pants on fire...and you're confusing the issue. Your \"simplistic analysis\" may very well be more complicated than my simple view, but natural selection and genetic selection advantage are two different branches of the same tree. You must have a requirement for change in order for it to happen. Life does not change before its habitat changes - unless you truly believe in the God of the Bible... \n\n You're not answering the question. I said:\n \n However, there is immense natural selective pressure against \"homosexuality\", so in that sense there is a \"natural law\" against it. The notion (raised elsewhere) that a countervailing genetic selective advantage (in being a \"carrier of homosexuality\") is interesting. However, my simplistic analysis shows that \"carriers\" would have to breed at twice the rate of non-carriers to support an 11% purely genetically based \"homosexual\" (non-breeding) population. Again, studies show that \"homosexuality\" is not (solely, or even dominantly) determined genetically. \n\n Your reply [in part] was:\n \n I agree, but that has nothing to do with nature. \n\n Answer the question: What has nothing to do with nature? Genetics?\n \n \n Okay. It's acceptable. Crash and burn, toby... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n I thought you said it was an absolute wrong. You seem to be contracting yourself. Are you conceding the argument, or just trying to elude it? This appears more of the closed-mindedness to which you object. Is the best you can do is feign agreement, or do you have any logical retort? Are you conceding that your arguments in favor of the acceptability of homosexuality work equally well for the acceptability of crashing planes? If then, as you say, plane crashing is immoral absolutely, then what possible rationale can you have that a claim that homosexuality is immoral absolutely is unacceptable?

Read my post. Then address it. Your supposition about sparseness makes little sense.

At any rate, there is no evidence that more homosexuals are born as the result (to any degree whatsoever) of dwindling resources. \n \n \nI'm not trying to say homosexuality is strictly genetic, because I think that's a very narrow minded view. I think homosexuality, like almost every other genetic trait, is driven by both genetics and environmental factors, with neither being strictly determinative of sexuality.\n\n I think you should have left out the word \"genetic\" from the phrase \"genetic trait\". But, yes, this is the geneticist's viewpoint: Genetics provides bounds of a trait, while environment determines where within the bounds. Studies show that genetics is not the determinative (or even the major) cause of homosexuality. Ironically, it appears that \"homosexuality\" is caused in no small part by current environmental pressures against an even more scurrilous phenomenon.",

   "\n Your argument about dark skin may just be a straw man, because we know that dark skin is limited by region and therefore race; but there's no evidence that homosexuality is (or is not) directly linked to the essential traits of humanity. \n\n Instead of addressing what was in front of you, you've decided to go back. I hope this doesn't put us in a loop. Here's what was said:\n \n \nOn the other hand, if homosexuality is (at least partially) genetic, then it would tend occur with equal regularity among all populations. \n\n \n \nThat simply doesn't follow. Dark skin is genetic and does not occur equally in all populations. \n\n Your premise is that homosexuality is at least partially genetic. Don't complain to me about your premise. I'm saying that, given your premise, that the logic is fouled. I can say the same thing about skin color, and you already agree that that logic doesn't hold. \n \n \nPossibly, but again, there's been no evidence proposed here. \n\n Are you seriously proposing that the incidence of homosexual acts was not higher in ancient Greece society than in modern times? I think you are being disingenuous. \n \n \nI have no idea what the hell you're trying to say with your comparison here. Care to clarify? \n\n When is a population in jeopardy of being over-populated? In the outback in Australia, each sheep needs 30 acres (I'm making this up, but the gist is correct), and in Ireland a sheep needs 3 acres. So, say there are 2 sheep on a 30-acre parcel in Ireland, and 1 sheep on a 30-acre parcel in the Australian outback. The sheep are more sparsely populated in Australia, but that doesn't mean that the system is less close to its carrying capacity than the system in Ireland. In fact, the Ireland parcel can maintain 8 more sheep. The issue would be sparseness if resources per area were a constant; however this is not the case in general. A fetus might be able to detect caloric intake, but it can't easily determine \"sparseness\", neither would that be a good measure. \n \n \nAnyway, my entire point (which you seem to have missed because you're narrowly construeing everything I say) is that genetics cannot be the sole determining factor, but it must play a part. \n\n Don't blame me if what you say doesn't make sense in every infinitesimal detail. Instead of blaming the messenger, why don't you consider that perhaps you should take greater care in what you say?\n It's not clear that genetics \"must\" play a part. Studies suggest that there is genetic component (at least for gays), but I guess I'm not sure why you believe that genetics \"must\" play a part. \n \n \nI don't know how big that part is. I don't know what exact genes make someone likely to be gay. I don't know what environmental stimuli cause a person with this genetic makeup to be gay. The response was to the initial question: there is no natural cause because homosexuality is not a purely natural phenominon. \n\n Do you mean to say that: \"Homosexuality is not a purely natural phenomenon\"? Are you suggesting that the environment is not natural? That socialization, no matter what it entails, is not natural? Is a kitten learning to hunt from its mother natural? I don't see how learned behaviors are any less natural than instinctive behaviors.\n \n \nHomosexuality is driven by both genetics and society, and so the original question is based on a faulty assumption.\n\n What original question? The first post said [in part]:\n \"Homosexuality is regarded as a natural occurence, documented in humans as well as numerous species of animals, birds, mammals, and such. My question is what would its purpose be?\"\n I don't see that there is a premise given (explicitly) that homosexuality is driven any particular way-only that it is natural.

   "Oh. It seems hypocritical; that of course doesn't make it unacceptable.\n\n I'll drop that part for now - this just goes 'round and 'round...\n \n Let's continue.\n \nWhich way is it? You say: \"man is an animal\" and \"human beings are not animals\" (in your opinion). My complaint is that you are inconsistent. Pick a view and stick to it; don't pick whatever looks good based on what you just happen to be trying to prove at the time.\n\n Let me explain how this started for you.\n It was suggested that homosexuality might be induced by nature to control population. I replied that, yes, since homosexuality is observed quite often in nature, and that there seems to be some link to population control being a trigger for such actions, that could be one factor. I went on to explain about the male of the animal species doing other things to control population such as infanticide. Then, there is where I lost you, I suppose - for it was then that I went down another path and voiced my opinion that mankind is no animal and that homosexuality was purely a desire. That there is no proof that homosexuality is driven by genetics, but that, also, there is no proof that it's caused by basic human desire.\n \n I choose to believe that it is driven by desire. I supported that by saying that there is proof that some men, e.g., or born with feminine traits and that there are specifics about that individual's persona that will tend to make them desire male companionship. It's a natural phenomenon. However, that desire can be overcome if that person so chooses. There is also proof of that. That is not to say that all males that choose to live a homosexual life will be born with feminine attributes, however.\n Follow me so far?\n \n You then proclaimed that that desire is the same as the desire to fly planes into buildings. I fail to see the connection. Homosexuality is not a religious belief.\n \n And it has been suggested that it is plausible that the requirement for Lucy to walk upright triggered the genetic change. If you want to get into greater detail, then I admit that I can't go with you. It's not that I can't understand it, but that I've not studied it enough to debate about it.\n \n Again, nature has its way of directing animals and a way of directing mankind, but human beings, imo, are not on the same scale as animals due to many factors. And, yes, circumstances and environment - either natural or manmade - can cause behavioral changes in both humans and animals.

Why should the burden be on me to be forced into swallowing what he says, when (according to your supposition) it should be an easy matter for him to amend his logic.\n \n (See the Post Script for more on this.)\n \n \nI already told you, regarding this discussion you and Biccat were having, I don't have a position. \n\n Well, I do not accept the god-like status you project, so kindly go away. Get in or get out. Your presumptive status as something other than a debater is repugnant. Perhaps there is a list of gods of which I am unaware: Please send it.\n \n You have said: \"I'm more than happy to \"back out\"...\" However, you still refuse to. Ironically, you have outlasted biccat (who has already conceded). This makes your statement that you are \"happy to back out\" quite laughable, doesn't it? Gods leave neither quickly nor silently.\n \n \nAnd it's not \"swallowing his logic\" to simply acknowledge the areas he agrees with you. That's good curteous discussion.\n\n I find your suggestion that I am not courteous to be not only baseless, but also hypocritical. Your supposed establishment as god in this matter is atrociously bad manners. It has been made plainly clear that your meddling is unwelcome and you refuse to leave. You say that you would be \"happy to back out\", but you don't. Your rudeness is only outdone by your arrogance: Only a god has prerogatives such as those you exhibit. \n I did agree with biccat, as I do with Big Orn, or whomever I am debating, as dictated by logic. For example: \"[] yes, this is the geneticist's viewpoint: Genetics provides bounds of a trait, while environment determines where within the bounds.\"\n \n Get your facts straight. If you are going to pretend to be god, at least have a logical point: At least one.\n \n Post Script:\n For your information, the debate with biccat was just getting interesting. The upshot is that an amendment to his argument would have presented far reaching consequential problems. You bumbled in at quite an unfortunate moment. We had not yet gotten to the original question:\n \"Homosexuality is regarded as a natural occurence, documented in humans as well as numerous species of animals, birds, mammals, and such. My question is what would its purpose be?\"\n \n My opponent was denying the validity of the premise (i.e., the naturalness of homosexuality). What possible reason would you have for not wanting him to explain why the premise is invalid? The question or naturalness is certainly germane to the initial question raised. Really: Your bumbling boggles the mind. \n \n Furthermore, I for one, was interested in how I was going to argue \"both sides\" of the debate simultaneously. Here was your chance to see each of my opponents (Big Orn and biccat) use my own arguments against me. As I say, somebody, just somebody, may have wanted to see that: I mean a completely rational debate instead of prejudice. Too bad you had to mastermind the situation. I can no longer do what I want: Biccat is long gone. Therefore, there will be no (more) ready ammunition for Big Orn. For a god, you seem to be rather inept. Of course, that may well be the state of affairs for all gods.",

   "Therefore, there will be no (more) ready ammunition for Big Orn.\n\n Can you explain this?\n \n In the meantime, let's go back a ways:\n \nYour logic doesn't seem to follow. If humans are not animals, why appeal to the \"animal\" kingdom as an example of something?\n\n It was suggested that homosexuality is brought about by nature to control population. See below:\n \nPerhaps it's a type of population control? What are your thoughts?\n\n and\n \nPopulation control......\n\n To show correlation with that (i.e. to show that nature does indeed control population) I replied in a logical manner by introducing methods by which this was done. Hence my answer below:\n \n In the animal kingdom (mammals specifically) to control population, to preserve foodstuffs, where diseases and famine threaten, and due to loss of habitation, the males of the species will commit infanticide.\n\n I had read this article some time ago and cannot find it on the Internet, but have found something similar:\n http://www-personal.umich.edu/~phyl/weektwelve.html\n However, after presenting this information, I introduced my opinion that human beings are not animals, and I say that due to the fact that I believe God when He said that we are fearfully - as in exceptionally - and wonderfully - as in magnificently, created. This is information from the Holy Bible and is by no means logical...and will never be logical by any standard. You can either accept that or reject it. This is my reply to the question and no one else's and there are no links or studies to prove me right or wrong. But, I feel that the remainder of my reply falls within the guidelines of accepted logic - that being the following:\n \n Homosexuality among humans, like that of animals, has occurred since the dawn of time. With that in mind, and knowing that some males are born with feminine traits and some females are born with male traits, it stands to reason that \"nature\" has taken its course, developing behavior in opposition to the norm. This does not and will never indicate that homosexuality is unnatural. Normalcy is a condition which is accepted by certain groups whereby they expect a particular behavior and judge it accordingly. Natural characteristics, as I have stated, come with birth and must be overcome by that person if they so desire.\n\n Jannsen B (a real person) was born a male; there were no traits that would lead one to believe otherwise. However, after a couple of years he began to show distinguishable qualities that would suggest that he was different. Each year would prove more progression towards feminist behavior. Soon it became apparent, not only to himself, but all those around him that he was \"a female in a male's body\". He has not decided which direction he will follow, but has yet to \"date\" a girl and is a full-grown, young man.\n Betty W (also a real person) was another person that was born opposite than the gender indicated. She played boys' sports and was considered a \"boy\" by her young playmates. She never exhibited any female traits, not even large breasts - even though she did have them they were \"unusually small\". She is now living a happy life with her female partner, working at a gas distribution plant and doing \"a man's job\".\n On the other end of the spectrum, there is Bobby S, a real person, also born feminine, who chose to remain a male in every facet of his life, has been married for almost fifty years (to the same woman), has four children and 12 grandchildren.\n This is just three of hundreds of cases. This called Gender dysphoria or Gender identity disorder (You can Google them for more information). As far as agreeing or disagreeing - I need more information on how this developes, but this is what is widely believed and documented.\n You then stated:\n \n Should we conclude something \"acceptable\" (if that's what you're arguing) about, say, the Twin Towers being on fire by appealing to trees burning in a forest, having been struck by lightening?\n\n This is what I had trouble with, considering that you seemed to be an intelligent person. Since I do strive to be patient, however, I will give you the benefit of the doubt.\n We accept that there is a decline in some amphibious species (decline as being: The condition whereby the local loss of populations across the normal range of a species so exceeds the rate at which populations may be established, or reestablished, that there is a definite downward trend in population number). It can't be explained, but it's observable and we accept it as true. That is the \"acceptable\" that I am referring to. I doubt that anything so appalling and abnormal as the Twin Towers burning will ever be \"acceptable\".\n \nYou seem to be implying that nature's intention of \"homosexuality\" is to preserve foodstuffs, etc. In humans, this suggestion seems baseless. Is there any evidence to suggest, for example, that \"homosexual\" rates are greater in regions of famine, than in regions of plenty? The evidence very well could show the inverse relationship.\n\n First of all, it was not my intention to imply that nature's intentions of homosexuality was to preserve foofstuffs, etc. My aim was to lead to homosexually as one way nature could control population - as I stated above. And with humans, it could very well seem baseless.\n \n You then stated:\n \nA person is being formed continually by his environment. You don't seem to recognize this.\n\n I do recognize this and replied:\n \nWho doesn't seem to realize it?\n\n I was a bit hasty and should have explained. First of all, we are all formed in some way, shape, form, or fashion by our environment. There have been numerous reports of young soldiers returning from war with an appearance so different than when they left, that their own parents did not readily recognize them. Also your reference to children living among animals, dogs specifically, where the children would move about on all fours. Here, I take responsibility for \"dropping the ball\", in that I should have gone more into detail.\n \n I then stated:\n \n Homosexuality in that sense, imo, is an indicator that nature has nothing to do with it in the long run. Sounds like I'm contradicting myself, but look at it like this: We are born with a certain nature and tend to live a normal life until we discover who we are. This comes along sometime in our early-teens. It is then that we can decide to accept and agree with it or reject it and change. It is our desire to be the way that we are, and should never be forced to change by someone, who, for the most part, don't have a clue who they are.\n \n to which you replied:\n \nOnce again, you seem to be asserting that one is autonomous from his environment. \n\n And I still believe that, in a sense we are. That is just my opinion since there have been studies that show ghetto kids growing up opposite of that behavioral background.\n \n You asserted:\n \nThere is no moral absolute or natural law against flying planes into the Twin Towers. \n \n However, there is immense natural selective pressure against \"homosexuality\", so in that sense there is a \"natural law\" against it. The notion (raised elsewhere) that a countervailing genetic selective advantage (in being a \"carrier of homosexuality\") is interesting. However, my simplistic analysis shows that \"carriers\" would have to breed at twice the rate of non-carriers to support an 11% purely genetically based \"homosexual\" (non-breeding) population. Again, studies show that \"homosexuality\" is not (solely, or even dominantly) determined genetically.\n\n Again, thinking only that you were being testy and believing that you were much more intelligent than you are letting on, I inserted my belief and admit that it was also a bit hasty. It does not change my answer, however, in any way. I admitted that your analysis could be much more complex than my simple mind could grasp, but that an environmental change (or any change for that matter - such as lip piercing) does not necessarily mean genetic changes. If an organism is required to change in order to live in that environment (or due to lip piercing) I believe that genetic change will occur.\n \n And when you stated:\n \nPerhaps you don't know what you saying. In many countries, they certainly do have the right.\n\n I see religion as a judgmental body of believers, sometimes with good intentions, sometimes with bad. But, it is my opinion, that no matter what the belief, no body of person should have the right to judge one or more persons. That is strictly my opinion and a digression on my part. It should have been omitted to begin with.\n \n Hopefully this will get us back on track and you can proceed with your rebuttal or reception.",

That is why we need to study and understand this phenomenon in another light. Not all tendencies are acted upon, especially when a person's desires override those propensities. (I apologize for confusing the wordage earlier and will correct that here.) When a male displays feminine traits, and a female displays masculine traits, those qualities are not always put into action. Why? It is the natural thing to do, is it not? Is it not natural for a female to desire a male? Then it stands to reason that it is natural for a feminine male to desire one of the same sex. But, due to our ability to reason, to establish guidelines of behavior according to normal standards of conduct, a person may desire, or choose, not to become homosexual. (Here I would like to point out that I am in no way asserting what \"normal standards of conduct\" may or may not be for a particular region or society).\n \nIf orientation is not determined genetically, then what does it mean for \"nature\" to take it course?\n\n I have no proof that orientation is established via genetics.

This phenomenon hardly explains the vast majority of homosexuality. Hundreds of \"cases\" pales in comparison to hundreds of millions of homosexuals (world wide). \n\n It only stands as evidence for me, and others if they wish to pursue it, that genetics could be responsible for those particular traits. I think it's worth the study. And, if that's been done and has come to some conclusion, I would be interested in reading it.\n \nIf man is not an animal, then traits/characteristics/behaviors of animals should not be used to explain or otherwise justify traits/characteristics/behaviors in man.\n\n No, it should not. That is why I explained it away from animals and towards mankind. It would take an unstable human being to gnaw the testicles from his own newborn child in order to control population. Human don't do that - we have operations for such things. :)\n It is very hard to discuss such things in an anti-religious manner when one's beliefs play an important role in how the body and mind works, and why. For that you will just have to bear with me. \n \nAll mortals die. If Aristotle is a mortal, then he will die. If Aristotle is not a mortal, then all bets are off: he may die or he may not die. One can conclude nothing from the premise (all mortals die) if Aristotle is not a mortal. My example was slightly different.

It could very well seem baseless, because it is baseless.\n\n You are of that opinion and nothing I can say will change that. But, you have to understand that just because we live in the same environment as animals and have some of the same basic needs, it does not mean that we are animals. It is, here, a matter of belief on my part and on your part a matter of accepted science. If it were put to a vote - you would win in a landslide. This is also something you will have to bear with me on, if you wish to continue.\n \nOkay, but you are about to contradict yourself...(about be autonomous from our environment)\n \n I'm sorry: This makes no sense (if I'm reading your implication correctly). The \"ghetto\" is not a uniform environment. Not all kids have the same \"ghetto\" experience. Parents are different. Siblings are different. Friends are different. Teachers are different. \"Natural\" abilities are different. \"Random\" experiences are different. Sheesh. You could even take credit that some kids get guidance from the church, while others do not. \n\n A weak analogy, maybe. Perhaps too simple. But, this is where the spirit of man triumphs over animals or any other creature. We have the power, due to our inner-man, our spirit and soul, to overcome our desires. Some may disparage the idea, attempting to explain observable reality while holding to the idea that God is Lord. Religion has crapped in its nest long enough to turn-up noses to that endeavor. But, I will continue to search for reasons why so many are suffering with existence due to the way they were born. And this is my quest. If I learn something or you or someone else can show just cause that the path I am on is in vain, then I appreciate it. \n I am not here to show my intelligence, which is evident, but to learn. If I can't speak my mind and spread my ideas onto the table, then I have no business here. By the same token, you shouldn't discourage that effort by picking apart my belief.\n \nFrankly I do not see how you reconcile that \"we are all formed in some way, shape, form, or fashion by our environment\" and yet we are autonomous from it. You seem to be arguing with yourself.\n\n That is the problem we face. All too often we accept that we are trapped into being how our environment has formed us. We grow weak, discouraged and finally succumb to it. Our mannerisms are dictated by our surroundings, but our minds will only be blocked when we choose to give up. If we so choose, or desire, to break away from it, then we become self-sufficient, and thus, capable of forming a new life. We are essentially a different person. \n \nI think we are pretty much in agreement here, although I'm not sure about your reference to lip piercing. Populations that are having their lips pierced might develop clotting blood, infection resistance, etc. (They wouldn't likely develop lip holes, unless that trait itself was being selected for.) There is no guarantee that they will by necessity however develop adaptations; they may simply go extinct. The dodo bird required the ability to fly (run extra fast or something), but was unable to acquire that adaptation in time.\n\n This was in reference to genetics motivating a species to change, instead of environmental pressures triggering the requirement to mutate genes. \n \nPlease also take note of your amphibians. \n\n Yes, we shall see.",

   "Having womanly mannerisms.\n (I have to say - you act as if you want me to patronize you. I'm not going to do that, toby. I think you know what feminine means...) \n\n That is not quantification. The reason for wanting quantification is to have something to measure. If what you have in mind can't be measured very well, then it is probably difficult to test any kind of theory regarding it. \n \nI posted three living proofs, evidence that is irrefutable. Then I gave you the name particular to that condition. \n\n When you started into this notion, it appeared that you were attempting to address homosexuality as a whole. (Actually, it still appears that way.) Therefore you don't need a few hundred \"cases\", but hundreds of millions of \"cases\". Okay, I have a theory: Everybody that dies, does so on Mt. Everest. There are dozens of cases of documented cases of deaths on Mt. Everest. Mallory and his partner died on Mt. Everest. The name of the particular condition is called hypothermia. The evidence is irrefutable. My theory is just as good as yours; in fact better. At least I can measure whether somebody was on Mt. Everest.\n \nIt is indeed unfounded, and evidence does not always equate to proof, but that is where I believe (no proof for my theory) that \"nature takes its course\".

If they are determined genetically, then homosexuality is 100% determined by genetics. Studies show that homosexuality cannot possibly be 100% genetic, as there are identical twins that have differing orientations. Therefore there is something wrong with your premises. \n \n \nI have no proof that orientation is established via genetics. I believe that genetics is responsible for masculine traits in women and feminine traits in men, but can't find enough evidence to support orientation. \n\n The question was: What does it mean for nature to take its course?\n \n \n It only stands as evidence for me, and others if they wish to pursue it, that genetics could be responsible for those particular traits. I think it's worth the study. And, if that's been done and has come to some conclusion, I would be interested in reading it. \n\n Do a search on \"twin study\" or \"twin studies\" and \"homosexual\". That should convince you that genetics is not deterministic in orientation. \n \n \n No, it should not. That is why I explained it away from animals and towards mankind. It would take an unstable human being to gnaw the testicles from his own newborn child in order to control population. Human don't do that - we have operations for such things. \n It is very hard to discuss such things in an anti-religious manner when one's beliefs play an important role in how the body and mind works, and why. For that you will just have to bear with me. \n\n I'm sorry. I'm confused. You seem to be agreeing that one should not draw parallels between man and animals. If you believe that, then there is no logical reason to mention anything about animals. There is no reason to explain it away from animals, unless man and animals are somehow related. Suppose I'm going to explain how to put gas in a car at a filling station. First off, I'm going to tell you that \"Brian is a nice name for a boy\". Then I'm going explain away from \"Brian is a nice name for a boy\" towards \"how there are these pumps at the filling station\". Wouldn't you find that odd? Well, I find it quite odd indeed that you would mention one word about animals, since (according to you) man is not an animal. I mean be serious: How would you feel if I started my all of my explanations with spurious statements like \"Brian is a nice name for a boy\"? You would think I was a lunatic, but that is exactly what you are doing (unless you changed positions on something). \n \n \n I choose to believe that we are a separate species. \n\n I'm confused. Are you now saying that man is an animal, but just a distinct species? \n \n \n You are of that opinion and nothing I can say will change that. But, you have to understand that just because we live in the same environment as animals and have some of the same basic needs, it does not mean that we are animals. It is, here, a matter of belief on my part and on your part a matter of accepted science. If it were put to a vote - you would win in a landslide. This is also something you will have to bear with me on, if you wish to continue. \n\n This issue here was not whether man is an animal, but whether there is any reason to believe that homosexuality is caused in any part whatever by a shortage of food. Such a claim is baseless. I thought you were agreeing that that claim [was] baseless.\n \n \n A weak analogy, maybe. Perhaps too simple. But, this is where the spirit of man triumphs over animals or any other creature. We have the power, due to our inner-man, our spirit and soul, to overcome our desires. Some may disparage the idea, attempting to explain observable reality while holding to the idea that God is Lord. Religion has crapped in its nest long enough to turn-up noses to that endeavor. But, I will continue to search for reasons why so many are suffering with existence due to the way they were born. And this is my quest. If I learn something or you or someone else can show just cause that the path I am on is in vain, then I appreciate it. \n\n The story of the wild children is telling. Environment plays an immense part in our behavior, to the extent that we will scamper about on all fours as dogs do. If environment can overcome bipedalism, then how much easier to is it for environment to impact sexual attitudes?\n On the genetic side, there is great pressure against \"homosexuality\", however there is considerably less little against homosexual activity. Pedantry and other variants were norms in ancient cultures. In these cases, an aversion to homosexual activity may actually have been pressured against. It is may very well be best (Darwinistically) to be somewhat flexible sexually, just as it is to be flexible as to bipedalism. You may also care to investigate bonobo.\n \n \n I am not here to show my intelligence, which is evident, but to learn. If I can't speak my mind and spread my ideas onto the table, then I have no business here. By the same token, you shouldn't discourage that effort by picking apart my belief. \n\n Don't blame the messenger on the score that your beliefs are vulnerable to being picked apart. Adopt different beliefs. Face it-- and this is what you're statement implies-you'd rather have illogical beliefs than logical ones. That's fine, but don't then ask for the cherry on top.\n \n \n That is the problem we face. All too often we accept that we are trapped into being how our environment has formed us. We grow weak, discouraged and finally succumb to it. Our mannerisms are dictated by our surroundings, but our minds will only be blocked when we choose to give up. If we so choose, or desire, to break away from it, then we become self-sufficient, and thus, capable of forming a new life. We are essentially a different person. \n\n How is the choice to give up or not made? On what basis? Is it genetic? I simply do not see a viable mechanism for the choice. If we can be convinced that walking on all fours is the correct thing to do, how is it that we cannot be convinced to give up? How is that we cannot be under the illusion that we think we have an autonomous choice that we do not in fact have? You feel that we have a choice. How can your certainty in that be greater than a wild child's certainty that walking on all fours is the correct behavior?\n \n\n This was in reference to genetics motivating a species to change, instead of environmental pressures triggering the requirement to mutate genes. \n\n Environmental pressures don't trigger the requirement to mutate genes. Genes are being mutated continually. Some mutations are beneficial, most not.",

   "That is not quantification. The reason for wanting quantification is to have something to measure. If what you have in mind can't be measured very well, then it is probably difficult to test any kind of theory regarding it.\n\n To what degree of measurement is required for a study? It would seem that if there were enough cases to warrant a medical term that quantifiable elements had been processed.\n \nWhen you started into this notion, it appeared that you were attempting to address homosexuality as a whole. (Actually, it still appears that way.) Therefore you don't need a few hundred \"cases\", but hundreds of millions of \"cases\". Okay, I have a theory: Everybody that dies, does so on Mt. Everest. There are dozens of cases of documented cases of deaths on Mt. Everest. Mallory and his partner died on Mt. Everest. The name of the particular condition is called hypothermia. The evidence is irrefutable. My theory is just as good as yours; in fact better. At least I can measure whether somebody was on Mt. Everest.\n\n Yes, I see your point. Maybe someone else can address my problem. Then again, I suppose one would need to see my point in order to do so.\n My premise is not difficult for me to grasp, but the way I go about presenting may be. I'll step back and take another look at it.\n \nIf you still believe that desires are inborn, then they are determined genetically. If they are determined genetically, then homosexuality is 100% determined by genetics. Studies show that homosexuality cannot possibly be 100% genetic, as there are identical twins that have differing orientations. Therefore there is something wrong with your premises.\n \n I do not believe that genes have total control of desires. I do, however, feel that genetic makeup has everything to do with preliminary cravings, but that those cravings can be controlled. This premise also is in need of review on my part. I'll go back to the drawing board.\n \nThe question was: What does it mean for nature to take its course?\n\n Initially I stated that \"it stands to reason\" and I put nature in parenthesis. That was the crux of my post, i.e.: \"With that in mind, and knowing that some males are born with feminine traits and some females are born with male [masculine] traits, it stands to reason that \"nature\" has taken its course, developing behavior in opposition to the norm.\"\n If it is natural, then I agree that is must be driven by genetic composition. This does not prove to me that genetics has anything to do with sexual orientation. This is another tiger I have by the tail - and there are several tigers. I'll try to rewrite the gist of my premise when I have it in a more understandable format.\n \nDo a search on \"twin study\" or \"twin studies\" and \"homosexual\". That should convince you that genetics is not deterministic in orientation.\n\n This is exactly why I don't think I'm getting my point across. \n \n Btw- I am already convinced of that.\n \nI'm sorry. I'm confused. You seem to be agreeing that one should not draw parallels between man and animals. If you believe that, then there is no logical reason to mention anything about animals. \n I'm confused. Are you now saying that man is an animal, but just a distinct species?\n\n You are correct. That will be considered also. It was my intention to take it away from accepted thought.\n \n Just a personal assertion here - an intentional digression if you will allow it: It is widely accepted that belief in God fences one in, but there seems to be much more imprisonment encountered within the limits of science at times. This is one area where I believe all avenues should be open for review until there remains nothing else to study. \n \nThis issue here was not whether man is an animal, but whether there is any reason to believe that homosexuality is caused in any part whatever by a shortage of food.

If it were not for that particular study I think we would still be struggling with the idea that \"humans born will humans be\". Very telling indeed.\n And, fwiw, I am in agreement with you about the genetics-against-homosexuality principle. \n \nYou may also care to investigate bonobo.\n\n Very interesting. Thanks.\n \nDon't blame the messenger on the score that your beliefs are vulnerable to being picked apart. Adopt different beliefs. Face it-- and this is what you're statement implies-you'd rather have illogical beliefs than logical ones. That's fine, but don't then ask for the cherry on top.\n\n Touch\u00e9. Frankly, I had no illusions of grandeur...I've been here before and had more negative repercussions than positive. I should be used to it by now.\n \nHow is the choice to give up or not made? On what basis? Is it genetic? I simply do not see a viable mechanism for the choice.

How can your certainty in that be greater than a wild child's certainty that walking on all fours is the correct behavior?\n\n That's the problem, basically. Some (I am leaning more towards \"most\") people don't see that viable mechanism for choice. And, utilizing the wild-child scenario, sometimes we aren't given enough of the proper stimulus and/or excessive doses of erroneous stimuli. This too falls back to my belief system...not that it's \"right\" or \"wrong\" or \" proper\", or \"righteous\", but that is unfortunately dismissed as fable or myth.\n My next endeavor at such a debate will need to be prepared differently, I suppose.\n \nEnvironmental pressures don't trigger the requirement to mutate genes. Genes are being mutated continually. Some mutations are beneficial, most not.\n\n I understand and realize that. But selection is what we were discussing initially, correct? If that's the case, does my principal still apply or no?\n \n Thank you for you patience and time, toby. I've enjoyed the debate and can actually say I've learned something...if just about my tactics when met with serious scrutiny. I am in dire need of dexterity in some places where my beliefs collide with conventional thought.\n I will gather my thoughts and principals; review my beliefs and categorize my research so that I can place in proper format all that I have for the next argument.

   "To what degree of measurement is required for a study? It would seem that if there were enough cases to warrant a medical term that quantifiable elements had been processed. \n\n I doubt that quantifiable elements have been processed. I imagine that classification has been on an ad hoc basis. Certainly, I doubt that there is a total score. It isn't a thing like blood pressure. One can still attempt to do an association study. The issue is that any conclusion is highly suspect. Another researcher can do another study and come up with a completely different conclusion (due to the variances in ad hoc inclusion or exclusion methods). The scientific method demands repeatability. \n \n \nYes, I see your point. Maybe someone else can address my problem. Then again, I suppose one would need to see my point in order to do so.\n My premise is not difficult for me to grasp, but the way I go about presenting may be.

I do, however, feel that genetic makeup has everything to do with preliminary cravings, but that those cravings can be controlled. This premise also is in need of review on my part. I'll go back to the drawing board. \n\n Okay. How exactly are cravings controlled? Is the controlling agent autonomous from both genetics and the environment? The issue is still: What is the mechanism? You seem to want to preserve this magical agent of yours.\n \n \nInitially I stated that \"it stands to reason\" and I put nature in parenthesis. That was the crux of my post, i.e.: \"With that in mind, and knowing that some males are born with feminine traits and some females are born with male [masculine] traits, it stands to reason that \"nature\" has taken its course, developing behavior in opposition to the norm.\" \n\n I maintain that this \"explanation\" explains very little as to the orientation of hundreds of millions of homosexuals. You need a theory to fit all the data, not a few hundred \"cases\". It is still like my theory that all people die on Mt. Everest.\n \n \nIf it is natural, then I agree that is must be driven by genetic composition. \n\n That is not my position. If I look into the sky and see the sun, is my vision of the sun unnatural? Surely you cannot claim that my vision of the sun is genetic, since it is dependent (presumably) on the environment (the sun itself floating in the sky). Seemingly what one experiences is not genetic. If one identical twin has a vision of the sun, does the other twin also experience the sun, even if locked in a closet at the time?\n \n \nThis does not prove to me that genetics has anything to do with sexual orientation. This is another tiger I have by the tail - and there are several tigers. I'll try to rewrite the gist of my premise when I have it in a more understandable format. \n\n Studies suggest that genetics do play a role in orientation, however I doubt to some extent the conclusions being made. \n \n \nThis is exactly why I don't think I'm getting my point across. \n \n Btw- I am already convinced of that. \n\n Okay.\n \n \nYou are correct.

This is one area where I believe all avenues should be open for review until there remains nothing else to study. \n\n I'm unsure how to \"review\" something relating to god. \n \n \nI did agree, that at this point, it is baseless, but I can't rule it out. Can you? Can anyone? \n\n No, I can't rule it out. Here's another theory though: If you stab yourself in the eye repeatedly with a darning needle, eventually a bear on roller skates will appear and give you one trillion dollars. Can you rule it out? The issue is that there is a cost and a benefit to exploring various theories. My theory can't be ruled out, but it doesn't look promising. [Perhaps you are aware of how computer chess playing programs \"prune\" unpromising moves. An unpromising move may actually turn out be the best move, but there are only so many computing resources, and it's impossible to consider every move out to the end of the game.] That is the situation with the population control theory. It doesn't make enough sense for me to take very seriously. If you want to pursue it, be my guest. (I've already offered a much more plausible theory.)\n \n \nIt is (wild child) telling and almost unbelievable. If it were not for that particular study I think we would still be struggling with the idea that \"humans born will humans be\". Very telling indeed.\n And, fwiw, I am in agreement with you about the genetics-against-homosexuality principle. \n\n Good.\n \n \nVery interesting. Thanks. \n\n You're welcome.\n \nTouch\u00e9. Frankly, I had no illusions of grandeur...I've been here before and had more negative repercussions than positive. I should be used to it by now. \n\n Your beliefs won't be an issue if you don't bring them in. Absolutely only make categorical statements that you want to defend. \n \n \nThat's the problem, basically. Some (I am leaning more towards \"most\") people don't see that viable mechanism for choice. And, utilizing the wild-child scenario, sometimes we aren't given enough of the proper stimulus and/or excessive doses of erroneous stimuli. This too falls back to my belief system...not that it's \"right\" or \"wrong\" or \" proper\", or \"righteous\", but that is unfortunately dismissed as fable or myth.\n My next endeavor at such a debate will need to be prepared differently, I suppose. \n\n The wild child believes what it believes; you believe what you believe. That places all beliefs on very shaky ground. It is not logically satisfactory to merely believe. \n \n \nI understand and realize that. But selection is what we were discussing initially, correct? If that's the case, does my principal still apply or no? \n\n I'm sorry: I'm unsure what principle you are referring to.\n \n \nThank you for you patience and time, toby. I've enjoyed the debate and can actually say I've learned something...if just about my tactics when met with serious scrutiny. I am in dire need of dexterity in some places where my beliefs collide with conventional thought. \n\n You're welcome. I think it is not the best approach to bring any special beliefs into a debate. Those will only hang you up. Keep it simple.\n \n \nI will gather my thoughts and principals; review my beliefs and categorize my research so that I can place in proper format all that I have for the next argument. I feel that a new thread is in order since it may take quite some time to accomplish it. \n\n Okay. Have fun.",
