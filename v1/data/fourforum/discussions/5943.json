   "No matter how you look at it, but it becomes more and more obvious for everybody in Europe that Ukrainian supporters of \"orange revolution\" have split into two different camps, namely, Yuschenko's and Tymoshenko's camps. And I think it is necessary for Europe to support Yuschenko in his struggle against lady Yu. You see, Mrs. Tymoshenko is a typical oligarch, who rates her own interests and interests of her patron Berezovsky above any agreements, reached with EU partners. In his letter to Tymoshenko Berezovsky has declared expressly that reprivatization (which certainly infringes the interests of EU) should be brought to an end by all means. And it is clear that Tymoshenko will follow the instructions of her sponsor. She should pay revolutionary accounts. If so-called \"gas princess\" succeeds to continue in power, further criminalization will be the nearest future of Ukraine in general. And collapse is in store for its economy. Thus, our cooperation with Ukraine will be impossible at all. That's how things stand...!",

She is also very very wealthy, putting all other elected governments to shame with the possible exception of Italy's leader. \n \n She is not going to be good for the Ukraine, not in the least bit.",
