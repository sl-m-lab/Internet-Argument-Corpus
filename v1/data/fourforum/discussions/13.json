Or maybe the carnivorus dinosaurs didn't like the taste of hair. Of course, they probibly could have learned how to hide.\n But if the theory of the asteroid or commit or what ever it was hitting the earth was true. Humans would have died out also. Are they sure that the prints were that of a human and not some really ancient ape? Oh well, I don't know, but I thought it looked cool. emoticon_cool",

   "There are some that have been modified (as an intention to fraud), at least according to Talkorigins.\nThose tracks are no longer in the river. There were some indentations in the limestone that were not tracks, as well as probable dinosaur tracks, that were cut from the river bed, carved by locals to look like human prints, and sold to tourists. It seems like those locals who did the carving weren't too careful about which side was up. One famous print (Baugh displays a picture) was carved on the bottom side of the slab.\n \n If you are actually interested in the topic, you should read Glen Kuban's pages, The Paluxy Dinosaur/\"Man Track\" Controversy.\n \n Other \"modified\" tracks are one that was damaged in place by someone obviously chipping at it with something. Another was damaged by Mr. Carl Baugh, who in a amateur attempt to get a cast, poured plaster of paris into it. Plaster of paris is, essentially, limestone and is quite hard. Baugh never explained how he thought he was going to get the cast out of the limestone river bed. Wouldn't an experienced paleontologist have used some other casting media expressly made for the purpose? Just an example of the quality of his work.\n \n By the way, the tracks (there are three kinds) were probably made by a Pleurocoelus (a sauropod), an Acrocanthosaurus (a theropid), and an Iguanodon (an ornithopod). Fossils of these have been found in strata of similar age close by Glen Rose.\n \n It's also fun to visit the river and see the tracks. I've got some nice pictures.",
