   "NEW ORLEANS -- Mayor C. Ray Nagin said yesterday that New Orleans will lay off 40 percent of its workers and warned of more belt-tightening ahead, a bleak reminder of the challenges the city faces as it recovers from two hurricanes.\n \n The elimination of 3,000 jobs, which Nagin described as ''pretty permanent,\" is expected to save the hard-hit city $5 million to $8 million a month. New Orleans now pays about $20 million a month in salaries for city workers, Nagin said.\n\n \n http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/10/05/hard_hit_new_orlea\n ns_will_lay_off_3000_workers/\n \n \n Now, just like in the game Six Degress of Kevin Bacon tell us how this is George W. Bush's fault. Hint: Dick Cheney's cyborg heart is fueled by the souls of dead babies.\n \n \n Josef Said\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism",

Either way, a huge sum of money leaves the US Treasury and goes to the giant company. The American companies are not manipulated by the government except by law whereas many foriegn companies are owned and operated by their respective governments.

Some of them where in New Orleans just a week after the huricane hit (or perhaps even sooner!). The bidding process is very quick in these kind of circumstances and many companies allready have tenders drafted for these kind of things. Some of the domestic companies that where hired also lacked written contracts and some lacked ending dates and price specifications. Among those companies where several with political ties...\n \n However, US legislation and regulation give local and regional (US) companies advantages in these kind of situations. No doubt based on populistic ideas. In the end, those who pay are the US tax-payers, but that equation is much harder for people to grasp than \"buy american, be a real america\" idea that seems to be common these days.\n \n Oh, and the foreign companies that where hired where specialist companies that had to be hired from abroad since there where no US companies with enough/the right competence to carry it out.",
