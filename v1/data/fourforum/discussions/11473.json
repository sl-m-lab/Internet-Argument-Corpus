Few states allow defense of property, so I would guess little of that number is property defense. I believe that number is any way a gun deters or prevents a violent crime, however property crime may be bundled in there. I don't think so though, because I picked the lowest number I could find on the internet. A lot of sites claim the number is as high as 2.5 million, however I'm sure that includes property damage. That's why I used the 1.7mil figure because it likely does not include much property crime defense.\n \n And lets say you're right, worst case scenario. That number includes 700,000 defense of property uses. That's still a 1:10 ratio.",

Much of American culture pertains to sex and violence.\n \n It is obvious to see that it is not gun control because states with strict gun control are notorious for crime (California, New York). While states with less gun control (Vermont, North Carolina) are much safer.\n \n On top of that, you still have not refuted any of my statistics.\n \n \n \n\"During the same period an estimated annual average of 62,000\n violent crime victims (approximately 1 percent of all violent\n crime victims) used a firearm in an effort to defend\n themselves. In addition, an annual average of about 20,000\n victims of theft, household burglary or motor vehicle theft\n attempted to defend their property with guns.\n\n \n \"Household burglary\" is lumped in with theft? When a burglar breaks into your house, it is perfectly OK to shoot him/her. You must assume that they are hostile in order to keep you and your family safe.

Is that your statement?\n \n No weapon is nearly as effective as a gun. At ultra close range, a samuri sword might win over a gun, but that's about it. Nobody should be forced, especially by the government, to take the risk of not having a gun. The only weapon that comes close in general is the air taser. But, with the air taser you only get one shot. When your life is in danger from an attacker, you tend to not shoot as well. Do you want to take that risk? If you do, fine.

Your data has been replied to by some more data which states the opposite - in fact, this survey is one of four that I have regularly used over the last few months I've spent here, all of which have similar conclusions.\n \n And your response to such data? \"I don't like what it says, so I'm going to ignore it out of hand\".\n \n Seriously. Do you want to actually debate, or are you just going to ignore things that disagree with you on the basis that they disagree with you? If that's the case, what use is there in replying to any thread you make?\n \n I'm sorry that this reply is a bit over the top. However, I'm fairly sick of seeing data ignored for entirely spurious reasons - now from all three pro-gunners (Ethmi, Omegamon, SnP). As to your original data from the OP, I'll get to it when I have the time (apologies, South Africa, etc...)",

   "gun nuts idea about self defense is pretty warped. This one gun nut threatened me with her rifle just cause I was taking pictures. disturbing that scaring nonviolent people like me is what the gun nuts call self defense.\n _____________\n Gun nuts may not pull the trigger but they are just as guilty because they support the laws that result in more people getting shot.\n \n Time to kick gun nut butt!\n\n \n Been away for a while (and seeing I've not missed much). But this post above by Brady caught my eye and I can't help but respond to it... \n \n Brady, assuming that you were doing nothing worthy of being \"threatened with a rifle,\" then what this woman did to you was a crime! \n \n We call it brandishing a firearm (\"It shall be unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another....\"). In Virginia this offense is punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.00 (and is grounds for immediate revocation of a CCW permit). \n \n Every state has a brandishing law. \n \n However, legitimate self defense is a bar to conviction of this crime. I mention this because you claim in your post that you believe the person who did this to you was acting in the name of some \"warped\" idea of self-defense. \n \n Now in my experience if the self-defense claim was legitimate then no one ever complains to law enforcement about it. For example, you never see anyone go to the police and say: \"look, I was trying to break into this girl's house and she pulled a gun on me and threatened me. Please go charge her for threatening my life with a gun.\" \n \n And, incidentally, even people who are committing a crime and actually get shot, wounded, flee the scene, and show up later at a hospital for treatment never report it truthfully. A man who, for example, gets shot but is able to run away while breaking into a house will ultimately end up at the hospital, which will in turn report all gunshot wounds to law enforcement. But when interviewed by responding law enforcement the story always seems to boil down to some version of this: \"look, I was just walking down the street when these guys drove by me on a white car and shot me for no reason.\" (Such are the facts upon which statistics for and against defensive firearm use are founded) \n \n So my questions to you, Brady, are this:\n \n What, if anything, did you do to test this \"warped\" idea of self defense? \n \n Were you proud enough of your actions to report them to the police? \n \n Did you follow your own advice in your tag line: \"time to kick gun nut butt!\" and seek to have this person prosecuted for this crime against you, Brady (or is this yet another example of very big talk with no action)? \n \n If reported, then was this alleged crime prosecuted? \n \n If prosecuted, then was the person convicted or not?\n \n Or isn't this entire scenario just another deliberate lie from you?\n \n ---\n \n \"Do not veil the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly.\" The Koran, 2:42",

Ethmi is trying to imply that I only obey the laws that I agree with. I'm saying that I only approve of the laws I agree with, which is entirely different.\n \n \nsonally, no US state to me has too little limits, because the states with little gun limits boast the best crime rates.

   "How did you come up with this one?\n\n \n You're saying that the Constitution should be changed and updated to meet the times in any manner that the government believes would be in their best interest, or even repealed outright and entirely. How exactly am I supposed to view you, what kind of conclusion am I supposed to reach when you have ideas like this and go spouting them off?\n \n \nAnd, like it or not, your government has more power over you than you claim. Again, see Gitmo and Patriot.\n\n \n All the more reason to resist whatever change they wish, to make it all the more difficult for them to get anymore power than they have now.\n \n \nSo you don't have any logical arguments for your position then? It would probably have taken you less time to type them than to make excuses for not having to show them, by now...\n\n \n Well how exactly do we go about this? Your position is that one of the rights that was recognized by our founding document should only be exercised for a recognized sport or if it's needed for work, but absolutely nothing else. Your position is that \"self defense\" is NOT a valid reason for owning a gun, but your position as to why is highly questionable.\n \n You don't like the fact that as Americans we're not obligated to constantly justify every single thing we do, that anytime we wish to exercise a right we don't have to seek permission from the government to do so. You think people abuse that freedom and would like to see it done away with. Yet you haven't proven that your supported position, the notion of getting a \"Permit to exercise a constitutional right\" is the better way of doing things.\n \n I've seen the way British people have to go about getting a gun. Gotta get permission from the police, gotta provide a justified reason for your ownership, gotta supply letters of reference from numerous friends and any previous marriages to make sure that you're of \"good character\" and not a danger to anybody, gotta ensure that you're the only person in existence that'll ever know where the keys to your gun safe will be, etc. I haven't seen any evidence to prove that your way is the better way, it's nothing more than a constant reminder that you're without rights and it won't be long before you can't even cross the street without the government signing your permission slip first.\n \n \nThen I'll tell you. 'Telling people who they can or cannot marry' is alive and well in today's America. Well, chunks of it.\n\n \n When it gets to the point where a person is told that they can't marry based on hair color, eye color, weight, skin color, state of origin, etc. then I'll worry, and then you'll have a point. Until then it's no skin off my nose. I support restrictions on age and species of the individuals involved.\n \n \nMy response was that to refuse to change on the basis that you can't be bothered is a fantastically weak excuse.\n\n \n And if there's no justifiable reason to warrant change, then what's the point of change? Changing something just for the sake of change is absolutely stupid, change shouldn't happen unless there's a good reason for it.\n \n \nThat would be a fine argument... if I was arguing that modern Americans should disobey the law and enforce their own gun bans. However, I'm arguing instead that the law/constitution should be repealed and no longer apply. So stating that it is currently active, and has been for some time, does nothing against me.\n\n \n And you're wondering why I consider you a freedom hating bastard. Well it's because of statements like this!

   "If it does, then using your own logic against you, I could say that they could just go outside of the US, get a gun, and return.\n\n You try personally moving a gun into the US and you will see the preposterousness of your argument.\n \n \nDon't you understand that I'm calling your argument a strawman? You don't, do you? I didn't say we shouldn't have laws, I just said they are not 100% effective. You would need to be pretty desperate to imply that we're against law.\n\n In which case your original argument is also a strawman. I've never said that laws are 100% effective - just that reducing the amount of criminal incidences can only be a good thing.\n \n \nYou're saying that the Constitution should be changed and updated to meet the times in any manner that the government believes would be in their best interest, or even repealed outright and entirely. How exactly am I supposed to view you, what kind of conclusion am I supposed to reach when you have ideas like this and go spouting them off?\nSince when did I say that I supported the idea of the government changing laws to suit itself? I support the idea of laws changing to suit a populace - and trust the democratic process to ensure that a government changes the laws in such a way, or face being voted out at end-of-term.\n \n \nAll the more reason to resist whatever change they wish, to make it all the more difficult for them to get anymore power than they have now.\n\n And yet I'm still waiting for the armed uprising...\n Your rights are being eroded. While you claim that gun ownership will prevent this, it is clear that this is not the case.\n \n \nWell how exactly do we go about this? Your position is that one of the rights that was recognized by our founding document should only be exercised for a recognized sport or if it's needed for work, but absolutely nothing else. Your position is that \"self defense\" is NOT a valid reason for owning a gun, but your position as to why is highly questionable.\nMy position is that the massive increace in weapon availability due to the massive increace in demand for guns from adament 'gun self-defenders' also directly increaces the amount of criminal gun use, in all likelyhood outweighing gun self-defence.\n I guess your response will be to parade your source again - in which case I suggest you go and respond in the other relevant thread, where I'm waiting for a reply on several fronts.\n \n \nYou don't like the fact that as Americans we're not obligated to constantly justify every single thing we do, that anytime we wish to exercise a right we don't have to seek permission from the government to do so. You think people abuse that freedom and would like to see it done away with. Yet you haven't proven that your supported position, the notion of getting a \"Permit to exercise a constitutional right\" is the better way of doing things.\nFirstly, I've said before that 'excercise a right' is not a valid argument against someone who doesn't recognise absolute rights. Secondly, I have to seek permission for very little I do - most of it that would put me in the position to harm others (guns, cars). Finally, if you cannot justify what you do then, by definition, you have no valid reason for doing it. Where does that leave you?\n \n \nI've seen the way British people have to go about getting a gun. Gotta get permission from the police, gotta provide a justified reason for your ownership, gotta supply letters of reference from numerous friends and any previous marriages to make sure that you're of \"good character\" and not a danger to anybody, gotta ensure that you're the only person in existence that'll ever know where the keys to your gun safe will be, etc. I haven't seen any evidence to prove that your way is the better way, it's nothing more than a constant reminder that you're without rights and it won't be long before you can't even cross the street without the government signing your permission slip first.\nHow about one of the only possible relevant comparisons - that of homicides and non-lethal shootings in the UK/US? We beat you on that one...\n \n \nWhen it gets to the point where a person is told that they can't marry based on hair color, eye color, weight, skin color, state of origin, etc. then I'll worry, and then you'll have a point. Until then it's no skin off my nose. I support restrictions on age and species of the individuals involved.\nHow about gender? That is the point of the term 'gay rights' with respect to marriages...\n \n \nAnd if there's no justifiable reason to warrant change, then what's the point of change? Changing something just for the sake of change is absolutely stupid, change shouldn't happen unless there's a good reason for it.\n\n You are quite happy with the current US murder rate? I suppose it's your risk, but personally I'd welcome something that might make me safer, especially if the only argument against it is 'it won't change anything anyway...'\n \n \nAnd you're wondering why I consider you a freedom hating bastard. Well it's because of statements like this! The Constitution is there to restrict the powers of the government, by arguing that it should be repealed you're voicing your support for an omnipotent government that has the power to regulate every possible facet of your life and kill you at any time in the name of serving it's best interests.\nThe UK has no constitution. Personally, I'm entirely free of the thought police...\n \n Don't you see that by locking your 'rights' in place you are making yourself less adaptable, less open to change, and (potentially) less 'free'? If (for some hypothetical reason) all guns on sale were immediately stolen/bought by criminals, would you still support the sale of guns, knowing that you were just arming the criminal underworld? That's the extreme version of today's state of affairs in the US...\n \n \nThat you know of.\n\n Please don't try to project your paranoia onto me. You're just showing your argument up as tautological.\n \n With regard to ASBOs... see GazzaElliot. Yes, they were misused at first. Most laws are - and the media tends to put a negative spin on it all. However, the public and the democratic process tends to win through, as in this case.\n \n \nAnd I'm still waiting for me to prove that the UK is more free than the US. Haven't seen any evidence yet.\n\n Gitmo and Patriot weren't enough?",

   "Based on recent news articles it seems that the handgun ban has done very little to put off the bad guys.\n\n \n Well I know that gun crime is rare in the UK. I know that we haven't had a school massacre since Dunblaine. I know that guns are not circulating on my street or in my neighbourhood. The question is whether this is due to the ban, or due to the British way of life. I think it's a mixture of both.\n \n \nYour papers are making the situation sound like every criminal in the UK is still packin' a gun and treating them like status symbols that get whipped out at the drop of a hat, and the age of offenders is getting progressively lower.\n\n \n That's why they're tabloids. Sadly our press is very sensational at the moment, and thier convinced that British society is disintergrating. It's absolute twaddle, and we're carrying on as we always have. There's a surge in knife crime at the moment (which has also been over-reported), but national gun crime is low. That's why it's blown out of proportion when it happens. When it's the norm, it's not sensationalized.\n \n \nYou people in the UK, unlike in America, claim that you don't have a gun culture.\n\n \n We don't in the way you do...\n \n \nYou can blame our problems with criminals on our gun culture, but you can't say the same thing for yourselves.\n\n \n No we can't.

The papers have been talking about the collapse and criminalization of British society for the last 15 years, but it hasn't happened yet. Bearing in mind how rare gun crime is over the UK, I don't think it's gone wrong, and it definately hasn't been disproven. You seem to like arguing as if the UK and US have the same rates of crime. We don't. Our rates are tiny compared to yours, and you have yet to explain that.\n \n \nI've seen no deterrence yet.

Oh, and before you ask for a source - it's common knowledge, I don't need one. \n \n You may now address my point that you have been evading.\n\n Well, I doubt very much that either of us can find figures on gun movement within the USA, although your favourite example of high gun crime in DC shows that it happens a fairly huge amount.\n But in fact, the likelyhood (or, to be more accurate, the ease with which it can be done) is the main relevance, because gun laws in the US really don't vary all that much (DC aside) so at the moment there isn't that much point in leaving a state specificaly to buy a gun. \n \n Your original argument was that leaving the USA to buy a gun and smuggle it back in is comparable to leaving your state to buy a gun and then smuggle it back in. I'm trying to point out that this is not the case - I freely acknowledge that both occur, but state-to-state movement is easier by far than non-USA-to-USA movement. Some story about border guards (which, incidentally, I have never heard of before) is entirely irrelevant to your argument, because I have never denied that arms smuggling exists, just as I have never denied that a black market for firearms will persist despite stronger firearms control. The fact remains that differences in US state laws are (potentially) far more diminished by gun smuggling than differences in countries' laws.\n \n \nAnd finally, compare these.\n \n \n \n Hence bringing a gun into the UK is a lot harder than brining a gun from one US state to the other. \n \n You try personally bringing a gun into the US and you'll see the preposterousness of your argument. \n\n \n Ian, you have inspired me. To go that extra mile, to push myself to the limit, and to reach the goal posts no matter where you move them. \n \n Seriously, of all the holes in your arguments, this one is the abyss. \n\n Ooops, typo. Sorry, my bad. I imagine that it is equally as hard to smuggle a gun into the US as the UK however, although don't let that dissuade you in your search for tiny holes in my argument. If a typo that didn't really change the point of the argument was 'the abyss', I'm quite proud of myself.\n \n \nWhy is that a straw man iangb? Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there? If your answer is no, then it's obvious his argument isn't a straw man because criminals still acquire guns even when they're banned. So the only people banning guns prevents from having them are honest people.\n\n OK. I'll bold the relevant part of the straw man for you, as you seem to be missing it out.\n \n \"gun laws won't stop all gun crime\"\n \n Did you spot it that time? I have never claimed that laws prevent all crime. I have, instead (and repeatedly) said that prohibition of an item reduces availibility of an item. In this case, gun control reduces availibility of guns, which reduces gun crime. The right argument to persue from this is to discuss gun defence vs gun crime, but we seem to have ground to a statistics-related halt on that one.\n \n Oh, and Ethmi? This:\n \nYawn... Why don't you actually stop trying to blow smoke, and answer some of Ian's points? Like:\n \n \n \n \n \n for example.... \n\n \n \n I answered those, in case you haven't noticed. \n\n is an entire lie. You didn't answer either of my points. To reiterate them: \n 1. The US murder rate is high - higher than most if not all of the other 'first world' countries. To discard a possible aid to reducing this murder rate on the basis that 'it probably won't change anything anyway' is lazy, if not incompetant.\n 2. A repeated pro-gun argument is that 'guns will prevent me from losing my rights'. However, many of your rights are being eroded as I type by instances such as Gitmo and the Patriot act. Clearly your guns have done nothing to stop this.",
