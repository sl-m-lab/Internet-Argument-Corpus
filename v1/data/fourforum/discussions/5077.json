   "It seems as if it is the most difficult thing in the world to do.\n \n I started this thread to compare stories and also to get a bit of advice.\n \n I live in Boston, but am forced to commute via T to the suburbs to work (bad economy). Since the bus I take runs once every 30 minutes, I pretty much see the same people on it every day. There is this gentleman that I see almost very day during this commute who just sends my senses rioting. I just find him appealing in every way. He's definitely not the most attractive person I have ever seen, but there is something about him that just makes me weak in the knees whenever he looks in my direction.\n \n Anyhow, I was just content on having a secret crush on him, but unforseen events have forced conversation to occur between us (just idle chitchat about bus schedules and the like). God, he has the mostwonderfully blue eyes, and it sucks that I cannot quite guage his sexual orientation (My gaydar only works when I am not interested in a person). I was unable to talk to really talk to him much due to other casual conversations that occur between me and other passengers (I am just an approachable guy) ...\n \n Until today ...\n \n The conversation was pretty casual and nonsensical, but it just makes me want to ask him out even more. And I don't even know his name!!! :xbanghead \n \n UGH!!! What do I do????",

And since we do not live in a totally accepting world (even in Massachusetts), I am always on my guard for the next bigot.\n \n Last night I saw the Phantom of the Opera, and waiting for the T to go home, some homophobic whino decided to call my friends and I maricons.

And I'm not referring to those crass gentlemen (and some women) with those tired come on lines that you hear about.

He didn't want to take me home to my third floor apartment, so he took me to his place and put me on his sofa, I do remember waking up in the middle of the night and he was sleeping on the floor in front of the sofa. I ask him about that later, he said he didn't want me to wake up in a strange place and be alone. The good part of this story is that I never left that apartment. I stayed with him, we talked, got to know each other. He helped me tie my shoes because I couldn't. I finally left that apartment about a year and half later when we bought a house together. I am sitting in that house know, he is here too! It will be 5 years of this on the 25th of this month. \n \n If you ask me what is stronger love or hate......I will tell you love.....it shines though hate when you least expect it!

Are we catching on here or do I still need to get it through that large thick nothing-in-it skull of yours?!!!!\n\n \n The claim that we are not \"meant\" to be attracted to members of the same sex implies that some intelligent being \"meant\" us to be attracted to something specific. This claim thus implies that there is a God, and it is thus an argument based on religious belief, not on equal treatment of all religions.\n \n Yet we are forced to admit that even if there is a creator, that creator has given same-sex couples perfectly safe ways to engage in sex with one another, and he has made it possible for us to be attracted to one another, and it then logically follows that even if there is a creator, we are indeed meant to attracted to members of either sex, looking only at anatomy.\n \n Your argument stating that the race would not go on if everyone engaged in a same-sex relationship is invalid. Certainly same-sex couples have as great a desire for children as opposite-sex couples, and they could certainly live in a society where the norm is to have sex outside of your relationship, but only to have children. With today's technology, articifical insemination is also possible. Such a society would suffer only from far less unwanted pregnancies.\n \n Stretching this to fit our current society, these things are still possible, and adoption is another method for same-sex couples to raise children. Although same-sex couples may not be able to have children by engaging in sex with each other, a same-sex couple is as able to have and raise children as any other couple in existence. I must therefore question the reasoning and logic which has led you to your claims that they cannot.\n \n As an additional note, I should mention that in a society where so many children are abandoned and left for adoption, a family's ability to give birth to new children does not measure the worth of that family in any way, shape, nor form. It is the love, kindness, and support provided by the members of that family which judge its worth.",

I just don't see why we can't have accuracy in the way this is portrayed.\n\n \n And what we are telling you is that many crimes actually go unreported. I never reported any of the assaults that happened to me. I know many other people that haven't said a word (mainly due to the discomfort level with the police). And even if people aren't physically assaulted, we deal with verbal abuse constantly. People don't seem to be particularly shy when calling us names under their breath but just loud enough for us to hear. \n \n Try an experiment: go out with a friend (male or female, doesn't matter) in a public setting (coffee shop, dinner, whatever) and just talk about a date you had - not too loudly, but just a casual conversation - but replace \"she\" with \"he\" and \"her\" with \"him\". Nothing sexual. Just relate a dinner and movie experience, and end the evening with a walk and accompanying \"him\" to \"his\" door, kissing \"him\" goodnight, then driving home. \n \n Look around and observe the looks from the people sitting nearby and tell me what you notice.",

   "I wrote a grant to get victims of hate crimes self-defense classes as part of mental health recovery. This is an exert from the grant I wrote.....It of course it Rhode Island biased.\n \n \n Stigma is a societal reaction, which singles out certain attributes of an individual or group as undesirable and devaluing, often resulting in prejudice and discrimination (Goffman, 1963). The most heinous outcome of the stigma is violence, or the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against another person or against oneself or against a group of people, that results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, mal-development, or deprivation (Department of Health and Human Services, 2000). Sexual prejudice is still acceptable in many segments of American society, and while many diverse members of society experience violence, hate crimes targeting LGBT people remain the most socially acceptable and widespread form of assaults (American Psychological Association, 1998; Finn & McNeil, 1987; Garnets, Herek, & Levey, 1990; Franklin, 1997). \n \n Members of the LGBT community subject to prejudice and discrimination might feel particularly vulnerable to being a victim of violence because of their sexual minority status (Meyer, 1995). \n Many sexual minorities maintain a high degree of vigilance - expectations of prejudice, discrimination, and violence - consuming a considerable amount of emotional energy and a considerable psychological toll because individuals in such a position must constantly monitor their environment and their behavior (e.g., how one dresses, speaks, walks, and talks) to avoid being \"discovered\"(Meyer, 1995). Therefore, just the threat or perception of violence is significant. As Meyer (1995) pointed out, \"A seemingly minor event, such as a slur directed at a gay man, may evoke deep feelings of rejection and fears of violence disproportionate to the event that precipitated them.\" Often, the physical, emotional, or psychological injury resulting from being a victim of a physical offense is serious and can be life-long, since recovery from bias-based violence takes much longer than recovery from random violence (American Psychological Association, 1998). Survivors of hate crimes often view their sexuality as a source of danger, pain, and punishment, rather than the experience of love, intimacy, and community, and maintain a heightened sense of vulnerability (Herek, Gillis, & Cogan, 1999). \n \n The discrimination and antigay violence that accompanies the prejudice are stressors and subject to many mental health and maladaptive behavioral concerns for LGBT persons that can result in permanent mental and physical disabilities. The negative psychological process of coping with the incongruence between the dominant society's beliefs and practices and the minority person's culture, needs, and social structure affects the LGBT person's positive sense of self, often resulting in a sense of disempowerment (Herek, Gillis, & Cogan, 1999). Some sexual minorities may internalize the negative social attitudes and develop introverted coping mechanisms such as self-hate and internal group aggression, and extroverted coping mechanisms such as shyness, obsessive concern with the stigmatizing characteristic, and rebellion (Meyer, 1995). The psychological distress cause by prejudice and discrimination, including violence can also include physical damage to the body, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse disorder (Dean, et al., 2000; Safe Schools Coalition of Washington, 1999). Waldo, Hesson-McInnis, & D'Augelli (1998) reported that suicide (or thoughts about suicide) among LGBT persons experiencing prejudice and discrimination becomes more and more direct as the severity of the stigma increases, most notably victimization of a hate crime that resulted in physical abuse (i.e., being gay-bashed). \n \n Society is making progress in the legal protection of sexual minorities. However, there remain 18 states that have hate crimes laws that do not cover sexual orientation or gender identity, four states have no hate crimes laws, and of the 28 states with hate crime legislation covering hate crimes against sexual minorities, only four address transgender persons (Human Rights Campaign [HRC], 2003). Moreover, 36 states do not provide legal protection to LGBT people against discrimination related to housing, employment, entitlements, and civil rights and only three states have discrimination laws protecting transgender individuals (HRC, 2003). Nationally, anti-male homosexual bias motivates most offenses, followed by anti-female homosexual bias and bias against homosexuals as a group, respectively. \n \n A single case of antigay violence is too many and many statistics underestimate the number of hate crimes against LGBT people. In the United States there were 1,671 incidents of hate crimes based on sexual orientation in 2001, compared to 1,517 in 2000 (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2001, 2002). The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), an organization that monitors antigay violence, reported 1,968 anti-LGBT incidents in 2002 (NCAVP, 2003). In many jurisdictions, reporting is voluntary and law enforcement agencies underreport anti-gay violence (Dean et al., 2000). Moreover, many LGBT people do not report being a victim because they fear additional prejudice and discrimination if exposed. \n \n Law-abiding people who see little wrong in their actions carry out most hate crimes and many of these perpetrators are not crazed individuals. Their motivation appears to be personal prejudice, a situation that impairs the perpetrator's judgment, blinding the immorality of their behavior (American Psychological Association, 1998). Franklin (1997) has identified four types of perpetrators - those who feel their actions enforce social morals; thrill seekers; those who want to prove their toughness and heterosexuality to friends, and; self-defense perpetrators who believe that LGBT people are sexual predators and the assaults are responses to aggressive sexual propositions. People with a history of antisocial behavior commit most extreme LGBT hate crimes (American Psychological Association, 1998). Alcohol and drugs sometimes help fuel the violence.\n \n Need for the Project:\n \n There have been 109 LGBT biased crimes reported since 1993 in Rhode Island (Rhode Island State Police, 2003). In 2002, there were 20 reported LGBT hate crimes, up 35% from 2001. In Rhode Island, gay men and heterosexual men perceived to be gay experienced the majority of these crimes. Rhode Island law establishes penalties for crimes committed because of hatred or animus toward the victim's actual or perceived disability, religion, color, race, nation origin or ancestry, sexual orientation or gender. The State of Rhode Island defines a hate crime as \"any crime motivated by bigotry and bias, including, but not limited to threatened, attempted, or completed acts that appear after investigation to have been motivated by racial, religious, ethnic, sexual orientation, gender, or disability prejudice.\" \n \n Community education is a strategy suggested to raise the consciousness of LGBT people about the sources of their oppression (Garnets & D'Augelli, 1994). Prevention education programs related to hate-crime violence directed at the LGBT community should be community-based, and have goals of serving victims and reducing the number of incidents through education and information (Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, 2001; The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs [NCAVP], 2003). \n \n Members of the LGBT community in Rhode Island are in need of an intervention that will allow them to dissuade the perpetrator or protect themselves from the effects of prejudice and discrimination, especially violent acts directed toward them. There is no agency providing self-defense training to Rhode Island adult LGBT residents, although several agencies provide support for victims. Only one agency (Youth Pride, Inc.) in Rhode Island provides comprehensive statewide services for LGBT youth who have been the victims of hate crime and trauma. Recently, Youth Pride completed a health and wellness series in which the agency provided a one-time self-defense training workshop to adults with IMPACT Model Mugging from Boston, Massachusetts. \n \n This initiative has the potential to reach every LGBT residents in the State. Rhode Island is unique in its size and in proximity, only covering a geographical area of 42 by 37 miles. There are many establishments providing social, legal, medical, and mental health services to LGBT residents to promote the program. Because of the highway infrastructure and public transportation, it is possible for residents to reach a central location for training. \n \n A second benefit of this project is that it will provide for a systematic tracking of training participants to determine the efficacy of the training over time. There is no data in Rhode Island that explains a LGBT person's behaviors and attitudes regarding self-defense. Beginning with the infusion of the program, a longitudinal tracking over a one-year period will allow follow-up data for analysis that will describe the program's efficacy with respect to use of the skills and changes in attitudes and other psychological measures.",
