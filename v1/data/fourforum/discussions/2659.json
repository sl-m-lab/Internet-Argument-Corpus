   "Reverend Wayne Perryman was on Fox News the other night and on local radio here again this morning talking about his book (title above).\n Rev. Perryman, like many blacks, was a strong Democratic supporter until he began doing research on the history of the Democratic Party and its position towards blacks.\n Here are a few of his revelations:\n \n\n \"The Democrats\n \n Our nation's top historians reveal that the Democratic Party gave us the Ku Klux Klan, Black Codes, Jim Crow Laws and other repressive legislation which resulted in the multitude of murders, lynchings, mutilations, and intimidations (of thousands of black and white Republicans). On the issue of slavery: historians say the Democrats gave their lives to expand it, the Republicans gave their lives to ban it. \n \n The Republicans\n \n Regarding the Republican Party, historians report that while Democrats were busy passing laws to hurt blacks, Republicans devoted their time to passing laws to help blacks. Republicans were primarily responsible for the following Civil Rights legislation: \n \n 1. The Emancipation Proclamation\n 2. The 13th Amendment\n 3. The 14th Amendment\n 4. The 15th Amendment\n 5. The Reconstruction Act of 1867\n 6. The Civil Rights of 1866\n 7. The Enforcement Act of 1870\n 8. The Forced Act of 1871\n 9. The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871\n 10. The Civil Rights Act of 1875\n 11. The Freeman Bureau\n 12. The Civil Rights Act of 1957\n 13. The Civil Rights Act of 1960\n 14. The United State Civil Rights Commission \n\n \n \n http://www.wayneperryman.com/\n \n It's interesting reading. Today on the radio, he made a great statement. He said that for years blacks have been shopping in Democratic stores but not coming home with any goods\" (paraphrased)\n \n Has anyone read this book? Is it worth the read?",

That's why it was democratic strength that passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n \n So Rev. Perryman sounds to me like someone very, very, easily duped. Obviously, the Republican party of yore was much friendlier to black interests than the democrats were. At the same time, the old Republican party started off more liberal than the Democrats too (for example, Teddy Roosevelt).

Jesse Jackson: \"As he left office, a Lou Harris poll found nearly 80 percent of blacks considered his administration oppressive.\"\n Jackson readily agreed, saying Reagan's relationship with blacks was \"very hostile.\"\n Earlier, Jackson said Reagan \"believed in states' rights and Jefferson Davis\" while he believes \"in the Union and Abraham Lincoln.\"\n But the facts prove otherwise. \"Under Reagan, black adult unemployment fell faster than did white unemployment,\" noted Larry Elder in a 1999 op-ed for the Ethnic News Watch. \"Black teenage unemployment fell faster than did white teenage unemployment. And blacks started businesses at a rate faster than that of whites.\"\n \"In 1981,\" Elder continued, \"the nation's poverty rate stood at 14 percent. It declined to 11.6 percent in 1988, Reagan's last year in office.\"\n .................\n \n Dems = Racism\n Perryman argues that Democrats are quick to demand Republicans believed to be guilty of racism apologize, but so far have refused to do so for their party's own racist past.\n \"The Democratic Party has never offered an apology for their racist legislative practices or their terrorist and lethal tactics-both initiated by members of their party and their Klan supporters,\" he writes.\n Speaking of Lincoln, Perryman also notes that some \"key traditional black colleges\" - such as Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Mo., which was founded in 1865 for Abraham Lincoln - are named after noted white Republicans who funded and supported them, even as \"Democrats were trying to destroy them.\"\n Perryman notes the nation's premier black civil rights organization - the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) - was \"founded and financed by three white persons\" who rose up in opposition of the Democrats' \"racist practices and the lynchings of blacks.\"\n \"History reveals the Republican Party has a far more impressive track record in Civil Rights legislation than the Democratic Party,\" Perryman says.\"\n\n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/6/22/162434.shtml",

GW gave a tax break to EVERYBODY and it is stimulating the economy. Now tell me how that didn't benefit blacks?\n Also, GW pushed the \"NCLB\" initiative that will certainly benefit poor blacks.\n He also passed the SS Prescription Plan which will surely benefit poor black Seniors. It is Republicans nationally that are the drivers behind school vouchers. Who do you think will benefit most by being able to pick a school for their kids to attend, white suburbanites that already go to good schools or poor inner-city blacks that can opt out for a school in the burbs?\n Maybe, what you need to do is look at who's influencing YOUR party and see what good their doing for blacks. Democrats have opposed school vouchers for two reasons, it threatens teacher union jobs and it makes them accountable for a school's performance. Democrats are supported by AFSCME, why? Because they know that Democrats won't try to cut the size of the government and eliminate tens of thousands of useless public service jobs. Do you think that the increased tax burden that results from us propping up needless governmental workers isn't hurting blacks as well as whites?\n \n\n As to the Great Society, I'm not sure I buy the dependency theory you are putting out.

As I pointed out above, the single most beneficial thing that you can give one to increase their earning potential is knowledge. And which party is doing anything positively in that respect, the Republicans. School of choice and vouchers work. We have them here in Michigan and we're seeing more inner-city blacks attending Blue Ribbon Schools in the burbs. Do you think they might be getting a better education now?\n As I stated before, the Republican philosophy is to give a man a hand up, not a Democratic handout.",

   "You sit here touting NCLB and you say I'm buying into myths? Please. Let's take these a point at a time.\n \n Reagan's tax cuts were predominately slanted towards the rich. During his time the wealth gap increased spectacularly, so while the economy as a whole may have benefited, the poor still lost out. Plus, the \"Greed is Good\" mentality of the Reagan years led directly to the S+L scandel and later to Enron and Worldcom (though democrats aren't absolved of blame for this, Lieberman has alot on his head for that particular problem). GW Bush's tax cuts also predominately help the rich (45% of the total expenditures to be precise). And while he also included some tax relief for the poor, what you are forgetting is that the Democratic tax plan included these cuts as well and sought to expand them. Indeed, John Kerry has very explicitly said that he will repeal the tax cuts for the rich while expanding them for the poor and middle class.\n \n No Child Left Behind was a) Bipartisan (Kennedy co-sponsered) and b) a sleight of hand. First of all, Bush has refused to fund it adequetly, which means it is at the moment actually harming schools rather than helping them (by giving them unfunded mandates). This is why some states, such as Utah, are threatening to opt-out of the program, because they can't afford to pay for it and Bush refuses to give them the money. According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune on June 17 2004, Wisconsin has decided that it is not bound by any of the NCLB requirements b/c the federal government hasn't provided adequete funding for them. Second, NCLB has irrational standards, since it labels a school \"failing\" if any grouping within that school doesn't make yearly progress on test data. From the Daytona Beach News-Journal, June 22 2004 \"Under another federal act, children with learning disabilities can apply for a special program only if they perform under grade level. Under NCLB, the schools these children attend cannot make AYP if any of the learning-disabled students perform under grade level. If a school fails to meet AYP because one or more learning-disabled students fail to perform at grade level, the whole school is labeled inadequate, and all schoolchildren are eligible for transfers.\" The problem with this is that sometimes schools don't have enough members of a group to be statistically significant, so if the school has 3 special-ed students and they do worse on their tests, the entire school is considered a failure even if all the other groups do well. Third, the penalties of NCLB fall hardest on poorer schools. As the Sarasota Herald Tribune reported on June 17 2004, since only Title I schools (those which recieve federal aid for serving poor students) are forced to implement remedial measures if they are labeled \"failing,\" what is essentially a slap on the wrist for a rich school becomes the death knell for a poorer one, which has to divert its federal funding to busing students to other schools among other things. Finally, while I don't like the specifics of NCLB, it has all the hallmarks of a liberal intiative, that is, a move by the federal government to control a classically state run program (and education especially is a democratic issue, the Republican party's biggest education intiative prior to NCLB is to try and abolish the Department of Education). The difference is that democrats provide adequete funding. Bush's medicare intiative is in the same vein, a poor co-opt of a democratic idea, poorly written and underfunded.\n \n As for vouchers, well I'm ambivelent on them. I do support them in principle (though not at the expense of underfunding public schools). The problem is that private schools aren't compelled to participate in the program, and still can put forth enterance exams and other barriers, so while its an escape for some students many more are left behind. Republicans tend to view vouchers as the be-all end-all of education reform, and its not. A comprehensive strategy is needed.\n \n Frankly, Republicans don't have alot of practice with hands, either up or out. Their paltry, politically motivated efforts to try have only proven this point. Incidentally, the Bush adminstration has justified not spending the requisite money on these programs b/c of deficits, at the same time as they seek to push more tax cuts in spite of deficits. Tax Cuts more important than deficits more important than Education intiative, ergo Tax Cuts more important than education reform to help the poor. Considering that repeal of only the tax cuts which aid the rich would free up over $600 billion dollars, it would be rather easy to fix the funding problems that have plagued every Bush intiative from Homeland Security to Education to AIDS relief IF the Bush admin wasn't so beholden to its tax-cutting agenda.",

   "What you've done is buy into the myth that Reagan only cut taxes and never hiked them. That is simply not true. Look to The New Republic on May 22 2003:\n \"To understand how deeply the United States has descended into fiscal madness, compare the present situation with the last time GOP tax-cutters ran Washington, the Reagan presidency. Just like George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan used his first year in office to enact a series of tax cuts tilted toward the well-off that helped plunge the nation into debt. For this, Reagan is remembered by both the right and left as an unflinching avatar of supply-side economics. But, in truth, Reagan reacted to the consequences of his 1981 tax cuts in a way that would have put him far out of step with Bush's Republican Party. When the scope of the budget deficit became apparent, Reagan acceded to a series of tax increases in 1982 (in the midst of a severe recession, no less), 1983, and 1984. In 1986, reacting to complaints that his 1981 tax cuts opened too many loopholes for the rich, Reagan enacted a sweeping tax reform that liberals, including this magazine, hailed for making the tax code more progressive. Reagan's record on taxes, in short, consisted of one year of unvarnished conservative ideological warfare followed by seven years of retreat and consolidation.\"\n The unemployment rate was around 7.5% in 1981, it soared to 10% by 1982. After that, it began falling again, right in the midst of Reagan's tax hikes. So comparing the data from 1980 to 1988 isn't solid statistics, b/c it includes both tax cuts and tax hikes. I don't mind Reaganomics from the perspective of tax cuts when feasible, tax hikes when necessary (though I don't think Reagan did a great job of implementing them), but when people talk Reaganomics, they mean the Reagan of 1981, not 1986.\n \nI love it. Now your going to blame Reagan for banking industry scandals. LOL\n And the problems with Enron, Worldcom, and let's add Golden Crossings took place under Clinton. The house of cards came down under Bush, but he certainly didn't cause it.\n As for GW's tax cuts, who do YOU think should get their taxes cut more, those who pay 95% of ALL income taxes or those who pay 5%? \n\n I'm going to assume u mean \"Global Crossing.\" The blame for that is shared amongst the greedy corporations who took the illegal/unethical actions, and the congressmen (including Sen. Lieberman as I mentioned before) who removed the oversight. The party in charge of congress was the Republican party at that time, and regardless of who's at fault for Enron doesn't change the fact that S+L was the granddaddy of all these scandels, and that was under Reagan's watch.\n Moving on with our \"how to lie with statistics\" kick, you repeat the oft heard line that the rich deserve the tax cuts b/c they pay most of the taxes. While its true that they pay the most in taxes, that's due to the fact that they also make the vast majority of our nations income. they pay around 95% of the taxes because they make around 90% of the total income. The whole principle behind a progressive tax system is that because capitalist markets inherently favor the rich, they are the ones who need to pay the most into the system that gives them the most benefits.\n \nBelieve me, you won't hear me tout NCLB as a program that I'd willingly pay for. I think that GW was insane to get in bed with Teddy. I think the Feds should get out of education all together. It isn't any of their business or charter. I only pointed it out because it was a program designed to help inner-city youth supported by Republicans and signed into law by a Republican President.\n \n So...the republican party's answer to social problems is poorly written bills that are underfunded and don't solve anything? Quite a ringing endorsement.\nIn theory, you're right, but in practice you're wrong. Before a private school can take any Federal money, it must first agree to comply with Federal mandated programs and curriculum. He who holds the purse strings controls the school...and in this instance Uncle Sam still holds some of the purse strings. \n \n That's the death knell for vouchers, since Private Schools don't need federal funding and don't WANT to be subject to the federal restrictions you mention. Hence they don't participate.\n \nThat's the problem with Liberals. They think that robbing the rih and giving the money to Liberal-controlled social programs work. The sad fact is that LBJ's $7Trillion War on Poverty has been America's greatest defeat. We lost that war and throwing more money into tired old handout programs just puts us further away from the end of poverty. Tax cuts for those paying the majority of the taxes is a good thing.

The economy is growing just like it did after Reagan's tax cuts, but Liberals would have us believe that it's not a \"real\" growth because we are losing manufacturing jobs. So what? We are morphing from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, get used to it.\n \n I don't know, I think the \"war on drugs\" can play ball for the \"worst defeat ever,\" (as can Vietnam, and Prohibition for that matter).

   "What you've done is buy into the myth that Reagan only cut taxes and never hiked them. That is simply not true. Look to The New Republic on May 22 2003:\n \"To understand how deeply the United States has descended into fiscal madness, compare the present situation with the last time GOP tax-cutters ran Washington, the Reagan presidency. Just like George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan used his first year in office to enact a series of tax cuts tilted toward the well-off that helped plunge the nation into debt. For this, Reagan is remembered by both the right and left as an unflinching avatar of supply-side economics. But, in truth, Reagan reacted to the consequences of his 1981 tax cuts in a way that would have put him far out of step with Bush's Republican Party. When the scope of the budget deficit became apparent, Reagan acceded to a series of tax increases in 1982 (in the midst of a severe recession, no less), 1983, and 1984. In 1986, reacting to complaints that his 1981 tax cuts opened too many loopholes for the rich, Reagan enacted a sweeping tax reform that liberals, including this magazine, hailed for making the tax code more progressive. Reagan's record on taxes, in short, consisted of one year of unvarnished conservative ideological warfare followed by seven years of retreat and consolidation.\"\n The unemployment rate was around 7.5% in 1981, it soared to 10% by 1982. After that, it began falling again, right in the midst of Reagan's tax hikes. So comparing the data from 1980 to 1988 isn't solid statistics, b/c it includes both tax cuts and tax hikes. I don't mind Reaganomics from the perspective of tax cuts when feasible, tax hikes when necessary (though I don't think Reagan did a great job of implementing them), but when people talk Reaganomics, they mean the Reagan of 1981, not 1986.\n\n \n \"President Reagan delivered on each of his four major policy objectives, although not to the extent that he and his supporters had hoped. The annual increase in real (inflation-adjusted) federal spending declined from 4.0 percent during the Carter administration to 2.5 percent during the Reagan administration, despite a record peacetime increase in real defense spending. This part of Reagan's fiscal record, however, reflected only a moderation, not a reversal, of prior fiscal trends. Reagan made no significant changes to the major transfer payment programs (such as Social Security and Medicare), and he proposed no substantial reductions in other domestic programs after his first budget.\"\n and..................\n The changes to the federal tax code were much more substantial. The top marginal tax rate on individual income was reduced from 70 percent to 28 percent. The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 48 percent to 34 percent. The individual tax brackets were indexed for inflation. And most of the poor were exempted from the individual income tax. These measures were somewhat offset by several tax increases. An increase in Social Security tax rates legislated in 1977 but scheduled for the eighties was accelerated slightly. Some excise tax rates were increased, and some deductions were reduced or eliminated.\n \n http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Reaganomics.html\n \n The above link gives a good synopsis of Reaganomics; it's successes and failures.\n Here's another:\n \n \"Ronald Reagan's legacy was a fascinating mixture: lower inflation and higher deficits; lower taxes and higher levels of government spending; less unemployment and bigger trade deficits; fewer strikes and more government jobs; reduced economic regulation and expanded social regulation; the deepest recession in half a century and the longest peacetime recovery ever. A few numerical comparisons help make the point. Real GDP declined by one-half of 1 percent in 1980, President Carter's last year, and rose 3.9 percent in 1988, President Reagan's last year. The CPI rose 13.5 percent in 1980 and by 4.1 percent in '88. The prime rate dropped from 15 percent in 1980 to 9 percent in 1988. Real median family income rose from $34,200 in 1980 to $37,000 in 1988. The unemployment rate declined from 7.0 percent in 1980 to 5.4 percent in 1988. On the other hand, the budget deficit rose from $74 billion in 1980 to $155 billion in 1988, while the trade deficit rose from $15 billion to $129 billion during the same period. And, contrary to widespread belief, the portion of the population below the poverty line was 13 percent in both years. One more set of numbers: Real national wealth rose from $11.9 trillion in 1980 to $14.2 trillion in 1988. Warts and all, the Reagan presidency was a high-water mark for the American economy, especially as measured by the more positive attitude that most Americans had toward themselves, their society, and the future.\n \n http://csmonitor.com/cgi-bin/durableRedirect.pl?/durable/1997/12/18/opin/opin.2.html\n \n \"A study from the Cato Institute (a Libertarian think tank, which supports many of the premises that lie behind Reaganomics) said:\n * Real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent during the Reagan years versus 2.8 percent during the Ford-Carter years and 2.1 percent during the Bush-Clinton years. \n * Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. (http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-261.html)\n \n [quote]\n I'm going to assume u mean \"Global Crossing.\" The blame for that is shared amongst the greedy corporations who took the illegal/unethical actions, and the congressmen (including Sen. Lieberman as I mentioned before) who removed the oversight. The party in charge of congress was the Republican party at that time, and regardless of who's at fault for Enron doesn't change the fact that S+L was the granddaddy of all these scandels, and that was under Reagan's watch.[quote]\n Really? 97-99 Senate was controlled by the Republicans; All Reagan Years Houses of Representatives were controlled by the Democrats and the root of the S&L scandal lies in the FSLIC, which increased the limit of Federal Insurance from $40k to $100K under CARTER.\n \n \"March, 1980--Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) enacted. The law is a Carter Administration initiative aimed at eliminating many of the distinctions among different types of depository institutions and ultimately removing interest rate ceiling on deposit accounts. Authority for federal S&Ls to make ADC (acquisition, development, construction) loans is expanded. Deposit insurance limit raised to $100,000 from $40,000. This last provision is added without debate.\"\n http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/s&l/\n \n\n Moving on with our \"how to lie with statistics\" kick, you repeat the oft heard line that the rich deserve the tax cuts b/c they pay most of the taxes. While its true that they pay the most in taxes, that's due to the fact that they also make the vast majority of our nations income. they pay around 95% of the taxes because they make around 90% of the total income. The whole principle behind a progressive tax system is that because capitalist markets inherently favor the rich, they are the ones who need to pay the most into the system that gives them the most benefits.\n\n \n The \"principle\" behind a progressive tax system is pure Marxism. \"From each according to his means, to each according to his needs.\" I'd call your \"progressive tax system\" by its real name \"Marxism\".\n But, let's look at the facts from the IRS:\n \n \"Top 5% - pay 56.47% of all income taxes; earn 35.30% of all income\n Top 10% - pay 67.33% of all income taxes; earn 46.01%\n Top 25% -pay 84.01% of all income taxes; earn 67.15%\n Top 50% - pay 96.09% of all income taxes; earn 87.01%\n Bottom 50%-pay 3.91% of all income taxes; earn 12.99%\n \n They make 87% of the income and pay over 96% of the income taxes. Again, I ask you, who should get the tax cuts, those who pay the taxes or those who don't?\n \n \n So...the republican party's answer to social problems is poorly written bills that are underfunded and don't solve anything? Quite a ringing endorsement. \n That's the death knell for vouchers, since Private Schools don't need federal funding and don't WANT to be subject to the federal restrictions you mention. Hence they don't participate.\n\n If it's a poorly written bill, then you should blame Teddy, not GW. He wrote the bill. :)\n \n \n I don't know, I think the \"war on drugs\" can play ball for the \"worst defeat ever,\" (as can Vietnam, and Prohibition for that matter). You won't find me objecting to plans that stop throwing money to handout programs. But while democrats are starting to come around to that realization, republicans aren't offering a hand at all.\n\n The war on drugs doesn't even come close to the cost of the War on Poverty. Neither does Vietman or Prohibition.\n \n\n We're still at a net loss of jobs (you can't just ignore manufacturing, even if you want to), and in a far worse economic state than we were under the Clinton years. We may be moving away from manufacturing (I'm inclined to agree with you here), but don't trumpet that as a good thing if the jobs that are replacing them are lowerpaying than the current ones.\n\n \n Another myth, lower paying jobs. Here's the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. If we're losing high paying jobs, why is the average income level increasing? Personal income has increased from $9.332Trillion to $9.685Trillion from Oct. 03 to May 04 alone. Maybe McDonald's raising their starting salary? :) \n \n http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm",

   "Reverend Wayne Perryman was on Fox News the other night and on local radio here again this morning talking about his book (title above).\n Rev. Perryman, like many blacks, was a strong Democratic supporter until he began doing research on the history of the Democratic Party and its position towards blacks.\n Here are a few of his revelations:\n \n \n \n http://www.wayneperryman.com/\n \n It's interesting reading. Today on the radio, he made a great statement. He said that for years blacks have been shopping in Democratic stores but not coming home with any goods\" (paraphrased)\n \n Has anyone read this book? Is it worth the read?\n\n \n \n I think the main reason that most blacks are Dems is because of the Compromise of 1877 when the Rep led North pulled Fed troops out of the south as part of an agreement following a disputed election result. Once the Fed troops were withdrawn there was no one to enforce/ensure that the gains made were enforced. President Rutherford B. Hayes just looked the other way thus allowing the south to pass laws known as Black Codes. This also gave rise to the KKK which grew unchecked. What ever goodwill the Rep had built up was squandered in a few short years. While slavery was illegal the Black Codes that were passed in southern states made it possible to enslave Blacks legally without using the word slavery. If you look at recent history (all US history is recent) the party that has done the most for Blacks (real or imagined) has been the Dem's. Rep turned thier back on Blacks who were left to the mercy of a defeated south in 1876/1877 as in the Rep did nothing to help maintain the freedoms gained. Both parties have failed in a lot of areas. All the above info is online, in more then one place..............\n \n Keep in mind this was only 2.5/3 generations ago. My great grandparents were slaves in Tenn to be exact.

At one time conservatism was a part of both parties. Now Democrats have basically stopped looking to support conservatism altogether and they are paying for it dearly. They've lost the presidency and they lose more and more seats in congress every time an election comes around.\n \n The key for Democrats is that they need to realize that conservatism and anti-civil rights are not synonomous and do not necessarily go hand-in-hand.

But to call them what they have called them, to minimalize there efforts and accomplishments is horrible.\n \n Justice Clarence Thomas has been wrecked by all dems because he gave up on the policy that got him where he is.\n \n BUNK total BUNK\n \n Its groups like the NAACP which are supposed to be an Association for the ADVANCEMENT of COLORED PEOPLE, regardless of politcal persuation\n \n Why would the comp. of 1877 make black people be Democrat?\n \n \nRepublicans negotiated with the Democrats to abandon the filibuster by offering the following: the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, appointment of at least one Southerner to Hayes's cabinet, and economic benefits to industrialize the South. Unfortunately, withdrawal of troops meant the Republicans essentially abandoning the enforcement of racial equality in the South.\n \n \n is it the GOPs fault the Dems made sure they couldnt enforce Equality?\n \n \nOpposed to Johnson's \"Presidential Reconstruction\" was \"Congressional Reconstruction\" from the radical Republicans. As a response to the South's instituting Black Codes, the radicals expanded the Freedman's Bureau and proposed the first Civil Rights legislation. The Fourteenth Amendment gave citizenship to black men. Later the Fifteenth Amendment was also passed which granted suffrage to black men. Reconstruction failed, however, to provide economically for the freed slaves.After Lincoln and Johnson's moderate policies, the Congressional Reconstruction seemed particularly harsh to Southerners. Post-Reconstruction, Southern Democrats began to assert their power.\n \n \n \n \n Remember it was GOP Eisenhower who ordered the troops to let the kids goto school admit protest from the Democratic Mayor and his mob",

You fill out the paperwork, you get scored, and if you score high enough you get your loan. I know that at at least a couple of major banks the scoring is not even done by a human, nor is the final loan decision made by a person when it comes to common loans (vehicle loans, home loans, etc....).\n \n I admit I only know a handful of black people (in my town there really is only a handful of black people worth knowing). They are all middle or upper middle class, and every one of them will tell you that descrimination against black in the US is rare. What people point at and claim is racial descrimination against blacks is generally discrimination aginst the lower class, particular inner city residents. \n \n I happen to know that none of the black people I know have any trouble getting loans.",

   "Most personal mortgages being assembled today are done with the intent of selling them to one of the big lenders for a portfolio or a quasi-government agency like Fanny Mae to package for securities. I guess any 'undercover' agent (I'd frankly be curious as to how that's achieved, sounds more like disgruntled employees) could create doubt, but I don't know why a lender would bother to discriminate since the loan would more than likely be going out of house to begin with. Sounds more like low scores based on debt to equity and income status. \n \n I've never done personal or home lending, but other than paperwork it can't be any different than commercial lending. If the means to make money is there (lender) and borrower circumstances are within acceptable perimeters, who would be stupid enough to keep money our of his or her pocket because of race? 30-40 years ago, yes, but most of those small banks were bought long ago for economy of operation in numbers. The few independents left are start-ups desperate for any business to facilitate expansion and you don't turn down a money tap like banks have by refusing acceptable business.",
