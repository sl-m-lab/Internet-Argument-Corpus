   "Hi Sinjin\n \n \nSinjin << Where was Jesus between 12yrs. and 30yrs.?\n\n \n Your question demonstrates the fact that the Four Gospel accounts are written in context to something other than the life and times of Jesus. Mark begins his letter by saying, \"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\" Mark 1:1. Then he begins talking about John the Baptist, and how he is this 'messenger' of Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1. Where was Jesus for the first 30 years? \n \n Many attribute the Book of Acts with Luke, because of terms only found in these two accounts, and the way he opens each letter to 'Theophilus.' Luke 1:3, Acts 1:1. I mention this in order to bring up the point about the context in which he is writing. He says, \n \n \n\"The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach, until the day when He was taken up {to heaven,} after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen. To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over {a period of} forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.\" Acts 1:1-3.\n\n \n The operative phrase here is the \"kingdom of God.\" As much as people might like to hear about how many chairs and tables Jesus made, or how many Lord's Passover suppers He ate throughout His lifetime, those things simply do not contribute to 'the things concerning the kingdom of God.' \n \n How many times would you guess that the word 'kingdom' is used in Matthew's Gospel account alone? Would you believe fifty-five times? Christ gathered the disciples together and told them that they would receive the Holy Spirit very soon. What kind of questions would you have for anyone who had just returned from the dead? Take a guess as to the very first question that asked Him. \"Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?\" Acts 1:6. \n \n Everyone seems to forget that Christ came, \"teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom.\" Matt. 4:23, 9:35. Even after the crucifixion, the gospel of the day was the, \"good news about the kingdom of God  and the name of Jesus Christ.\" Acts 8:12. That was the good news message that Israel rejected, so that Christ could raise up the Apostle Paul with our 'Christ crucified' gospel for today. See the difference here:\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509\n \n Others among us fail to realize that Mark and Luke are not disciples at all, and both were companions of Paul that wrote by the testimony of other people. John ends his Gospel account by saying, \n \n \n\"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written.\" John 21:24+25.\n\n \n Maybe you can ask Christ, \"Where were You between 12 yrs. and 30yrs.?\" However, since you boast and say, \n\"But I am an atheist,\" \n then you might be a little busy at that judgment.\n \n \n\"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\" Rev. 20:15.\n\n \n Good luck with that,\n \n Terral",

How about \"fool\"?\n\n \n It is natural to conclude that my mentioning one of the many judgments of Scripture means that I hate that person. In actuality that is far from the truth. Whether homosexuals, atheists or folks from the peanut gallery, I genuinely have a burden for the souls of all men. Jude writes,\n \n \n\"And have mercy on some, who are doubting; save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh. Jude 1:22+23.\n\n \n \nGreg << When they start reading from the BooK of Life and tossing souls in to the lake of fire , I sure hope the right Tom Smith, Bob Brown, Bill Jones, is picked out and tossed.\n \n \n Look at the example of the rich man. He pleaded,\n \n \n\"Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father's house--for I have five brothers--in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' \"But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.' Luke 16:27-27.\n\n \n And we have the Holy Scriptures today. So I take opportunity to warn people about what is just around the corner. We are here but a few minutes compared to the ages to come. Hold your breath for as long as possible. Even that compared to this day is far longer, than your entire life measured against eternity. For me, I had much rather listen to your words of ridicule and know that I ran the good race in warning everyone possible, about what is prophesied in God's Word. Join Bill in calling me a fool if you like.\n \n \nGreg << Those, along with all of the other millions of souls here on earth that have the same name . It might just get real tricky matching same names to the right soul and getting them ALL right , \n \n \n Listen to what Christ told His disciples:\n \n \n\"Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear {whispered} in {your} ear, proclaim upon the housetops. Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And {yet} not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\" Matt. 10:26-30.\n\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",
