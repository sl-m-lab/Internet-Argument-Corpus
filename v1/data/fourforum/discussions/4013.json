   "I'm just saying that you can say that it makes little sense that God would require sacrifice, but you can say that about anything related to God if you try hard enough. Belief in God is a matter of faith rather than reason. The difference between people of faith and reason is that people of faith don't feel that reason has to be superior to faith. In my experience, people who rely totally on their own reason do indeed feel it is always superior. \n \n \n \n Who said it was a matter of \"need\" on His part? If someone loves God, they want to worship him. It's that simple.\n \n \n \n In my view, all prayers \"reach\" God. If God is all-knowing (omniscient, which I believe He is), there's no way He would not know the prayers of all people. That doesn't mean He would be obligated to answer them.\n\n \n I think your distinction between faith and reason is crucial in a debate of this kind - it's one I've made myself on several occasions. The only problem is, it more or less puts an end to discourse between those who believe in God and those who don't. Both parties are following paths that can never meet.\n \n However, it still seems reasonable to ask believers to explain if not justify the ways in which they \"implement\" their faith. For example, on the question of prayer, it still seems incredible (to me) that anyone could believe that God is listening to the millions of individual voices - each person with his/her own unique enquiry or supplication. One might add that if God is omniscient, then he is already in possession of the facts in each case, so prayer is superfluous.",

The view that I've heard on this is that God still wants to hear prayer, if anything for our sake.

   "Umm...I don't think so. Sorry. \n\n you removed this from my post: \"if God is the ultimate judge, then its not at all far fetched to think that he's the one keeping the score\"\n \n that was the response to the qustion you rasied\n \n \nAll well and good. But the question remains (actually, two questions), 1) what efforts are required for one to obtain redemption?, and 2) is redemption even necessary? I'll defer the second question for another time, but I'd like to address the first, if only briefly. \n \n Jewish theology suggests that one must atone for or redress one's transgressions (sins) whether they be against man or against God. If the transgression be against one's neighbour, one must seek to undo the offense, make retribution, and to ask for forgiveness. If the offense be against God, one is required to acknowledge the offense and to ask for forgiveness. There is no room here for a proxy.\n\n i never said God acts as a proxy. God is the JUDGE. you report your atonement to him. he determines if your act of atonement is satisfactory. actually, he's the one that decrees what acts you must commit for atonement in the first place. thats what a judge/referee/score-keeper does",

   "nor do I consider it to be a first-hand account written by eyewitnesses to the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth. The authors of the NT were apparently attempting to sell a story the events of which they did not witness.\n\n \n Wow, that sounds remarkably like any modern history book written about events of any era prior to the author's life . . .\n \n \nMoreover, the story seems to have evolved over time. For example, consider the question of when it was that Jesus became divine - you will get four different answers, one each from Paul, Mark, Matthew/Luke, and John. These guys were unable to agree on the specifics surrounding either Jesus' birth nor his resurrection.\n\n \n The similarities of these gospels far, far outweigh the differences.",
