This sensitivity can be explained as the loss of political prestige - perhaps a fading of La Gloire into insignificance.\n \n Seventy years ago France was a major international power. Since then it has suffered a catastrophic military defeat and humiliating occupation, the scandal of the collaborationists, the Vichy episode, two very embarrassing colonial withdrawals, and a regime change (1958) that amounted to a virtual coup. \n \n The French people tend to compensate themselves for this rather inglorious recent history by asserting their 'national honour' whenever possible. This is often at the root of their anti-American sentiments.\n \n Gratitude for American participation in the 1944 liberation of France is of no account now - perhaps on the principle that no good turn goes unpunished.

That the allies were a bit too eager to please General De gaulle who had little support from the French themselves even by allowing him a victorious ride into Paris and declare that the French had liberated themselves!\n After the war the French invented the myth of widespread resistance against the Germans which was not true.\n I am sure that there were many brave French people during WW2 but Britain can claim it as thier finest hour , the only nation to be resisting the might of the German forces before they opened up the Eastern front. The French cant claim that but try .",

Here's some food for thought.\n Fact: Over 125,000 Americans died on French & European soil from October 1917 until November 1918 - mostly fighting to free France from German invasion.\n \n Fact: On D-Day - June 6th, 1944 over 2500 Americans died on the beaches in Normandy, France - fighting to free France from German occupation.\n \n Fact: Over 400,000 Americans died fighting in World War 2, again in large part fighting to free France from German occupation.\n \n \"What do you expect from a culture and a nation that exerted more of its national will fighting against Disney World and Big Macs than against the Nazis?\" NOT MUCH! ---Dennis Miller==============================================================================================A Frenchman, an American, and a Brit were all busy getting drunk in Saudi Arabia when the cops burst in. They were soon sentenced to death, but through good lawyers, the three men were able to reduce their sentence to life. As luck would have it, it was a Saudi holiday, so the judge said, \"Because it's a holiday you will each recieve 20 lashes and be let go.\n It is customary to grant one wish before punishment. The Brit thinks and says, \"Strap a pillow on my back.\" They do, but it only holds for 10 lashes.\n \n The Frenchman sees this, and requests two pillows on his back. These only hold for 15 lashes.\n \n The judge turns to the American and says \"Because you are from such a respectable country, you get 2 wishes.\"\n \n The American replies, \"I wish to be flogged 100 times, not 20.\" The judge thinks this is very honerable and asks \"And your second?\"\n \n The American answers \"Strap the Frenchman to my back.\"\n ==============================================================================================\n Donald Rumsfeld was being heckled by a French anti-war weenie when he suddenly turned and asked the Frenchman:\n \"Excuse me. Do you speak German?\"\n \n The Frenchman replied \"No.\"\n \n Rumsfeld looked him in the eyes and said \"You're welcome.\"\n ==============================================================================================\n Q: Where can you find 60,100,000 French jokes?\n A: In France.\n ==============================================================================================\n The only seat available on the train was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged French woman and the seat was being used by her dog.\n The weary traveler asked, \"Ma'am, please move your dog. I need that seat.\" The French woman looked down her nose at the American, sniffed and said, You Americans. Your are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my little FiFi is using that seat?\"\n \n The American walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog. Again he asked, \"Please, lady. May I sit there?\". I'm very tired.\"\n \n The French woman wrinkled her nose and snorted \"You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant....Imagine!\"\n \n The American didn't say anything else, he leaned over, picked up the dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her honor and chastise the American.\n \n An English man sitting across the aisle spoke up indignantly \"You know,sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, Sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.\"\n The reason there are so many french jokes is because they're so obvious. :)emoticon_xagreeemoticon_xbouncer",

Not a proud point of the history.)\n Battle of Greece: April 6 - April 30, 1941\n \n No, of course France was uncharacteristically short compared to every other defeated opponent... Gimme a break. The Germans steamrolled over everyone at the start of the war, and got bogged down later. And suddenly had to deal with local resistance movements.\n \n \nHad they, then the war would have ended in short order and we would all be speaking german now.\n\n Keep this one in mind for a little bit.\n \n \nSo stop making excuses for France and acting like this is my opinion only. Because the opinion I'm stating here is the universal opinion of the WORLD regarding how quickly France gave up the ghost to Germany. Except the fact, that in that generation they called the French blatant cowards for allowing themselves to be forced to give aid and comfort to the enemy. \n\n You really haven't seen any of the other collaborator regimes, have you? Quisling may be the one common name, but don't you lecture a former Yugoslav on the subject of WWII collaboration.\n \n \n Fact: Over 125,000 Americans died on French & European soil from October 1917 until November 1918 - mostly fighting to free France from German invasion.\n \n Fact: On D-Day - June 6th, 1944 over 2500 Americans died on the beaches in Normandy, France - fighting to free France from German occupation.\n \n Fact: Over 400,000 Americans died fighting in World War 2, again in large part fighting to free France from German occupation.\n \n \"What do you expect from a culture and a nation that exerted more of its national will fighting against Disney World and Big Macs than against the Nazis?\" NOT MUCH! ---Dennis Miller\n\n And this was all done so... er... well, obviously out of the US goodwill and certainly not so the US wouldn't have to speak German, right? Or did you forget that slip up above already.\n \n \n The US, in both world wars, was an economic superpower safely an ocean away from its opponents. Had it not interfered, the other allies might have won the war. I'm damn grateful it has intervened, even if it certainly was in its best interests. But arrogantly calling everyone else cowards/weaklings when what they had faced was an entirely different matter from what the US had faced, I can't stand.\n \n Especially not if it's provoked simply by not blindly following the US in its blind rage over a terrorist attack killing thousands, especially since it led to wars killing hundreds of thousands.

   "1/4 Serbian, 3/4 Slovenian. Don't make too much out of it, though, you'd get me wrong. One humanity is my creed.\n \n It was a damn dirty war over here. If you want, I can explain in more detail. In short, collaboration was rife, all sides got as dirty as dirty gets, and the winners took horrible vengeance after the war (but not as horrible as the losers would like to make it seem). I lived through communism, the least extreme sort (I can expand on that topic, too, if anyone would like). I wish I were older, to know more of what it felt like, as I was still in primary school when we seceded.\n \n I'm not particularly fond of the French. And I used to bloody love the US, until they started acting like a pain maddened beast. They've done a lot of harm that way. I want the other USA back, the one that doesn't act solely on the principle of quid licet Iovi non licet bovi.\n \n As for WWII, the start of the war was all about the Germans beating everything in their way. Their modern army, well trained troops and novel tactics crushed everyone in their way. Losing to them was not particularly dishonourable - the bastards were simply better than anyone else. And with occupying troops, it's a lot harder to be defiant than those who had never been occupied might think. Try... try to understand \"a woman's look at war\". Not as a point to be made, but a threat to be avoided. \n \n The French certainly weren't a shining example of anything. They were the biggest target the Germans had conquered, remember. They were the closest to matching the Germans. But they relied on fixed emplacements that the Germans elegantly drove around. Their tactics weren't ready for what they were facing. Blitzkrieg worked in their case - their army was crushed quickly. And they certainly cooperated too easily.\n \n But the problem is, the accusations come from people who have won. They didn't win alone, and their victory was not as assured as it had seemed. The war was lost primarily (in my opinion) by the totally idiotic attack on Russia. It drained the Germans, and allowed everyone else to gang up. Otherwise, I'm certain Germany would have achieved separate peace with everyone, and you'd have the evil twin of the EU in place. THAT would have been a serious threat to everyone around - enough that noone that fought against them in WWII can claim he didn't fight for himself, too.\n \n Exiles and resistance? Of course they were there, and fought. From the French resistance to the poles to the Partizans in Yugoslavia. Trust me on this: the Partizans kept a sizeable amount of Germans occupied. 10 divisions, IIRC. But being in a resistance is not as simple as our valiant Archie thinks. There are wonderful stories I read as a child. And much more bitter ones later, as an adult.\n \n I damn well knew exactly why I dodged the army.

The important lessen that should have been learned from WW2, but I fear was lost on the Leftists, was that to fail to stand against a tyrant who is committed to a power grab and expanding his empire only leads to a larger war, rather than preventing one.\n \n Had the peace loving powers in Europe slapped Hitler down as soon as he started to ignore the Treaty and actually work against it, then WW2 might have been avoided altogether as Hitler may never have built up the War Machine which so intimidated France and England just a few years later.",
