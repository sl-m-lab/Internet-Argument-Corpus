   "I'm wondering what others here think about the future of the democrat party. I'm predicting some hefty fallout this November. Here is what I think:\n \n Senate: Democrats lose 8 seats\n House: Democrats lose 20 seats\n \n Not enough to take control but enough to put a serious dent in the majority. I also think there is definite potential for more loses in 2012, including at least one majority switch and loss of the White House.",
