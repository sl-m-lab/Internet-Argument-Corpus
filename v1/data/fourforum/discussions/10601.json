   "Most people don't think of E85 as being a high performance fuel, but it truly is. It has two characterists that are of interest to high performance car enthusiasts.\n 1. Octane levels of 105-106 This is equivalent to very expensive racing gas at a fraction of the cost. (E85 is currently available here in Detroit for $2.88/gallon. Racing gas is running <$10/gallon.). It has a lower natural propensity to detonate because of its high octane AND the folowing characteristic.\n 2. Ethanol cools dramatically when atomized. This cools the Air/fuel charge, which reduces the tendency to detonate even further. This property also allows the use of power adders such as turbos and superchargers to be run without expensive and complicated intercoolers, giving a higher density fuel/air charge into the cylinders (thereby making additional horsepower).\n \n Since the mixture is cooler, engine killing detonation at high boost becomes less of an issue, so more timing can be put into the ignition.\n \n Redacted info. emoticon_xgood",

We raced a twin turbo car running on C16 @$11/gallon last year. We also went through over 20 pounds of ice (for the twin intercoolers) per run. That car was expensive to drive on the street, too, because it still required racing fuel to run.\n With this one, it'll use more while racing and ~25% more than gas when cruising. At $3.00/gallon, I'd have to use almost 4X as much in order for it to have the same operating cost as the last one. Since it cools when atomized, there's no need for an intercooler or 3 bags of ice per run. And on the road, the estimated 25% increase in usage is no biggie. emoticon_xgood",

That's obviously not so in many forms of racing. \n \n I guess I was pondering what you planned to do on the intake side to compensate for the 25-50% more fuel, and therefore air, that you have to put through the engine to develop the same power.\n \n I take it that intake charge is not currently your limiting factor?\n \n Waxy",

With straight methanol, the injector hat can build a layer of frost. \n \n The motor is going in the black car. The red one is my summer daily driver.
