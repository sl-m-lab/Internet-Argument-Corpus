Accepting homosexual behavior as easy as apply pie is getting to be a fad in some ways--just like it's now acceptable to think of promiscuity and sex as ok among teenagers as long as protection is used. I'll say it again--the gay rights movement and sexual revolution are very much related, and if it had not been for the sexual revolution, the gay rights movement would not be going on, in my opinion.\n \n I don't think kids are any more \"aware\" than anyone else. The tendencies of society tend to get carried out to extremes in teenage culture; gay kids can sometimes be ostracized MORE in high school than anywhere else. But the other extreme is true as well that some kids are more accepting by forming 'alliances' and so forth and being quick to get involved in the fad of \"silence\" days, and so forth. If you think teenagers are so 'aware' and accepting, ask yourself if you'd rather be a gay adult or a gay teenager. My guess is that you'd just as soon not be a gay teenager again, even in today's culture.\n \n If someone tried to carry out a day of silence around me for the cause of the gay lobby, I'd make it a point to talk more that day than any other. Not because I hate gay people (which I certainly don't) but because the gay rights industry is a sham. I wonder how the kids who DON'T participate in these Days of Silence are made to feel, when they express their religious views by not taking part.

If it were, you could always at least try to bring them back to prejudice. It may be difficult to go back to those old ways, especially since the rest of society is changing as well. Why would we move towards including gay people, learning that gay people are not a threat, then go back to the opposite, back to ignorance and unreasoned prejudice? Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but I don't believe American society is like that. There are social trends or evolutions that happen that change things forever, which work against prejudice. Often young people are at the forefront. I believe this is one of those trends. \n \n \njust like it's now acceptable to think of promiscuity and sex as ok among teenagers as long as protection is used.\n\n \n You don't understand. You concern yourself with sex acts, but being gay is about more than that. However, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be acceptable for gay people to express their sexuality in some way at some point during a gay person's life cycle, and also to find sexual love and companionship of course. Teenage sex is another issue. I'd like to stick with acceptance of homosexuality itself. \n \n \nI'll say it again--the gay rights movement and sexual revolution are very much related, and if it had not been for the sexual revolution, the gay rights movement would not be going on, in my opinion.\n\n \n Yet there is no evidence to show the link. Homosexuality was looked down upon by those involved in the sexual revolution. In fact, many heterosexual women even looked down upon the sexual revolution, because they saw it as just being about what heterosexual men wanted. Even if we said for the sake of argument, that the sexual revolution did affect gay rights, that doesn't mean that the gay rights movement wouldn't have existed in a different form. It did exist before the sexual revolution. In fact, many young and old gay people involved in the movement today, are not stressing sexual freedom at all, other than being gay. We in the movement are talking about gay monogamy, and gay marriage, and non-promiscuity. These are pre-sexual revolution ideas, in everything, other than the fact that we are gay. The gay rights movement is not about promiscuity and doing anything you like sexually.",

This is why it persecuted anyone who outwardly expressed their Christianity. China does this as well. It's based on prejudice too. \n \n \nI don't expect you to learn from this,\n\n \n You have nothing to teach, but a tired, fading prejudice.\n \n \nNo, see, you are adding something to what I said when you say gay people are 'less.' The problem is that you insist on associating concerns about the morality of one's behavior to an sense of worth. Belief that gay romatic behavior is immoral is NOT a statement about the worth of gay people. It doesn't mean you are any \"less\" than anyone else. That's your movement trying to interject something to change the debate. And it's a lie.\n\n \n There is morality and immorality. Is immorality not less than morality? This immoral homosexuality you are talking about is a gay person's identity. \n \n \nIt certainly IS acceptable to have a religious moral view, even if it's about the behavior some people have. Get over it!! Stop trying to say what moral beliefs people can and can't have. Good grief, grow some skin.\n\n \n If their beliefs are based on the irrational, I will call them on it. Their beliefs are hurtful to gay people, by excluding gay people. And yes, telling gay people they can't express their difference, is excluding the gay person.",

   "Well, the fact that you refer to what is a genuine moral concern among most people as \"prejudice\" only shows me you don't understand the situation at all. The issue has never been gay people being a threat, but the rather about the issue of homosexual behavior and pride in society. This is not like social movements such as when black people began becoming more accepted--the issue for them was racism, not behavior (which is at the root of the homosexuality issue). But your movement has done an effective job of pulling the wool over people's eyes and pretending its about gay people instead of gay behavior by using words like \"prejudice\" as you've done here, in keeping with your movement's deceptive practices. \n \n I wouldn't put too much faith in the hands of teenagers these days for your movement--high schools are among the worst places for abuse toward gay people. That needs to change, BTW. But you need to keep it honest as you enact that change. And there needs to be acceptance--genuine acceptance--for opinions of people who feel that gay behavior is immoral as it is their right to feel that way. That means doing more than lip service for these religious teenagers when it's convenient, and not attacking them for their beliefs as soon as their backs are turned. \n \n \n \n But \"being gay\" has never really been the issue. It's not about the person. It's about homosexual behavior.\n\n \n \n Jyoshu, I'm an American black homosexual male and the oppression of gay people is similiar to the oppression in which blacks and others had to face. Today, gay folks are the most dispised group. The words, \"civil rights\" goes for any group of people who are oppressed in their country. We are not popular amongst most of the majority in America. Homosexuals in Africa are discriminated against and are attacked on the streets. They are also sometimes denied medicine by health clinics because of the majority \"biblical\" beliefs. Homosexuals face heterosexism- the belief that the heterosexual orientation is the only normal or \"moral\" orientation. Sexual orientation and same sex or opposite sex behavior are different. I'm celebate but homosexuality makes up a part of me. Christian fundalmentalists contribute to the attacks against homosexuals because they only speak out loudest when they want to convince others to discriminate against us. They rarely speak out against violent acts committed by the MAJORITY against gay and lesbian people.",
