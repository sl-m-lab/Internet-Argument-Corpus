   "I&#8217;m not sure why fans attacking each other make the sport itself violent. And I&#8217;m not sure why a sport being more violent than another sport is good as you seem to imply. Seems like you have some chip on your shoulder about American football. Soccer is a great sport and requires a lot of skill from each player. However even in soccer there are specialist as there are defensive players, offensive players, and goalies. I know all players can play different roles but some are better at some roles than others. In football, as in baseball, the players are more specialized even though all players can, and sometimes do, switch roles.\n \n I enjoy watching soccer but don&#8217;t get to see many here in the US because not many are shown. But I have never seen a game where hundreds of injuries occurred. Nor have I ever seen someone break their arm or leg in soccer although I don't doubt it happens. I have seen that happen in football because I have seen lots of football games. Players use protective equipment in football simply because the game is so violent. In soccer you don&#8217;t have 300 pound lineman running full speed into a 200 pound quarterback who is standing still with his body exposed while his arms are in the air. Without protective equipment in today&#8217;s football, there would be so many injures that teams would not last two weeks into the season. You don&#8217;t have that kind of equipment in soccer because you don&#8217;t have that kind of interaction between the players.\n \n It is correct that we call the football finals the Super Bowl and the baseball finals the World Series even though only American and Canadian teams play. But this is only because the games were created in the US and other countries have not taken up the sports to a large extent. There are no other competitive teams in other countries to compete with. Soccer is a great sport but a different sport from football that requires different athletic skills. Why the defensiveness about soccer?",

Soccer is missing the fast paced part of the equation although it is very strategic and somewhat unpredictable. I like watching soccer occassionally but to me it just seems too slow. In football every play lasts only a few seconds and every single player on the field is involved in the play. In soccer there are no fast paced sequences like this except corner kicks and even then not every person on the field is really all that involved in the play.

Have you heard of Steve McNair? Brett Favre? Many NFL players are some of the fastest and strongest athletes in the world. Padding is necessary because football is the game has WAY MORE power and WAY MORE speed. Equipment allows players to HIT HARDER. \n \n What need would a soccer player have for equipment? There's no tackling. There's no getting blindsided by a 350 lb behemoth whose job is to put you on the DL. \n \n What need does a rugby player have for equipment? Everyone is bunched up all the time. It's almost as if everyone is a lineman. By no coincidence, linemen are the least injured players in the NFL. There are no DBs and LBs accelerating from 20 yards or huge linemen to crush you.

It's called specialization. \"Michael Jordan can't play center. Basketball sucks.\" Football is war. You don't send out infantry to do every job. You need different units for different purposes. \n \n \nAll require multi-skilling\n \n \n It's hardly multi-skilling. It's the same skills applied in two different ways. It's not equivilent to being able to accurately throw 60 yards (QB) + run a 4.4 forty (RB,WR)+ have a 40 inch vertical (WR) + play coverage (DB) + run an offense (QB) + recognize a set (all defense) + kick a 50 yard field goal (K) + kick a 70 yard punt (P) + play on the line (OL,DL).\n \n \nand usually play for the entire game.\n \n \n I could hardly care less about a player's endurance. If I wanted to watch endurance, marathon running would be my favorite sport. Endurance is not entertaining. Besides, I think you'd have a hard time arguing at Ricky Williams running 45 times in a game doesn't require as much endurance as a goalie who makes only a handful of saves and makes a dozen endkicks.\n \n \nThen American Football's peak game is the SuperBowl which is only played between American teams.\n \n \n ...ok.

Does that mean I don't like American football fan? No, (Go Packers) but it does mean I don't respect it.\n\n \n So you define how much the fans care about the game as how out of control the fan is. The simple fact is that in America, fans attacking the players or other fans in any sport is simply not tolerated. Although a few fans have attacked individual players at times, the consequences are fairly severe. And in football, not many are willing to take on a 350 pound lineman that can bench press over 600 pounds even if they had the chance. I guarantee if the penalties were severe and sure enough, fans in other countries would not practice that kind of criminal activity.\n \n \n2. Now regarding the lack of Games on T.V.

But some are more intense than others. I coached my son in baseball. Now I am coaching my daughter in soccer and I play basketball. In basketball we don&#8217;t use any protective equipment and there is more physical contact than in soccer. I guess soccer players wear that protective equipment because they are afraid they might get a little kick in the shin.\n \n BTW how do you get hundreds of injuries in a game when there are only 22 players?\n \n \n3.

But I&#8217;m not clear on why being proud you&#8217;re a soccer player makes you defensive.

Some Football players ARE fat. Someone said here that they are like a fridge! That's being fat. Not well built. For example, Shaq, was first believed to be just a huge guy with no athletic abilities. However, even though the guy IS huge, he has some athletic abilities. His leg movements are extremely fast. I mean, he's not really an athlete like Kobe Bryant for example... but he atleast is more athletic than other big players like him (that's why he's better).\n \n Are Football players like Shaq, or just fat? To me, from what I've seen, they don't look like athletes. They're just fat.

(I played in a position similar in some respects to a blocker in your fave code... My role was to be a large dumb hurting tackler/attacker.) (there are too many dissimilarities to make this an adequate analogy, only that in relation to the rest of the team, a 'loose-head prop forward' or a 'tight-head prop forward' are the biggest, dumbest ones on the field; I even almost lost my left ear once from a clash of heads with an opposing player; it was almost torn off).*\n \n Anyway, having experienced Union, I actually prefer Rugby League.

   "Interesting thread.\n \n I have to admit, I know very little about soccer. What I do know is that it is consistently rated as the #1 most demanding sport to play in terms of conditioning. Soccer players are in great shape, that's undeniable. I also think they're great athletes. It requires stamina and coordination, no doubt.\n \n I know A LOT about American Football. To anyone who doubts the athleticism of lineman in the NFL, 1 minute with one of them in person would change your mind. We're talking about men that weigh 300lbs plus, can lift small houses, and can run faster than vast majority of \"normal\" people, even athletes. I honestly believe that if you spent 1/2hr with one fo these men, they'd blow your mind with their physical abilities. It's a lot easier to run for 5 minutes than it is to wrestle with someone for 1 or 2 minutes. Try it out for yourself. \n \n Even the non-lineman, we're talking the biggest, fastest, strongest men in the US, colliding with each other at full speed. Pads or not, IT HURTS. 40 seconds between plays to recover is nothing.\n \n The rest comes down to personal preference for a game style. I like the calculated strategy of the NFL, being carried out by some of the most gifted athletes in the world. I don't care much for soccer, I find it really dull. To me, an uneducated observer, it looks like a lot of guys running around aimlessly on a field. \n \n When it comes to sheer toughness, there's no comparison. I can't even believe the first post in this thread would suggest that. Put an NFL team on the field vs Real Madrid. In any kind of a physical one on one battle, it won't even be close. Soccer is a NON CONTACT sport. \n \n If you want tough, and VERY fast paced, try lacrosse.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. The whole argument about the fans is just absurd.",

I've taken 80mph slapshots, 80mph lacrosse balls, and hot grounders in the crotch, no doubt it hurt. Of course, I was smart enough to wear a cup. ;) \n \n I have felt the pain of \"football in the groin\" during tackles/scrums and even during games in the park. No doubt it hurts like a motherfool, but I haven't ever required an ambulance, nor have I ever seen anyone require an ambulance. \n \n Also, if that's the worst inury soccer has to offer, that's pretty tame, not to mention, EASILY preventable.\n \n Waxy",

   "A tackle from the rear that ended in a player landing on his head with accompanying numbness of the extremities. It was SCARY.\n\n \n That is scary, I've seen similar things a few times during my playing days, in hockey, football, and lacrosse. Thankfully, I've never seen anyone suffer any permanent damage. (Knock on wood)\n \n My point would be this - yes it can happen, it can happen walking down the street too. What would be the frequency of serious injuries in American football vs soccer? I'd bet everything I own that the frequency and severity of injuries is more than double in football than soccer.\n \n Not that that really proves anything.\n \n Waxy",

   "I'd bet everything I own that the frequency and severity of injuries is more than double in football than soccer.\n \n Not that that really proves anything.\n \n Waxy\n\n Just that football not only requires the players to hit hard, but harder because of the pads.\n I played against a player in high school that went on the pros (Billy Simms) and he was hard to take down (leg strength alone was enough - not to mention upper body). It took a very hard tackle to do it, which rendered me unconscious for awhile. But, it was not that I wasn't hitting him hard the first few plays - I just wasn't hitting hard enough. He walked away with a broken nose, I was helped off the field.\n The next year a player on our team died on the field of a broken neck doing the exact thing I did.\n Football is a dangerous sport, \"...like being in a bad car wreck,\" says Emmit Smith.",
