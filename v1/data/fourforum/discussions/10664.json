   "A big to-do has been going on recently on this site about atheism and morality. I'd like to pose some questions for anybody who ascribes to the view that atheists must be immoral or that God is necessary for morality.\n \n 1. Atheists don't rely on \"godly\" arguments to come up with their moral standards, yet most of them come up with identical or nearly identical sets. If morals are impossible without the Christian God's help, how can this be?\n \n 2. Christians don't follow the Bible's morality anyway. The Bible says that it's fine to own and beat slaves, that it's fine to sell your daughter into slavery, that it's fine-- nay, required to murder a person for blasphemy and for cursing a parent, etc. Instead, Christians pick and choose their morals from the Bible, accepting some and rejecting most. If God's word is the basis for their morality, (a) why do Christians have to pick and choose, and (b) why do Christians tend to select identical or nearly identical sets? This suggests that there's actually some other standard being used. (c) Why does \"Christian morality\" change with the times? For example, 18th century Christians saw no problem with slavery. I'm betting most Christians reading this do, although one never really knows...\n \n 3. Atheists have morals based on their reasoning and experience. Atheists understand that murder is wrong without having to rely on an outside, authoritative source. Christians have to be told that murder is wrong in order to believe that murder is wrong. Which of these groups seems more morally advanced?\n \n And my personal favorite:\n 4. From where does God get His morals?\n A. If God makes up His morals, and if God says it's okay to torture your slaves, to rape virgins kept from your pillaging, and to murder blasphemers, then it must be true. But this problem is not limited to just examples we find in the Bible (although its tellingly hard to find examples of terrible morals that aren't endorsed by God somewhere in the Bible). If God said that it was immoral to not rape little girls, then that would mean that it really is immoral not to rape little girls. Does that mean that Christians would rape little girls and feel no guilt?\n B. If God doesn't just make up His morals, then He gets them from somewhere else. If this is the case, then God isn't the ultimate authority on morals, is He? It would mean that God is not the source of morality, and morality exists independently of God.\n \n 5. If God told you to murder me, would you do it? Would it be moral?",

You would do anything your god told you to, including killing someone, yet \"doubt\" your god ever would (despite the fact he told Abraham, and numerous other Israelites). But what happens when you have a vision of your god telling you to go kill your neighbor?\n \n Apparently, you would trip off in good conscience and bump them off! emoticon_wow\n \n It's Steven Weinberg all over again: without religion, you can have good people doing good things, and bad people doing bad things. To have good people doing bad things, it takes religion.\n \n If the only thing preventing a good person doing a bad thing is their fear (or just as bad, love) of god, then I don't want to live anywhere near that person, because of what might happen if fear and love turned into disbelief, or if god decided, according to them, to command something unspeakable. A morality based on obedience to a god allows the moralist to do the unspeakable, so long as it is commanded by god.\n \n I don't think you can develop a healthy morality based on that alone, and I don't think most religious moralities are, in fact, based on their god.",

   "Is it good only because God says so (the Divine Command Theory leading to impious results thus should not be accepted) or is it that there is a standard of right and wrong that is independent of God's will? Good point, electrolyte.\n \n Thing is, in such questions what you usually get as an answer is that God has a purpose for creating all that he is supposed to have created. And religious people are so enthusiastic thinking that by saying that they prove that His commands are not arbitrary.\n \n Aristotle, a long time before Jesus or any other prophet came in the scene, said that everything in nature has a purpose. For him the whole world was an orderly, rational system and he came to this conclusion through observation of the natural world, leaving God out. To give an example, rain for Aristotle was there in order to make plants grow. \n \n Religious thinkers put God in Aristotle's image. Rain falls in order to make plants grow because this is what God's intention was.\n \n So, why did God create the world in the first place?\n I still haven't got a clear, logical answer to that one, have you?\n \n Our difference with religious people is that to questions such as 'Why truthfulness is a good thing?' we have a better answer than just 'Because God said so'.\n\n actually, its a bit beyond this. biblical morality is actually based on what the political authority in israel deemed it to be at the time, based on his own discretion or lack of it. this is why there are so many conflicting ideas of morality in the bible. for example, if god blessed people for being truthful, why did he bless jacob. if god blessed people for being obedient, why did he bless jonah. how could god send bears to maul and kill people just because elisha got his feelings hurt when they called him bald-head? is there really a correlation between following the ten commandments and being blessed by god? if you examine the bible, you'll find that the opposite situation actually occurs more often\n \n so what exactly is the moral code of the bible? how could these poltical heads and leaders of israel be right, even when they contradicted the commandments? how could they justify the instances when they decided to do the exact opposite of what was commanded? because they could SAY that god told them to do so. and since they were the authority at the time, they could authorize that the record reflect this, and noone would dare argue that it wasnt so, for obvious reasons",

You need to learn how to read it from the perspective of the actual story teller in the book you are reading from. You see, with the examples you gave we should learn that all of the men in the bible that God used were flawed and quite normal in their fears and frailties. But God used them anyway. \n \n Even King David who's lineage Messiah came through was an adulterer who sent the husband of his mistress to die needlessly on the front lines just so David could have his wife. And Moses whom God used to free the Jews from Egyptian bondage wasn't allowed to enter the promised land because he broke the Ten Commandments that God Himself carved for him out of anger.\n \n So every man and woman God used in the bible was seriously flawed to various degrees. This doesn't imply in any way that these flawed men determined the National morality of Israel for their generations in any way. The very implication is ludicrous. Now the Kings of Israel did set the moral and religious standard for the Nation when they ruled. And if you study the lives and histories of the good and bad kings of Israel you will find that God blessed her when good Kings ruled and He punished her when evil Kings ruled. So even when evil Kings ruled and forgot about the God of Israel, even they didn't get away with setting or determining the moral standard for the Country indefinitely.\n \n Another thing to consider is that no matter how far from God the Nation of Israel drifted, He always had a remnant who remained faithful to His principles and standards of righteousness. \n \n \n Gen 45:7 \"God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.\n \n 2Ki 19:30 'The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.\n \n 2Ki 19:31 'For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD will perform this.\n \n Ezr 9:8 \"But now for a brief moment grace has been {shown} from the LORD our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage.\n \n Neh 1:3 They said to me, \"The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.\"\n \n Isa 10:20 Now in that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.\n \n Isa 10:21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.\n \n And these are just a few examples to make my point. Noah was also a remnant of humanity that God preserved so all of human life wouldn't be lost in the Great Flood. God has always preserved a remnant in order to preserve His Glory and Righteousness in a spiritually dark World.",

I'd like to pose some questions for anybody who ascribes to the view that atheists must be immoral or that God is necessary for morality.\n \n 1. Atheists don't rely on \"godly\" arguments to come up with their moral standards, yet most of them come up with identical or nearly identical sets. If morals are impossible without the Christian God's help, how can this be?\n \n 2. Christians don't follow the Bible's morality anyway. The Bible says that it's fine to own and beat slaves, that it's fine to sell your daughter into slavery, that it's fine-- nay, required to murder a person for blasphemy and for cursing a parent, etc. Instead, Christians pick and choose their morals from the Bible, accepting some and rejecting most. If God's word is the basis for their morality, (a) why do Christians have to pick and choose, and (b) why do Christians tend to select identical or nearly identical sets? This suggests that there's actually some other standard being used. (c) Why does \"Christian morality\" change with the times? For example, 18th century Christians saw no problem with slavery. I'm betting most Christians reading this do, although one never really knows...\n \n 3. Atheists have morals based on their reasoning and experience.

If God said that it was immoral to not rape little girls, then that would mean that it really is immoral not to rape little girls. Does that mean that Christians would rape little girls and feel no guilt?\n B. If God doesn't just make up His morals, then He gets them from somewhere else. If this is the case, then God isn't the ultimate authority on morals, is He? It would mean that God is not the source of morality, and morality exists independently of God.\n \n 5.

   "Another opinion", 
   "The subject of this thread has relevance since the Religious Right seems to claim some exclusivity to morality and campaigns on that. They also often end up dominating discussions on morality, which is a pity. Because of their very narrow definition of morality, the term itself seems to have acquired a negative connotation with many people - thus limiting who participates in discussions of morality. This allows the Religious Right to attach that term almost exclusively to their own views and have far too much influence in certain social agendas. \n \n Nearly all people follow various codes of morality - even most criminals have certain codes of honor that they follow. Heck, even many higher order animal groups (chimps, etc.) have both learned and instinctual basic social codes of conduct. The question that comes up is: which one is \"right\"? Many religions claim that only theirs is right and, a lot of the time, the only answer that they can give is unprovable claims that :1) There is an omnipotent, all-knowing, benevolent God that passed on a metaphysically perfect version of morality.\n 2) This hypothetically perfect morality was clearly passed on to mankind, who interpreted it correctly.\n 3) This hypothetically perfect morality that was hypothetically correctly passed on to mankind has been unaltered by the passage of time and the politics and local morality of the ages that it passed through.These are huge and entirely unproven claims that, frankly, most of us just don't buy into. It is only a small minority of people (usually ranging in the polls on most relevant issues in the ~20% region) that follow various Christian rules strictly. Judging from answers to polls, most people who consider themselves religious stray from official dogma in a wide range of areas because they think for themselves. I suspect that the main reason that the large group of moderate religious believers are not as outspoken is that they feel uncomfortable denying the validity of parts of the Bible - a text that they also claim to honor. They forget that the Religious Right ALSO picks and chooses their moral stance by selectively quoting the Bible and conveniently ignores certain embarrassing areas of the Bible which seem to condone slavery, certainly condone stoning for adultery, etc.\n \n I, along with many if not most others, claim that there is no \"right\" morality or ethics but that there are trends based on human nature and psychology. For example, most human groups (religious or otherwise) have developed codes against murder, theft, and similar trends. Morality can also follow certain logical rules - as with the philosopher Kant's categorical imperitive: \"Act only on the maxim through which you can at the same time will become a universal law\" - meaning that we should only do those things we could rationally allow everyone else to do at the same time. For example, you cannot say that it is fine for you to not pay taxes since, if you morally allowed that nobody has to pay taxes, then our country (and thus all of us) would soon be in very desperate states.\n \n I am essentially an agnostic - though I would like to believe that there is a God, I find no evidence for His existence so I cannot claim faith in God with any confidence whatsoever. My own non-religious moral code tries to follow the basic principle of trying to treat others as I would expect to be treated (which ends up following fairly closely to Kant's formulism), as well as occasionally going out of my way to help or advocate for others based purely on empathy. \n \n Lastly, I personally have much more respect for people who try to treat others well out of principle than for people who try to treat others well because they fear Godly or other punishment. It is the difference between the morality of a child who obeys his parents blindly, and the morality of an adult who thinks through his/her actions.",

If morals are impossible without the Christian God's help, how can this be?\n\n I don't disagree that you can have morals. Just don't imagine them to be objective (i.e. portable) morals. They are your own, they will die with you.\n \n If you suggest, therefore that something is evil or \"wrong\" - it's perfectly okay for the person sitting next to you and disagree - saying what you think is wrong - is perfectly fine - \n \n That's because - that person's morals are no more objective or portable than your own.\n \n That being said, you have no objective basis to declare anything right, wrong or indifferent in any objective sense, and should expect no agreement whatsoever in a controversy.\n \n Of course, if you find agreement with another, consider it seredipitous, but again not objective or portable.\n \n \n\n 2.

That you fail to understand it is simple ignorance. \n \n Some of the rules were for government. Some were to preserve the Hebrew bloodline, some were to preserve the transmission of Scripture, some were to help each other get along. Some were.....fill in the blank here.... were to put fear in the heart of Israel's enemies....\n \n \n \n\n 3. Atheists have morals based on their reasoning and experience. Atheists understand that murder is wrong without having to rely on an outside, authoritative source. Christians have to be told that murder is wrong in order to believe that murder is wrong. Which of these groups seems more morally advanced?\n\n Joseph Stalin was an atheist. He killed lots of people and didn't call it murder. \n \n It's not whether someone has to be told that murder is wrong, it's that there's no objective agreement on the meaning of life - therefore murder is likewise a subjective issue.\n \n Is abortion murder? Some atheists say yes, some don't. It's not fundamentally whether a human life is being killed (doctors won't disagree with this) but on the value or potential of the life, etc. \n \n You say you know what murder is. But if you cannot say what human life is, and what it isn't, you have no objective standard for defining murder.\n \n \n \n\n And my personal favorite:\n 4. From where does God get His morals?\n\n Superfluous statement. Where did Hussein, Stalin or Hitler get their morals? They were soveriegn rulers, and answered to nobody - in their minds. Whether we think them murderous is immaterial - they didn't think so - and they were the highest law in the land.\n \n Highest law in the land calls the shots. Those who don't like it can leave, or find another land to live in. In our case, Universe #2, because we live in Universe #1, and God is boss.\n \n \n\n A.

Would it be moral? \n\n \n If I murdered you, can you objectively tell me that it's \"wrong\"? \n \n Here's some fun: Bang! I just shot you. You don't believe that God is real, and have no clue whether I do either (since over 90% of the people on the earth don't believe in God) - And now while you're bleeding on the floor - you look up me, knowing that there's no God (whether I think there's one or not, is immaterial, you believe that there isn't, so cannot appeal to God's morality)\n \n So, from your point of view, on the ground, bleeding, try to convince me that what I just did to you was wrong. Make a case quickly, because you're bleeding out....time is short....\n \n Shooting you was wrong because......???",

   "the Bible's morality is objective - both of us can read it and it will say the same thing - even in different languages.\n\n It contradicts itself even in the same language.\n \n \nSome of the rules were for government. Some were to preserve the Hebrew bloodline, some were to preserve the transmission of Scripture, some were to help each other get along. Some were.....fill in the blank here.... were to put fear in the heart of Israel's enemies....\n\n So this book that everyone holds up as the ultimate explanation of morals actually had a different purpose? So we shan't spill our seed on the ground in favor of in the belly of a whore because doing so will preserve Hebrew bloodlines? Does this moral code apply to only Hebrews?\n \n \nJoseph Stalin was an atheist. He killed lots of people and didn't call it murder.\n\n And Hitler was a Roman Catholic and didn't call the Holocaust murder. One issue here is not whether these people were whatever religion, the issue is whether their religion caused or justified their actions. A second issue is that there mere existence any atheists who express good moral standing refute the assertion that atheists can't be or aren't moral.\n \n \nIt's not whether someone has to be told that murder is wrong, it's that there's no objective agreement on the meaning of life - therefore murder is likewise a subjective issue.\n\n The latter is an intriguing observation worthy of discussion. But I think the former is completely applicable.\n \n \nYou say you know what murder is. But if you cannot say what human life is, and what it isn't, you have no objective standard for defining murder.\n\n If I define murder as the killing of a borne human, then I certainly can say what murder is.\n \n \nSuperfluous statement. Where did Hussein, Stalin or Hitler get their morals? They were soveriegn rulers, and answered to nobody - in their minds. Whether we think them murderous is immaterial - they didn't think so - and they were the highest law in the land.\n\n Ah, so you recognize the fallacy of simply fabricating morals out of nothing. Now apply this problem to your own beliefs.\n \n \nget real. This is all baloney. Talk about unreasonable rants...\n\n So you recognize the problem, but then instead of addressing the dilemma that it poses for you, you tell me to f*** off when I ask you to apply it to your beliefs. Imagine my shock.\n \n \nUltimate authority - uuuh - see above.\n\n Yes, see above regarding the problem of declaring absolute morals on whims. \n \n \nWe can lie. God cannot. Not that he is unwiling, but unable.\n\n Now you are lying, unless the Bible is. The Bible has numerous cases of God being purposely untruthful. Would you like to see them, or will you just run away?\n \n \nIf I murdered you, can you objectively tell me that it's \"wrong\"? \n\n Whether I can tell you is not the question. In fact, you didn't answer the question at all. Why not?\n \n \n(since over 90% of the people on the earth don't believe in God)\n\n What a load. Well over half of the world's population believes in the Judeo-Christian God. Turn off your persecution complex.\n \n \nHere's some fun: Bang! I just shot you. You don't believe that God is real, and have no clue whether I do either (since over 90% of the people on the earth don't believe in God) - And now while you're bleeding on the floor - you look up me, knowing that there's no God (whether I think there's one or not, is immaterial, you believe that there isn't, so cannot appeal to God's morality)\n \n So, from your point of view, on the ground, bleeding, try to convince me that what I just did to you was wrong. Make a case quickly, because you're bleeding out....time is short....\n \n Shooting you was wrong because......???\n\n I can't help you if you're a heartless XXX. If you murdered me because you think you have a reason, i.e. you think God told you to, then I can try to show you that there is no possible logical reason that God can have a justifiable final say on morality. Of course, if you won't listen, and if you listen to my points only to hand-wave them away without addressing them... Well, you can remain a heartless XXX.",
