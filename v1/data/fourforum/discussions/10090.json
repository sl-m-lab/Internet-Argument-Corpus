   "By BONNIE ERBE\n \n First comes love, then comes marriage -- but these two things are no longer inextricably linked to nor necessarily followed by \"the baby carriage.\"\n \n A new poll by the Pew Research Center finds that Americans are de-linking children as the sine qua non of successful marriages. In fact, they now tell pollsters they rate \"having children\" as the ninth most important out of 10 markers of successful marriages.\n \n Higher on the list are such factors as \"healthy sexual relationships ... faithfulness ... household chore-sharing, economic factors such as adequate income and good housing, common religious beliefs, and shared tastes and interests,\" according to The Washington Post.\n \n For more Americans the purpose of marriage isn't raising children, but rather finding \"mutual happiness and fulfillment.\" This is a big difference from 1990, when 65 percent of those surveyed told Pew pollsters that children are \"very important\" to successful marriages. Today, just 41 percent agree with that statement.\n \n http://www.capitolhillblue.com/cont/node/2845",
