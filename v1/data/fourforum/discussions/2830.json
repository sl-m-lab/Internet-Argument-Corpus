Man was not suppose to spend months at sea. Man was not designed to live in Space. Heck, I can do this for days. Much of what we do today that is accepted is not natural.

A variation on the pseudo-heterosexuality argument, this argument postulates that lower ranked males are deprived of the opportunity to mate and therefore turn to other males for sexual satisfaction. \n \n The problem with this argument is that in many species in which harem-guarding occurs, there is no difference between higher ranking males and lower ranking ones as to the frequency of their homosexual mountings. This has been demonstrated in musk oxen, American bison, and New Zealand sea lions among others. \n \n Among female homosexual pairs of Japanese macaques and Hanuman langurs engaging in homosexual behaviors, males approaching the pair may be threatened or even attacked. \n \n When homosexual bonding does occur in the absence of opposite sex pairs, members of such a pair often resist attempts to 'convert' them back into heterosexual relationships. Even when deprived of their bonded partner, white-fronted Amazon parrots will not revert, and long-eared hedgehogs have refused heterosexual partners for as long as two and a half years, much of their natural lifetime. In the case of Stellar's sea eagles and female barn owls, both housed without opposite sexed members of their species, homosexual pair bonds among females were strong enough that when inseminated, they coparented the chicks that resulted. \n \n Homosexual bonds can be tight. Among male rhesus macaques, crab-eating macaques, bottlenosed dolphins, cheetahs and black-headed gulls with homosexual bonded partners, the members of the pair exhibited considerable distress at being separated from their partners. In all cases, the individuals ignored opposite sex partners offered them, and showed considerable joy and exhuberance at the reintroduction of their partners.\n \n http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm\n \n http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html",

   "The \"deprived of heterosexuality\" argument. A variation on the pseudo-heterosexuality argument, this argument postulates that lower ranked males are deprived of the opportunity to mate and therefore turn to other males for sexual satisfaction. \n \n The problem with this argument is that in many species in which harem-guarding occurs, there is no difference between higher ranking males and lower ranking ones as to the frequency of their homosexual mountings. This has been demonstrated in musk oxen, American bison, and New Zealand sea lions among others. \n \n Among female homosexual pairs of Japanese macaques and Hanuman langurs engaging in homosexual behaviors, males approaching the pair may be threatened or even attacked. \n \n When homosexual bonding does occur in the absence of opposite sex pairs, members of such a pair often resist attempts to 'convert' them back into heterosexual relationships. Even when deprived of their bonded partner, white-fronted Amazon parrots will not revert, and long-eared hedgehogs have refused heterosexual partners for as long as two and a half years, much of their natural lifetime. In the case of Stellar's sea eagles and female barn owls, both housed without opposite sexed members of their species, homosexual pair bonds among females were strong enough that when inseminated, they coparented the chicks that resulted. \n \n Homosexual bonds can be tight. Among male rhesus macaques, crab-eating macaques, bottlenosed dolphins, cheetahs and black-headed gulls with homosexual bonded partners, the members of the pair exhibited considerable distress at being separated from their partners. In all cases, the individuals ignored opposite sex partners offered them, and showed considerable joy and exhuberance at the reintroduction of their partners.\n \n http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm\n \n http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html\n\n \n You're first link was an esay by an unqualified blogger making inference on abook that makes inference on data. One blogger's inference on another person's inferences is hardly proof.\n \n Also your second link shows that animals are not monolithic. If that is true than everything science says about animals is fales and then they can't rely on any other scientific data.\n \n Animals are considered monolithic. If they stray from that they have a disorder. They're DNA is so similar that it is usually impossible to identify siblings individually.",

We also know that muder, like many other \"crimes\" were not considered crimes in the past, that morality has changed with each culture and which each passing era. So in essence, what is wrong is relative according to the timeline. Also, let's consider the religious point. Thou shall not kill is the typical cliche, but it is mentioned that a adulterous woman should be stoned to death, a form of murder, and that God destroyed and killed (murder again) virtually all of his creations, as well as dubiously two cities full of people. So on one hand, muder is wrong, but on the other hand, murder is justified in Christanity's eyes and even Godsend. \n \n That doesn't mean that the other option, that someone decided it was wrong, is in fact the correct notion, but it does seem so.",

   "Another sorry attempt by mana'ia to prove anything....sign, it shouldn't take too long to disprove this attempt at a half baked argument. First off not all human bodies have the same tolerance.\n \n Duo I feel sorry for you. You're arguments even though for youre comprehension seem logical are not and I'm about to show you how. You proved that you had no credibility to begin with.\n \n \n \n \nNo human is able to withstain the pressures at 30,000 feet above nor the pressure at 30,000 below. Therefore, it is not natural to live or even be at either. \n \n No one lives are travels to 30,000 ft below sea level. Also we can wihtstaion the pressure at 30,000 ft above sea level. It's the lack of oxygen that makes it impractical to remain. We pressurise planes becasue the jet travel; is too fast for most people to adjust. That is why jet pilots only have helmets.\n \n \n \nBut there is no one who can withstain the pressures of unprotected jet stream travel, nor deep sea habitation. \n \n The travel of in the jet stream is only for efficient purposes. We can travel at any altitude but it becomes efficient to travel at higher. Being efficient is what is natural not the need to protect us from the elements. No one deep sea travels except submariens but they only travel so far. submariens are for military puposes only. So that really isn't relevant wht the military does. Tehy do unnatural things to gain advantage over enemies who aren't quite as adapted.\n \n \n \nIf it was natural for us to live there, why aren't we found in similar instances? Aka, sheer rock towers rising from the ground, oh wait, there isn't, nor are we given the genetic ability to climb these without unnatural adaptations. \n \n Poeple live in the moutnians that are much higher in elevation than any skyscrapers. You made the argument about anatomy but then attack the idea of technology. Why would you confuse the two arguments? The technology of the buildings allows us to genetically climb them without any help. \n \n \n \n \nIrrelevant. Explain how that is equilvant to 30,000 feet. \n \n You brought up the argument of living in scky scrapers and now you mix up the argument of living in 30,000 feet. No one lives at 30,000 feet. They only travel with it.\n \n \n \nBut we are not designed to live in skyscrappers. We were not given the ability to climb similar structures, nor were we given the ability to sustain oursleves in similar conditions, nor were we given the ability to rapidly change altitudes without problems. All of that is unnatural, yet it is common. This is the first of your three utter failures at proving anything. \n \n You're miuxing up arguments with anatomy and technology. There is a natural need to travel. Anatomically we can travel at almost any altitude. The only thing that limits are ability is the level of oxygen. The rapid change is due to efficiency but we could travel at 30,000 feet provided with oxygen if we didn't make an ascent too fast. \n \n You're argument that we have to ahve the anatomical ability to do anything to be natural is not relevant. Many animal species do things that they were not anatomically created to do but it is more efficient.\n \n \n \nTherefore it is unnatural. \n \n No you think it is but you criteria is based on anatomy which excludes homosexuality.\n \n \n \nJust like we are given the intelligence to explore our bodies in unorthodox ways. How do you like them apples? I can use that argument aganist you just in a far more nerve striking way. Using that logic, you can say anything is natural because we have the ability to do so. Is genetic engineering natural because we have the intelligence to do it? You just opened a huge can of worms that I won't let to put back into the can. Human cloning is therefore natural under your logic as well as everything else we can do or even imagine. People have the intelligence and technology to kidnap and rape little children, is that natural? It would be best of you to stop using that point, it will only burn you in the end. This is your number 2 failure, prepare for #3. \n \n First off I didn't open a can of worms for you. You opened another can that i never did. I asserted that the need was enhanced by our intelligence and technology. Having the intelligence to do something doesn't create the need which is the argument you're making. So you need to assess the arguments before you start arguing with yourself.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI love how you just gave me a tactical nuclear weapon to use aganist your pea shooter, it is almost makes me feel sorry for you...almost. Under your logic, killing people, boiling their bodies down into the paste, then pressurzing in into a highly efficent fuel to keep us warm is therefore natural because we are using other's to adapt and help us survive. HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES? If I were you, i'd quickly withdraw the intelligence point before I start the real pounding. \n \n Well since you are killing yoursellf in teh process then hey I love them apples. First off you are mixing up the moral and technological terms and mixing them into one argument which is not what we are arguing so you're just arguing with yourself.\n \n \n \n \nOur body anatomically was not designed for anal sex, but it does not make it unnatural to do it. I can't believe you just gave me that to use aganist you. \n \n yes our body was not made for anal sex and there is nothing technological that I am aware that makes it safer except lubrication whihc minimizes damages but doesn't prevent it.\n \n \n \nThen it is natural to transport ourselves using human slaves pulling a chariot.\n \n Again mixing up two separate terms. Tehnology of chariots yes natural. Slavery is immoral and considered not natural. You can't combine two arguments. \n \n \n \nBut you just said that while we are not designed for it, it does not make it unnatural. \n \n The technological adanves that allow up to accomodate our needs does not make it unnatural.\n \n \n \nReplace airplane travel with anal, fisting, or other common gay practices. \n \n You have failed more then 3 times, as well as giving me numerous weapons I wasn't going to use against you. I'd LOVE to see you come back from this.\n\n There is no need to stick somthing up our A$$. If it was it would be very common which it is not. Everyone doesn't engage in those activities because there is no need.\n Also the health risks of ariplane travel compared to anal sex, fisting and everything else is even comparable.

   "The basic fact that homosexuality exists and has always existed should certainly be enough. Period.\n \n Those who are left handed exist, but we don't pass laws against them. Those who have blue eyes exist, yet we do not pass laws against them.\n \n Yes, in the history of this country there have been laws against things which are different or foreign. Many of those laws have either been repealed or repaired. \n \n The title of this subject on his forum is \"GAY RIGHTS.\" It's not meant to be a discussion on whether or not being gay is natural. It's not meant to be a discussion of whether or not acting on sexual orientation is natural. \n It is simply because it exists. \n \n All I've read here from those who are attempting to prove or convince others that being gay is in anyway unnatural are simply xenophobes who are terrified of anything or anyone who is in anyway different than they are. \n Too bad. \n Get over it.\n I don't give one iota if anyone tollerates homosexuality, that's really a matter of personal likes or dislikes. But the fact that homosexuals exist, they lead normal, healthy lives, they contribute to society and (get ready to hold yourselves down on this) THEY DO PROCREATE. \n So what if some have gone outside their sexual orientation to do so? So what if they have gained access to outside technology to do so? They are indeed, doing their evolutionary job in reproducing and therefore continuing the species. \n You could wave the most honnest, caring, compassionate, handsome, wealthy, giving, brilliant, well read, interesting, fun loving, funny, strong, forgiving, helpfull man in front of me. It's not gonig to change the fact that I will have absolutely ZERO attraction or inclination to have sex with this person. I am not oriented to copulate with a man. \n The ONLY reason I have a child at all is because of SOCIETAL presures. \n I was truly convinced that living as a heterosexual would in some way change my orientation. I believed that if I dated, married and reproduced with a man I would somehow be \"Cured\" of my NATURAL desire to be with a woman. \n How wrong I was.\n Granted, my sexual orientation had nothing to do with the demise of my legal marriage. But fate interceded and rescused me from a marriage of brutality and infidelity. \n \n I took a very long time to accept who and what I am. What I have always known I was. All those years of television, mass media, peer presure, societal presures, community presures had all played their role in my missery. I had always thought I was strange or different my whole life. \n I had to go through pure hell to find my happiness, my comfort level and my own piece of heaven on earth. \n Once I was able to accept that I was, and have always been gay, then and ONLY then did I make any form of conscious choise. That choice was to live honnestly. To stop accepting the lies that were being fed to me. To stop hoping to become part of any \"in\" group. I had to learn to live for what made me happy. What brought me peace, and what would be the best example of honnesty for my child. \n Self loathing and hatred is descructive and dangerous. Projecting that on my child would be inexcusable. \n My finding myself was the equivalent of being raised with a parent who died my hair and put face paint on me and told me my entire childhood I was something of which I was not and could never be no matter how much paint was applied. \n \n All I am able to do is to argue on behalf of my own experiences. To me and my family, that is natural. I have no regrets or anger towards anyone. I am grateful I was blessed to have a wonderful, accepting and support structure of friends and family around me. \n \n Now for the funny part: when I did finally \"come out\" and the ripe age of 29, my parents actually said; \"Duh, what took you so long to realize this? We always knew...but we couldn't force you to accept it. That was for you to do.\"",

   "Of course it's natural. And humans are animals. \n \n Fear and hatred of homosexuality is by in large a learned behavior. Naturally, my guess is that it would be a mixed bag. Some would participate in homosexual behavior, some might not. And it might vary over time. Some might also be \"opposed\" to it in some fashion, while others encourage it. Either way, it doesn't matter.

   "Then you would have to say hetero oral sex or using a condom or the birth control pill or masturbation is not using the organs for what they were designed for.\n\n This is my fave homophobe argument. Apparently, according to them, all our organs were designed with a single function, and doing anything else with them is \"unnatural\". So, your fingers are made to hold and grab things, and your nose is made to smell and breathe (oops, already two functions!), so picking your nose is \"unnatural\". I guess this makes the liver a profoundly unnatural organ, as it performs about 500 functions in the body. \n \n What all parts of our bodies are \"designed\" for, and whether there was a \"design\" at all, cannot be known by any human, as we did not do the designing, nor do we have the blueprints. All we have to know are whether certain actions are dangerous for our health. We choose to do many things, in varying degrees of moderation, that we in fact know are bad for our health (smoking, drinking, sleep-deprivation, etc.). \n \n Are homophobes really that concerned about global health? Will they start flooding boards with messages about how \"despite how satisfying it is to clean one's ear canal with a q-tip, doctors recommend we do not insert objects into the ear canal\"? I doubt it. Obviously, the problem some ppl have with homosexuality is not that it is unusual mammalian behavior (which it isn't), or that homosexual relationships are by definition unhealthy (which they aren't). ;)",

It is absed upon doing the unorthodox.\n \n \n \nAnd that is seen and accepted. Yet you don't argue aganist it because it is unnatural. Hypocrite. \n \n Warfare is different from accepted behavior. WArfare is considered unnecessary or a necessary evil depending on the situation. Don't confuse warfare with accepted behavior.\n \n \n \nIf we were naturally designed to live on sheer rock cliffs, we would have the ability to scale them without technology. Yet we resort to unnatural processes to do so. No one is endowned with the ability to rapidly descend. Even the best climbers cannot go that fast without major issues to their respiroty functions. \n \n Sloths go real slow climbing trees. Does that make it an unnatural habitat? Many species build nests and burrow in the gorund that takes time and yet we can do those things faster than them. Does that make it unnatural for them to live in it?\n You need to define what we were intended to live in and what is your term of natural? Does there have to be a need? Does our body have to be capable of doing it without technological advances? You keep going off on different tangents.\n \n \n \nYet it is unnatural to do either. \n \n How is it unnatural to do either? There were people taht lived on sheer cliffs during the history of mankind.\n \n \n \nTechnology is designed to make up for the lackins in anatomy. It is a unnatural process to allow us to do unnautrally anatomical acts. You fail to see this. \n \n No you fail. Technology is part of civilization. Technology has evovled as has our behavior. Technology is for our progress not for what we lack. We lack many things but technology improves our way of life. Where do you get technology being the lack of anatomical abilities?\n \n \n \nThat may be, but you will still lose, just like you lose every argument you enter. \n \n Uhhh yeahhhh okay\n \n \nYou made no such asseration. You simply said that the intelligence to do soemthing doesn't make it unnatural. I counterd with the same logic you used, yet you fail to see how it applies. Besides, if you want to argue that, there is a need for genetic manipulation as well as cloning. \n \n I did make that assertion 42\n \n If you want to get technical with what we were given then you must include our intelligence. Many animals liek the hermit crab adopt other animls shells for protection. Many animls build nests and other such things to help them dapat. Bears seek shelter in caves. We do likewise by using animal fur and other necessity to help us live in conditions that even though they aren't ideal conditions are more than bearable. Anatomically our body does adjust and use others skills that other animls use to help us survive. \n \n I agree that intelligence to do something doesn't make it unnatrual but I never agreed either that the intelligence to something makes it natural either. You can argue taht there is a need for genetic engineering but that is a whole different topic.\n \n \n \n \n \nNo, you gave the logic to support your argument, I am using it direct aganist you. YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUES BEING SLAMMED BACK INTO YOUR FACE AND ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE FOCUS FROM YOUR FAILURES \n \n Wow form some that responds to every argumetn with you failed. Withous showing me how I failed or manipulating issues its funny taht you're going to try to assert this.\n \n \n \nNo, your asseration was on intelligence, not primarily technology. So my point still stand, and you have lost.\n\n Alright whatever. You say. I never said that but alright whatever.\n \n \n \nSo therefore gay safe sex is not unnatural.\n\n Your statement is a conclusory statement with out any analysis that anyone can follow. I said technological dvances does nto make it natural then you respond with this? You're lost.\n \n \n \nThere is no need to fly at 30,000 feet. Everyone doesn't engage in those activies because there is no need. YOU HAVE LOST. \n Actually over a million people a day engage in the activity.\n There is a need to travel. Everyone that flies generally does engage in this activity. People that don't engage in it isn't because they don't need to it's because they ahve no opportunity to do it. BUt keep smiling with your argument.\n \n \n \n \n \nYou have no argument, and this is why. \n \n You made the asseration that having intelligence, the means to build transportation, (without making a argument for need), makes things not unnatural. That very same logic can easily be applied to gay sex, which apparently you are completely obessed with. If we have the intelligence to explore our bodies, and the intelligence to build technological advances to do so, then anal sex is no longer unnatural. \n \n Taht's like three degrees of seperation form waht I said. You keep making these leaps taht I never made. \n \n \n \nYou also said that having intelligence to use other animals and objects to your aid is natural, yet you refuse to comment on the same logic applied in a horrible manner. You have a living, breathing and walking double standard. You also start throwing in morality, which is irrevelant to a anatomical or intelligence-related ability argument. You assume YOUR morality is the correct, and therefore you have right to decide what is right and what is wrong without making a single logical point.\n\n you're the one taht brought up slavery not me. So that is when you bring in moral issues.\n \n \n \n \nThen you start saying the technology does not make something unnatural. If we have the technology to do anything, then the related field is no longer unnatural due to your very own logic, which you refuse to acknowledge yet use in your very own arguments. Then you have the ignorant comment to even mention efficency, which has no bearing on the means and willingess to utilize intelligence. \n \n CAn you please post the quote where I said that. I said technology does not make it unnatural. Technoilogy helps us fulfill our needs. Teh efficiency argument is res ipsa loquitor \" the thing speaks for itself\". Society won't encourage something thats impractical.\n \n \n \n \nThen you decide that only YOU can define what is a need, and only what is needed is therefore unnatural when added to the technology equation. Yet many of your examples, pathetic refutations at that, came from no need, but luxury, unncessity, the absence of need. You ignore that to suit your arguments, yet give the impression that they were needed. \n \n You need to define need. There is a need for a microwave. However some people never use the microwave so they may say that there is no need. Teh fact that soem people need to use it and others don't doesn't meant here is no need. So luxuries for some are necessities for tohers. You too far gone from the original argument.\n \n Also I said technology aided our needs not the other way around.\n \n \n \nGive up.

   "No I simply show taht under any criteria that allows homosexuality will allow for other things.\n\n \n You really have to explain that further. What criteria is that precisely, and what other things will be allowed by that criteria. Also, heterosexuality can share many of the same criterias as homosexuality.\n \n \n \nAlso majority oppresion is what most people call democracy. If you ahve a problem with democracy that is a whole different topic.\n\n \n So when the majority supported slavery, that was simply democracy in action. A group fighting against inequality and oppression is also democracy.\n \n \nAGain technology does not make it unnatural. My point is that there never existed a natural need or desire to perform homosexual activities.\n\n \n It happens. Who are you to say there isn't a natural need? You define natural need by your own personal politics and by your own personal, subjective morality. Nature doesn't conform to your politics nor to your morality.\n \n \nDefense of our country does not necessarily mean that you will go to war. Soldiers perform other tasks than killing people. They prepared to do things to protect us and that is considered alright. Attacking people is not necessarily considered natural.\n\n \n More of your own politics, not nature.\n \n \nNo we have always had the need to travel fast and to remote places.\n\n \n Why would we have the need to travel fast to remote places? Everytime that happens someone is acting on need? A need to be a tourist and take pictures, or the need to lay on a far-off exotic beach and be served drinks?\n \n \nWhy is it impractical to have a plasma screen? For some the cost makes it impractical for others the cost isn't a factor so the need for better entertainment isn't impractical.\n\n \n There can be a practical need for the \"better\" entertainment, if you are rich? However, there cannot be a social need for a different relationship that meets the needs and desires of a gay person? I can't believe you don't see how completely subjective and politically biased you are being, the blinders you are wearing. \n \n \nLeaving valuables in cars is ver pratical for transporting them so that they are available for us at our convenience.\n\n \n Not if they end up stolen. Luxury items are not practical needs.\n \n \nMaybe for you but for most people need is important factors is some aspects of natural.\n\n \n You don't understand what nature is. You are assigning your politics and your morality to natural needs. Nature has no morality and no politics. Nature does not define \"need\" based on your morality, nor does it define \"need\" based on your politics.",
