There is also significant usage/dependance on vehicles (Depending on the settings and map).\n \n I played some head to head (not online, just closed net) unreal, and quake. From my experience, there was no comparison. I can clearly make out my opponents, the movement isn't \"jerky\", and the maps work well. If that helps :)\n \n -Mach",

The first multiplayer online first person shooter (MOFPS) it was a game that I could only describe as being excellent (although buggy). The battles are incredible- literally hundreds of players involved at a time with buggies, tanks, aircraft, infantry- you name it.\n \n Problem I found was that it was a time sink and sometimes just to engrossing to put down- the battles could last for hours over a single base sometimes.\n \n Amazing game, but after the beta testing and a couple of months retail play I had to bid it farewell. I think wifey has just about forgiven me now ;)\n \n Jaaaman: I don't know if you are into that sort of thing but it is very cool. If nothing else you would probably appreciate the Biblical nuances the story has.",
