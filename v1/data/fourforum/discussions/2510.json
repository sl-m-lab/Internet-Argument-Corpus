Michael Moore showed that in the cities and suburbs of Canada there is a substantial gun ownership. people with guns on them at all times doesnt equate to people that are most likely to shoot you.\n \n the point of bowling for columbine is that america is so trigger happy because the media perpetuates a paranoia that everybody is out to rob you. people in the US are afraid of each other. thanks to the media, people afraid of the subways, parking lots, the parks, nightclubs and neighboorhoods where blacks are the majority. its not that these places are inherently more hazardous, its just that the media continuously highlights the hazards\n \n now everybody is so tense and jumpy, that its no surprise people get shot regularly. that was the point of the movie, and if you missed that message then you should look at it again",

The sensationalist way in which he tackles the subject matter is possibly undermining any social message he is trying to get across.\n\n \n I agree. I wouldn't have minded Bowling so much if he had either made a documentary or made a commercial film. In the end, the message wasn't that bad. For all intenst and purposes he said exactly what the pr-gunners have been saying for years, which is that guns don't kill, people kill. \n \n Now, he took a kind of roundabout means of getting there, but that was more or less the conclusion of the film. Our society is a messed up place and people are scared. I am not sure that he is right that they have no reason to be (just look at our crime statistics).\n \n Watching the film, it almost looks like he set out to make one movie then ended up making another. The first 2/3 of the film certainly seemed like the message was \"guns are evil\". It wasn't until the end that you come to the revelation that his message is not \"guns are evil\". \n \n The sensationalist methods he used in the film, IMHO, pretty much strike it from the \"documentary\" list.",

   "Yes, the gun control issue is an important one that has to be discussed, I'm just wondering if he's the person that should be doing it. On the plus side his work does reach a large audience, so it brings the matter to people's attention and maybe they will have something more to think about when they vote on local laws etc. But back to the Columbine film it is fragmented, and in some ways it over simplifies things. \n That's the double edged sword of this kind of thing, pure documentary would put people to sleep, but without restraint you end up with something that's an alternative to watching a Rolling stones concert on an I Max cinema screen.\n Moore had an episode of Oprah Winfrey devoted to showcasing the Columbine work. That's fine, but his rantings at award ceremonies and the trailers for his latest film (which have the style of a trailer for something like Charlie Sheen's Hot Shots), that's all something else. It makes it hard for me to take what he shows seriously.",

   "Crime, whether violent or not, occurs for a multitude of reasons. Petty emotions like envy, greed, anger, hatred, and revenge are often present. In my experience, however, drugs and/or alcohol are present in about 85% of crime [from dealing drugs; enforcing drug debts; robberies, burglaries and larcenies to take property to trade for drugs; crimes committed by those under the influence; etc.]\n \n While the motivation to commit crimes can vary widely from individual to individual, there are always three deterrent factors which any person who is thinking about committing a crime considers:\n \n 1. What is the likelihood that I (or, to a lesser extent, my friend and co-defendant) will suffer a serious injury as a result of attempting the crime?\n 2. What is the likelihood that I will be caught and charged with committing the crime?\n 3. What is the likelihood that I will suffer a punishment which I am unwilling to accept if I am caught and found guilty of the crime?\n \n I don't keep a gun under my pillow, because I have young children and do not believe that it would be a safe method of storage for my family. I do, however, advertise deterrent factor #1 as much as I can by making it no secret that I have immediate access to a firearm in the event of a home invasion. I am by nature a very easygoing person, and I am not tense, jumpy, and paranoid. I have, however, been witness to the frequency and the effect of violent crime, and have had my life threatened by some whom I have come across in my work. \n ------------------------------------------\n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria from his work, On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",

   "I agree, this movie was sensationalized. But as far as people thinking it was lame because it didn't end up with the message it started out with, well, I think the goal was to get people to think. And for people with the original opinion (guns are evil) he probably hoped to get them to see things more balanced. Micheal Moore tends to manipulate people, just in a different way than the President or the media does.. not with fear, with knowledge and anger. At least from what I've seen. In the end, I think the information he shares is valuable, but the way it's presented ends up making fanatics, and fanatics aren't exactly constructive to a movement for the better. ;) But I must confess to liking that movie.",
