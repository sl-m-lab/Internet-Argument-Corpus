Maybe by reintroducing prayer in school outings we can fix what we have done wrong.\n\n \n religious freedom implies that i have the choice to believe whatever i want, which includes nothing at all. i would certainly say that this gives me the right to have freedom from religion. hell, if i want to, i can believe that bob barker is god and watch the price is right for my church service. the problem with prayer in school or at school events is two-fold. \n 1. you imply that everyone is of the same religion. our country (America) was founded by people seeking freedom from others who tried to dictate what they should believe. if you want to have prayer at school, then you must provide equal representation for every religion. Why should a muslim or jew feel that their religion is not important enough to represent also. in a christian school, you could certainly pray, as everyone is christian. but in a public school, where many religions can be represented this sets a dangerous foundation that corrupts the very morals you speak of. it tells our children that America is a christian land and those of other religions do not deserve equal representation. this is a lesson that can be applied in many other ways, especially by impressionable children. this leads to ostracism and prejudice towards those that are different from us. shouldn't our goal be to teach our children that while some people are different, we all have the same inherent qualities that make us members of one group: the human race?\n \n 2. you imply that the christian religion is the only moral religion. this perpetuates the steriotype that anyone who is not a christian is less moral. the truth is that there are many people of many faiths that are moral, and many that are not moral. morals are not something that should be taught by religion, but by human decency. in my opinion, a person who needs religion to dictate their morals is someone who really has no morals in the first place. sure, religion can supplement morals, but morals arise from our own consciousness. a person lacking morals before religion will never have morals with religion. if parents wish to teach religious values to supplement morals, let them do so at home. school is for education of earthly principles, let the spiritual principles to the church and the home. \n \n BESIDES, IF A CHILD WISHES TO PRAY AT ANY TIME, HE/SHE MAY DO SO AT ANY TIME, ANY PLACE...EVEN IN SCHOOL. PRAYER DOES NOT NEED TO BE OUT LOUD!!!",
