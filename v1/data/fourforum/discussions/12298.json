Ohio, studies showed that the number of annual drug arrests in the U.S. -- most cases are prosecuted in state court -- didn't change much but there was a sharp increase in officers claiming that suspects dropped drugs on the ground. \"Either drug users were suddenly dropping bags all over the place or the cops were still frisking but saying the guy dropped the drugs,\" says John Kleinig, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n This speaks volumes of the situation.\n It should not be ignored.",

The Constitution is not like a beetle captured in amber; it is an organic, living document, deliberately written not only for its time but also flexible enough to adapt to all time.\nthe meaning of the provisions do not change while the constitution may change. This is just like any other legal document. Do the terms in a rental agreement change over time without consent from the people who signed it? No. The founders wrote specifically how the constitution changes so that it doesn't become a stagnant document. Ironically enough, the \"living constitution\" idea you propose makes the constitution more rigid than adopting the original meaning. This is because the constitution was originally very limited in scope. Once you start saying \"it means this\" or \"it means that\" than you have made changes in society virtually impossible because it can only be changed by 9 judges or a constitutional amendment. With your \"living constitution\" if they determine abortion is banned by the constitution than the only way to remove that would be to reserve the decision or amendment. If you had the original constitution view than the issue would be left up to the states to decide and states could change the laws to fit with current times.",

Let's just abolish the Judicial Branch of government altogether and leave the decision of what the Constitution says and means to vagaries of public opinion.\n In which case, we will immediately do away with all Federal prosecutions of kiddie porn, because, after all, the First Amendment says \"Congress shall make NO LAW...\" and any ##### can figure out for himself that \"No law\" means NO LAW, right?",

Having the supposed weakest branch of government decide what should or shouldn't be in the constitution based upon anything other than what the constitution originally meant makes a constitution as useful as a used piece of paper. Things not in the constitution should be left up to the \"vagaries of public opinion\". Things in the constitution should be used by the judges to see if a situation has violated the provision...just like in any court case. You never hear of a judge having a murder case come to his court and deciding to change the law against murder.\n \n As for your first amendment issue that you always bring up; you once again fail to understand the difference between original meaning and strict construction. Original meaning doesn't look at common time literal meaning of the words. It looks at what the provision meant at the time of adoption. And even if the first amendment did not ban kiddle porn on the federal side, so what? That is why we have state governments to handle this kind of thing.",

   "I personally think the exclusionary rule (for the most part) is a good idea but saying it makes sense and is a good idea doesn't mean the 4th amendment says that. The history of the amendment and its original meaning is all that matters. At the time of adoption there was no exclusionary rule.\n\n \n At the time of its adoption, the federal government considered themselves on a tight leash. I can not seem to find ANY case law on the fourth amendment from early courts and the anecdotal evidence I can find would seem to suggest that there were virtually NO searches done without proper warrants and (unlike today) if they found out they were searching the wrong person, they STOPPED. \n \n I understand your line of thought here, but in a way it is dangerous. Was there no exclusionary rule because that is not what they meant, or was there no exclusionary rule because the government was under tighter control and they did not cross that line? \n \n That is the same kind of argument you see from people who oppose the second amendment. They are always quick to point out that the court never actually heard a case about the second amendment until the miller decision in 1939. They are correct, BUT the national firearms act (the law challenged in the miller case) was very literally the first major piece of gun control legislation passed in the history of the country. Up until then you could own anything you could manufacture and afford. \n \n The fact that gun control did not come up in the courts does not mean guns did not exist. It means that the government was on a shorter leash and never tried it.",

Don't fall into the trap of\" because we don't know we have to guess\". Bork said it best when he used the ink blot analogy. If you don't know you can't guess and assume it is right. Luckily we don't have to guess about the meaning.\n \n The first problem we have is that the 4th amendment was not (nor should it be now) applied to the states. This was merely a federal government restriction. This really limits the number of cases you are looking at which is probably why not many cases came up about it. I haven't done enough research on the 4th amendment but, like I said, it doesn't seem like it would stray from common law. It could even have a different remedy. \n \n I'd also like to point out that at the time of the exclusionary rule, no other country really did this even though they had a similar type provision (4th amendment that is). Frankfurther pointed this out in the Wolf case. \n \n I think it is a bad precedent to assume something it true because it makes sense. This is how we got to a constitution with no meaning. You can always adopt an exclusionary rule if you feel one is needed.\n \n \nThat is the same kind of argument you see from people who oppose the second amendment.

It means that the government was on a shorter leash and never tried it.\nYou don't have to have a court case to know original meaning. The evidence is clear when they made the second amendment that it was for citizens blowing their government away if they were out of line. A recent case about this actually highlights the history of the amendment and breaks down exactly what those words meant at the time of adoption and how they were used during that time (this alone isn't enough but Scalia goes on to talk about the history as well).",

   "The Fourth Amendment is applied to the states, by way of the 14th amendment.\n By way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, nearly all of the rights in the Bill of Rights have been applied to the states, under what is known as the incorporation doctrine. As a result, the Fourteenth Amendment not only empowered the federal courts to intervene in this area to enforce the guarantee of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, but also to import the substantive rights of free speech, freedom of religion, protection from unreasonable searches and cruel and unusual punishment, and other limitations on governmental power. At the present, the Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause incorporates all of the substantive protections of the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments and all of the Fifth Amendment other than the requirement that any criminal prosecution must follow a grand jury indictment, but none of the provisions of the Seventh Amendment relating to civil trials. Thus, the Court has also greatly expanded the reach of procedural due process, requiring some sort of hearing before the government may terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits.Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
