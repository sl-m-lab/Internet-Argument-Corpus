   "Report finds fewer teens having intercourse, more using condoms\n \n \"Fewer high school students are having sex these days, and more are using condoms. The teen birth rate has hit a record low.\n art.teen.sex2.gi.jpg\n \n In 2005, 47 percent of high school students reported having sexual intercourse, down from 54 percent in 1991.\n \n More young people are finishing high school, too, and more little kids are being read to, according to the latest government snapshot on the well-being of the nation's children. It's good news on a number of key wellness indicators, experts said of the report being released Friday.\n \n \"The implications for the population are quite positive in terms of their health and their well-being,\" said Edward Sondik, director of the National Center for Health Statistics. \"The lower figure on teens having sex means the risk of sexually transmitted diseases is lower.\"\n \n In 2005, 47 percent of high school students -- 6.7 million -- reported having had sexual intercourse, down from 54 percent in 1991. The rate of those who reported having had sex has remained the same since 2003.\n \n Of those who had sex during a three-month period in 2005, 63 percent -- about 3 million -- used condoms. That's up from 46 percent in 1991.\n \n The teen birth rate, the report said, was 21 per 1,000 young women ages 15-17 in 2005 -- an all-time low. It was down from 39 births per 1,000 teens in 1991.\n \n \"This is very good news,\" said Sondik. \"Young teen mothers and their babies are at a greater risk of both immediate and long-term difficulties.\"\n \n The birth rate in the 15-19 age group was 40 per 1,000 in 2005, also down sharply from the previous decade.\n \n Education campaigns that started years ago are having a significant effect, said James Wagoner, president of Advocates for Youth, a Washington-based nonprofit group that focuses on prevention of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.\n \n \"I think the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the efforts in the '80s and '90s had a lot to do with that,\" Wagoner said of the improved numbers on teen sex, condoms and adolescent births.\n \n \"We need to encourage young teens to delay sexual initiation and we need to make sure they get all the information they need about condoms and birth control,\" he said.\" \n More at http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/13/teen.sex.ap/index.html\n \n I think the article misses pointing out something important here, though. When teens wait to have sex, they are exercising abstinence. They attribute these stats to the HIV epidemic, but I suspect another cause is that abstinence programs are making some inroads. As are programs geared toward safe-sex.",
