Nobody deserves respect or obedience who displays such hypocrisy.\n \n As to the original question, most certainly not. The Bible is contradictory and prejudiced. A society modelled on it in it's entirety is one that is barbaric, bigoted and bloody. That is of course not to say that it doesn't have some part in our society. As much as I disagree with much of it, I do also admit it has some very good elements; and, coming form a Christian society, concede that much of what I hold as good and great in my society owes a lot to the Bible.

   "Well quite, but that's hardly the point. You're correct, I'd probably have to toe the line should such circumstances happen; but should I suddenly find myself ruled by a despotic mortal who could execute me in a second the same would be true, but it doesn't mean I should approve of that circumstance either. We all hold opinions on things we are totally unable to change, that doesn't mean we shouldn't hold them.\n\n \n Hardly the point? It's what you said. If you're talking about having a different opinion, sure, nobody is saying here you have to agree with God on anything. You were talking about holding God to standards. Now you're talking about whether or not you approve of the fact He's God.\n \n \nIndeed, I was just pointing out that it's not just two extremes: all powerful God or nothing. To be honest I see it quite possible to have a fallible God in the broad context of Christianity. He can be wise, just not infallible. I think it's a considerably more likely and appealing version of God myself than one who is so alien and uncaring.\n\n \n In that case, it seems to me that it wouldn't be \"God.\" Maybe a deity or something. But I think generally, the idea of \"God\" is a monotheistic all-powerful being.",

That Jesus actually said it 2000 years ago, or that the Temple was actually destroyed and the Jews dispersed as jesus said would happen until their return to their original homeland in may of 1948 ? Exactly which events are you saying are false or never happened ? The promise that they would, or the occurrences themselves ? Which are all independently and historically documented on both ends of the history. \n \n So try to get beyond the shallow and glib insults and actually explain what you mean when you just write off the Savior of humanity as if He's a quack.\nOk so let me ask you this one thing:\n \n Is the bible a manual for social re-construction?\n \n I am guessing from your posts that you would say \"NO\" (unless you became confused and went of on a tangent again.)\n \n Am I right?",

I am asking for I do not want to become good too soon, you know, and miss a lot of fun.\n So Archangel, please tell us how much time before Judgment Day? and what about that the Apocalypse stuff? No, not that movie with Marlon Brando, no the real one, the eschatological one.
