   "Source \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n UN Confirms: WMDs Smuggled Out of Iraq\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \u00a9 June 18, 2004, Rod D. Martin\n \n \n In a report which might alternately be termed \"stunning\" or \"terrifying\", United Nations weapons inspectors confirmed last week not merely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that he smuggled them out of his country, before, during and after the war.\n \n Late last week, the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) briefed the Security Council on Saddam's lightning-fast dismantling of missile and WMD sites before and during the war. UNMOVIC executive chairman Demetrius Perricos detailed not only the export of thousands of tons of missile components, nuclear reactor vessels and fermenters for chemical and biological warheads, but also the discovery of many (but not most) of these items - with UN inspection tags still on them -- as far afield as Jordan, Turkey and even Holland.\n \n Notably absent from that list is Iraq's western neighbor Syria, ruled by its own Baath Party just like Saddam's and closed to even the thought of an UNMOVIC inspection. Israeli intelligence has been reporting the large-scale smuggling of Saddam's WMD program across the Syrian border since at least two months before the war. Syria has long been the world's foremost state-sponsor of terrorism.\n \n Perricos highlighted the proliferation danger to the Security Council, as well he should: UNMOVIC has no idea where most of the WMD material is today, just that it exists and it's gone; and anything in Syria is likely to be in Jerusalem or New York tomorrow.\n \n This is the biggest news story of 2004 so far. Yet you haven't heard about it, have you?\n \n You probably haven't heard about Canada's Prime Minister Paul Martin either -- a socialist and no friend of America. Addressing a group of 700 university researchers and business leaders in Montreal last month, Martin stated bluntly that terrorists have acquired WMDs from Saddam. \"The fact is that there is now, we know well, a proliferation of nuclear weapons, and that many weapons that Saddam Huseein had, we don't know where they are.... [T]errorists have access to all of them,\" the Canadian premier warned.\n \n The tip of this terrorist sword was scarcely deflected on April 26th, when Jordanian intelligence broke up an al Qaeda conspiracy to detonate a large chemical device in the capital city of Amman. Directed by al Qaeda terrorist leader Abu al-Zarqawi -- the same man who personally beheaded American Nicholas Berg in Iraq last month -- the plotters sought to use a massive explosion to spread a \"toxic cloud\", meant to wipe out the U.S. embassy, the Jordanian prime minister's office, the Jordanian intelligence headquarters, and at least 20,000 civilians (by contrast, only 3,000 died on 9/11). Over twenty tons of chemical weapons were seized from the conspirators, who were just days away from carrying out their plot.\n \n One wonders where CNN and USA Today think twenty tons of nerve gas and sarin came from: Chemical Weapons-Mart? Yet their coverage, like most major media outlets, mentioned not a word about Saddam's smuggled WMDs, which -- according to liberal dogma -- \"don't exist.\" \n \n Even though the UN says they do exist, now spread around the world.\n \n It's not just the UN. Bill Clinton says they exist, even after the war: in a July 2003 interview with Larry King, the ex-president uncharacteristically defended George Bush, saying \"it is incontestable that on the day I left office, there [was]...a substantial amount of biological and chemical material unaccounted for\" in Iraq. Every intelligence agency in the world -- French, British, German, Russian, Czech, you name it -- agreed before the war; Jordanian intelligence can certainly confirm their opinion today. \n \n So what's the deal? Why the relentless pretence that \"Bush lied\" when even the UN and Bill Clinton say he didn't? Why the absolute silence about \"inconvenient\" parts of various UN reports, such as the discovery of chemical and biological weapons plans, recipes and equipment; of bio-weapons agents in an Iraqi scientist's house; of a prison lab for testing bio weapons on humans; of complexes for manufacturing fuel for prohibited long-range missiles; of artillery rounds containing enough sarin to kill thousands of people, of similar shells containing mustard gas, two (but far from the only) of which were used in a terrorist attack against U.S. forces just weeks ago? \n \n America cannot afford the answer to this \"why\": that many on the left consider George W. Bush's defeat more urgent than al Qaeda's, his political death more essential than the possible physical death of millions of Americans. \n \n The character of our foreign enemies has never been in doubt. The character of the enemy within -- from Dan Rather to Michael Moore -- has never been clearer. And the stakes are the highest they've ever been.\n \n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Rod D.

   "Scary, but I'll wait until the story is corroborated by a few other sources before I begin saying my mea culpas.\n \n This part of the article casts a lot of doubt on its validity for me - \n \n \nYou probably haven't heard about Canada's Prime Minister Paul Martin either -- a socialist and no friend of America. Addressing a group of 700 university researchers and business leaders in Montreal last month, Martin stated bluntly that terrorists have acquired WMDs from Saddam. \"The fact is that there is now, we know well, a proliferation of nuclear weapons, and that many weapons that Saddam Huseein had, we don't know where they are.... [T]errorists have access to all of them,\" the Canadian premier warned.\n\n \n It sounds like pure hogwash to me, right down to the attempt to characterize Paul Martin as \"anti-American\".\n \n Paul Martin was in the battle for re-election of his life last month. A battle in which his platform clearly stated that Canadians were right to stay out of Iraq, and that any involvement we would have would only be in a peace keeping mission that was UN sanctioned. In fact, the opposition party ran on a stronger military platform and lost. \n \n Canadians DO NOT get elected on anti-terrorism and military might platforms. This kind of a speech, in ultra-liberal Montreal of all places, would be equivalent to shooting himself in the foot.\n \n There's been very little press coverage with mention of Saddam or Iraq by Paul Martin in the last 2-3 months. Statements like the ones he's claimed to make above would have been big news, especially during a campaign.\n \n Waxy",

   "This is not news, this is the same stuff Blix was talking about prior to the invasion, during the invasion, and following the invasion. He warned us about this when they found the refined (yellow cake) uranium in the last scrap shipment, he warned us about this when they found the artillery shell containing Sarin. \n \n Many of the items the UN teams found in Iraq, or that were turned over by the Iraqis, were not destroyed. Tehy were either tagged for destruction or tagged for tracking and verification (in the case of dual use items like fermenters). Very few of the items the UN team uncovered had been destroyed when they were ordered out by the US. They were tagged for destruction and being held in secure locations. The US failed to secure these locations following the invasion. subsequently, many of these materials have disapeared. In souther Iraq, an entire nuclear research facility, buildings and all, has gone missing, presumably trucked through jordan and sold for scrap.\n \n Wouldn't it be ironic if the next terrorist atatack involved 500 lbs of explosives with 1000 lbs of refined uranium from Iraq wrapped around it? It would be especially terrible since the IAEA and UNMOVIC had accounted for all of Iraqs uranium pre war, and America managed to loose it during or after the invasion.\n \n I think you are right to be concerned about this, Waxy. We have taken this stuff away from a petty tyranty half a world away who apparently had no plans to use it against the US, nor the abilitiy to do so. We put this stuff in warehouses and chemical dumps with the plans to destroy it or track it to ensure that it was not misused, and then we pulled the guards off those facilities, didn't put adequate surveilance on them, and didn't ensure that they were destroyed. Now, there is a very real possibility that the US has done what even Saddam would apparently not, given this stuff to anti US forces.",

With that in mind, if we lost contact with this \"payload of weapons\" in the months preceding the war that does not leave us in a very favorable light. It angers me more to know these weapons slipped through our skillful hands and went on to others that could do us harm. Where's the bright spot in this scenario? If your intelligence is good enough to document the weapons, it should be good enough to track the weapons. Frankly, if we were that concerned about Saddam's chemical and biological weapons, I would have thought we would have taken a stronger stance against North Korea and their well documented nuclear weapons. emoticon_rolleyes",
