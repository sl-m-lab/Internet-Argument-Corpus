And he still doesn't admit it but claims his link is a serious issue to debate. So stop with the excuses and justifications. emoticon_frazzledemoticon_xbye",

   "Well as a christian it is not my place to judge the homosexual as a person, but I would like to make a point to the gay community.

I didn't condemn heterosexuals as persons. I said the heterosexual lifestyle is destructive. Does that make sense to you? Probably not. So, it shouldn't make any more sense by substituting \"homosexual,\" where I just wrote \"heterosexual\". This was my whole point of the thread. I was also tired of Archangle posting anti-gay links which cherry-picked snipets of studies to paint gay people with overly-broad generalizing brush strokes, and leave a bad impression about us.

The spinoffs: exclusion, prejudice, no rights, and lessons encouraging self-hate.\n\n \n You are very very right Jake. Especially on the issue of suppression. I can attest to that fully. What people fail to understand is that it's not a choice. If it were do you think I would be risking my family friends and even my job for this? It is just who I am. I tried so long to suppress my feelings toward guys for so long I became a miserable spiteful self loathing hating person.\n \n I hated everything I hated myself I couldnt stay focused, I felt non stop guilt especially if I acted upon my feelings. During my beating on the ship something snapped. Something gave way. I fought for the ifrst time for myself to survive to live. \n \n I finally realized that in those moments when it mattered most that I had to stand up and stop lying to myself and face the truth. For once in my life I had a clear path and as scary as it has been I have never felt more at ease and happy in my life.\n \n Recovering from that incident took 6 months roughly for me to actually think in a positive way and I owe it all to my ex whom which were still very close. He took me in gave me a place to stay opened his home up to me, let me enter his circle of friends. He built me up and always encouraged me. \n \n he helped me find my passion for music again and I can gladly say that now I am a music major playing lead tenor sax and lead bari sax in one of the toughest bands in all of southern california that has played worldwide. \n \n Point being that you can't judge someone due to their sexuality or judge them on that alone. And if you do judge, judge yourself. I know ive been very open on these forums and people have even messaged me and said I shouldnt be so open. Well why not? I'm not afraid. Im honest and forth right and very open. I just hope that my expeiences can shed some kind of postitive light on these issues and show others that even at its roughest life can get better.",

   "It only comes up when referencing the looney lefty's and the gay agenda...\n\n \"gay agenda\".\n Another propagandic phrase.\n The truth is that the \"gay agenda\" is supported by a MAJORITY of U.S. people. The only exception is \"gay marriage\".\n Gay agenda\n Military to allow gays to serve openly? Majority support.\n Gays to be able to adopt? Majority support.\n Gays to have protection against employment / housing discrimination? Majority support.\n Sodomy laws overturned? Majority support.\n Gays to have civil unions? Majority support.\n \n The only thing \"looney\" here is in trying to pretend that Paul Cameron's statements aren't blatant lies. And that ain't the \"gay agenda\" doing that...\n \n \n \nWhere as me and my group of evangelical christians are traditionalist who are attempting to slow the onset of the extreme influences and dumbing down of America's values which these other groups are promoting. \n\n It's funny how you use words, and they are absolutely meaningless.\n Take your defense of Paul Cameron for example. NOT ONCE do you actually say \"while the gays accuse him of lying, Paul speaks the truth\".\n All you do is try to rephrase things...\n \n The truth of the matter is that you aren't attempting to \"slow\" anything except EQUALITY.\n EQUALITY is not an \"extreme influence\".\n EQUALITY is not a \"dumbing down\".\n \n Even trying to talk about \"dumbing down\" is like trying to ask how many vowels the physical room of the kitchen has. We're talking about MORALITY, which isn't an issue of smart or dumb.\n Unless you're the one backing the liar, trying to pretend his view-point is valid.\n \n \n \nIt might seem extreme to your side, but clinging to traditional values isn't the least bit radical. It's an attempt to maintain the quickly disappearing innocence, modesty and personal self respect which people used to have for themselves and each other. There is nothing radical about that.\n\n What's amusing is to note that your desire to discriminate and slander homosexuals has absolutely nothing to do with \"innocence\".\n You sure as heck aren't \"modest\" when you try to pretend, ad nausieum, that you have the \"truth\" and everybody else is \"dumbed down\".\n And if you had any \"self respect\", you wouldn't try to back the word of a liar as just another opinion.\n \n No. This is about gay equality.\n This thread is about exposing the reasoning of the anti-gay person as being false and arbitrary.\n Prejudice towards blacks used to be a \"traditional value\", with people thinking it \"immodest\" and lacking in \"self respect\" to cross cultural boundaries between whites and blacks.\n Your words are simply thinly veiled \"prettifying\" of ugly concepts, and you can't discuss the ACTUAL concept because you too quickly reveal things about yourself that you cannot intelligibly deny ...",

It's an attempt to maintain the quickly disappearing innocence, modesty and personal self respect which people used to have for themselves and each other. There is nothing radical about that.\n\n \n \"traditional\" in what sense? You think you are somehow preserving some lost form of a golden age of leave it to beaver mentaility when in fact Archie it has NEVER been that way ever. And if you look at the time in which your views of christianity were at their highest, it was in a time that was plagued by extreme racism, violence, corruption, fear of not only war but total destruction of western civilization and even anarchy.\n \n People were told what the government wanted them to hear, they were told on sunday the same old bigoted hate filled message from right wing baptist nuts who would from the pulpit talk of jesus and then later that night dawn a white hood and white uniform and meet in backwoods amd beat innocent blacks for their color.\n \n This was a time where if you were gay you could and would be beaten, even killed. Gays lived in fear and met in secret for fear of their own lives. Confused and guilt ridden teens had no organizations to turn to to seek help when dealing with coming out and therfore dealt with the burden heavily.\n \n I'm not saying that all preachers are racists, and I'm not saying that the golden rule and such are bad in any way. But this false sense of moraility you speak of is just another false illusion and defence by people who know nothing of gays and who unlike most educated people, will stick their head in the sand and fling random scripture and insults in their defence for their lack of understanding.\n \n If there is any \"agenda\" here it is for equality. I want to be able to hold hands with my boyfriend in a public place without getting stares or sneers or insults for who I am. I want to be able when I do find the right person to settle down and have a family and love and nurture that child and for me and my partner to have the same parental rights as hetero couples do.\n \n I want to be able to be able to see my partner if something has happened and he is in the hospital and to care for him in any way I can and to be the main person the doctor asks in terms of potential life altering decisions. I want to be able to not feel like a second class citizen in this country that I served to defend just as many other gays have and have given their lives and those who still serve now under fear and bled the same blood as strait people in uniform for this country and therfore, should be honored not ridiculed or abashed from this society in which they love.\n \n If this is radical, if this is indeed a hinderence to your \"morality\", if this is what you fear for your kids to see. Then you fear that the barriers of yor own self fear and isolated views will come crashing down and that at last you will be exposed to truth, bare unfiltered truth and see that maybe all along your views were flawed. Pursuit is the key phrase here and is what this country is based upon pursuit of equality and justice for the minority and the pursuit to where no citizen in this country should feel ashamed or fearful of the society in which it lives.\n \n Because if they do and believe me they do, then this country needs change and it needs a warm caring heart. Not a cold set of laws and barriers that strangle the rights of those voices who need to be heard.",
