   "I read a thread in the Religion forum entitled \"How many people did God murder?\" and decided that I'd like to start a similar thread related to deaths due to AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases spread via gays.\n Now, I'm sure that every gay poster in the forum will see this as gay bashing because I bring up a sore subject, but consuidering that they had no problem jumping on the anti-Christian bandwagon, turn around is fair play.\n \n My contention is that HIV/AIDS would be nothing more than a footnote in a medical book had it not been for gays. Prove me wrong......if you dare. \n \n \n\n Mid-1970's-1980 history\n We do not know how many people developed AIDS in the 1970s, or indeed in the years before. Neither do we know, and we probably never will know, where the AIDS virus HIV originated (see our origins page for some theories). But what we do know is:\n \n \"The dominant feature of this first period was silence, for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was unknown and transmission was not accompanied by signs or symptoms salient enough to be noticed. While rare, sporadic case reports of AIDS and sero-archaeological studies have documented human infections with HIV prior to 1970, available data suggest that the current pandemic started in the mid- to late 1970s. By 1980, HIV had spread to at least five continents (North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Australia). During this period of silence, spread was unchecked by awareness or any preventive action and approximately 100,000-300,000 persons may have been infected.\"\n \n Mann J. M (1989) 'AIDS: A worldwide pandemic', in Current topics in AIDS, volume 2, edited by Gottlieb M.S., Jeffries D.J., Mildvan D., Pinching, A.J., Quinn T.C., John Wiley & Sons \n 1981 History\n Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) was a rare form of relatively benign cancer that tended to occur in older people. But by March 1981 at least eight cases of a more aggressive form of KS had occurred amongst young gay men in New York.2\n \n At about the same time there was an increase, in both California and New York, in the number of cases of a rare lung infection Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)3. In April this increase in PCP was noticed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. A drug technician, Sandra Ford, noticed a high number of requests for the drug pentamine, used in the treatment of PCP:\n \n \"A doctor was treating a gay man in his 20s who had pneumonia. Two weeks later, he called to ask for a refill of a rare drug that I handled. This was unusual - nobody ever asked for a refill. Patients usually were cured in one 10-day treatment or they died\"\n \n - Sandra Ford for Newsweek -4\n Daniel McGinn, 'MSNBC: AIDS at 20: Anatomy of a Plague; an Oral History', Newsweek Web Exclusive \n In June, the CDC published a report about the occurrence, without identifiable cause, of PCP in five men in Los Angeles5. This report is sometimes referred to as the \"beginning\" of AIDS, but it might be more accurate to describe it as the beginning of the general awareness of AIDS in the USA.\n \n A few days later, following these reports of PCP and other rare life-threatening opportunistic infections, the CDC formed a Task Force on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (KSOI).6\n \n \n Dr. Conant and Dr Volverg discussing Kaposi's Sarcoma. Circa 1981\n Around this time a number of theories were developed about the possible cause of these opportunistic infections and cancers. Early theories included infection with cytomegalovirus, the use of amyl nitrite or butyl nitrate \"poppers\", and \"immune overload\".7 8 9\n \n Because there was so little known about the transmission of what seemed to be a new disease, there was concern about contagion, and whether the disease could by passed on by people who had no apparent signs or symptoms.10 Knowledge about the disease was changing so quickly that certain assumptions made at this time were shown to be unfounded just a few months later. For example, in July 1981 Dr Curran of the CDC was reported as follows:\n \n \"Dr. Curran said there was no apparent danger to non homosexuals from contagion. 'The best evidence against contagion', he said, 'is that no cases have been reported to date outside the homosexual community or in women'\"\n \n - The New York Times -11\n \n Just five months later, in December 1981, it was clear that the disease affected other population groups, when the first cases of PCP were reported in injecting drug users.12 At the same time the first case of AIDS was documented in the UK.13 \n http://www.avert.org/his81_86.htm\n \n\n \n That ought to be enough to get the debate started.",

Gays have a higher infection rate in North America because patient zero was gay, and this is largely an STD. It got a foothold in the gay population first. Given that, the stats show that the rate at which new infections are showing up in gays is lower than the rate at which they're showing up in straights, relative to percent of population already infected. In other words, being gay has nothing to do with getting AIDS. AIDS would have gotten here eventually, and if patient zero had been straight than we would have millions of straights with AIDS and a relatively untouched gay population.",

There is a greater epidemic among heterosexuals in sub-Saharan Africa. It also spreads best, when a condom is not used in homosexual or heterosexual sexl. There is some debate about the safety of unprotected oral sex. Gays didn't use condoms before AIDS, because condoms were primarily used to prevent pregnancy before AIDS.

The denials always start with the current situation, a situation that would never had occurred had critical numbers not have been reached in the gay communities world-wide.\n\n \n As I said earlier, nonsense. AIDS became a pandemic because HIV is a virus to which we have no resistance. At some point, no matter what gay people or anyone else might have done, it would have taken hold, as it is doing in places around the world today. Gay people or no gay people, this virus has been very, very hard to fight.\n \n Only in the U.S. did the \"critical numbers\" initially involve mostly gay people (possibly also in Australia, I'm not sure). In Europe, the epidemic followed more than just the gay path. In Africa, which has suffered the most from HIV (so far), gay transmission was of minimal importance. The same is true in Eastern Europe, India, China. \n \n It's impossible to read your comments on this subject without noticing that you really don't see all of humanity in the same bucket against HIV. It's as if it would have been just fine if gay people had AIDS as long as we hadn't \"spread it\".

It's because it largely happened among gay men first that America was so slow to respond and so wrong in its responses.

No. It's the easy, bigoted way to look at it and it surprises me not in the least that many straights like to look at it that way.",

Maybe, just maybe, there might have been a more rational discussion of what paths to follow to fight the disease. Maybe, just maybe, St. Reagan might have uttered the word \"AIDS\" before years of epidemic had passed.\n\n \n \n Sorry, this is just plain wrong. Within weeks of discovering the realationship between sex and aids, the CDC drafted a memo callig for the closign of all public bath houses and other establishments where anonymous public sex was prevelant. They also called for an extensive awareness campaign targeted at the homosexual community becuase at that point over 98% of AIDS cases were found in gay men. Leaders of the gay community pitched a fit, calling the memo and the idea of shuttign down the public sex establishements \"discriminatory\". They utilized progressive politicians to back their case, and instead of shutting down the bath houses and targeting education efforts at the gay community, they posted notices regarding the benifits of condom use int he public sex establishments, and targeted their campaing at IV drug users and teenagers. \n \n At the time, prevelance of diseases like Syphalis and Ghonnorea were SEVERAL HUNDRED times more prevelant among gay men than straight, and it was largely due to the \"Gay liberation movement\". Edmund White, a prominent figure in the gay community at the time (co wrote \"The Joy of Gay Sex\") went around the country to gay pride rallies telling people \"Gay men should wear their their sexually transmitted diseases like red badges of courage ina war against a sex-negative society\".\n \n When they did finally to shut down some of the public sex houses in the mid 80's, Michael Warner led a crusade to opent hem back up. His argument was as follows:\n \n \"The phenomenology of a sex club encounter is an experience of world making. It's an experience of being connected not just to this person, but to potentially limitless numbers of people, and thats why its important that it be with a stranger\"\n \n That was the problem. Connection to potentially limitless numbers of people, and just a few in the chain with aids had the potential of spreadign AIDS to every one of them. \n \n It was not until the late 90's that gay leaders started backing ANY attempt to do anything really constructive to curb the disease. Larry Kramer wrote in The Advocate in 1997 \"We have made sex the cornerstone of gay liberation and gay culture, and it has killed us.\"\n \n This is an issue I have a great deal of interest in. I have an uncle who is an surgeon who contracted HIV in the late 70's or early 80's (he was an early case and is lucky to still be alive). He worked for the CDC for several years as a spokesman in the gay community trying to convince people that the promiscuous sex that was so heavily endorsed by the gay liberation movement was a BAD, BAD idea. At the time he lived in Sanf Francisco and he ended up having to move. His house was vandalized, his car destroyed, and on more than one occasion his life was threatened by gay radicals who did not like the idea of somebody, especially one of their own, speaking out against their widely accepted revolution.\n \n In short, YES, leaders in the gay community were ABSOLUTLY responsible for the rapid spread of aids and the inability of the CDC or any other government agency to do anything constructive to stop its spread. The leaders fo the gay revolution, and the politicians who abandoned common sense and known and accepted methods for combatting pandemics in the name political correctness and acceptance of alternative lifestyles are, IMO 100% responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands due to the prevelance of AIDS in the homosexual community. They killed the people they were claiming to fight for.\n \n In Africa, heterosexuals far out number gays with aids not because homosexual sex is any safer, but because there are more heterosexuals. The initial spread of aids in africa was not thorugh sexual transmission at all. It was the result of vaccination and health programs, most run by christian charities. Nurses would set up and give vaccinations and antibiotic shots all day, sometimes to literally thousands of people, using the same needle for everybody as a cost saving measure. By the time AIDS was understood, it was all over africa, and spread fairly evenly. In the US, it started rather slowly then took off like wildfire. In Africa, by the time it was discovered, it was already a pandemic.",

How about all the nitwits -- right up into the highest levels of government -- openly talking about AIDS as God's judgement on gay people???????\n\n \n Rounding up gays and putting them in quarantine, cancellation of health insurance, restictions on where you could work, or proclaiming AIDS gods punishment on gay people are not accepted measures to fight a blood borne pathogen. Closing down establishments that are hotbeds of infection because they cater to infections behavior and intensive educational measures aimed at the group most heavily infected ARE accepted measures for fighting a blood borne pathogen.\n \n Yes,peopel bring up the bath houses and public sex establishments because they are a MAJOR factor in the spread of AIDS. As late as 1995, with over 900,000 gay men infected, the New York Gay Men's Health Crisis STILL fought the closing of the bath houses, despite the fact that studies had shown that the brief closing of the bath houses in San Fransico in the mid eighties resulted in a 67% decrease in unprotected sex and an estimated 45%decrease in new aids cases. \n \n Aids has been nothing short of a Holocaust brought down on the Gay community by its own leaders and the politicans who supported them. I am not blaming Gays in general, but the radicals who led them. As with many similar movements, they were more interested in acquiring and maintaining power for themselves than in the welfare or the very lives of those who put their trust in them. \n \n To date, over half a million people of died of AIDS and over a million are HIV positive, the vast majority of them men. Even today we try to \"de-gayify\" aids, despite the fact that gay men are still by FAR the biggest group of infectees with nearly twice as many as the next largest group (IV drug users) and nearly 4 times as many cases as heterosexuals, despite the fact that IV drug users outnumber gays in this country by a fairly wide margin, and heterosexuals outnumber gays males by a HUGE margin. \n \n I suppose it is really not my problem. After all, the odds of gay men passing aids to a straight person is pretty slim. IF the gay community wants to self destruct rather then accept the fact that there is a 900 LB gorilla in the living room, I suppose they are free to do so. I think it is a poor decision, but that is just my opinion.",

That is like claiming that the existance of opium dens had no corrolation to the use of opium. Straight people are going to have sex, too. It is much more prevelant in whore houses than in churches. \n \n \nBy the way, San Francisco's ban on bathhouses is still in effect -- it has never been repealed.\n\n \n The ban was enacted in 1984. In 1986 several bath houses re-opened and sued the city for the right to remain open. The bath houses lost becuase the city was able to show (with the help of the CDC) that over 99% of gay men who were diagnosed with aids reported frequenting the bath houses. They were allowed to stay open, but ONLY on the condition that they remove all private rooms and hire 1 monitor for every 20 patrons. The monitors job was to ensure that no unsafe sex practices took place,a nd to expell any patron who did take part in an unsafe sex practice. Under these conditions they quickly shut down.\n \n Besides the fact that they were gay, and men, that was pretty much the only trait that virtually all of them shared. With the bath houses closed, the disease spread from the generally promiscuous gays to the wider gay population, but its spread was GREATLY decreased.\n \n It was during these court battles that the CDC hired my uncle as a spokesman. He did the job for about a year, then a group of gay activists destroyed his house, torched his mercedes, and held a knife to his throat and threatened to kill him if he did not leave the city. After that he moved, but still continued as a spokesman. He would fly into a city to attend a rally or give a speach, with a dozen CDC provided armed guards, then fly out the same day. That is how fanatical the gay radicals were. \n \n I certainly understand your hesitation to allow the blame for this to be laid on the shoulders of anyone inthe gay community, but frankly that is where most of it belongs. You cannot afford to play \"water under the bridge\" on this one because if you fail to recognize the problems and the culpability in this, it increases the odds of a reoccurance, not just in the gay community but for every population subset that may be disproportionatly succeptible to a future health threat. \n \n We would certainly still have an aids problem regardless of the early history of the disease in the US. If the CDC had been allowed to insist ont heir early course of action, close the public sex establishments and engage in a massive educational campaign targeted at the gay community, it would probably be another 50 years before aids was as widespread in the US as it is today. Hundreds of thousands of lives could have been saved, most of them gay men. \n \n I think this underscores the point of the thread pretty well. Radicalism is dangerous, regardless of what the radical is radical about. Religon tends to get picked on more frequently than other radical groups becuase there are far more religous radicals out there. Also, people disposed to religon seem to be more succeptible to being duped into following some lunatic to commit wholesale slaughter.",

   "Your posts indicate familiarity the with the subject, but it's a familiarity with blinders on and viewed through a shaded lens.\n \n I get so tired of people deriding \"gay activists\". YOUR UNCLE IS A GAY ACTIVIST. He's gay and he was/is an activist. In your twisted view of what happened in San Francisco, you'd even have to classify him as a \"radical gay activist\" since you say his position was so against the grain (which isn't true, but I'll get to that).\n \n \nSince his \"leadership\" consisted of being one of the leading voices in the gay community urging that the bath houses be shut down and that gays be extensively targeted for education regarding aids, I am going to say \"no\". He is not particularly guilty in regards to the actions of the leaders fo the gay community who took the exact opposite stance. I don't blame just the leaders of the gay communities. I also blame the politicians who worked with them.\n\n \n San Francisco is blessed (or cursed, depending) with a lot of fringe groups, most on \"the left\", some on \"the right\". I put those in quotation marks because many of these tiny groups hold beliefs that are more extraterrestial than they are political. There is a small, and VERY VOCAL group that has fought science and logic and reason and common sense and government and the CDC and the City's real gay leadership for decades about AIDS. They hold ridiculous views (AIDS isn't caused by HIV, AIDS is a CIA plot, etc.) and are largely ignored by everyone. Which is hard to do, since they employ some pretty offensive tactics (like vandalism and spitting on people and disrupting meetings, etc.). They are not San Francisco's gay leadership. They're wackos.\n \n So, back to your point. If the CDC recommended closing the bathhouses and mounting an extensive campaign targeting the gay male community, what happened? Well, the bathhouses DID close here. (more about that later) They didn't close in other cities. Hmmm. And what about the information campaign? An AIDS information campaign has gone on for two and a half decades in this city, largely funded by local government and local gay and AIDS organizations. When I visit other cities, I hardly see anything. If you go to the South, it's like there never was an epidemic. Is there a national campaign? Were there widespread efforts to educate America about AIDS and how to prevent it? No. Whose responsibility is that? You can't seriously blame gay people, can you? \n \n \nIf not for the fact that gay men in cities where bath houses were prevelant were 700x (that is SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES) more likely to contract aids than gay men in cites without bath houses, you might have a point. On second thought NO, you still would not have a point. To claim that transmission of a disease that at the time was primarily spread due to male-male sexual contact is unrelated to the existance of establishments specifically created to facilitate such encounters hundreds, or even thousands of times per night with strangers is just ludicrous. \n\n \n Where in the world are you getting that number? I'm not suggesting that the bathhouses were not places where a lot of men got HIV. With unsafe sex, of course places that encourage multiple contacts result in more infections. My point, however, is that even though that would be the worst possible situation, the better choice between closing bathhouses and providing information is providing information. Common sense might indicate that doing BOTH would be the best solution, but studies have shown that rates have declined most when the bathhouses have fully cooperated in providing information, testing, and condoms. \n \n Why? Because a LOT of patrons of bathhouses are not \"gay men\". They are closeted, or married, or in the military, or confused. They are isolated from much of the information about AIDS because they are not part of the gay community and, therefore, aren't exposed to what little information this society disseminates about the disease. Bathhouses are often the only place they encounter the anti-AIDS campaign.\n \n \n \nThe fact that the transmission of aids was nearly cut in half following the closure of the bath houses is no coincidence. That is like claiming that the existance of opium dens had no corrolation to the use of opium. Straight people are going to have sex, too. It is much more prevelant in whore houses than in churches. \n\n \n This is a remarkably naive or remarkably insincere claim. The closure of bathhouses did not occur in a vacuum. You can't isolate the effect of one step in fighting AIDS from all the rest of what was going on. As I've said before, this is a very complex issue spanning almost three decades now. You can't resort to such simplistic analyses. \n \n \n \nThe ban was enacted in 1984. In 1986 several bath houses re-opened and sued the city for the right to remain open. The bath houses lost becuase the city was able to show (with the help of the CDC) that over 99% of gay men who were diagnosed with aids reported frequenting the bath houses. They were allowed to stay open, but ONLY on the condition that they remove all private rooms and hire 1 monitor for every 20 patrons. The monitors job was to ensure that no unsafe sex practices took place,a nd to expell any patron who did take part in an unsafe sex practice. Under these conditions they quickly shut down.\n\n \n As I said, you appear more informed than most about what happened in SF. What you are describing is not a \"bathhouse\", it's a sex club. Many closed. Some remain open. San Francisco is one of very few places with these kinds of restrictions. If \"gay leaders\" are to \"blame\" for not doing enough, why are we the only major American city with such restrictions???? True bathhouses exist in most major American cities (the distinction isn't the availability of water for bathing, it's the existence of private rooms where unsafe sex is much more likely to occur). \n \n \nBesides the fact that they were gay, and men, that was pretty much the only trait that virtually all of them shared. With the bath houses closed, the disease spread from the generally promiscuous gays to the wider gay population, but its spread was GREATLY decreased.\n\n \n You are again making enormous leaps of speculation. Rates dropped because of FEAR. Because gay men rapidly and seriously changed their behavior and adopted safe-sex techniques. \n \n By the way, you seem to be saying that closing the bathhouses is what drove the infection into the larger community which was less promiscuous. If so, you're contradicting your own assertion that closing them was a good idea...\n \n \nIt was during these court battles that the CDC hired my uncle as a spokesman. He did the job for about a year, then a group of gay activists destroyed his house, torched his mercedes, and held a knife to his throat and threatened to kill him if he did not leave the city. After that he moved, but still continued as a spokesman. He would fly into a city to attend a rally or give a speach, with a dozen CDC provided armed guards, then fly out the same day. That is how fanatical the gay radicals were. \n\n \n Yes, that was the tiny minority I mentioned above. Ask your uncle their names. It's the same wackos, I bet. \n \n While you're at it, ask him if anyone else bears any responsibility. Feel free to report back.\n \n \nI certainly understand your hesitation to allow the blame for this to be laid on the shoulders of anyone inthe gay community, but frankly that is where most of it belongs. \n\n \n I don't think you understand much about this issue at all. SOME gay men certainly bear responsibility. So do SOME Republican presidents. (well, all to date) So do SOME religious leaders. \n \n Almost all of the gay men who did bear responsibility are dead. The consequences for the gay-baiting, bigoted religious and political leaders who made this epidemic far worse and who still impede real progress against it seem to have been far more favorable. Look where they are.\n \n \nYou cannot afford to play \"water under the bridge\" on this one because if you fail to recognize the problems and the culpability in this, it increases the odds of a reoccurance, not just in the gay community but for every population subset that may be disproportionatly succeptible to a future health threat.\n\n \n There is a reoccurence. It's happening all over again in the black community. It's happening all over again in India. In China. Precious little has been learned. Pardon me, a great deal has been learned -- it's just not getting implemented. Gay people's fault again????\n \n \nWe would certainly still have an aids problem regardless of the early history of the disease in the US. If the CDC had been allowed to insist ont heir early course of action, close the public sex establishments and engage in a massive educational campaign targeted at the gay community, it would probably be another 50 years before aids was as widespread in the US as it is today. Hundreds of thousands of lives could have been saved, most of them gay men. \n\n \n Perhaps. If the bathhouses had been closed, and the educational campaign had begun, and people's insurance had been protected, and their jobs had been protected, and anti-gay rhetoric would have been held to a minimum, and people had been compassionate toward the sick, and Congress had appropriated money, and the President had said one fricken word about it, things might have been far different.\n \n As for your speculation about HIV's spread over 50 years, every society faces different risk factors. South Africa has the exacerbating problem of displaced males living away from their wives. Russia has rampant drug use. China and India have the twin problems of poverty and prudery.\n \n America's achilles heel has been and still is homophobia. Low educational levels and political pandering haven't helped. \n \n If you're going to respond to any of what I've said, please start with this: you keep mentioning this massive public information campaign. WHO stopped that one? \n \n \nI think this underscores the point of the thread pretty well. Radicalism is dangerous, regardless of what the radical is radical about. Religon tends to get picked on more frequently than other radical groups becuase there are far more religous radicals out there. Also, people disposed to religon seem to be more succeptible to being duped into following some lunatic to commit wholesale slaughter.\n\n \n Radicalism is dangerous, I'd agree. Pragmatism is what works. Information is pragmatic. Safe sex is pragmatic. Compassion is pragmatic. Reason is pragmatic.",

These guys are either quite a bit older than me (they're in their 70s and 80s) or come from areas of the country where the gay movement is decades behind. ALL of them remember that sex was MORE available, MORE anonymous, MORE frequent, MORE reckless before the movement. It was also more miserable and more unfulfillilng, but that's another issue.\n \n In any case, your argument confounds me. How can a movement of people defined and oppresssed BECAUSE of how they have sex leap into acceptance without defending their right to have sex the way they do????\n \n This seems to be another case of your lifting one issue completely out of its real context so that you are free to criticize it.",

   "As I said earlier, nonsense. AIDS became a pandemic because HIV is a virus to which we have no resistance. At some point, no matter what gay people or anyone else might have done, it would have taken hold, as it is doing in places around the world today. Gay people or no gay people, this virus has been very, very hard to fight.\n\n AIDS became a pandemic because it was spread. Initially, it was a local phenomenon. Without a mechanism to spread throughout society, it would never have gained traction. That traction came in the gay community. In fact, according to Avert.com, the epidemic in Africa may have been caused by travelers from Western infected countries returning to Africa. So, even Africa's epidemic may be imported.\n \n\n Both national and international travel undoubtedly had a major role in the initial spread of HIV. In the US , international travel by young men making the most of the gay sexual revolution of the late 70s and early 80s would certainly have played a large part in taking the virus worldwide. In Africa , the virus would probably have been spread along truck routes and between towns and cities within the continent itself. However, it is quite conceivable that some of the early outbreaks in African nations were not started by Africans infected with the 'original' virus at all, but by people visiting from overseas where the epidemic had been growing too. The process of transmission in a global pandemic is simply too complex to blame on any one group or individual.\n http://www.avert.org/origins.htm \n\n \n \n\n Only in the U.S. did the \"critical numbers\" initially involve mostly gay people (possibly also in Australia, I'm not sure). In Europe, the epidemic followed more than just the gay path. In Africa, which has suffered the most from HIV (so far), gay transmission was of minimal importance. The same is true in Eastern Europe, India, China. \n\n see above reference.\n \n\n It's impossible to read your comments on this subject without noticing that you really don't see all of humanity in the same bucket against HIV. It's as if it would have been just fine if gay people had AIDS as long as we hadn't \"spread it\". Is that your empathy at work???\n\n All of humanity is in the same bucket now because it was transmitted globally primarily through the gay community and later through contaminated blood. \n \n\n To your claim that gay people helped create the epidemic in the U.S., I'll add a twist. It's because it largely happened among gay men first that America was so slow to respond and so wrong in its responses. Had this happened to a minority that the larger society gave a damn about, maybe, just maybe the response would have been based on science and not bias. Maybe, just maybe, there might have been a more rational discussion of what paths to follow to fight the disease. Maybe, just maybe, St. Reagan might have uttered the word \"AIDS\" before years of epidemic had passed.\n\n The politically correct crowd thwarted early efforts to isolate and contain AIDS. It was gay activists in legion with the ACLU that prevented meaningful attempts to stop the pandemic when it would have still been relatively easy. \n While people with TB are identified and quarantined, those with HIV aren't. In fact, you can't even warn students, for example, that their teacher has HIV.\n \n\n Wonder? No. It's the easy, bigoted way to look at it and it surprises me not in the least that many straights like to look at it that way.\n\n If we hadn't been so damned accomodating to gays with HIV early on, the problem wouldn't have ever reached epidemic proportions. You may consider that bigotted. It's not, it's reality. We quarantined cities to prevent SARS but didn't dare inconvenience anyone with HIV. Ridiculous!",

   ".....\n \n In Africa, heterosexuals far out number gays with aids not because homosexual sex is any safer, but because there are more heterosexuals. The initial spread of aids in africa was not thorugh sexual transmission at all. It was the result of vaccination and health programs, most run by christian charities. Nurses would set up and give vaccinations and antibiotic shots all day, sometimes to literally thousands of people, using the same needle for everybody as a cost saving measure. By the time AIDS was understood, it was all over africa, and spread fairly evenly. In the US, it started rather slowly then took off like wildfire. In Africa, by the time it was discovered, it was already a pandemic.\n\n What you described is a variation of the \"colonialism Theory\".\n \n\n The Colonialism Theory\n The colonialism or 'Heart of Darkness' theory, is one of the more recent theories to have entered into the debate. It is again based on the basic 'hunter' premise, but more thoroughly explains how this original infection could have lead to an epidemic. It was first proposed in 2000 by Jim Moore, an American specialist in primate behaviour, who published his findings in the journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses.6\n \n During the late 19th and early 20 th century, much of Africa was ruled by colonial forces. In areas such as French Equatorial Africa and the Belgian Congo, colonial rule was particularly harsh and many Africans were forced into labour camps where sanitation was poor, food was scare and physical demands were extreme. These factors alone would have been sufficient to create poor health in anyone, so SIV could easily have infiltrated the labour force and taken advantage of their weakened immune systems to become HIV. A stray and perhaps sick chimpanzee with SIV would have made a welcome extra source of food for the workers.\n \n Moore also believes that many of the labourers would have been inoculated with unsterile needles against diseases such as smallpox (to keep them alive and working), and that many of the camps actively employed prostitutes to keep the workers happy, creating numerous possibilities for onward transmission. A large number of labourers would have died before they even developed the first symptoms of AIDS, and those that did get sick would not have stood out as any different in an already disease-ridden population. Even if they had been identified, all evidence (including medical records) that the camps existed was destroyed to cover up the fact that a staggering 50% of the local population were wiped out there.\n \n One final factor Moore uses to support his theory, is the fact that the labour camps were set up around the time that HIV was first believed to have passed into humans - the early part of the 20th century.\n http://www.avert.org/origins.htm\n \n\n \n I believe that the epidemic in Africa is due to the cultural promiscuity practiced in much of the African countries experiencing the epidemic.\n \n\n Africa is the only region of the world where more women than men are being infected with HIV and dying from AIDS-related causes. Fifty-five percent of HIV positive adults in Sub-Saharan Africa are women, and heterosexual activity is the principal mode of transmission. Women may have higher prevalence than men because they are more susceptible to HIV infection, and because they are more likely to be exposed to an infected partner. \n http://www.prcdc.org/summaries/aidsinafrica/aidsinafrica.html\n \n",

   "Your posts indicate familiarity the with the subject, but it's a familiarity with blinders on and viewed through a shaded lens.\n \n I get so tired of people deriding \"gay activists\". YOUR UNCLE IS A GAY ACTIVIST. He's gay and he was/is an activist. In your twisted view of what happened in San Francisco, you'd even have to classify him as a \"radical gay activist\" since you say his position was so against the grain (which isn't true, but I'll get to that).\n\n \n I don't think I have mentioned gay activists once int his thread. I have mentioned leaders of the gay community. Maybe that is where the confusion lies. To me, a gay activist would be somebody working to the benifit of the gay community. Unfortunatly, ay activists were not the leaders of the gay liberation movement. The community instead followed the radicals, who were interested primarily in getting their peckers wet, getting rich, and ensuring that they accomplished enough to keep book royalties, cash for speaking engagements, and donations flowing it, but not enough to actually remove the perpetual victim status from the gay minority. They knew which side their bread was buttered on.\n \n \n \nSan Francisco is blessed (or cursed, depending) with a lot of fringe groups, most on \"the left\", some on \"the right\". I put those in quotation marks because many of these tiny groups hold beliefs that are more extraterrestial than they are political. There is a small, and VERY VOCAL group that has fought science and logic and reason and common sense and government and the CDC and the City's real gay leadership for decades about AIDS. They hold ridiculous views (AIDS isn't caused by HIV, AIDS is a CIA plot, etc.) and are largely ignored by everyone. Which is hard to do, since they employ some pretty offensive tactics (like vandalism and spitting on people and disrupting meetings, etc.). They are not San Francisco's gay leadership. They're wackos.\n\n \n In 1981, 73% of gay men in San Francisco were postive for hepatits B. Fully 80% of visitors to San Franciscos VD clinics were gay men. We are not talking a fringe group of folks involved in the activities that fueled the outbreak. \n \n \n \nSo, back to your point. If the CDC recommended closing the bathhouses and mounting an extensive campaign targeting the gay male community, what happened? Well, the bathhouses DID close here. (more about that later) They didn't close in other cities. Hmmm. And what about the information campaign? An AIDS information campaign has gone on for two and a half decades in this city, largely funded by local government and local gay and AIDS organizations. When I visit other cities, I hardly see anything. If you go to the South, it's like there never was an epidemic. Is there a national campaign? Were there widespread efforts to educate America about AIDS and how to prevent it? No. Whose responsibility is that? You can't seriously blame gay people, can you? \n\n \n What happened? Guys like my uncle got the bath houses closed. Leaders of the \"liberation\" movement (lets face it, it was a holocaust movement) and their political dogs went to work on the CDC. In the first year of the outbreak, the CDC allocate half a BILLION dollars for a massive public education campaign targeted at the gay community as the principal carriers. Of they money, over $400 Million was specifically intended for ad campaigns, literature, and public forums aimed at the gay community. After the radicals in the gay community and their pet politicians got done, over 80% of that money went to educating high school and college kids, despite the fact that they made up less than .5% of infectees. The CDC fought that tooth and nail. The radicals pushing their agenda argued that portraying aids as a \"gay\" disease would invite discriminaiton of gays. At the time, AIDS WAS a gay disease. \n \n It was not until it had swept through they gay community that the restraints put on the CDC were finally lifted, and they were allowed to target their campaign appropriatly. \n \n \n \nWhere in the world are you getting that number? I'm not suggesting that the bathhouses were not places where a lot of men got HIV. With unsafe sex, of course places that encourage multiple contacts result in more infections. My point, however, is that even though that would be the worst possible situation, the better choice between closing bathhouses and providing information is providing information. Common sense might indicate that doing BOTH would be the best solution, but studies have shown that rates have declined most when the bathhouses have fully cooperated in providing information, testing, and condoms. \n\n \n The numbers come from Rotello.\n \n Absolutly. The best option was to close bathhouses and provide information, which is why the spread fo AIDS in SF slowed at a MUCH greater rate than in cities where they did not close the bath houses. \n \n Whihc studies have shown that bath houses providing education, testing, and condoms was more effective than closing them and providing information? \n \n \n \nWhy? Because a LOT of patrons of bathhouses are not \"gay men\". They are closeted, or married, or in the military, or confused. They are isolated from much of the information about AIDS because they are not part of the gay community and, therefore, aren't exposed to what little information this society disseminates about the disease. Bathhouses are often the only place they encounter the anti-AIDS campaign.\n\n \n That is absolutly rediculous. Exactly what percentage fo those visiting bath houses do you think fit the above criteria? Maybe 1%? Without the bath houses, it is far more likely that those folks would have either NOT had unprotected sex with other men, or would have been in a monogomous relationship with one. Your logic here is insane. If bath houses were the only place they encountered the anti gay campaign and they did not circulate in the wider gay community, closing the bath houses would have substantially decreased their odds of contracting aids. \n \n \nYes, that was the tiny minority I mentioned above. Ask your uncle their names. It's the same wackos, I bet. \n \n While you're at it, ask him if anyone else bears any responsibility. Feel free to report back.\n\n \n I neither have nor care for names. As far as the second question, this is something we have discussed at length, and as far as he is concerned, the gay community is 100% responsible for the scale of the epedimic. He worked for the CDC at the time, and nearly everybody on the AIDS awareness task force was a gay doctor. The CDC took that unprecedented step because otherwise every time they issued a public statement mentioning the gay community they were accused of being homophobes or spreading anti gay sentiment. Those guys would go out to give speeches and get booed off the stage. \n \n \nI don't think you understand much about this issue at all. SOME gay men certainly bear responsibility. So do SOME Republican presidents. (well, all to date) So do SOME religious leaders. \n\n \n Every president since AIDS hit this country has fully funded the CDC's aids education campaigns. \n \n \nAlmost all of the gay men who did bear responsibility are dead. The consequences for the gay-baiting, bigoted religious and political leaders who made this epidemic far worse and who still impede real progress against it seem to have been far more favorable. Look where they are.\n\n \n As far as the agy men who bear responsibility...good riddance to bad rubbish. As for as the politicains who aided in the spread, hopefully they will die agonizing deaths as well. Religous leaders? Are you crazy? This is one instance where we cannot blame religous leaders for mass casualties. I am unaware of any reports that promiscuity among religous leaders is a major cause fo the spread of HIV. I am also unaware of any report that educaitonal programs were affected by religous leaders, or that they were forcing you guys at gunpoint to intentionally engage in unsafe sex. Generally you can find a religous tie in to this kind of thing. In this case, there simply is not one. In fact, if the gay community had listened to religous leaders rail against the promiscous lifestyle they were leading, more of them would have survived.\n \n \n \nThere is a reoccurence. It's happening all over again in the black community. It's happening all over again in India. In China. Precious little has been learned. Pardon me, a great deal has been learned -- it's just not getting implemented. Gay people's fault again????\n\n \n No, and no. The spread fo AIDS in the black community, india, or china is NOTHING compared to the spread in the gay community in the United states. It does nto even COMPARE. It does not even come CLOSE.\n \n \n \nPerhaps. If the bathhouses had been closed, and the educational campaign had begun, and people's insurance had been protected, and their jobs had been protected, and anti-gay rhetoric would have been held to a minimum, and people had been compassionate toward the sick, and Congress had appropriated money, and the President had said one fricken word about it, things might have been far different.\n\n \n Yes, it is everybody elses fault. They FORCED those gus to hump every thing within reach. I think it time to grow up and take some responsibility. The AIDS epidemic in the US was spread by promiscous homosexual sex. None of the above are related. It was irresponsible, STUPID behavior and there is only ONE group that can really carry the blame for what they do with their peckers. Blaming others for failure to control your dick is inappropriate, illogical, and childish. \n \n the money was there for education. The people were in place. When your target group sues you every time you suggest that they are the targeted group, there just isn't a whole lot of educating that is going to take place.\n \n \nAs for your speculation about HIV's spread over 50 years, every society faces different risk factors. South Africa has the exacerbating problem of displaced males living away from their wives. Russia has rampant drug use. China and India have the twin problems of poverty and prudery.\n\n \n I am not talking about Africa, China, or India. I am talking about the US. Look at infection rates then come back if you want to argue the point. \n \n \nAmerica's achilles heel has been and still is homophobia. Low educational levels and political pandering haven't helped. \n \n \n Homophobia spreads aids? Your quest for a scapegoat is getting desperate.\n \n \nIf you're going to respond to any of what I've said, please start with this: you keep mentioning this massive public information campaign. WHO stopped that one? \n\n \n The Gay Liberation Front stopped it by filing a massive lawsuit claiming that the CDCs efforts to target their educational efforts at the gay community were discriminatory.",

I have the right to have straight sex. I don't run around and bed hundreds of women because it would be foolish and unhealthy and becuase we live in a society that does not condone having hundreds of sexual partners. That is just life. If you want acceptance in your society, you have to be willing to accept some of that societies values....that is what makes you a member of the society. I don't think that straight folks would have had nearly the problems with acceptance if not for the way the comapign was carried out.\n \n As is, the gay community did a GREAT job of alienating themselves fromt he rest of society. As an added bonus for the homophobes and religous zealots, they spread an epidemic among their ranks that they will continue to kill them in disproportionatly large numbers for decades. The homophobes and religous zealots will be dancing on the graves of millions of gays men for years to come becuase the gay community turned a fight for equality into a massive viral outbreak.\n \n Way to go!

As it is AIDS is spreading equally rapidly through the gay and straight communities, given their disparate initial infection pools. Your gay bashing is based on lies.\n\n \n Not true. Aids is a bloodborne pathogen. As such, it is actually very difficult to contract. When aids furst started showign up in the US, nobody believed that it would have had NEARLY the infectios rate that it did. Aids is not really an STD. You do not get aids by having sex, you get aids due to bodily fluids entering your BLOODSTREAM during sex. In heterosexual sex, this si not something that happens all that often. \n \n As of 2003, an estimated 440,887 cases of aids were caused by male to male sexual contact. Comtrast that to the only 149,989 attributed to heterosexual contact. Considering that gay males are an extreme minority in the united states, that is a HUGE increased risk factor.\n \n The simple fact of the matter is that male to male sex is a much riskier activity than heterosexual sex.\n \n If patient 0 had been straight, and the timetable was unadjusted, we would still see the majority of AIDS cases showing up in gay males. As I think I have shown, it was the sexual aspects fo the gay liberation movement and the politicizing of the CDCs response that was responsible for the spread of AIDS.\n \n Gay bashing? Hatred? This is a scientific discussion. Neither gay bashing or personal feelings about gays has any place here. Admittedly the title of the thread is inflamatory, and JP has already explained that it does not reflect his personal views. I considered refrainign from posting int he thread due to the title, but I find the topic interesting. I don't think there is any gay bashing or hatred apparent here.",

After the radicals in the gay community and their pet politicians got done, over 80% of that money went to educating high school and college kids, despite the fact that they made up less than .5% of infectees.\n \n ...\n \n The Gay Liberation Front stopped it by filing a massive lawsuit claiming that the CDCs efforts to target their educational efforts at the gay community were discriminatory.\n\n \n You should have no trouble pointing us to that lawsuit.

Considering that gay males are an extreme minority in the united states, that is a HUGE increased risk factor.\n\n \n No, in fact it isn't. What you've failed to take into account is the initial infection pool. If more gays have HIV at a given moment, then gays are more likely to catch HIV, not because their activities are inherently more dangerous, but because any random parter is more likely to be infected. Look at the numbers from the CDC site:\n http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats.htm#exposure\n \n As of 2003, 440,887 gays had HIV, with 17,969 new cases that year. Straights had 149,989 cases, with 13,260 new cases. Straights outnumber gays about 10 to 1, right? So all else being equal, you would expect the infection rate for straights to be 10 times that for gays. You've noticed that it's lower than that, but jumped to the wrong conclusion as to why. What isn't equal is original infection numbers. Because gays were exposed first the disease spread originialy through the gay population, so any random gay sex partner is more likely to have HIV than a random straight partner. Call the US popution in 2003 250 million. That gives about 25 million gays and 225 million straights. Using the CDC numbers, that means about 1.76 % of the gay population had HIV compared to .07 % for straights. That's 25 times higher. With those starting numbers, all else being equal, gays should be catching HIV 25 times more often than straights. GIven their smaller numbers, you would expect them to be getting HIV 2.5 times more often (25/10). What do we see in reality? Their rate is only 1.4 times that of straights.

Anal intercourse without a condom is the highest risk sexual activity because the rectal lining is fragile and prone to tearing, thus allowing easy access for infected blood and semen. One San Franciscan study found that a person who has unprotected anal intercourse is two-and-a-half times more likely to contract HIV than a person who does not.\n\n \n http://www.globalchange.com/ttaa/ttaa%204.htm\n \n \nIn America and Europe HIV has spread rapidly through gay communities. Why? There are two reasons. First, it does appear that someone who allows a man to push his penis into his rectum and ejaculate there has a particularly high risk of getting the infection. The lining of the anus is fragile. The lining of the rectum is also likely to bleed during anal intercourse, especially if a pre-sex douche (enema) or a dildo (artificial penis) is used. It is possible that some cells in the rectum have surfaces particularly suited for HIV to latch on to and can become a reservoir for infecting the whole body.\n\n \n http://sachet.org.pk/home/agehi_resource_center/dosti/hiv_aids.asp\n \n \nAlthough all types of sexual intercourse can transmit an HIV, some practices are riskier than others. Unprotected receptive anal intercourse is riskiest, probably because during anal sex the rectal lining often tears slightly, exposing blood vessels to infected cells in semen. \n\n \n http://www.albany.edu/sph/AIDS/aids101_2.html\n \n \nWhy is anal sex a high risk activity for HIV infection? \n \n The walls of the anus and rectum are thin and richly supplied with blood vessels which can be injured during anal sex. HIV infected semen can be easily absorbed through these thin walls and into the bloodstream. Injured tissue in the anus and rectum can expose the penis to blood containing HIV, as well. Unprotected anal sex with a partner who is infected or whose HIV status is unknown is the most risky sexual activity for both men and women. While latex condoms provide protection, their failure rate during anal sex is greater than that for vaginal or oral sex. \n\n \n Facts is facts. The highest risk activity for transmission of aids is anal sex. Thats all there is to it. While your attitude is certainly more politically correct, it also relies on incorrect information and carries a likelyhood of getting people killed.",

Carry on with your delusions and disinformation. I recommend anyone reading to look for more reliable sources. Start by looking at the truth of Reagan's AIDS budgets. That ought to illuminate Daewoo's \"facts\".\n\n \n Most callous and misinformed? I believe I have backed up just about every fact I have stated here. Here is an article about Regans budget for aids. Keep in mind that is money allocated OVER and BEYOND the CDCs regular budget. \n \n http://www.indegayforum.org/authors/murdock/murdock4.html\n \n \nI would add that President Reagan indeed used the word \"AIDS\" in a September 17, 1985, press conference. So the widely accepted myth that he did not even utter those four letters until 1987 remains precisely that:a myth.\n \n Finally, while President Reagan's critics are free to argue that he should have done more about AIDS, and perhaps he should have, the fact that total federal HIV/AIDS expenditures grew from $0 to $5.727 billion on his watch belies the notion that he \"did nothing\" about this vicious disease.\n\n \n \n\"As I recall, from 1984 onward - and bear in mind that the AIDS virus was not identified until 1982 - every Reagan budget contained a large sum of money specifically earmarked for AIDS,\" says Peter Robinson, a former Reagan speechwriter and author of How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life. \"Now, people will argue that it wasn't enough,\" Robinson adds. \"But, of course, that's the kind of argument that takes place over every item in the federal budget. Nevertheless, the notion that he was somehow callous or had a cruel or cynical attitude towards homosexuals or AIDS victims is just ridiculous.\"\n\n \n \nPrecise budget requests are difficult to calculate, as online records from the 1980s are spotty. Nevertheless, New York University's archived, hard copies of budget documents from fiscal year 1984 through FY 1989 show that Reagan proposed at least $2.79 billion for AIDS research, education, and treatment. In a Congressional Research Service study titled AIDS Funding for Federal Government Programs: FY1981-FY1999, author Judith Johnson found that overall, the federal government spent $5.727 billion on AIDS under Ronald Reagan. This higher number reflects President Reagan's proposals as well as additional expenditures approved by Congress that he later signed.\n\n \n Again, all this was over and above the CDCs regular budget, which is NOT inconsiderable. Until 1986 the CDCs ENTIRE infectious disease prevention education budget was aimed at AIDS. They did this because AIDS was considered an easily contained risk. After all, it is NOT an easy disease to get. An educational campaign and some public health regulation changes should have taken care of the problem. They did not count on the most heavily infected group of people rallying against them. \n \n It hurts to talk about? I would imagine so. Bad news. I don't care if it hurts. I care if you get aids and pass it on and kill yourself and a bunch of other people in the process. Your self esteem and emotional state take back seat to that. It hurts when I take my kids to get vaccinations. The polio shot hurts one hell of a lot less than polio does.\n \n Eevn 20 years later, with gay males being the largest carriers of AIDS, and gay sex the most frequent mechanism for its passage, you people STILL are not getting it, and as evidenced byt his thread, living in a state of denial.\n \n http://www.sfaf.org/aboutsfaf/outreach/index.html?june01/pride.html~frontpage\n \n \nLots of fun. Great weather. Men are everywhere. It's a time for enjoying all the best stuff about being gay -- the costumes, the parties, the sex. To begin with, San Francisco is like no place else on earth. Lots of guys are going to be coming into town. It's going to be a hot time in the city. \n\n \n \nThere's no doubt that during this Pride season a lot of us want to have some great sex. It's one of the ways we celebrate our hard-won rights. And we've worked really hard for the right to have sex the ways we want to. Making a fully informed and active decision about how to #### healthfully is perhaps the best expression of Pride around\n\n \n \n You want to celebrate your hard won freedoms, get a T shirt that says \"I'm gay and insured\" or \"I'm gay and you can't fire me for it\". Engaging in sexual bahavior that carries a high risk of DEATH is not a demonstration of freedom, it is an exercise in stupidity.",

If everything was the same except that there were 10 times more straights than gays, than the ROI should be 10 times higher for straights.

HHS Discretionary spending targetted for AIDS was $5.555Million that year. His last budget, 1989 included $1.3Billion in HHS discretionary spending alone targetted for AIDS and another $1Billion in AIDS-related healthcare.

   "No, in fact it isn't. What you've failed to take into account is the initial infection pool. If more gays have HIV at a given moment, then gays are more likely to catch HIV, not because their activities are inherently more dangerous, but because any random parter is more likely to be infected. Look at the numbers from the CDC site:\n http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats.htm#exposure\n \n As of 2003, 440,887 gays had HIV, with 17,969 new cases that year. Straights had 149,989 cases, with 13,260 new cases. Straights outnumber gays about 10 to 1, right? So all else being equal, you would expect the infection rate for straights to be 10 times that for gays. You've noticed that it's lower than that, but jumped to the wrong conclusion as to why. What isn't equal is original infection numbers. Because gays were exposed first the disease spread originialy through the gay population, so any random gay sex partner is more likely to have HIV than a random straight partner. Call the US popution in 2003 250 million. That gives about 25 million gays and 225 million straights. Using the CDC numbers, that means about 1.76 % of the gay population had HIV compared to .07 % for straights. That's 25 times higher. With those starting numbers, all else being equal, gays should be catching HIV 25 times more often than straights. GIven their smaller numbers, you would expect them to be getting HIV 2.5 times more often (25/10). What do we see in reality? Their rate is only 1.4 times that of straights. If gay sex really was inherently more risky the infection rate would be higher than 2.5 times that of straights. Instead, it's lower. If anything we must conclude that straights engage in riskier behaviors than gays.\n\n \n What your attempt at mathematical obfuscation failed to take into consideration is the number of straights that contracted AIDs via dirty needles, transfusions and bisexuals.\n http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/news/prevention.pdf\n \n 70% of new cases are males, 60% by MSM, 15% from Hetero sex and 25% from injectable drug usage.\n \n 30% are women, 25% from drug use and 75% from sexual contact. Of those, 11% had sex with injectable drug users, 29% had sex with high risk males (bisexuals, hemopheliacs, transfusion recipients, etc.) for a total of 40% from heterosexual sex. 32% were unspecified causes. \n \n No matter how you attempt to spin the data, the highest % of new cases are amongst MSM. If gay males account for 5% of the population, all things being equal, they should account for 5% of all AIDS victims. They are over-represented by a factor of 1200%. Now, if anal sex is only practiced by a small fraction of gay males, let's say 10%, then anal sex would boost the above risk factor to 12000%. emoticon_wow",

   "From the paper \"Hate on the Net: A Question of Rights / A Question of Power\" by Evelyn Kallen, York University: \nIn order to \"justify\" harmful discriminatory action against targeted minorities, in clear violation of their fundamental human rights, organized hate groups throughout the globe rely on and promote invalidation myths and ideologies through which they attempt to invalidate, in essence, to dehumanize, identified minorities and thus to legitimize violation of their human rights.\n \n Let me take a minute or two to elaborate on the concept of invalidation, which I hold to be critical for the analysis of hate propaganda and its harmful effects. Invalidation myths are falsified statements which allege that identified human populations are innately inferior or invalid (defective) with regard to particular human attributes (Kallen 1995: 22). For example, (as will be amply demonstrated throughout this paper) Jews are depicted in prevailing anti-Semitic myths as \"devils incarnate\" - unscrupulous power-hungry and money-hungry manipulators of media, governments and international finance, whose only loyalty is to other Jews. Blacks are classified in racist myths as racially, culturally and morally inferior sub-human beings - criminally inclined dope-peddlers, wife-beaters and murderers. Gay men are identified in heterosexist/homophobic myths as anti-human beings - sinful, perverted, promiscuous sex-seekers, life threatening AIDS-carriers and transmitters of disease and death.\n \n Invalidation ideologies - like anti-Semitism, white racism and heterosexism - are spurious theories which are designed to give credibility to invalidation myths by providing purported \"evidence\" for them (Kallen op cit). The arguments are premised on scientifically unsupportable assumptions about differences in human attributes among various populations; prejudicial assumptions which serve to inferiorize, to invalidate, particular populations and thus to provide a platform for discriminatory action against them. Typically, pseudo-scientific and/or pseudo-religious \"evidence\" of minority inferiority or dangerousness is manipulated in order to justify violations of minority rights.\n \n Hate propaganda represents probably the most malignant expression of invalidation ideology, for it not only inferiorizes target populations, but it also singles them out as dangerous and threatening to society. Not surprisingly, it follows from this premise that hate propaganda urges its audience to take steps to eliminate the purported threat. What begins as prejudice is thus translated into discrimination through hate-mongering activities which incite hate and harm against the target group.\n http://www.sociology.org/content/vol003.002/kallen.html",

   "Don't be silly. Just because the disease had a stigma of being a 'gay disease' doesn't mean there weren't some straights that had it too very early on. In fact, we know there were.\n\n \n This early history may suggest the disease had an earlier start in the gay community in the USA. It shows cases were reported among gays before any known cases were reported among straights...\n \n http://www.avert.org/his81_86.htm\n \n \nCome on, now. You KNOW that the disease mostly spread because of gay men early on. This is not a generalization--it's reality. In saying there were many reasons (I assume you mostly mean straight sex and drug use)you are trying to argue the exceptions over the rule. No one is saying there weren't occassional cases of straight infections as well, or some spreading by drug use. It's not \"judging.\" This is historical fact.\n\n \n Sorry if I wasn't clear, there. I was taking issue with your subjective judgment that gays did not react quickly enough to curb it's spread. I showed a study which suggested they reacted quite quickly by changing their practices, and dramatically lowering the previous rate of spread. This could only happen once the education of what exactly it was, what caused it, and how to prevent it, had occured. See my above link which demonstrates a few years of early confusion concerning those things. I would say that the early transmission was due to ignorance. Saying it was spread because of gay men in the U.S., is like saying SARS was spread because of Asians. It's a pretty simple way to look at the issue of a disease or virus, which doesn't care about a human's identity. However, if you are only looking at history, and even that can be difficult with HIV/AIDS, then okay, that is not necessarily making a judgment. \n \n \nYou know, about saying it's because of the \"gay community\", you're right I suppose--that phrase is a generalization. I'll take it back. It doesn't change the reality we're discussing here, but it's my desire to avoid generalization anytime I can, so I'll retract that.\n\n \n Thanks, I appreciate that.",

   "There is an extant myth, propagated by the Christian Right, that homosexuals engage in highly promiscuous behavior. Granted, there are some homosexuals that do engage in such behavior. But there are heterosexuals that do the same thing. What is important to recognize is the substantial heterosexist bias that causes people to ignore heterosexual flaws while highlighting homosexual flaws.\n \n a) One study which appears to support the idea that homosexuals are highly promiscuous was published by Bell and Weinberg, and is often cited by the Christian Right, and even some secular sources. However, their data is highly suspicious, and cannot be generalized to the entire homosexual population. Because of their methodology, their data is valuable only as a case study for the sample they studied, but it is not by any means representative of the general gay population. See Appendix A for my specific critique of this study, and why their statistics on gay promiscuity are so bizarrely high. \n \n b) In a study of sexual behavior in homosexuals and heterosexuals, the researchers found that of gay and bisexual men, 24% had one male partner in their lifetime, 45% had 2-4 male partners, 13% had 5-9 male partners, and 18% had 10 or more sexual partners, which produces a mean of less than 6 partners. (The statistics I did by myself using the data presented, which is presented as a percentage of total males interviewed, both gay and straight (p. 345)--they can be verified yourself by looking at the numbers given in the paper)(Fay; n=97 gay males of 1450 males total). In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy). This data indicates that gay men may have fewer number of sexual partners than heterosexuals. \n \n J Billy-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25:52-60 \n R Fay-1989, Science 243:338-348\n \n In another set of studies, the first (n=2664) showed that gay men had an average of 6.5 sexual partners in the past 5 years. In fact, the authors of this paper report that \"homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate\" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs). The table indicates the percentage of men having the given number of sexual partners in the previous year [top row: Binson; bottom row: Dolcini]: \n \n orientation no partners 1 partner 2+ partners \n gay 24 % 41 % 35 % \n straight 8 % 80 % 12 % \n \n \n D Binson-1995: Journal of Sex Research 32: 245-54.\n M Dolcini-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25: 208-14.\n \n A third major study, by Laumann, appears on the surface to indicate that gay men do have many more sexual partners than heterosexual men. However, a more extensive analysis of the data gives a more balanced perspective. Laumann fails to explore the radically skewed nature of the data. Typically this indicates that the mean, the statistic presented by Laumann, may not be the best measure to report. A further analysis of the GSS data (on which Laumann based his results) indicates that the median (50th percentile) number of sexual partners for heterosexuals is five and for homosexuals is six (http://www.jeramyt.org/gss/partners.html). The discrepancy between the mean and median is indicative of a small sub-population of gay males who tend towards high rates of sexual partners, skewing the mean, while the majority of gay men tend to have rates about the same as heterosexual males. \n \n Laumann, Edward, et al.

From a public health perspective regarding AIDS, which would be better: all sex outside a momogamous relationship between tested individual protected, whether promiscuous or not OR only promiscuous sex protected and non-promiscuous sex unprotected?

Another coincidence? emoticon_confused\n\n \n Not true. I cited a studty earlier conducted over several years during the late 70's and early 80s that showed that 14% of gay men were in monogamous relationships, 43% had been with over 500 men, and fully 1/3 had been with 1000 or more. \n \n At the time those in the gay liberation movement were thrilled with these numbers. They were proof that their \"revolution\" was suceeding. Now gay men generally try to distance themselves from these numbers. \n \n Arguing semantics, or definitions (such as \"what exactly is the definition of promiscous\") is a way of avoiding the realities fo the situation. It is much easier to try to blame Reagan fo \"not saying the word \"Aids\" for X number of years or try to blame heterosexauls for not funding aids research or education campaigns (both claims that I have refuted in this thread) than to accept and admit the fact that it was the promiscous anal sex encouraged by the gay liberation movement that led to the spread and growth of AIDS. \n \n The first report by the CDC on the transmission of the aids virus estimated fewer than 10,000 cases in the US over the next 20 years (reprot was written in 1984) because aids, being primarily bloodborne, is not hat easy tio get. Even with sexual transmission, they estimated that an HIV positive person would only transmit the virus in 1 of 20 sexual encounters becuase while aids CAN be transmitted vaginally, it is far easier to spread through anal sex. When more reports started ocming in about aids, and they realized that it was runnign rampant through the gay community, they revised that 10,000 figure upwards nearly 100 fold. \n \n Back to the title fo the thread....I don't know that gays actually murdered anybody. Their incredible stupid behavior, however, led to an awful lot of deaths. Human history is little more than a history of stupidity with a few moments of brilliance, so they are in good ocmpany as far as the stupid behavior thing goes.",

He told me what a glory hole is. \n \n What those fine folks who worked so hard to make sex the cornerstone of gay liberation...and thsoe who still do so today, is that while the taboo against promiscous sex is certainly a cultural taboo, it is one shared by most cultures. Like many other cultural taboos (and many religous taboos), it is based not on an idea of morality or religous precedent, but on good old fashioned common sense. STDs are not new. People noticed, over the years, that if you slept with a lot of people, you tended to get cetain ailments and sometimes die. We have reports and descriptions of STDs from the earliest writings of man. This is also likely why virgins were (and to some extent still are) prized as wives. They were safe.\n \n Many of our taboos are based not on uptight morality, but more on an awareness of public heath and disease vectors, even during ancient times. STDs were well known. It was undrestood that incest (almost all cultures hold strong taboos against incest) leads to undesirable result. Pork was taboo for centuries for most religous groups primarily becuase they had no refigeration, and pork spoils more quickly than other meats, and there are several organisms specific to pork that have no odor.\n \n This is what people failed to recognize during the sexual revolution and the later gay liberation movement. The gay liberation movement was particularly disasterous because anal sex is much more dangerous than vaginal sex when it comes to the spread of disease (likely the reason there tends to be a cultural taboo against anal sex specifically in most cultures).",

And if it takes ONE infected person, the more you are with is only going of increase the chance of something going wrong. There is a greater likelihood of 1 in 500 condoms failing than 1 in 5.

Hence the protection angle.\n \n \nThat's a BIG \"if\".

Do you actually think most sexually tansmitted HIV infections come from monogamous relationships? They don't. \n\n \n Two of my best friends contracted HIV from their (then) boyfriends, who they were faithful to. They weren't promiscuous and they got it. If they had used protection with their partners they would not have.\n \n That pesky protection angle ...\n \n \n This isn't a case of \"misinformation\".

As is, we have a serious epidemic in the rest of the world.\n\n \n It's not that simple at all. One reason it spread so rapidly in the gay community as opposed to the straight one is that gays tend to employ anal sex a lot more than straights, and it's well known to allow STD spreading more easily. And, gays knew how to prevent STDs (which have been around for eons)--they just didn't bother until it was too late. Straights also used condoms more already simply because their sexual activities could result in pregnancy, unlike what goes on between gay men.\n \n The reason it's prevalent among straights in the \"rest of the world\" (really, mainly Africa) is also a complex issue. First, a lot of males in Africa aren't particularly concerned about getting women pregnant because many countries there don't impose child support. So many don't bother with condoms. Second, they simply have not had the education nor the protective measures available to them that they need. There's every reason to believe that HIV is also prevalent among the gay population in Africa too, it's just that you hear about the straights a lot more there because there aren't as many people living in gay relationships there (or, to use gay-esque language, they are in the closet and not out in the open as much).\n \n If \"patient zero\" HAD been involved in opposite-sex relations instead of gay ones, it might NOT have spread as rapidly. He might have been more prone to use protection to begin with (given that there was risk of pregnancy), or have had normal intercourse instead of anal sex which could have made a difference. Besides, we don't know that there was a single \"patient zero.\" HIV could have began spreading with several people at once for all we know.",

   "Who are you to judge it as irresponsible behaviour? Hindsight is 20/20. It also helps when information is available on HIV/AIDS. In the early days of the HIV/AIDS in the U.S., there was a lack of information. People didn't know how it happend, how it was spread, nor how to prevent it. Obviously, today, with this information, we define what responsible or less risky behaviour is for the prevention of HIV. \n \n Should one have different tax rate if one is straight? Should only gay people directly pay for this, including if they do not have the disease?\n\n \n \n You missed the point of my reply to Mathew S completely. I said that straights had a say in attempting to curb risky behavior because they were paying for the effects of that risky behavior. That's what gave them the right to interfere.
