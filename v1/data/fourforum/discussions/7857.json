I was just reminded of a regular article that used to run in a paper (the Times, I think) entitled \"Interesting Historical Questions to which the Answer is 'No' \". Which this, along with so many conspiracies, seems to fit.\n \n I don't deny the video is interesting; and it makes fascinating points. I also totally agree that there are elements of the WT attacks and their aftermath that no doubt run contrary to what the government has told us.\n \n But I just don't believe that such an act was a massive conspiracy, and I from what I have seen so far from this an other sources I don't see a weight of evidence to override the 'official' story. As compelling as much of what the video says, so much of it is still conjecture; claims which cannot be proven either way, backed by various quotes which are understandably confused. I feel the burden of proof is on the conspiracy theorist, and so far they have not shown anything like the amount to satisfy me they have anything but a few irregularities and confused statements.\n \n I have only watched the first half so far, will finish it when I have the chance and post further then.",

   "Hmm. I've been thinking about the issue, and in the end the reason I feel it is not a conspiracy is not the government's lack of will to do such a thing necessarily (though I'm not saying they had/have it) but instead the fact that I just don't believe they could have.\n \n This is a government that failed to conceal that there were no WMDs in Iraq, failed to cover up their abuse of POWs and failed to cover up the fact that they had been making these so-called 'terror flights' around Europe. All of which would have been considerably easier to conceal than a cover-up on the monumental scale as the one required to plot, carry out and then falsify the 11 Sept attacks would have been.

   "IMO what the evidence points to is that the government story regarding 9/11 is wrong, but not necessarily that the government was behind it. \n \n Personally, I am not buying that the buildings came down soley becuase they were hit by a plane. Too many reports of secondary explosions from reputable sources (esp firefighters on scene) to buy that. \n \n I also think is it interesting that so many of the hijackers have turned up alive in various parts of the world. \n \n Here is my take on things:\n \n Our govenremtn was desperate to come up with an explanation and a villian in order to pacify the American people, as well as to push their militant agenda. SO, they pushed through an investigation, \"found\" the answer that they wanted, and pushed ahead with that.\n \n Beyond that, I think that just about everything is up in the air. I don't think it was a governemtn conspiracy simply because too many people would have to have been involved, and Government employees tend to have loose lips. I would certainly not rule out the possibility that this was an act by Americans, possibly including some powerful Americans.\n \n The only thing that can clear up such questions is disclosure.

   "I can't tell you the amount of conversations I have had with the conspiracy nuts about 9-11. I call them nuts because to date, not one has actually shown me any evidence. I hear alot of lies that I can easily prove to be lies, but no evidence.\n \n I heard it all from this genius on another forum. He posted constantly about the cover-up, the conspiracy, blah blah blah. He listed as his sources people who had no science background and people who weren't around. Anytime anyone would point out obvious flaws in his theories, he would say that they weren't scientific enough to understand. \n \n The interesting thing about his science, is that it wasn't science. For instance, he claimed that 757s did not hit the towers, that indeed it was remote controlled 737s. When I pointed out the fact that the pictures gave evidence that it could not have been a 737 because of the size of the hole, he ignored me. \n He insisted that the pentagon was not hit by a plane despite eye witness accounts that say it was hit by a plane. He claimed that physics was more important than eyewitness accounts. Of course, his physics was flawed due to the fact that he lied about the material used to re-enforce the pentagon building. \n He also claimed that there were secondary explosions at the WTC. He gave links to videos that he claimed proved this. They did not prove this, they only proved that the buildings fell because they were hit by large, fast, fuel filled airplanes. The \"explosions\" were in fact nothing more than debri being thrown from the very spot the planes hit the towers once they started to fall. They also fell from the top, not the bottom, destroying the lies about explosions at the bottom of the towers. \n \n These facts do nothing to persuade the conspiracy nuts. I would explain why this is true, but someone else has done a great job of explaining this for me. I'll just link up.\n http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/05/08/213417.php",

There is no \"If I had scored a couple points higher on my ASVAB I could have....\" Becuase what matters is not where you score, but how you score. GT is VE+AR.\n \n Here is a test for you. During my military career I taught south american scumbags how to torture people, and then joined a SF unit at the same base. What was my MOS?\n\n \n Oh wow, you know that the asvab has sections. WOW. Thats great. You also know that one of those sections tests your ability for what is needed for military intelligence then. Are you aware that the Marine Corps gives the asvab again during the first few weeks of boot camp and then takes those who scored a certain way and gives them a secondary test to see if they can decifer code?\n And you might want to pay attention. You were the one who thought it was fun to lecture everyone else on courage and you were the one who said that those who are currently in Iraq on the line are the ones who are lacking. You have of course, per your SOP, not proved any argument for this, but you made the statement none the less. \n And I really don't think I know the torture south americans MOS. I would have to guess that you were an 03 something if you were in the Marine Corps. But I would of course be suspicious of anyone who claimed to be in the military who calls those serving in Iraq cowards.",
