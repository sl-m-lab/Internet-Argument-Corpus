I do not think that the protestant church declares that heaven is where there is no memory of our past. God has declared that he will remember our sins no more. That is true.\n \n I submit that Love as used in this context is not an emotion. That would be a noun. When using the word loving we are speaking of a verb. Love is an action. Acting lovingly is to act in accord with the others best interests without regard to self. God did that. He would have been justified to allow all to suffer under judgement as we originally broke the law not him. Instead he sent his only son to be a propitiation for our sins. \n \n You equivocate the word love. You state that if God is Loving (verb) then..... but then you define love as an emotion. They are different words because they are different parts of speech and have different meanings.

   "Charchuk,\n \n \nEven the early Christians didn't belief in a hell as modern Christians do. To them it was either heaven or the void, non-existence. No torture, no everlasting torment. Our idea of hell came in with modern Christianity through the Church. The first Christians weren't into retribution.\n\n \n Early Christians did not believe in hell?\n \n The early Christians stated their belief in hell, an unquenchable fire, look at this:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Hell_There_Is.asp \n \n \nThe Church had taught that there was no memory of one's past on Earth while in heaven.\n\n \n Please elaborate on this teaching. I do not know much about it. Do you mean that we will not live in heaven quite like we do on earth? Do you mean that we will forget all of our earthly life? Do you mean that our past sins will be forgotten?\n \n \nAnyways, Jesus opened the gate to everyone by his \"sacrifice\" on the cross. That was the key which permited all to enter because all sins were forgiven there and then. You don't have to be saved if you are already a believer, so therefore everyone elses sins were automatically forgiven. To say otherwise would be to say that it was meaningless, another lie.\n\n \n \nThat is a contradictory statement. So, Christ died for nothing since we're going to be judged anyways for the sins which he was suppose to have wiped out by his \"sacrifice\".\n\n \n Catholic theology explains this by stating that Christ died for all of our sins. However, because God instilled in us free will, we must cooperate with the free gift of grace God gives us. We must in some sense participate in the redemptive suffering of Christ along with him. Not because his work was insufficient but because he allows us to participate with him...A father does not need his young son's help to put together his new computer but he allows the boy to help because the experience will bring them closer together in love and companionship.\n \n \"God chose to make man fundamentally free since he wanted to have a relationship of love with us. And there's no true love unless the one who loves is free, since love implies choosing the person you love. Since he wanted us to love him freely, he created us free. And that's the way he wants us, just as he created us: free...Human freedom, however, unlike divine freedom, is in a position to choose good or evil. Temptation incites us to make wrong choices, choices that go against God's will. Temptation is so human and it is so intimately a part of man's nature that Christ himself chose to be tempted three times in the desert.\" Father Marcial Maciel in Christ is My Life\n \n A few questions:\n 1. What's wrong with blind faith?\n \n 2. Do you believe that all Christians utilize simply blind faith and nothing else?\n \n 3.

   "I cannot speak to the catholic church on this. I do not think that the protestant church declares that heaven is where there is no memory of our past. God has declared that he will remember our sins no more. That is true.\n \n I submit that Love as used in this context is not an emotion. That would be a noun. When using the word loving we are speaking of a verb. Love is an action. Acting lovingly is to act in accord with the others best interests without regard to self. God did that. He would have been justified to allow all to suffer under judgement as we originally broke the law not him. Instead he sent his only son to be a propitiation for our sins.\n\n \n There is also another term to discribe your god, All-forgiving.\n His son atoned for our sins, which means that they are gone. Yet you are still saying that we'll be judge for them. That is contradictory.\n \n \nYou equivocate the word love. You state that if God is Loving (verb) then..... but then you define love as an emotion. They are different words because they are different parts of speech and have different meanings. Again, equivocation is a logical fallacy.\n\n \n We are not talking about the term loving, but the term all-loving, which means to love all without question. You are trying to redefine love to justifiy the contradiction.\n \n \nNow if we are talking about emotion, as God having affection for all then that is true.

People believe the world flat for many thousands of years, did it make the world flat?\n \n \nIt is also a very historically reliable work when you compare it to other writings of the time (probably more reliable).\n\n \n Again hardly. Even if it does contain actual history it still doesn't mean that the rest is true.\n \n \nTell me why you believe free will is an illusion. Are you not exercising free will as you post in this forum? Are your thoughts your creation or simply the product of a chemical reaction?\n\n \n We are influenced by our instincts more than we'd like to admit. If you look deeper you will see this by how each replies. Do you exercize free will when you fell in love? Do you choose who you will love?\n \n \nThere you have blind faith Charchuk. This is often how the faith is passed on. A family teaches the faith to its children. The children trust the parents. And you will say that the children are not at an age of reason. Well, the same thing happens to adults who convert as well. Often times they are evangelized by someone they know and trust. Someone who doesn't even have to talk to them. Someone who lives a Christian life by example.\n\n \n Religious faith is difference than normal faith. In my family we are taught to think for ourselves. to not choose just because someone we know has said it. This is why they didn't shun, or condenm me when I had said that I wasn't a Christian anymore.\n \n \nNo, the example you give does not include a person whom they know and trust.\n\n \n Most pedophiles are known to the child.\n \n \nTrust.\n\n \n This is the kind of trust which is taken advantage of. Before I trust someone I get to know them in the person first. I don't go by what others have said only.\n \n \nSo you acknowledge that there is nothing out of the ordinary for a Christian to seek forgiveness for a sin that God already knows about.\n\n \n Sin is a religious concept.\n \n \nI guess that would depend on what the crime is. \n\n \n Punishment for all unrepentant sins is hell.\n \n \nI don't know any Christians that believe the penalty of any sin is hell.\n\n \n The wages of sin is death. Actually that is a hold over from when Christians believed that hell was the end, oblivion.",

Do some date many people prior to getting married and choose one? Do I choose to stay with my wife each and every day? Can't I leave at any time? Love is not just a feeling.

Far too many confuse lust for love.\n \n \nDo you fall in love with every person to whom you are physically attracted?

Lust is temporary. \n \n \n \nDo I choose to stay with my wife each and every day? Can't I have at any time? Love is not just a feeling. It is a choice but more importantly it is a committment. It is an action. The gushy feelings of love may fade at times and during that time the committment of love must remain steadfast.\n\n \n Love is not a choice. Mistaking lust for love is a big problem. This is one reason why the divorse rate is so high in open societies like ours. Once the lust has worn off they don't want to stsy together anymore.\n \n \nYou accost Catholics and other Christians for not being able to think for themselves. Yet you say there is no free will or free thought. Are you a free thinker? I thought agnostics loved their freedom.\n\n \n You're not seeing the difference here. Our thinking is influenced more by our instincts than by our \"will\" so it is not as free as we would like to believe. Christians give up most of their will to their beliefs so they don't have to use it. We see just how all covering this can be with Jews and Muslims as well. Religious belief proves that free will is an illusion.\n \n \n \nThis is your judgment of others.\n\n \n It is a sound judgement. It is like a funeral. They are more for the living than the dead.\n \n \nThis statement does not respond to what I wrote. I'm not sure what you mean. God's love requires justice.\n\n \n Love requires nothing.
