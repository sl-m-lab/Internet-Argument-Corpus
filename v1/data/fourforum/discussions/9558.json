   "From the NYTimes:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/science/13carl.html\n \n February 13, 2007\n A Familiar and Prescient Voice, Brought to Life\n By DENNIS OVERBYE\n \n It's been a long 10 years since we've heard Carl Sagan beckoning us to consider the possibilities inherent in the \"billions\" of stars peppering the sky and in the \"billions\" of neuronal connections spiderwebbing our brains.\n \n In the day, the Cornell astronomer, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of books like \"The Dragons of Eden,\" \"Contact,\" \"Pale Blue Dot\" and \"The Demon-Haunted World,\" impresario of the PBS program \"Cosmos\" and Johnny Carson regular was one of the world's most famous and eloquent unbelievers, an apostle of cosmic wonder, critic of nuclear arms and a champion of science's duty to probe and question without limit, including the claims of religion. He died of pneumonia after a series of bone marrow transplants in December 1996.\n \n In his absence, the public discourse on his favorite issues - the fate of the planet, the beauty and mystery of the cosmos - has not fared well. The teaching of evolution in public schools has become a bitter bone of contention; NASA tried to abandon the Hubble Space Telescope and censor talk of climate change; and of course, religious fanatics crashed jetliners into the World Trade Center, leading to a war in the Middle East that has awakened memories in some corners of the Crusades.\n \n Now, however, Dr. Sagan has rejoined the cosmic debate from the grave. The occasion is the publication last month of \"The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God\" (Penguin). The book is based on a series of lectures exploring the boundary between science and religion that Dr. Sagan gave in Glasgow in 1985, and it was edited by Ann Druyan, his widow and collaborator.\n \n Reading Dr. Sagan's new book is like running into an old friend at a noisy party, discovering he still has all his hair, and repairing to the den for a quiet, congenial drink.\n \n \"I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship,\" he writes at the beginning of a discussion that includes the history of cosmology, a travel guide to the solar system, the reason there are hallucinogen receptors in the brain, and the meaning of the potential discovery - or lack thereof - of extraterrestrial intelligence.\n \n Never afraid to venture into global politics, Dr. Sagan warns at one point of the danger that a leader under the sway of religious fundamentalism might not try too hard to avoid nuclear Armageddon, reasoning that it was God's plan.\n \n \"He might be interested to see what that would be like,\" Dr. Sagan wrote. \"Why slow it down?\"\n \n Almost in the same breath, Dr. Sagan acknowledges that religion can engender hope and speak truth to power, as in the civil rights movement in the United States, but that it rarely does.\n \n It's curious, he says, that no allegedly Christian nation has adopted the Golden Rule as a basis for foreign policy. Rather, in the nuclear age, mutually assured destruction was the policy of choice. \"Christianity says that you should love your enemy. It certainly doesn't say that you should vaporize his children.\"\n \n When Saddam Hussein was hanged in December, those words had a haunting resonance.\n \n It was Ms. Druyan's impatience with religious fundamentalism that led her to resurrect Dr. Sagan's lectures, which were part of the Gifford Lectures, a prestigious series about natural theology that has been going on since the 19th century.\n \n Ms. Druyan, who co-wrote \"Cosmos\" and produced the movie \"Contact,\" based on her husband's novel, runs Cosmos Studio and was a leader in the aborted effort by the Planetary Society to launch a solar sail from a Russian submarine two years ago. Among her lesser-known achievements is a kiss on the cheek of the science writer Timothy Ferris, which was recorded and included on a record of the sounds of Earth that is part of the Voyager spacecraft now flying out of the solar system. She and Dr. Sagan had planned to use his Gifford lectures as the basis for a new television show called \"Ethos,\" a sequel to \"Cosmos,\" about the spiritual implications of the scientific revolution. \"I know of no other force that can wean us from our infantile belief that we are the center of the universe,\" she said.\n \n But \"Ethos\" never happened, and the lectures disappeared.\n \n In the wake of Sept. 11 and the attacks on the teaching of evolution in this country, she said, a tacit truce between science and religion that has existed since the time of Galileo started breaking down. \"A lot of scientists were mad as hell, and they weren't going to take it anymore,\" Ms. Druyan said over lunch recently.\n \n Some of the books that resulted, such as Richard Dawkins's \"The God Delusion,\" have been criticized as shrill, but Ms. Druyan said: \"People like Carl and Dawkins are more serious about God than people who just go through the motions. They are real seekers.\"\n \n (More)",

   "About a year ago, Ms. Druyan went looking for Dr. Sagan's lectures, eventually finding them filed under \"Ethos\" in his archive at Cornell, which occupies 1,000 filing cabinets and includes things like his baby pictures and report cards.\n \n Rereading them, she said, \"I couldn't believe how prophetic they were.\"\n \n It took about a day for her editor at Penguin to decide to publish them, she said.\n \n She retitled the book - Dr. Sagan had named his lectures \"The Search for Who We Are\" - as a nod to William James, whose Gifford lectures in 1901 and 1902 became the basis for his book \"The Varieties of Religious Experience.\"\n \n Ever the questioner, Dr. Sagan asks at one point in his lectures why the God of the Scriptures seems to betray no apparent knowledge of the wider universe that \"He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is\" allegedly created. Why not a commandment, for instance, that thou shalt not exceed the speed of light? Or why not engrave the Ten Commandments on the Moon in such a way that they would not be discovered until now, \u00e0 la the slab in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"?\n \n If such an inscription were found, people would ask how it had gotten there, Dr. Sagan writes. \"And then there would be various hypotheses, most of which would be very interesting,\" he adds dryly.\n \n Near the end of his book, Dr. Sagan parses the difference between belief and science this way: \"I think if we ever reach the point where we think we thoroughly understand who we are and where we came from, we will have failed.\"\n \n The search for who we are does not lead to complacency or arrogance, he explains. \"It goes with a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.\"\n \n Dr. Sagan was many things, but shrill was not one of them.\n \n The last word may as well go to Dr. Dawkins himself, who in a 1996 book nominated Dr. Sagan as the ideal spokesman for Earth. In a blurb for the new book, Dr. Dawkins said that the astronomer was more than religious, having left behind the priests and mullahs.\n \n \"He left them behind, because he had so much more to be religious about,\" Dr. Dawkins wrote. \"They have their Bronze Age myths, medieval superstitions and childish wishful thinking. He had the universe.\"",

He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Starting to get the picture, sport?\n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One.

   "To the first question (regardless of the exaggeration in it), most definitely YES.\n \n Okay, he (Clinton) couldn't keep his pants zipped up, but did not lie repeatedly to congress in order to take his country to war.\n\n \n If Bush lied he had a lot of company, including Slick Willie Clinton:\n \n \"If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\"\n -- President Bill Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998\n \n \n \"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.\"\n -- Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998\n \"Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\"\n -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998\n \n \n \"Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.\"\n -- Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999\n \n \n \"We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.\"\n -- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n \n \n \"There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\" \n Letter to President Bush, Signed by: -- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), and others, Dec 5, 2001\n \n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and th! e means of delivering them.\" \n -- Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002\n \n \n \"We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.\" \n -- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n \n \n \"Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\" \n -- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n \n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\" \n -- Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002\n \n \n \"The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons...\" \n -- Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002\n \n \n \"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" \n -- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002\n \n \n \"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\" \n -- Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002\n \n \n \"He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do\" \n -- Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002\n \n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\" \n -- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002\n \n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" \n -- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002\n \n \n \"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real...\" \n -- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003\n \n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\"\n --Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002 \n \n \n \nI think a little adultery (okay, it's a sin) is far less damning than the sins that the current president has committed.\n\n \n See above. And a little adultery can certainly have some adverse consequences in the hereafter, if not on earth too.\n \n \nOh, and just as another thought - the passage I quoted also suggests that Clinton was established by God and doing his work. So looks like you're stuck either way.\n Smiley\n\n \n Nope. God established Saul in the OT too, but he screwed up and was put out. In Romans God is talking about evildoers, and if the chief screws up and does evil, he is at risk too.\n \n Quote / Shadow: \"I wish we had a \"touche\" smiley on this board, 'cause you just owned EZ.\"\n \n In your dreams.

Come to the wedding banquet.' 5\"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \n 8\"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11\"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13\"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14\"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n \n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works alone, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14",
