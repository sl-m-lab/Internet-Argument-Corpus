   "The spiteful and cowardly Phil Kline has filed charges against a Kansas abortion provider. After he was utterly defeated by Paul Morrison in the November election to try to retain his position as Attorney General, he has struck out at an abortion provider before he leaves the office.\n \n Phil Kline has a record of being anti-choice, and in fact, it was an anti-choice Kansas group that funded much of his campaign for re-election.\n \n The story is here: http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/12/22/kansas.abortion.ap/index.html\n \n Besides this, as I posted in a thread in the Current Events section, Republicans in Johnson County have given Kline the position of District Attorney that is vacated by Paul Morrison, despite the fact that in the election for Attorney General, the citizens of Johnson County voted 65 to 35 percent AGAINST Kline, so the citizens of Kansas are stuck with this spiteful man even longer even though they voted against him in the election. http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/dec/12/kline_chosen_johnson_county_district_attorney/",

Apparently he did not inform the district attorney in the county, something I find rather ironic as he is soon to be a district attorney (despite it being against the vote of the people). \n \n It proves how spiteful he was when you read here in the article that Kline actually lacks the legal authority to file the complaint (wow, I wonder why everyone voted against the hateful little man): \"The district attorney does in fact object to any such filing by the attorney general, as he lacks the legal authority to file such a complaint in this jurisdiction.\"\n \n Here is the entire article: http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/12/22/kansas.abortion.ap/index.html",
