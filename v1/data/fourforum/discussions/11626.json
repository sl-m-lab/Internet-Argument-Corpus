   "The wastrel jerks are going to hand me, the American taxpayer, the bill for their wastrel, stupidities.\n \n If I'm footing the bill, I demand accountability! I demand to know where the money is going. I like what Senator Bernie Sanders says:\n \n \nIn my view, we need to go forward in addressing this financial crisis by insisting on four basic principles:\n \n (1) The people who can best afford to pay and the people who have benefited most from Bush's economic policies are the people who should provide the funds for the bailout. It would be immoral to ask the middle class, the people whose standard of living has declined under Bush, to pay for this bailout while the rich, once again, avoid their responsibilities. Further, if the government is going to save companies from bankruptcy, the taxpayers of this country should be rewarded for assuming the risk by sharing in the gains that result from this government bailout.\n \n Specifically, to pay for the bailout, which is estimated to cost up to $1 trillion, the government should:\n \n a) Impose a five-year, 10 percent surtax on income over $1 million a year for couples and over $500,000 for single taxpayers. That would raise more than $300 billion in revenue;\n \n b) Ensure that assets purchased from banks are realistically discounted so companies are not rewarded for their risky behavior and taxpayers can recover the amount they paid for them; and\n \n c) Require that taxpayers receive equity stakes in the bailed-out companies so that the assumption of risk is rewarded when companies' stock goes up.\n \n (2) There must be a major economic recovery package which puts Americans to work at decent wages. Among many other areas, we can create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and moving our country from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Further, we must protect working families from the difficult times they are experiencing. We must ensure that every child has health insurance and that every American has access to quality health and dental care, that families can send their children to college, that seniors are not allowed to go without heat in the winter, and that no American goes to bed hungry.\n \n (3) Legislation must be passed which undoes the damage caused by excessive de-regulation. That means reinstalling the regulatory firewalls that were ripped down in 1999. That means re-regulating the energy markets so that we never again see the rampant speculation in oil that helped drive up prices. That means regulating or abolishing various financial instruments that have created the enormous shadow banking system that is at the heart of the collapse of AIG and the financial services meltdown.\n \n (4) We must end the danger posed by companies that are \"too big too fail,\" that is, companies whose failure would cause systemic harm to the U.S. economy. If a company is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. We need to determine which companies fall in this category and then break them up. Right now, for example, the Bank of America, the nation's largest depository institution, has absorbed Countrywide, the nation's largest mortgage lender, and Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage house. We should not be trying to solve the current financial crisis by creating even larger, more powerful institutions. Their failure could cause even more harm to the entire economy.\n\n http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=303313\n \n Any questions, chumps?",

   "It's the shady side of the free market.\n \n In theory, all market bubbles are temporary, and not a problem, because when they burst, the market lets the dead wood die away to let new businesses grow. Except, economists forget that the the dead wood is people.\n \n Crashes in the economy hurt. That's why it's a good thing to remember this earlier, when the economy is blooming and everyone lives in the illusion that the bloom will last forever. It won't. It can't. That's why I'm all for state interventions in a market, to prevent bubbles from ever appearing at all.\n \n BTW, remember how long Daewoo has been warning that this would happen?

This was great if your Grandma died and left you her house or if you wanted to take out another mortgage !\n Other than that it was obvious to anyone else other than our leaders and the great financial houses that it was pyramid selling in another form.\n Now the bottom has fell out of the housing market our government is blaming us and our media is blaming the government.\n It would appear the same thing has happened in the States and like us the perpitrators of this scam have got away with it and we have to pay their bill.",
