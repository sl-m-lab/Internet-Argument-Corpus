Very odd. I suppose we can take some cold comfort from the fact the BNP didn't do better in the face of widespread disillusionment with politicians generally.",

   "The UK has had/is having a major scandal involving MP's expenses, where despite earning 3 times the national average pay, they have been claiming for everything from a new bath plug to a floating duck house, or moat cleaning! Politicians of all the national parties are held in general contempt, while Labour continues it's slow implosion.\n The attitude to The European Parliament is ambivalent at best, so in the UK, voting in the European elections gives a handy vehicle for a protest vote, though as the overall votes for the EP have dropped every time since the 1970's, only the least apathetic do so at all. This is the background against which the BNP lost less votes than the main parties, and scraped home through the back door.",
