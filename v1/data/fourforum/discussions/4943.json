   "Here's a cute math puzzler I heard recently.\n \n Must it be the case that there exists two antipodal spots on the equator that have the same temperature?\n \n Why or why not?\n\n \n \n No, it is not necessary that there exist two antipodal spots on the equator that have identical temperatures in reality. The Borsuk-Ulam theorem applies to a conceptual mathematical construct, and can be used to \"model\" reality, but it no way does it necessitate existence of any kind. (perhaps we believe that god's existence can be shown mathematically???)\n \n Realistically, there are not an infinite number of points along the equator. The functions of both position around a planetary body and temperature at any such position cannot be shown to be \"continuous\". \n \n There is no \"must exist\" when dealing with conceptual mathematical representations with such obvious built-in inaccuracies. May exist, perhaps but then we'd have to calculate probability given the accuracy of the measurements (both position and temperature).\n \n Mathematically this is an exercise in infinite probability which allows for a quick and fairly accurate answer to what is a model (with inaccuracies) of a real world problem.\n \n The math used to answer your question assumes that between any two points there are an infinite number of points and that this infinite number of points is continuous (!). That is, if two points had a measurement of 90deg and 100 deg., it is a requirement that there exist a point between the two points that is (exactly!) 91degrees...which is not realistic. Yes, given an infinite probability, all possibilities are infinitely present, which is IMO the general form of the puzzle. Given an infinite number of points and a possibility of each point being a particular temperature on a continuous scale, if it's possible that two points have identical temperatures then there exist an infinite number of such antipodal pairs with identical temperatures. So the puzzle is somewhat misleading in that it hides it's infinity in a single pair.\n \n Must it be the case that there exists AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PAIRS OF antipodal spots on the equator that have the same temperature? No, but in a mathematical model that is probably a close representation of reality, sure.\n \n A gross simplication of a similar real-world problem would be given an infinite number of chances for there to exist a human, if it's possible for that human to be Mach, then an infinite number of Mach's exist.

   "Blah, blah, blah.\n \n Were you just being silly, or do you believe that every math puzzle should come with a page and a half of assumptions, qualifications, and givens, in order to be precise? \n \n That reminds me of a joke. An engineer and a mathematician (both het males) are abducted by aliens. They materialize in a long room, at the end or which is a beautiful woman. A loudspeaker clicks on: \"A siren will sound every 30 seconds. When the siren sounds you may move half the remaining distance towards the end of the room. Move more than half the distance and you will be disintergrated. More before the siren sounds and you will be disintergrated.\" \n \n The siren sounds. The engineer dashes halfway across the room, while the mathemetician sits down and starts scribbling equations. Several sirens later the mathematician calls out, \"You might as well give up. I've just proven that you'll never get all the way to the woman.\" To which the engineer replies \"Yeah, but eventually I'll be close enough!\"",

   "...also, in case I was wrong I'd want to be corrected. \n\n Well, if you insist...\n \n \nMathematically this is an exercise in infinite probability which allows for a quick and fairly accurate answer to what is a model (with inaccuracies) of a real world problem. \n\n I don't know where the term \"infinite probability\" came from, but it nonsensical. Perhaps you mean an infinite number of possibilities, each of which having an infinitesimal probability.\n \n \n Yes, given an infinite probability, all possibilities are infinitely present, which is IMO the general form of the puzzle. \n\n There's that term, again. I think you're not looking at this correctly. In the reals in the interval [0,1], each number in the interval appears exactly once, not infinitely many times.

No, but in a mathematical model that is probably a close representation of reality, sure. \n\n Not in general; it depends how the representation is done. For a finite linear combination of sine waves, the answer will in general be: No. Only in very special cases will the answer be: Yes.\n \n \n A gross simplication of a similar real-world problem would be given an infinite number of chances for there to exist a human, if it's possible for that human to be Mach, then an infinite number of Mach's exist. I think Bruno was burned to death for claiming that ;) \n\n That depends on what \"possible\" means. If \"possible\" means that the probability of a Mach is a discrete number other than zero, then Archimedes will insist that there will be infinitely many Mach's. However, if \"possible\" means infinitesimally probable, then the number of probable number of Mach's is dependent upon the cardinality of the number of possibilities versus the cardinality of the number of trials. You could easily end up with zero probable Mach's (as in taking a countably infinite number of samples on [0,1] and needing to get a 0 for each Mach).",

   "Who brought up the reals and the interval [0,1]? Was that interval a given of the puzzle? If not, then it's irrelvant. \n\n If you don't understand the relevance, why not just say so? Was your earlier statement that you wanted to be corrected (if wrong) mere posing? You do not seem to be wanting correction. That you claim my argument is irrelevant does not make it so. My point was completely relevant to the quote. It is the single counter example needed to show that your reasoning regarding the problem is wrong.\n \n \nThe debate lever is \"must exist\". It only takes one to false example to make it incorrect, not a few true examples, or even mostly true examples.\n \n\n We're not even debating whether there exists at least one antipodal pair with the same temperature. My objection is to your analysis which supposedly shows that there is. An infinitude of possible antipodal pairs does not show (by itself) that one pair must be the same (since a continuous circuit is really needed), much less that an infinite number must be the same. I provided the single counter example (a sine wave) needed to show that an infinite number are not guaranteed. \n \n \nDid you catch that I stated that each point has a probability of being a number on the temperature scale (assumes any/all numbers, it's a general form, just like the puzzle)? \n\n What you did say was [numbering added]:\n \n\n (1)Yes, given an infinite probability, all possibilities are infinitely present, which is IMO the general form of the puzzle. \n (2)Given an infinite number of points and a possibility of each point being a particular temperature on a continuous scale, if it's possible that two points have identical temperatures then there exist an infinite number of such antipodal pairs with identical temperatures. \n\n (1) The first sentence contains faulty reasoning. Suppose the temperature is a sine wave, then the temperature values will be [-1,1]. All values in [-1,1] are present twice, with the exception of the end points, which are present once. Therefore, not all possibilities are infinitely present. [If no circuit is not in play the simple (non- self repeating) range [0,1] also works fine. That is, it meets with your premise (e.g., no circuit required), but not your conclusion.] Your logic is wrong.\n (2) The second sentence contains faulty reasoning. Once again, if temperature is sine wave, it is possible that two points (an antipodal pair) have the same temperature. In fact, it is definite that an antipodal pair have the same temperature, i.e., 0 and 180 degrees. Nonetheless, there do not exist infinitely many antipodal pairs with the same temperature. Your logic is wrong.\n \n \nPick a point on the sine wave that is not the antipodal pair at 0,180. Say, 90. Is it possible that the temperature is identical on 90,270? No, because you've already included as your given to the puzzle, that temperature is represented by a sine wave (a continuous function where exactly (and only) opposite points are identical in value.) Your example is a interesting, but irrelevant. It's also another continuous function. \n\n Your assertion that my counter example is irrelevant is interesting, but irrelevant. I'm not trying to solve the puzzle. I'm trying to show that your logic is wrong, just as you have asked. \n The counter example (sine wave) shows that a valid temperature profile exists (and satisfies your premises) and does not conform to your conclusions. I have shown all possibilities are not infinitely present. ([0,1] also works as a counter example, given your premise.) I have also shown that if one pair possibly exists, then an infinite number of pairs needn't exist. Shall we let Kronus decide (I we will get anywhere)?",
