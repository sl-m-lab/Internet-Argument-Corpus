Why do I feel hungry when I haven't eaten in a long time? Why does pain hurt?\n \n All these things are answered in the same way. It is all a part of being able to survive. If pain didn't hurt then you would cause damage to yourself without knowing it. If rotten meat didn't taste bad then you would eat it and get sick or die. If you didn't blink when looking at the sun you would go blind. If you didn't feel hungry after not eating for a long period of time you would starve. It is all survival instincts.

All sound waves, which are percussion waves, can be reflected, it is simply a matter of the frequency (energy) of the sound and the material it is reflecting off of. Higher energy sounds reflect more easily whereas lower energy are more easily absorbed. Some materials more readily absorb while others more readily reflect.",

They have a distinct survival disadvantage. Pain is the feedback we get from our body, without it, it's open-loop.\n \n Logically, pain must be. If you instead felt PLEASURE, from putting your hand on a hot stove, your ancestors would have died from infected burns long ago, if not from suicidal immolation directly. Pain = avoid/something is wrong, pleasure = seek/something is good. Simple control mechanisms, hard to make any real-world system without them, it's only natural.\n \n -Mach",

This is a survival benefit. Take sex for example. It's intensly pleasurable, good to seek it. But if those sexual desires were to be followed when the conscious mind might calculate it's \"not a good time\", you might have situations where some animal mates, because they are programmed to, despite the predator that is charging them...\n The mind's ability to control \"most\" actions, is more adaptive than without it.\n \n In reality, pain comes in varying degrees. Humans can override most senses through \"distraction\" of some form or another, however, part of the brain still experiences the sensory input. Take hypnosis for example. Some hypnotized patients that are exposed to pain that normally results in a reflexive reaction, don't react. However, if asked \"do you feel this, is it painful\", they can tell you it is. Did they \"override\" the pain? Not really, they just compartmentalized it, so to speak. Same goes with meditation. A headache? OK, I can see it. A jagged blade shoved under a finger nail? I'm doubting you can just lotus-power that away...\n \n Ever seen the experiments with split brain patients? You might find it fascinating given your interestin brain duality.\n \n -Mach",
