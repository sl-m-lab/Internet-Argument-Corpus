   "Brady Campaign joins the VPC in deception\n July 23, 2:44 PMMinneapolis Gun Rights ExaminerJohn Pierce\n \n \"A lie told often enough becomes truth.\" - Vladimir Lenin\n \n In my last article, Lies, damn lies and VPC statistics, I demonstrated that the recently released Violence Policy Center (VPC) \"study\" claiming to document the misbehaviors of carry permit holders was fatally flawed.\n \n If you have not read my article, I encourage you to do so and to spread it to your pro-gun friends and colleagues. Make no mistake about it, the media will be echoing the numbers from this so-called \"study\" for decades and we must stand ready to refute them whenever they are used.\n \n The above quote from Lenin is particularly apt where the anti-gun media is concerned and we can ill afford to allow permit holders to be dishonestly portrayed as dangerous when, in fact, they represent one of the most law abiding segments of our population.\n \n As I noted in my earlier article, the most glaring flaw in the \"study\" was in their determination of the threshold question of whether or not the parties involved were even carry permit holders. They admitted that they \"relied primarily on news accounts\" in classifying individuals as permit holders. This is an indefensible methodology when preparing a \"study\" which they are portraying as well-researched to members of Congress as the following case will clearly demonstrate.\n \n Case in point\n \n There was a single case in the VPC report from Minnesota. The VPC, apparently relying solely upon a Star Tribune article, reported the incident as:\n \n \"On July 24, 2008, Michael C. Iheme shot and killed his wife after she left her job at an assisted living center. Court records show that she had an active harassment restraining order against him and suggest a history of domestic abuse, including threats to kill her. After the shooting, Iheme called 911 and said, \"I have killed the woman that mess my life up....\" Iheme, who had a concealed handgun permit, was found guilty of second degree murder.\"\n \n It is interesting that the VPC mentions \"court records\" in their narrative. It is actually a very shrewd spin tactic. It implies to the reader that they have exhaustively researched the history and setting of the case and are certain of their facts. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. This is just more mimicry of news reports.\n \n Dr. John Lott, author of one of the quintessential books for gun rights activists, More Guns, Less Crime, recognized this immediately and reached out to trusted local activists to try and put together a nationwide picture of just how many cases were misrepresented.\n \n In Minnesota, he contacted Andrew Rothman, Executive Director of The Minnesota Association of Defensive Firearm Instructors (MADFI). Andrew contacted noted author and activist Joel Rosenberg, and Joel was able to contact other prominent local attorneys and activists who were able to confirm verbally with their sources in law enforcement that Iheme was not a permit holder.\n \n But actual court records were what was needed to validate the verbal assurances. Since grassroots activists dedicate their time despite working full-time jobs, neither Andrew nor Joel was able to get free and an answer was needed quickly. Andrew called me. New to the state and a wet-behind-the-ears 2L law student, a quick trip to the Hennepin County courthouse was just the kind of adventure to break me in.\n \n It turned out that parking was the most difficult part of my task. Once there, the nice lady at the records office provided me a case file about an inch and a half thick, and approximately 15 minutes later, I was three-quarters of the way through the file when I found what we were looking for ... the original complaint, each page of which is clickable below for your viewing pleasure. The key pieces of data are to be found on pages 2 and 5 and I have highlighted them for your convenience.\n \n I should note that the full details of how the Iheme deception went from phone call to the floor of the Senate is a moving and educational illustration of just how powerful grassroots activism can be and I will be detailing it in tomorrow's column.\n \n But now, back to the data that the VPC could have easily found themselves if they had even one wet-behind-the-ears activist such as myself in Minnesota. Unfortunately for them, it appears that true grassroots activism is not a part of their organization.\n \n Amazingly, the Offender Tracking Form has a standard question on it that asks the question \"Does the subject hold a Minnesota permit to carry a pistol?\" and then directs the officer filing the complaint to run a QPC query. The answer on Mr. Iheme's Offender Tracking Form says \"No Permit on File.\" It turns out that not only did Mr. Iheme not have a Minnesota carry permit, but he had never even applied for one!\n \n The Brady Campaign joins in\n \n But the VPC is not the only anti-self-defense group to blatantly misrepresent the Iheme case. The Brady Campaign, more commonly known by their previous name of Handgun Control, Inc., has been highlighting the case on its website since it occurred.\n \n In case they remove it after it becomes clear that the deception has been exposed, I have captured a screen shot of the page.\n \n In addition to their attempt to use Iheme's criminal act to paint all permit holders in a negative light, they also launched a blistering attack on the dedicated law enforcement officers in Minnesota, derisively asking \"how could the state allow him to hold a concealed carry permit?\"\n \n The answer is simple ... if Minnesota's law enforcement officers are going to be forced to pursue mythological objects, then I vote we launch a search for bigfoot. We will find the elusive sasquatch long before we find Mr. Iheme's non-existent carry permit.\n \n But did they both just make it up?\n \n While I personally believe the VPC and the Brady Campaign to be more than willing to outright lie if it forwarded their agenda and they felt they could get away with it, I do not believe that was the case here.\n \n The truth I believe is much more damning in its own way. While gun owners invest a great deal of time in understanding the laws of the state they live in as well as the states in which they intend to transport or carry firearms, gun control groups actually understand very little about the state of gun laws in America and the media understand even less.\n \n The chain of events apparently went something like this ...\n \n Page 2 of the complaint says:\n \n \"In a search of the Toyota driven to the scene by defendant, police officers recovered a .45 caliber magazine, a Minnesota permit to purchase a handgun, and a receipt from Cabela's to buy the handgun.\"\n \n The report in the Star Tribune shortened this to:\n \n \"police found a gun permit and Cabela's receipt for the gun\"\n \n And finally, VPC and Brady, securely wrapped in the blanket of ignorance and prejudice that are the hallmarks of the anti-self-defense mindset, added \"concealed carry\" back to the description because they do not even understand the difference between a purchase permit and a carry permit.\n \n After all, when your ultimate goal is the elimination of all civilian ownership of firearms, why bother learning about the safeguards and restrictions already in place?\n \n Going forward\n \n As activists across the country seek the same information in courthouses in their own states, I suspect that the number of improperly reported permit holders will rise quickly. Therefore, I call upon the VPC to immediately recall and renounce this \"study\". Failure to do so, in the face of clear evidence that the report is flawed, can only be interpreted as intentional fraud.\n \n However, as I think about it, use of knowingly misleading or false data in congressional testimony is a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Perhaps Senator Schumer or Durbin should use this report after all.\n \n Brady Campaign joins the VPC in deception",

   "Hey Sarge, that looks like something I saw yesterday.\n \n   New anti-gun strategy: Demonize CCW holders \n Bigotry assumes many forms, hides behind many facades, but always it is the same; the social demonization of entire groups, classes or races of people in an effort to make them appear inferior and detrimental by their very existence.\n \n In the wake of a nasty multiple shooting at a Pittsburgh, PA-area fitness club by a not-so-clearly psychotic man identified as George Sodini, America&#8217;s gun prohibitionists &#8211; led by the Violence Policy Center and Freedom States Alliance &#8211; are clamoring for restrictions or repeal of concealed carry statutes.\n \n In the case against legally-armed citizens, the VPC has even manufactured an innuendo-riddled &#8220;study&#8221; to support their prejudices. My colleague, Cleveland Gun Rights Examiner Daniel White, writes about the shooting here.\n \n Their hardly subliminal argument appears to be that citizens licensed to carry concealed handguns for personal protection are a threat to the community. This contention is based on six shooting incidents over the past couple of years in which the gunman had, or apparently had, a carry permit.\n ....\n\n Anti-gunners. Why do you HATE our Constitutions Bill of Rights? Why do you persecute people who can pass a background check not only once, but every time they purchase a new gun? You told America that this would satisfy you, when this new law was proposed! But NO! You demonize us anyway! We prove our lawfulness not only when we purchase a new gun, but also CCW people have to pass another background check when they apply for a Concealed Handgun License, then take a test and classes to boot?\n \n   We already have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws.  When are you going to be reasonable?\n \n So what's the deal? Why do you HATE America so much? Why do you HATE us law-abiding people who keep our noses clean all of our lives? Heck, I am 62 and have never run afoul of our laws.

The media is just as guilty as these pervert organizations. Either they are totally clueless about firearms laws or they are out to carry the water for the pro slavery express. In Soldini's case the closest he came to being a CCW holder was he purchased the pistols legally. He neither applied nor was granted a carry permit. The same was true of the Michigan case. We have no friends in the leftist media much to our detriment. Remember blood sells and the more of it the better it sells.",

   "youre more concerned about those 22 to 30 thousand gun laws but Im more concerned about the 22 to 30 thousand lives taken by gun violence each year\n\n First of all, gun violence is no joke, but your figures are way too high if you are talking about criminal gun violence. Which is the subject of this group of threads. But you guys push for stuff that will have little to no impact on gun violence. Stuff like an Assault Weapons ban. So called Assault Weapons even if were dis-invented would have less impact than lets say murders committed by beating people to death with hands, and feet. Which by the way, also shows the futility of banning guns in the first place. \n \n Brady,  I have shown you who commits murder.  You are NEVER going to stop all of that by punishing those who don't take drugs, or sell them, or commit crimes. If you were actually serious about doing what you say you want to do, you would be designing and pushing for resolutions to deal with the actual evidence. \n \n Let me also show you what the FBI says are the pertinent factors. \n   Crime factors from the FBI website\n Historically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n Population density and degree of urbanization. \n Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commutingXpatterns, and transient factors. \n Modes of transportation and highway system. \n Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n Climate. \n Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n\n Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators. Why don't you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime (gun control). \n \n However, if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control, then go for it! Maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence.",

It also noted that states with so-called \"weak\" gun laws had more gun deaths. \n \n But there's another way to look at the numbers. Of the 780 firearm deaths that occurred in Alabama in 2006, 333 were homicides, 37 were accidental, eight were undetermined and two were considered \"legal intervention.\" \n \n But the majority of gun deaths - 400 to be exact - were suicides. Let's restate that: More than half the gun deaths (which is typical nationally) were the deliberate acts of gun owners or those who had guns in their possession at the time. \n \n According to other statistics, Alabama's suicide rate overall is about 24th to 28th in the nation, depending on the year and the statistical method employed. Indeed, in some states, Alaska for one, high rates of gun deaths and high suicide rates occurred at the same time. Contributing factors to suicide rates include economic trends and social isolation, as well as gun ownership and availability. \n New statistics on gun deaths - al.com\n The FBI's Crime in the United States estimated that 66% of the 16,137 murders in 2004 were committed with firearms. \n \n Basically, the only source that we have for firearm death statistics, outside of local governments, are the data that are reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the F.B.I., every year, and that's pretty much the standard source that everybody uses. \n \n Gun Death Statistics\n Misrepresenting Gun Statistics | LearnAboutGuns.comX\n Since I was suspicious of the Handgun Control Inc. statistics that everyone quotes, I decided to do my own research. Here's what I found. I welcome corrections and reliable sources of more recent statistics. \n \n \"Out of 30,708 Americans who died by gunfire in 1998, only 316 were shot in justifiable homicides by private citizens with firearms.\" -Handgun Control, Inc. \n \n Let's break that number down. \n \n 17,424 (57%) of those were suicides, so you're down to 12,968 people actually shooting other people. (I'll talk about suicide in a moment.) Most of this is gang or drug-related. When we talk about the danger of shootings in the home, we're talking about people shooting intimates: family members, children, boyfriends or girlfriends. \n \n In 1998, about 1000 people killed one of their intimates with guns. Add the 134 children age 0-14 killed in gun accidents, and you have... \n \n 1150. That's a lot less than 30,708. (Source: DOJ statistics.) \n \n Now let's compare these numbers to crimes prevented by guns. The HCI report cheats by only counting cases where a criminal was shot _and killed_ as successful defensive gun usage. In the vast majority of cases, displaying a firearm is sufficient to prevent a crime. \n \n Here's a US DOJ (i.e. government) report which includes a survey of defensive gun usage in America. According to the surveys, guns were used to prevent a crime 1.5 million times in 1994. (*) (Source: DOJ statistics.) \n \n That's 1300 crimes prevented by guns per gun homicide of a family member, intimate, or ex-intimate -- and 115 crimes prevented by guns per gun death of anyone, anywhere in the USA. \n \n How about that! \n \n These are all numbers from official government studies which I found myself, not just a parroting of someone else's propaganda. \n \n Now we tackle suicide. \n \n From 1972 to 1995, the per capita gun stock in the U. S. increased by more than 50%. In 1972, the suicide rate was 11.9 per 100,000. In 1995, the suicide rate was -- 11.9 per 100,000. (It remained remarkably constant during this time, with a high of 13.0 and a low of 11.8.) \n \n This clearly demonstrates that owning a gun does not cause people to commit suicide: the number of guns per American increased by 50%, yet we did not kill ourselves any more often than before. So even if you believe the government should try to keep people from killing themselves, banning guns won't do it. \n \n The numbers are out there, and it's easy to see the results. I used to be anti-gun until I realized that \"gun control\" was totally failing at its stated goal of keeping Americans safer. \n \n Here's a last little tidbit: In what city do husbands kill their wives the most? (Per capita -- I'm not a statistical cheat.) \n \n New York, which has some of the toughest anti-gun laws around. \n \n Here's another classic: the \"save the children\" canard. \n \n How many children are killed each year by gun accidents? Take a guess. Now let's look at some numbers: the way that anti-gun groups get big numbers is by stretching the definition of \"children\". \n \n \"The annual review of mortality data, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, said gun-related deaths dropped from 4,223 in 1997 to 3,792 among children under age 20 in 1998.\" -Handgun Control, Inc. \n \n \"Children under age 20?\" What? Some of these \"children\" are fighting a war in Iraq right now. \n \n \"In 1997 gun accidents killed 142 children from birth to age 14.\" \n \n Oh. \n \n I don't want to imply that these deaths are somehow acceptable -- but 142 is a lot less than 4,223. Most of the 4,223 are 16-19 year olds shooting each other in gang-related violence, not accidental shootings in the home. \n \n To give some perspective to this number, in an average year, roughly 550 children 0-14 are run over by cars, 800 are drowned, 660 are burned to death in fires, and 1,850 die inside cars. Most of these drownings are unattended children in backyard swimming pools -- meaning that swimming pools are many times more dangerous than guns! Where's the \"Mothers Against Swimming Pools\" lobby? \n \n (*) The government report spends a lot of time being skeptical of its own 1.5 million number and tries to find ways to discredit it -- but they can't find any evidence, because their own procedure was very specific: \"Each respondent who answered yes to either of these DGU [defensive gun use] questions was asked a sequence of 30 additional questions concerning the most recent defensive gun use in which the respondent was involved, including the respondent's actions with the gun, the location and other circumstances of the incident, and the respondent's relationship to the perpetrator. [...] Respondents were excluded on the basis of the most recent DGU description for any of the following reasons: the respondent did not see a perpetrator; the respondent could not state a specific crime that was involved in the incident; or the respondent did not actually display the gun or mention it to the perpetrator.\" \n Grigsby: Why I'm no longer anti-gun - Vox\n Bureau of Justice Statistics Key Facts at a Glance - Firearm deaths by intent",

   "* In 2006, there were only 154 justifiable homicides by private citizens using handguns in the United States.11\n\n Here is another deceptive practice by the Brady bunch. Make data sound like something it is not.\n   2006 Expanded Homicide Data \n Law enforcement reported 617 justifiable homicides in 2006. Of those, law enforcement officers justifiably killed 376 individuals, and private citizens justifiably killed 241 individuals.\n \n \n* The presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.18\n \n * The presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.19\n\n OK so it this were actually true, wouldn't crime murder and suicides be growing at some similar rate as the gun stock of America grows? I mean if this were actually true? \n \n   Total NICS Background Checks -- November 30, 1998 - August 31, 2009 \n ( There were)105,060,213 (request to purchase guns from gun shops) \n 105 million.\n \n And yet, as our gun stock grew.  Serious violent crime levels declined since 1993.\n In 1998 there were 2,776,000 violent crimes.\n In 2005 there were 1,823,300 \n   Homicide rates \n 1998 the homicide rate was= 6.8\n 2004 it was = 5.9 \n\n \n   Homicide rate Number of Crimes per 100,000 Inhabitants -- by Population Group, 2008 \n 2008 = 5.6 \n\n   U.S. Suicide Rates, 1950-2003 \n \n 1950 = 13.2\n 1990 = 12.5\n 2003 = 10.8\n\n How does this defy the Brady's so called studies?

   "youre more concerned about those 22 to 30 thousand gun laws but Im more concerned about the 22 to 30 thousand lives taken by gun violence each year and when youre dead guess what? then BANG! you dont have anymore rights protected by the bill of rights because youre dead\n so if youre really pro american and pro bill of rights then you should worry more about getting good gun control laws passed to protect peoples lives so they can enjoy their rights without having to worry about being shot and losing all their rights maybe youve just been decieved and dont understand what youre supporting\n\n \n Half of all firearms-related deaths are suicides. Out of the remaining 11 to 15 thousand deaths, the vast majority are the results of police shootings or gang wars. Neither of these are linked to widespread legal gun ownership, nor can they be curtailed with evermore laws. Only a fool would believe more laws against guns will affect gang members.",

   "wrong again, \n only 154 justifiable homicides out of thousands of murders\n \n * In 2005, 30,694 people in the United States died from firearm-related deaths &#8211; 12,352 were murdered; 17,002 killed themselves; 789 were accidents; 330 died by police intervention, and in 221, the intent was unknown.\n\n \n And in exactly how many of those 12,352 murders, was the one responsible a law-abiding citizen who legally owned the gun that was used? Exactly what is the figure?\n \n You'd better come up with something, because you're behind the 8 ball. Everybody knows the most deaths are the fault of the 1 million+ gang members in this country.\n \n EDIT\n \n Interesting fact. At least 85 million people in this country legally own guns, that's more than 28% of the entire American population.\n \n So let's compare and contrast shall we? 85 million legal gun owners, versus 12,352 murders. At a rate of one person per murder, that would mean only 0.00015% of the entire gun owning population is actually breaking the laws and committing acts of violence against others. That's not even a full 1% of our numbers.\n \n And that's assuming that those murders are the result of gun owners and not hardcore criminals and gang members. And while it's a shame that so many are killed when their deaths could be avoided, I simply don't see a problem that needs more gun control laws to address it.",
