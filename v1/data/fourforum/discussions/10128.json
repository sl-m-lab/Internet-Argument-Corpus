   "Fetus\n \n The unborn child from the start of the ninth week after conception to the time of birth.\n \n Prenatal development is defined by two stages. The first stage involves the formation of the embryo from the fertilized egg. During this stage, the embryo's cells multiply and differentiate rapidly at an exponential rate. The embryo develops a primitive nervous and circulatory system. In the second stage of prenatal development the child-to-be is referred to as the fetus. Embryologists begin calling the embryo a fetus once the first bone cells appear, which is at about the eighth week after conception. The fetus is unlike the embryo in that it begins to become much more active. In the first trimester the fetus can kick its legs and move its arms. At this stage the heartbeat is strong enough to be detected by ultrasound.",

Now we have zygotes also. Even easier to kill something that sounds like an alien.\n\n If you think that we on the pro-choice side do not call zygotes babies because of guilt, then I could claim that you do not call an unfertilized human egg a baby because of your guilt. Both arguments are just as absurd because they assume that what we REALLY think is that the zygote (or unfertilized egg) is REALLY a person and we are denying that because we would like to make things convenient for ourselves. Where your reasoning is faulty is that few if any of us on the pro-choice side REALLY believe that the zygote is a person (baby) just as you don't REALLY believe that the unfertilized egg is a person.",

Its a reasonably well informed belief based in biological reality. However its not scientifically possible to determine personhood so it IS a belief well founded though it may be. Thus the choice of what to believe must be left to the woman rather than enforced universally by law - such law would lack any scientifically informed foundation.",
