   "I've questioned whether I've had the symptoms all through college. I never felt I had it in high school, but probably only because the work was ridiculously unchallenging.\n \n I'm assuming there aren't too many doctors on this forum, but it would be helpful if somebody could give anecdotes of their own experiences with ADD and its treatments.\n \n The following are reasons that have made me consider a psychiatric evaluation of some serious ADD: my attendance in college includes 0% of discussions or office hours, and around 20% of classes senior year. If I do go to class I get extremely bored, paradoxically even if I find the material fascinating (perhaps I can't focus enough to tie it together). I still have homework to do (ME major) and I do it at home. I cannot do my homework without, watching TV, gambling, or socializing at the same time -- I find it almost physically impossible to sit still and *just* do homework. I have 3 separate checkbooks, not only do I not keep a balance, I write checks completely randomly (whichever check I open to out of the 3). I drink about 4L of soda a day (Diet Mountain Dew, quite a bit of caffeine, perhaps for self-medication). If I leave my apartment, more than half the time I come back in once or twice because I forgot something. In college I have missed 2 finals (luckily I was allowed to make them up, I have also missed other exams). I also have two cousins who have recently been \"diagnosed\" with ADD in the past year.\n \n I could continue with other funny stories and whatnot, but I feel that is a decent overview. I'm worried now because I would like to go on to law school. Law school is not like engineering were you can miss class and still get by OK. There is also tons of reading. With my current habits and idiosyncrasies, I can't fathom finishing law school. \n \n The few times I have taken Adderol, or Ritalin etc. from a friend, I plugged through my homework -gasp- at the library -gasp- efficiently. I feel that I would be graduating with a AB instead of a BC with the advent of a \"concentration drug\".\n \n Does anybody have any stories of being diagnosed late, perhaps during college? Where the changes significant? Do my symptoms sound familiar?\n \n Thanks :xbanghead",

It really itsn't a disease at all. Perhaps it is really a euphemism for \"de-motivational disorder\". In that taking drugs for the \"disease\" are really only curing \"symptoms\" that are perhaps only personal traits.\n \n \n May I suggest getting off the caffeine for say six weeks, so that can at least be ruled out as a causative or excacerbating factor?

You can try one week, though then you introduce an element of chance into the picture.\n \n The soda itself, regardless of caffeine content, also may contribute to fluctuating blood sugar levels..\n \n Why not (after your finals) take a shot at a less stimulant orientated diet for a few weeks, it's hardly going to hurt you.\n \n You say you didn't notice these things in high school - when did you start drinking large quantities of soda / caffeine?",
