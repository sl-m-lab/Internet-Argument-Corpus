I don't see how this helps the economy. emoticon_confused\n \n \nBut some of the NEA's grants are spicing up more than the economy. A few of their more risque choices have some taxpayer advocates hot under the collar, including a $50,000 infusion for the Frameline film house, which recently screened Thundercrack, \"the world's only underground kinky art porno horror film, complete with four men, three women and a gorilla.\"\n\n \n \nBut he presumably didn't intend to have stimulus money help fund the weekly production of \"Perverts Put Out\" at San Francisco's CounterPULSE, whose \"long-running pansexual performance series\" invites guests to \"join your fellow pervs for some explicit, twisted fun.\"\n\n \n \nOne project that has received past NEA funding and stands to get an additional boost from a $25,000 stimulus grant is \"The Symmetry Project,\" a dance piece by choreographer Jess Curtis.\n \n The show depicts \"the sharing of a central axis, [as] spine, mouth, genitals, face, and anus reveal their interconnectedness and centrality in embodied experience,\" according to a description offered on Curtis' Web site.\n\n \n It's nice to know that we're paying for that, isn't it?",

Or is it just denial? emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n \nIt won't seem so cheap in hell. I didn't make the claim, so I don't have to prove anything.\n\n \n I see, another illogical twister of facts. Are you incapable of following the debate? I called Obama a communist; you accused me of bearing false witness. I replied that talks cheap, and challenged you to prove he isn't a radical communist. And you think that you can just deny he is what he is without proving he isn't a communist based on his very public actions and policies? \n \n \nAnother claim with no proof.\n\n \n Really? Then list one member of his cabinet or inner circle who is an avowed capitalist if you can. If I could, I would, but I can't name even one moderate he has affiliated himself with.\n \n [QUOTE]Haven't seen any proof for either claim. Still waiting.\n \n Are you living in a vacuum? Do you not watch the news at night? Have you no clue that his policies are turning us into a third world country? Can you post any objective evidence that I am wrong in my claim? I mean, why should I have to document the obvious?\n \n \n \nNope.\n\n \n You really don't \"remember when he said to judge him by the people he surrounds himself with?\" Then you do live in a vacuum of self imposed ignorance and I'm wasting my time even attempting to reason with you since you are obviously in denial of reality. Here you go anyway, in Obama's own voice, and a lot more info to apprise you of the facts of what this enemy of the state represents in reality. YouTube - Obama\"Judge me by the people with whom I surround myself.' 4\n \n \nI seek the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I'm not a Democrat or Republican. I'm not stupid enough to be a tool for the political hacks. I follow God and Him only. Who do you follow?\n\n \n Why is it that because I oppose Obama, the enemy of the state, you assume I'm a republican? Because I'm a registered independent. And if you're so independent and not a lying tool for the liberals, then why are you denying what is so obvious about Obama? Your denials of his criminal and treasonous affiliations betray you dconklin.\n \n I challenge you to refute the facts in these videos. Obama's Czars",

Why did you just ignore the two links I posted with overwhelming evidence which support my claims? Here they are again. First the evidence that he said to judge him by those whom he surrounds himself with: YouTube - Obama\"Judge me by the people with whom I surround myself.' 4 Then the evidence of his communist and radical affiliations, and history: Obama's Czars \n \n Second point, if you know the Lord and understand grace and salvation according to Gods word, then why are you so quick to condemn someone you perceive as wrong? Is there no grace in your salvation gospel? Is everyone whom you perceive as wrong destined to burn without considering that they might be covered by the shed blood of Christ on Calvary's Cross? Is that knowledge of His sacrifice beyond you?\n \n \nI didn't make a claim. You have the burden of proof. You learn this stuff in logic classes.\n\n \n Then go back to logic class because you're making no logical sense at all here as you produce no evidence for your dishonest claims in defense of Obama while demanding I produce evidence which you then ignore. That is illogical, yet it's all i'm getting from you.\n \n \nSure you are. you just sound like a mouthpiece for the radical right.\n\n \n What I am is a mouthpiece for the \"adamantly opposed to Obama's attempt to fundamentally reshape america in his communist image\". I challenge you to watch him in his own words and point out one promise he made that night which has come to be. Just listen to the promise he makes about college education costs as compared to his administration actually discussing placing a new and unheard of TAX on college educations. I challenge you to defend against this reality rather than deflect and deny the need to respond with facts. YouTube - Obama @ MU If your next reply is as juvenile and evasive as the last two, I will place you on ignore and never be a party to your games again.

   "I know it's an old thread, but I forgot completely about it.\n \n \nEthmi, you have not offered a single economic piece of data that says this is unwarranted. All we hear is morality. Me, I'm at least saying that the idea is not wrong in principle, but that I lack the economic detail to make a decision. Nothing you said indicates you have any of that data, either.\n\n \n That is not true, why I think this is bulls*** has nothing to do with morality. The porn industry is bigger than ever, it's not even something people keep to themselves anymore. I don't see how funding it is different from the auto industry bailout. Oh, yeah, that's right. The difference is it's a liberal doing this so that makes it OK. \n \n \nAm I OKL with the US government doing this? Well, yeah. You're too big not to affect the rest of the world, and I'd like your economy to get back on track, so the rest of the world's can too. I don't know which industries need the stimulus, I don't have the data, but I expect a broad spectrum application of the stimulus would be OK. If that includes the porn industry, then the porn industry should be stimulated.\n \n\n \n You can talk when you can explain how funding all these companies - not just porn companies, any company that's recieving stimulus funds without showing signs of failing, is different from a bailout. It may not be refered to as a \"bailout\", but no matter how much sugar you put on a warm pile of horse s***, you won't make it appetizing.\n \n \nAnd where did you get the idea of raising prices? Why not tell the automobile industry to raise prices? Cause that's kinda not the idea of an economic stimulus...\n\n \n That's completely different.

You are now on ignore since I see no value in debating with philosophical cowards who will obfuscate rather than honestly face and respond to my posts with on topic evidence. \n \n But it's interesting to see how you will deflect at all cost since you know there is no honest defense against what Obama represents in reality.
