   "Please.\n \n I have to keep repeating. White people are looting. And I'm sure they are even looting VCRs and TVs (what the hell are they gonna watch?). But I can almost guarantee that the ultraviolence, the arson, the sniping, is coming from the projects, and in New Orleans, white people DO NOT live in the projects. and by that I mean that white people don't LIVE if they go into the projects...\nYou bring up an interesting point. One man (who just happened to be black) was found to have looted five big screen TVs (got caught with them in his home) and he was defended by one of the black leaders, saying he might have intended to use them to barter for food.",

   "gnojek: No-one's agreeing with the opinions of the people in the related articles. However, I disagree with your claim that only black people are shooting at rescuers, that only black people are starting fires and that only black people are going around in armed gangs. Can you back up this claim with evidence? If not, where did you get the idea from that only black people are doing this?\n\n You're not from New Orleans are you?\n I don't think you're even from the US.\n Ah, just checked it, you're not.\n I don't think you get it.\n \n Maybe in some place like Idaho white people would be shooting at cops, but not in New Orleans.\n \n Ok, let's just say it's extremely unlikely.\n \n If you can find me a picture of ANYONE shooting at cops, I'll bet you anything they are black.\n \n \n \n But let's listen to Rush Limbaugh crack some racism.\n Here he calls New Orleans mayor Nagin \"Mayor Nager\"\n http://movies.crooksandliars.com/nager.mp3\n \n That's not as bad as Coondaleeza Rice, but getting there. :)\n \n \n \n edit: The mayor wants vacations for the cops that actually did their jobs.

If I did, chances are they'd be black, obviously. You still haven't provided any evidence of only black people are doing all this. I don't see how you can't back this view up, as surely you'd have had to get some info from somewhere to form that opinion. If so, where is it?\n \n -Wez",
