   "\"I Salute You\"\n \n to all the children who woke up at three a.m. to find themselves alone\n\n According to South Park, that's when Goths dance alone...\n \n \nto all the children who were afraid of their fathers\n\n Blame the mothers.\n \n \nto all the children who have ever been to court\n i salute you\n\n Why?\n Why are they in court and why salute them?\n \n \nto all the children who have wanted to give up on occasion\n\n Children...or teens?\n It's quite natural for teens to want to give up. Even for adults too.\n \n \nto all the children who ever had to take care of a parent\n\n While I understand what you mean here, in reality, most children the world over and for the past umpteenth generations have taken care of parents.\n \n \nto all the children who have ever hid when you heard a knock on your door\n\n Was it the fuzz? Was it mommy who was looking to find who broke the vase?\n \ni salute you\n\n Saluting people...just let them be.\n \n \nto all the children who grew up way too fast\n\n The majority of children 'grow up too fast'. unfortunatly it's a silly western concept that 'children' should enjoy this abnormal thing called childhood for too damn long. Spoiled is what we is. Some people are still 'children' at the tender young age of 40.\n \nin all world with long forgotten hope\n\n Too many have false hope drilled into them for a long time. Told that they can be anything but not given the tools to realize those potentials...that they never had to begin with.\n Lower your expectations...you'll be happier in the end and find that elusive contentment.\n \nand false confidences by the dozens\n\n yep, earth shattering. Wait until your older. It doesn't get any better.\n \ni salute you\n\n Maybe you should toss in 'Quit Bitching' instead of saluting. Self pity does no one good.\n \n \nto all the children who at times\n didnt feel as much like children as parents\n\n Does this go for the countless children who help raise their siblings in extended families...or, are you jealous because those spoiled kids in your peer group don't have the same 'burdens' you appear to have?\n \nor as much like parents as prisoners\n\n Life is a prison...decorate it and it'll seem like home.\n i salute you\n \n \ni salute these children\n this \"lost\" generation, generation x.\n\n MY generation is Gen X...I don't even know what they call you guys.\n \nbecause to understand los\n you have to have lived it first\n\n Doesn't sound like you've lived yet. But, you don't have to understand loss to get that feeling that you have lossed. It's called entitlement. A sense that somehow, you were due better, that life should be fair and balanced. That somehow, your misery is shared by others in similar shoes.\n I've known many, MANY people who have experienced the things you lament...and state they are better people for it. And, I also know some who fall into a pit of self pity. If it's due to a chemical imbalance, seek help. If it's simply the cards you've been dealt in life, get over it. Wear it as a badge of honor. That you're superior to others and are a valued achiever that others envy.\n If that doesn't work, lure priveledged teens into dark alley ways and slaughter them. Then thank Zardoz for encouraging you to become a serial killer. After all, you have sooo much to blame for your nefarious deeds. Like daddy...\n \n \n \nso go back to your mansion, Mr.Bush\n\n Mr. Bush isn't responsible for your plight.\n \nand close the curtains on the country\n\n Nor is he obligated to offer you relief.\n \nwhile we churn out another generation\n of children of nobody\n\n This is called logical disconnect. Or, even jumping on a band wagon of blame.\n Misplaced anger and hostility.\n \n Go slaughter the snobby priveledged.\n Or even your own family...they're the ones causing you the woe.\n \n \n Yeah, I know it's a poem...but, angsty teeny whinney poetry really, REALLY is over done.\n \n \n \n How about composing a poem entited 'I have an Ear Ring'\n \n I have an ear ring on my key chain of all the trophies I took from all the snobs that I kilt whilst on my way to the subway.\n I have a blood stained knife that took the life of one too few posers that I snuffed whilst on my way to work the other day.\n I have a mask that I where as I ask, a fine young lass I met is a class, where she'd like to go when we toddle off to play.\n ...\n \n Or, How about 'I'm better than George.'\n \n I was mistaken when I tried to keep up with George Jones \n and his nice little family down the street.\n For while my life was bad, I find it really sad \n that the family of George he doust beat.\n \n When keeping up with the Jones's\n In all of their pretty little homes's\n There is\n One thing you should seek\n \n While all that are happy \n have smiles identically snappy\n know that\n Everyone's misery is unique.",
