   "\"European politicians have thrown out a controversial bill that could have led to software being patented. \n \n The European Parliament voted 648 to 14 to reject the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive.\"\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4655955.stm\n \n 648 to 14! Stick that up your collective arses members of the European Commission with your big business-driven abuse of democracy that you indulged in earlier this year.\n \n If it had been passed, the bill would have forced US-style software patents upon EU countries, allowing the ludicrous situation of ideas being patented (such as the idea of storing credit card details in a database to speed up online purchases, a US patent held by Amazon).\n \n Sadly due to the undemocratic antics of the European Commission, we will get no legislation. They ignored the wishes of parliament to allow patents on software that was integral to inventions only and tried to force through the US style system. Individual countries might still adopt that system, but at least the EU as a whole is svaed from such madness.\n \n This is a victory for free enterprise\n This is a victory for Linux and other open source software\n This is a victory for democracy\n This is a victory for Europe\n \n This is a good day!",
