   "What do you think the right to life actually means? If you would ask most people they would say that the right to life boils down to the right not to be killed. But does this also include the right to be provided with what you require to live? One of the main problems of the abortion argument is that neither side can agree on whether the fetus is either a) alive or b) a person so this argument will be made by assuming that the fetus is a living person. \n \n In the case of a rape, the fetus (by the way, the word fetus is used in reference to all stages of development for simplicity's sake) is imposed upon the woman without any consent or permission from her. So now the fetus is using the woman's body as life support and if aborted will die, so is the woman obligated to keep the fetus alive? Yes, it would be wrong to kill the fetus, as it is wrong to kill any person, but it is not within the fetus' right to be provided with what it needs to live, in this case, use of the woman's body. It would be as if (borrowing from Judith Thompson, the philosopher whose argument I am trying to present) in the middle of the night, someone snuck into your room and hooked you up to an innocent unconscious kidney patient who needs your kidneys to circulate his blood for nine months, or else he will die. Is the person obligated to give the kidney patient use of their body, even though it would mean death to the kidney patient to disconnect them? I would hope that most people would say that the kidney patient has no right to the person's body, and therefore there would be no moral issue in disconnecting him, an unfortunate circumstance, but no one would blame the person for disconnecting.\n \n A stickier situation comes into play concerning (I would assume) the most common cause for a woman to get an abortion, failed contraception. The argument above fails to apply now, because the woman has knowledge of the consequences of her actions. But, can we say that a woman using contraceptives that fail should be morally obligated to take on the fetus until the pregnancy comes to term? This is like saying that if you owned a house that had all the necessary precautions to keep burgalers/vagabonds/the homeless out of your house such as barbed wire fences, bars on the windows, etc. that if one of these unwanted visitors should somehow get past all of these precautionary measures, you should be obligated to feed and take care of them in your house. Now, it would be very generous of someone to take care of a homeless person that needed food so badly that he/she broke into their house (despite all precautions), but would anyone feel morally obligated to not kick that person out of their house, even if it meant they would die of hunger/disease once kicked out? Should one be frowned upon or morally obligated to keep unwanted breaking and entering persons in their house even if it meant their death to expel them? \n \n Eager to hear a variety of arguments from all sides.\n \n (Personally, I don't believe that the fetus is a person, but in order to make this argument more than a \"it is so, it is not\" argument, this assumption needs to be made.)",

The argument above fails to apply now, because the woman has knowledge of the consequences of her actions.\n\n \n A few musings to get the ball rolling.....\n \n A woman is not at error by default in this situation. Most forms of contraception can (and do) fail even when employed exactly as the \"manufacturer intended\". Even the various types of pill sometimes don't work even when taken exactly as prescribed due to factors that are very difficult for the individual to be aware of. However, contraception also fails due to incorrect use (by both parties) more commonly I guess. However, you can't base any sort of judgement in this situation on how well someone used their contracetpives as there is no way of establishing if they were \"negligent\" or not.",
