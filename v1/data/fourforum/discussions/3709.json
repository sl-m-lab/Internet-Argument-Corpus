   "here are some.\n The Pollution Solution \n Pollution Solution II \n Libertarian Solutions: The Pollution Solution\n\n \n the first page offers no real solutions to problems, it only says that the govt is the largest polluters and that if you want to save large grazing animals then \"own\" some\n \n it does mention national forests as if the presence of these things are good (and they are) so does that mean libertarians are in favor of publicly protected lands?\n \n The second one makes more sense. This is the area I was concerned about<b></b>:\n \nIn Britain, individuals have property rights in the rivers that run through their land. If someone upstream pollutes the water and harms the fish, the downstream owners don't have to wait for a bureaucratic commission to study the issue. Instead, they immediately sue the polluters to protect their valuable property and claim restitution for damages. As a result, would-be polluters are effectively deterred from damaging the environment.\n\n \n But it's things like this:\n \nEven ocean beds can be protected from pollution when private ownership of fishing rights is coupled with restitution. In some states, homesteading of oyster beds is permitted. Private oyster beds are more prolific and profitable than public ones. The owners have incentive to invest money in caring for the beds and harvesting them sustainably.\n\n and the ownership of wildlife above that don't make sense. \n These actions might sustain a profitable number of certian animals for human use and consumption, but what about the interests of all the life in that area? What if a private oyster bed wasn't an oyster bed before? What if by breeding and protecting these 'domesticated' oyters (or other animals) you upset the ecology of the surrounding area? \n \n What is the libertarian answer to protect WILDlife. If life is owned, it is no longer wild. Also, if life isn't profitable, there are no incentives for protection. These \"suggestions\" made on these 2 pages so far are only concerned with human comforts and profit. Of course, there is more to life than this.\n \n Well, the third page is just a repeat of the first.\n \n So here's my problem with all this.\n Some of it makes sense, like the part about property owners downstream of a river. But, what happens when a certain pollutant is released that doesn't affect people? What if the people downstream (if there are any) don't care about what's being put into the water? It may kill all the fish and plants in the water, but if humans downstream don't care, then what's to stop it?\n If humans have no interest in protecting, say, wolves, badgers, owls, otters, turtles, and every other animal that serves no real purpose to humans, then what will protect them?\n \n Do you see my problems with this philosophy?\n I agree with just about everything libertarian when it comes to humans interacting with humans, but it really has little place when it comes to humans interacting with the rest of nature.",

They want very small government. Some seem to side with Republicans - others side with Democrats. It seems to depend on what freedoms they hold dear, the \"freedom\" to have abortions, legal drugs, and isolationism from foriegn countries, or the freedom of private property rights, medical care, and freedom from foreign attacks.\n \n\n Yup.\n \n \nI was asking you, because your posts seem to imply that \"experts\" will protect us from any environmental problems. They are missing when it comes to road de-icing. Did you see the \"road salt\" thread elseware on this forum? In the link there, did you see how the environmentalist said \"safe roads come before all else\"? The Sierra Club diversifies!!!!! Safety trumps the environment!!!!!!!!!!! Wouldn't it be nice if they said \"private property rights come before all else\"? I might listen to them if they did.\n\n Well, I didn't mean to imply that experts will protect us from anything, but if I need to know if something will harm the environment in which we all live, I'd hope that person would be an expert on the subject and not some dumbass. Also, if I wanted to know how to go about preventing or cleaning something up, I'd ask an expert, not a dumbass.\n \n Well, maybe safety trumps the environment. That does not mean the roads MUST be salted. If you want to be safe, don't drive down icy roads, or don't drive when it's icy.\n \n \nAnd? Ask yourself what's in it for them every time they try to tell you the sky is falling. I'll be watching to see if your future posts reflect it. :)\n\n \n They don't get anything from me, so I'm not worried about it.",

My work takes me to every corner of it. I can't taste or see a thing but crystal clear blue sky. But I believe Cincinnati is considered a \"non-attainment\" area by the EPA. We have auto emission testing in Cincinnati, and in the three adjoining counties in northern Ky. I don't think there are any facts and figures that show the air is any cleaner than since before these auto tests started, but it seems they aren't going anywhere. Deals were made, contracts were signed, don't ya know.\n \n Oh there is one time per year when Cincinnati's air gets choked with smog. The \"Riverfest\" fireworks display. Happens after dark, so most people don't notice the filth. If a private industry put out that kind of pollution once a year the EPA would be quick to act, but since it benefits the city's tax base, that kind of pollution is not a problem. :)",

And there's a difference between libertarianism and small government (minarchism.) \n\n \n The only excuse for usage of violence is in defence of negative rights according to the libertarian philosophy. There are to be no collective or positive rights nor should there be governmentally owned collective property. The libertarian ideology cannot justify the use of violence (law) to protect property of individuals from their \"rightful\" owners (as that would infringe on individual property rights). The only situation that would justify use of violence (law) would be where individual property must be protected from others (protecting individual property rights). Democracy is toothless as it cannot justifiably infringe on the individual right to use (or destroy) private property, nor can it confiscate property or allow for governmentally owned collective property. Individual freedom cannot be impaired by democratic decissions, law cannot regulate anything but property, contracts and protection of negative rights (which basicly boils down to freedom from harm). \n \n \n And there's a difference between libertarianism and small government (minarchism.)
