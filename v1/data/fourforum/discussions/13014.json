Our government leaders really think that National Healthcare will help the economy, so they are willing to put this on everyone else but themselves.

It has to be inconvenient if the politicians that are trying to place this national healthcare on the public when they want to keep the current system on themselves which convinces people that the current system is better.

The fact is imo, that there is nothing productive, economical or efficient about this Government program. When all is said and done, it will be about rationing healthcare to the american people and concentrating the most effort toward the young. The old will ultimately be sacrificed at the alter of economic efficiency with this brave new world of socialized medicine. We are seeing examples of it today through medicare on a smaller scale than will be practiced once this new program is enacted if we allow it to be.",

   "Thing is while our politicians in congress are sipping their martinis,emoticon_xhoho people are already dying from our flawed healthcare system. Now even though it is not how people would like it to be, it is much better than national healthcare. If we have to ration healthcare if this plan passes, more people will die.emoticon_xangel You are right about how our seniors will die because the government thinks that they are less important tan everyone else. That they are not worthy to recieve quality healthcare they can afford. I also agree with the smaller scale medicare which is the simulation, as one might put it what will happen to our seniors if this plan passes, but on a nationwide scale. Our seniors may be retired, or not as helpful as they used to be, but they helped our country. Throughout their lives they fought in wars to defend our country, helped those less fortunate, and lived their lives like normal people, and they are getting punished for that?!emoticon_mad\n Everyone deserves to live, it is not at all the governments decision to decide who lives and who dies.\n \n \n In what country is there a place for people like me? -Andrew Ryan",
