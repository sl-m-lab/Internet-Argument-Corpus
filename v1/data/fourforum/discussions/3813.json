He was a reservist of some sort. He was also a small, skinny, slightly built person. I eventually won the argument when I pointed out that I knew numerous lesbians that could turn him into a little puddle of goo. It was a rude shock to him, but he couldn't deny it. There will always be individuals who are superior to others based on some prized characteristic, but you won't be able to identify them by applying the criteria of gender.\n \n\n \n You need to look at an anatamony book and then read psychology books. Men and women are inherenlty different. We are equal but not identical. Law recognize those differences. That is legal and prudent.",

Yet, in the same post he mentions how even married gay couples in mass cannot collect social security. Didn't you name one yourself? \n \n Gay couples are taxed after the death of their partner, this wold not be so if they could marry.\n \n There are two ways to purchase a house, joint tennats and teenats in common. If you are listed as joint tennats you both own the house 100% equally. Upon death ownership of that house will go to the surviving partner, but the value of that is included in the estate of that person because they owned it. The surviving partner will need to pat the inheritiance tax on that amount. If that amount exceeds 250,000 the tax is at 50% on real estate and 20% on other monies and values. Only married spouses are exempt from this. Gays cannot get married so they are not exempt. So in short, there is no way out of this. gay couples end up being taxed on their own belongings. My partner and I have been researching a way to skate this by a trust or something.\n \n Married couple contrary to Mania's \"thought\" on the matter can live together in an assisted living facility, by law they cannot be separated unless it endangers their health. Gay coupled regardless how long they have been together are not afforded this right.\n \n Mania has also pointed out that the Federal Goverment will not recognize gay marriages done anywhere, and that is true.

Thanks\n Misty \n \n \n http://members3.boardhost.com/Ask_Dr_Joan/msg/444.html\n \n \n \n Lesbian Life \n Advertisement\n \n \n Fisting\n How To :Fisting\n From Kathy Belge,\n Your Guide to Lesbian Life.\n \n \n \n The term fisting may sound like it's done fast and hard, but actually fisting is an act that requires patience, arousal and lots of lubrication. Here's how it's done. \n \n http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/ht/HowtoFist.htm\n \n \n vaginal fisting is primarily a lesbian activity\n \n http://www.googlism.com/what_is/v/vaginal_fisting/\n \n Some lesbian sexual practises are risky (see underneath for more details) \n \n Any sexual activity, which can lead to bleeding or cuts/breaks in the lining of vagina or anus, is risky, including 'fisting' or certain S&M activities. \n \n http://www.avert.org/lesbiansafesex.htm\n \n \n Lesbians account for about 10-12% of the total population but there are only three articles on lesbian health in gynaecological and obstetrics journal. Studies have shown that 84% of lesbians are not comfortable seeking health care (Stevens & Hall, 1988, Zeidenstein, 1990). The reasons being that they have experienced non-empathetic responses from health care providers. One study documented that 72% of lesbians reported negative responses after their sexual orientation was known (Stevens & Hall, 1988). The result of lesbians' reluctance to seek health care may adversely affect their health and well-being. Therefore it is important to outline health issues and concerns that affect lesbians. \n \n As women, many lesbian health concerns are the same as for heterosexual women. Just because your partner is a woman does not mean that you are immune from STDs and other gynaecological problems. \n \n General hygiene & disease prevention\n Watch for unpleasant odour, it could be a sign of a vaginal infection and/or STD. A healthy vagina does not smell. If symptoms persist, see your doctor. \n Bathroom etiquette: always wipe from front to back after urinating or defecating. This keeps waste products and bacteria from entering the vagina and urethra thus preventing urinary and bladder infections. Always wash your genital area every day or more often with warm water. Avoid using harsh soaps with strong perfumes which can cause irritation in some women. \n Commercial douching, feminine hygiene sprays, and bubble baths can be irritating. \n Feminine hygiene sprays can dry out mucous membranes or cause allergic reactions. You do not need to douche at all since the vagina naturally cleanses itself through small daily vaginal secretions. Commercial douches upset the delicate vaginal chemical balance which can lead to infections. If you feel that you need to douche, do not do it more than once a month. Plain tepid water is best. Avoid bulbs and syringes since water that is forced into the vagina could possibly be pushed into the uterus or the abdominal cavity and cause damage. Pregnant women should never douche. \n Avoid nylon underwear and pantyhose as they do not allow the vagina to breathe. Cotton underwear are preferable. \n Keep your fingernails short. Longer nails can irritate the cervix without your lover even knowing, causing a cervical abrasion which is very susceptible to infection. Bacteria can accumulate under the fingernails and can possibly lead to a vaginal infection. \n Educate yourself and practice safer sex and reduce the risk of transmitting STDs, HIV/AIDS, and vaginal infections. If you are not completely sure that your lover is without infection or an STD (HIV/AIDS included) then use a latex barrier when performing oral sex, a latex glove when fingering or fisting the vagina and/or anus, thoroughly clean sex toys in between uses and partners, cover dildos with a new condom for each new user. \n \n http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/lbgtm/info/women.html\n \n Lesbian sex is not taken seriously in the wider community and that is a fact. It is therefore more difficult for women who sleep with women to stay sexually healthy because of a fear of not being taken seriously and because of a fear of the consequences of breaking the silence around lesbian sex. It is important to be able to talk about sex without feeling ashamed or embarrassed not only because of the impact silence has on our safer-sex education but also because sexual health is an emotional state of wellbeing, as well as physical.\n \n fistingWhen the subject of fisting arises there is always a mixed reaction from any group of people. Its name harshly suggests the idea of simply making a fist and putting it inside someone, in which case the squeamish reactions would be entirely justified. Fisting is the insertion of a whole hand into the vagina, which if done properly and with the necessary care can be an extremely intense and enjoyable experience. It takes patience, hard work, and time and it should be done gently and slowly.\n Safety concerns- Minimise the possibility of damage to those sensitive areas (anus and vagina) by cutting and filing your nails as shortly as possible.\n - Remove any jewellery you may be wearing.\n - Latex gloves are advisable because of the amount of stretching that takes place when fisting. Small tears may occur which provide a route of transmission for STIs.\n - You can never use too much lube. Reapply throughout, not just to fingers but to your whole hand (when fisting).\n Penetration using your fingers or whole hand can become very tiring. It is easy to think of staying sexually healthy purely in terms of STIs but your muscles are also important! If you do become tired you can try varying some of the following things:\n - using your fingers and hand alone;\n - moving your hand and lower arm together;\n - loosening your arm and work from your shoulder;\n - adjusting the position of your body when you can;\n - using latex gloves, which can make penetration smoother.\n \n http://lgbta.dsu.org.uk/welf_ssw.php\n \n \n Almost all of these are lesbian or objective sites.",

Here's how it's done. \n \n http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/ht/HowtoFist.htm\n \n \n vaginal fisting is primarily a lesbian activity\n \n http://www.googlism.com/what_is/v/vaginal_fisting/\n \n Some lesbian sexual practises are risky (see underneath for more details) \n \n Any sexual activity, which can lead to bleeding or cuts/breaks in the lining of vagina or anus, is risky, including 'fisting' or certain S&M activities. \n \n http://www.avert.org/lesbiansafesex.htm\n \n \n Lesbians account for about 10-12% of the total population but there are only three articles on lesbian health in gynaecological and obstetrics journal. Studies have shown that 84% of lesbians are not comfortable seeking health care (Stevens & Hall, 1988, Zeidenstein, 1990). The reasons being that they have experienced non-empathetic responses from health care providers. One study documented that 72% of lesbians reported negative responses after their sexual orientation was known (Stevens & Hall, 1988). The result of lesbians' reluctance to seek health care may adversely affect their health and well-being. Therefore it is important to outline health issues and concerns that affect lesbians. \n \n As women, many lesbian health concerns are the same as for heterosexual women. Just because your partner is a woman does not mean that you are immune from STDs and other gynaecological problems. \n \n General hygiene & disease prevention\n Watch for unpleasant odour, it could be a sign of a vaginal infection and/or STD. A healthy vagina does not smell. If symptoms persist, see your doctor. \n Bathroom etiquette: always wipe from front to back after urinating or defecating. This keeps waste products and bacteria from entering the vagina and urethra thus preventing urinary and bladder infections. Always wash your genital area every day or more often with warm water. Avoid using harsh soaps with strong perfumes which can cause irritation in some women. \n Commercial douching, feminine hygiene sprays, and bubble baths can be irritating. \n Feminine hygiene sprays can dry out mucous membranes or cause allergic reactions. You do not need to douche at all since the vagina naturally cleanses itself through small daily vaginal secretions. Commercial douches upset the delicate vaginal chemical balance which can lead to infections. If you feel that you need to douche, do not do it more than once a month. Plain tepid water is best. Avoid bulbs and syringes since water that is forced into the vagina could possibly be pushed into the uterus or the abdominal cavity and cause damage. Pregnant women should never douche. \n Avoid nylon underwear and pantyhose as they do not allow the vagina to breathe. Cotton underwear are preferable. \n Keep your fingernails short. Longer nails can irritate the cervix without your lover even knowing, causing a cervical abrasion which is very susceptible to infection. Bacteria can accumulate under the fingernails and can possibly lead to a vaginal infection. \n Educate yourself and practice safer sex and reduce the risk of transmitting STDs, HIV/AIDS, and vaginal infections. If you are not completely sure that your lover is without infection or an STD (HIV/AIDS included) then use a latex barrier when performing oral sex, a latex glove when fingering or fisting the vagina and/or anus, thoroughly clean sex toys in between uses and partners, cover dildos with a new condom for each new user. \n \n http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/lbgtm/info/women.html\n \n Lesbian sex is not taken seriously in the wider community and that is a fact. It is therefore more difficult for women who sleep with women to stay sexually healthy because of a fear of not being taken seriously and because of a fear of the consequences of breaking the silence around lesbian sex. It is important to be able to talk about sex without feeling ashamed or embarrassed not only because of the impact silence has on our safer-sex education but also because sexual health is an emotional state of wellbeing, as well as physical.\n \n fistingWhen the subject of fisting arises there is always a mixed reaction from any group of people. Its name harshly suggests the idea of simply making a fist and putting it inside someone, in which case the squeamish reactions would be entirely justified. Fisting is the insertion of a whole hand into the vagina, which if done properly and with the necessary care can be an extremely intense and enjoyable experience. It takes patience, hard work, and time and it should be done gently and slowly.\n Safety concerns- Minimise the possibility of damage to those sensitive areas (anus and vagina) by cutting and filing your nails as shortly as possible.\n - Remove any jewellery you may be wearing.\n - Latex gloves are advisable because of the amount of stretching that takes place when fisting. Small tears may occur which provide a route of transmission for STIs.\n - You can never use too much lube. Reapply throughout, not just to fingers but to your whole hand (when fisting).\n Penetration using your fingers or whole hand can become very tiring. It is easy to think of staying sexually healthy purely in terms of STIs but your muscles are also important! If you do become tired you can try varying some of the following things:\n - using your fingers and hand alone;\n - moving your hand and lower arm together;\n - loosening your arm and work from your shoulder;\n - adjusting the position of your body when you can;\n - using latex gloves, which can make penetration smoother.\n \n http://lgbta.dsu.org.uk/welf_ssw.php\n \n \n Almost all of these are lesbian or objective sites.\n\n \n Why on earth would someone who claims to be SOOOOO STRAIGHT even extert energy going to \"gay\" websites? \n It boggles the mind. Oh, wait, I get it....\n YOU ARE GAY! \n \n \n You know, I don't go around to anti-gay websites, I don't frequent \"christian\" blogs. I don't have an insatiable urge to be maligned, libeled or insulted. Obviously you do. \n \n You are sick, sick, sick little man.

   "Mania mentions in his above posts that no one has names a right out of 1100 that gays and lesbians are denied. Yet, in the same post he mentions how even married gay couples in mass cannot collect social security. Didn't you name one yourself? \n \n Gay couples are taxed after the death of their partner, this wold not be so if they could marry.\n \n There are two ways to purchase a house, joint tennats and teenats in common. If you are listed as joint tennats you both own the house 100% equally. Upon death ownership of that house will go to the surviving partner, but the value of that is included in the estate of that person because they owned it. The surviving partner will need to pat the inheritiance tax on that amount. If that amount exceeds 250,000 the tax is at 50% on real estate and 20% on other monies and values. Only married spouses are exempt from this. Gays cannot get married so they are not exempt. So in short, there is no way out of this. gay couples end up being taxed on their own belongings. My partner and I have been researching a way to skate this by a trust or something.\n \n Married couple contrary to Mania's \"thought\" on the matter can live together in an assisted living facility, by law they cannot be separated unless it endangers their health. Gay coupled regardless how long they have been together are not afforded this right.\n \n Mania has also pointed out that the Federal Goverment will not recognize gay marriages done anywhere, and that is true. For now, but not forever.\n\n \n Obviously you've been reading too many gay right websites. You can avoid death taxes by good estate planning. You can do it by a trust. I'll find out which one because I remember learning about it. The fact is that good estate planning you can avoid taxes for any transfer.\n \n Contracts are in palce to assure your wishes are complied with. If you contract wiht a living center to keep you together then they should and if they don't then you always can force it through court. jsut as if they didn't obey the law the court could force it.",

To assert and/or publicly opine that one is a true Christian when one engages in name-calling and exhorting others to openly discriminate against another person or group gives Christian hypocrisy a bad name. \n \n The recent election results have surely taught us that Gay Bashing has turned into a \"successful\" Olympian sport by so-called Christian moralists like Dr. James Dobson and his cadre of enablers and opportunists. \n \n Well-known Focus on the Family founder Dr. James Dobson has spent a great deal of time, effort and money (none of which was his) in vilifying and viciously attacking the gay community. Dobson's vehicle for spewing forth his homophobic rant is aimed at amending the US Constitution to outlaw gay marriages. \n \n In October, Dobson spoke on behalf of Senatorial Candidate Tom Coburn of Oklahoma at a rally at Oklahoma Christian University in support of a constitutional ban on gay marriages. To prove that gay marriages led to fewer men and women getting married, Dobson cited countries such as Norway that have allowed same-sex couples to marry. \n \n Dobson said 80 percent of children are born out of wedlock in Norway. \"Homosexuals are not monogamous. They want to destroy the institution of marriage. It will destroy marriage. It will destroy the Earth, Dobson said.\" (The Oklahoman, 10-23-03) \n \n Not to be outdone by his mentor and political supporter, Tom Coburn told Rogers County Republicans last year, \"The gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power... That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today. Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That's a gay agenda.\" \n \n Lord have mercy, if these statements are true, and who would question the veracity of Christian stalwarts like Dobson and Coburn, then we (that's us so-called straight God-fearing folks) should be truly concerned about the power (Is that extreme power Mr. Coburn? Is there another kind, said Jack Nicholson, I'm sorry, I mean Coburn) of the gay community that will (a) destroy marriages, (b) destroy the earth (whew, and I was worried about global warming), and (c) the greatest threat to our freedom (I guess so, now that Saddam's been captured). \n \n Oklahomans are lucky to have voted for a visionary (soothsayer) like Senator Tom Coburn who was able to perceive that abortion is a \"gay agenda.\" Whew, Dr. Tom must be blessed with ESPN, don't ya think? I don't know about you, but I find it laughable at best to claim that abortion is a gay issue. Ever heard of a gay couple seeking an abortion or lamenting over an unwanted pregnancy? Now, I don't mean to disparage Dr. Tom if ya know what I mean. After all, he's a gynecologist and I'm not; however Dr. Tom should stop buying recreational drugs from street vendors in Tulsa who accept double off coupons. \n \n In 1998, Dr. Dobson gave a speech wherein he stated, \"You don't have to be taught that it's wrong to steal and to lie and to extort and to bribe and to oppress the poor and to express racial hatred and to be promiscuous, both homosexually and heterosexually. There's no difference between those two. Promiscuity it immoral, as is adultery. That law is eternal and it is written on the heart of man.\" \n \n http://rainbowallianceopenfaith.homestead.com/Dobson.html",

   "James Dobson: Focusing on Himself \n \n How James Dobson, leader of Focus on the Family, sets himself up as the moral authority of the nation -- taken from his own words and from other media reports \n \n Move over George Washington. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, wants to take your place as father of our country. But rather than being a true father -- one who helps us mature into individuals -- he is little more than another Pharisee, setting himself up as a religiously-based political dictator bent on getting us to support his personal view of legislated morality. \n And what's even worse, Dobson goes to great length to use Scripture to support his view, and yet according to Time magazine he doesn't even have any formal theological training. In short, Dobson, using his position as a radio psychologist, has set himself up as our moral authority and asks us all to blindly follow. \n \n But don't take my word for it. The following are quotes from Dobson and from other media reporting about Dobson's activities. In them you'll find Dobson clearly putting his ideas forth as the Gospel truth and asking all of us to act on them as if they were directly from God. The text in bold is my emphasis. \n \n In the January 1995 Focus on the Family Newsletter Dobson writes: \n \n \"Focus on the Family immediately joined the Family Research Council and other conservative organizations in getting out the word. Using our radio program and this monthly letter, we asked for a massive response from our listeners.\" \n \"Again, Focus on the Family threw down the gauntlet, We devoted our broadcast to this danger on three separate days, almost begging our listeners to flood the White House, the attorney general, and the Congress with letters of protest.\" \n \n \"One issue concerned the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child, which has worried me for years. I devoted a portion of my letter in January 1993, and again in July 1994, to the threat posed by this dangerous document. More than 150 countries around the world have already adopted it within their borders.\" \n \n \"The state of Oregon narrowly passed the nation's first euthanasia law, which almost defies comprehension. If the courts permit it to take effect, physicians will be allowed to assist their willing patients in killing themselves. The implications of this legislation are so ominous that I will devote a future letter to that topic.\" \n \n \"In May, I discussed this legislation in my monthly letter and warned of the many dangers that lie ahead.\" \n \n \"What ... I have called a `civil war of values' continues to rage.\" \n \n \"Focus on the Family will continue to fight for moral values. And we'll try to keep you informed of the threats coming against the institutions of marriage and parenthood. But we do need your financial support to get the job done.\" \n \n Here Dobson clearly admits to using his newsletters and broadcasts to ask us to do his bidding. And it is clearly just that -- his bidding. He often uses phrases like, \"I devoted\" and \"I have called\" and \"I discussed\" to point out his moral beliefs, but in his calls for action, he presents his causes as nothing short of God's own. \n In the March 1995 Focus on the Family Newsletter Dobson writes: \n \n \"Perhaps this explains the statement I made on the radio last month, which some of you questioned. Let me express it once more. I am committed never again to cast a vote for a politician who would kill one innocent baby. \" \n \"Never will I use my influence, however remotely, to support the shedding of their blood.\" \n \n \"These are challenging days, to be sure, and there are other issues I wish we had time to deal with.\" \n \n Here is admits he has an influence, and he admits he will use it support those things he believes and to condemn those things he condemns. And to those who questions him, he simply rolls over them to reiterate his personal beliefs. \n In the April 1995 Focus on the Family Newsletter Dobson writes: \n \n \"If you read my March letter, you know we have been very concerned about the Republican presidential hopefuls who, like the Democrats before them, are trying to tiptoe away from the pro-life position....I am determined that they will not do it in secret.\" \n In this letter Dobson proclaims himself as our presidential watch dog. He is \"determined\" to be the one who sets the moral standards for our political leaders. \n In the May 1995 Focus on the Family Newsletter Dobson writes: \n \n \"To help us prepare for the congressional battle, let me present various points of view and then propose what we at Focus on the Family think is best for or nation's children.\" \n \"Many people, myself included, believe that the deterioration of public education in recent years can be linked directly tour inability to reach values and show respect for God in the classroom.\" \n \n \"Speaking again for Focus on the Family, our vision is for a just and righteous society....\" \n \n http://elroy.net/ehr/dobson.html",

The judges do not heed to public interest or they they are not suppose to, they are suppose to interpret the law in light of the constitution. Public interest cannot role, If it did. we would still have slaves, because at that time the voters owned them, and it was in their public interest.\n \n Where is it written in the constitution that the courts consider public interest?\n\n \n \n Thanks for showing us how much you don't know.\n \n Citizen's Guide to the Courts - \n Part I: What The Courts Do\n \n . Constitutional Law:\n \n Constitutional law is found in the constitutions of the State of Maine and the United States. The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and its provisions must be followed at every level of government in America. The U.S. Constitution sets up the structure of the federal government and guarantees the citizens of each state a representative form of government. The Maine Constitution sets up the structure of our state government, with its bicameral (two-Chambered) legislature, its governor, and its judiciary. \n \n The federal and Maine constitutions are important sources of rights as well. They guarantee freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly. Each constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, involuntary self-incrimination, and cruel and unusual punishments.\n \n Each constitution guarantees due process of law, as well as equal protection of the laws. Daniel Webster described due process as the result of a judicial system that \"hears before it condemns, proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after a trial\". In modern times the rights to due process and equal protection have become extremely important. They protect citizens against the passage of laws that are arbitrary, unreasonable, unreasonably discriminatory, or beyond the reach of government. The due process clause also ensures that citizens receive timely notice when they are subject to most judicial proceedings and guarantees them a fair opportunity to be heard in cases that affect their personal or property interests.\n \n 2. Statutory Law:\n \n Statutory law is passed by a legislative body. Congress passes federal statutes; the Maine Legislature passes state statutes, which are published online and in bound form as the Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (M.R.S.A.). Statutory law covers many subjects. It must be consistent with the Constitution.\n \n 3. Common Law:\n \n Common law is developed by courts to cover situations where statutory law does not apply or exist. The common law, which also must be consistent with the Constitution, consists of principles and rules developed, sometimes over centuries, in prior court decisions called precedents. Courts generally follow the precedents established in earlier cases involving similar facts.\n \n http://www.courts.state.me.us/courtservices/citizen_guide/types_of_law.html\n \n The Ninth Circuit expressed understanding that courts must consider the public interest when exercising their discretion to enter an injunction. But it also recognized that mere recitation of the statutory purpose does not automatically settle the public interest inquiry.\n \n http://archive.aclu.org/court/oakland.html\n \n \n In 1993, a plurality of the Hawaii Supreme Court declared that the state's existing marriage statute was a form of \"sex discrimination\" that could be justified only by a \"compelling state interest.\"1 Three years later, a Hawaii trial court ruled that the state's marriage law violated the Hawaii constitution.2 In response, the people of Hawaii amended their state constitution to allow the legislature to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, and the legislature passed a Marriage Protection Act that defined marriage as the union between one man and one woman.\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/LegalIssues/bg1759.cfm",

   "You keep mixing up arguments. When you discuss issues you need to keep them relevant to the issue discussed. You responded to my argument that gender rights are different. Like women can only go to women bathrooms, men can only go to the men's bathrooms. We don't ahve the same right. \n\n \n Pointing out why your analogies are bad is by no means irrelevant. It's actually the very definition of relevant to the debate. For you to use analogy requires the analogy to be logically consistent, they are not. Try to answer the direct question about same-sex marriage as restriction of the rights of consenting adults, and try to stay away from the fallacy for bad analogy.\n Regarding locker rooms.\n There are a number of reasons such laws are OK, since you don't know them, I'll explain:\n \n #1 Right to privacy\n We all have right to privacy in certain areas. Women waive this right to privacy in the presence of other women (in some circumstances). They do not waive this right with respect to men. \n \n #2 Not two consenting adults - We are discussing restricted rights of two consenting adults. Your analogy refers to a human, and a physical location for changing clothes. We have already pointed out that men still have locker rooms, just not co-existent with women's locker rooms. Thus, humans are still allowed in locker rooms. If locker rooms are given to women and not to men in a public space, there are legal grounds to contest it.\n \n #3 What rights of yours are violated? Trespassing. You can't go where you please if it violates someone elses rights (#1 privacy), or #2 (location..i.e. trespassing). You can go to a locker room, your locker room, not someone else's locker room.\n \n #4 Where is the mass movement of men who are saying their right to enter women's locker rooms is being violated? Looks like it's just you. I wonder if that's because you know you don't have a point, or if you honestly just don't understand the issue.\n \n \n \nSo like men can only marry women, so women can only marry men. Rights are individual according to the constitution. You can't base you rights on preferences. You have the same right as me. Tell me one right (not preference) that we don't share.\n\n \n (the names are used in a thought experiment only, no persons were harmed in this experiment!)\n \n You can legally marry a woman you don't love.\n Ladywolf legally cannot marry a woman she loves.\n \n Ladywolf can legally marry a man she doesn't love.\n Joebrummer legally cannot marry a man he loves.\n \n That's two!\n Do I win a prize?

How is the behavior of marrying a human [male], different in terms of violating everyone's rights, form marrying a human [female]?\n \n \n Can you compare and contrast for us?\n \n Consenting adults, couples, that are of the same sex, want equal treatment under the law with regards to being able to legalize their union, so that they can enjoy the same rights benefited to hetero couples.\n \n You want to restrict their right to be married to one another because:\n 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n \n \n 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n ^^^ your justification for wanting to restrict their rights goes here.\n \n \nIf you believe there is no such thing as \"right\" and 'wrong' then yes I'm lotivated by my values and standards that I learned thorugh religion. However every organization has a social agenda, they just don't say god supports them. That is the only difference.\n\n \n Please understand. The U.S. has a secular government.\n The agenda for the government and it's citizens is to support the constitution. If your religious agenda is contradictory to that, you're in the wrong, as it's legally relevant.\n \n If your reason for wanting to make it illegal to marry is based on religious grounds you lose:\n \n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\n \n That's why you, and others like you, dance around the justification part, isn't it? You try to make up other reasons, but they all fall short of divine guidance don't they? And that's unconstitutional isn't it? Aren't you really being anti-american? Are you a freedom-hater? would some other country where you could restrict freedom on religous grounds not be better suited to your desires?\n \n -Mach",

   "Pointing out why your analogies are bad is by no means irrelevant. It's actually the very definition of relevant to the debate. For you to use analogy requires the analogy to be logically consistent, they are not. Try to answer the direct question about same-sex marriage as restriction of the rights of consenting adults, and try to stay away from the fallacy for bad analogy.\n\n You're funny. You use immutable difference when we speak about behavior and then say I make bad analogies\n \n \n \n \nRegarding locker rooms.\n There are a number of reasons such laws are OK, since you don't know them, I'll explain:\n \n #1 Right to privacy\n We all have right to privacy in certain areas. Women waive this right to privacy in the presence of other women (in some circumstances). They do not waive this right with respect to men. \n \n CAn you define right to privacy or are oyu jsut guessing?\n \n Distinct from the right of publicity protected by state common or statutory law, a broader right of privacy has been inferred in the Constitution. Although not explicity stated in the text of the Constitution, in 1890 then to be Justice Louis Brandeis extolled 'a right to be left alone.' This right has developed into a liberty of personal autonomy protected by the 14th amendment. The 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments also provide some protection of privacy, although in all cases the right is narrowly defined. The Constitutional right of privacy has developed alongside a statutory right of privacy which limits access to personal information. The Federal Trade Commission overwhelmingly enforces this statutory right of privacy, and the rise of privacy policies and privacy statements are evidence of its work. In all of its forms, however, the right of privacy must be balanced against the state's compelling interests. Such compelling interests include the promotion of public morality, protection of the individual's psychological health, and improving the quality of life. These distinct rights of privacy are examined separately on the following pages:\n \n http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/privacy.html\n \n Teh issue is how can men violate women's privacy but women can't? If we both don't violate the privacy laws tehn isn't that discrimination?\n \n \n \n \n#2 Not two consenting adults - We are discussing restricted rights of two consenting adults. Your analogy refers to a human, and a physical location for changing clothes. We have already pointed out that men still have locker rooms, just not co-existent with women's locker rooms. Thus, humans are still allowed in locker rooms. If locker rooms are given to women and not to men in a public space, there are legal grounds to contest it.\n\n TWo consenting adults? Like prostiution, drug sales, lewdness, scalping tickets, manipulating stocks, adutlery, and polygamy (there are two consenting adults but others are invovled as well) So if two people consent to anyting it should be legal?\n \n \n \n#3 What rights of yours are violated? Trespassing. You can't go where you please if it violates someone elses rights (#1 privacy), or #2 (location..i.e. trespassing). You can go to a locker room, your locker room, not someone else's locker room.\n\n How can a man violate a women's right to privacy and a woman doesn't? Does that men there is gender discrimination?\n \n \n#4 Where is the mass movement of men who are saying their right to enter women's locker rooms is being violated? Looks like it's just you. I wonder if that's because you know you don't have a point, or if you honestly just don't understand the issue.\n\n Hmmm, well change locker rooms to marraige and what do we have?\n How is it gender discrimination for marriage and not lockerrooms?\n \n \n \n (the names are used in a thought experiment only, no persons were harmed in this experiment!)\n \n \nYou can legally marry a woman you don't love.\n Ladywolf legally cannot marry a woman she loves.\n\n Really. I can marry kather Zeta Jones, who I don't love that is married? I can marry my sister, wel actually I do love her\n \n \n\n Ladywolf can legally marry a man she doesn't love.\n Joebrummer legally cannot marry a man he loves.\n\n But they can't go into the same locker room.\n Can I marry my dad? I love him. He's married and my dad so I'm allowed right? \n \n \nThat's two!\n Do I win a prize?

   "If you're a woman you can only marry a man, not a woman. Why can't you marry a woman? Because you are a woman. Sex discrimination. Please justify this particular discrimination, without any extended analogy fallacies, or other fallacies which don't address the specific topic of same-sex marriage.\n\n Gender enjoys a lower level of review than the other immutable differences.\n \n I'm going to help you understand\n The Supreme Court has formally adopted three standards of review in equal protection cases: Strict Scrutiny (suspect classification or fundamental rights), Intermediate Scrutiny (gender and illegitimacy), and Rational Basis. At the high end of scrutiny are laws based on a suspect classification (race, national origin, religion, alienage (in some cases)). The Court will subject such laws to Strict Scrutiny and will strike them down unless they serve a compelling state interest and are necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve that state interest.\n \n Justices Marshall, Stevens and Rehnquist have suggested that there are not three, but really only one standard of review. Under this standard, (termed \"Marshall's Sliding Scale\"), the degree of judicial scrutiny should vary with the nature of the discrimination and the significance of the burden of fundamental interests. See Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 591-92 (1970) (Marshall, J. dissenting).\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n All persons burdened equally:\n The Equal Protection Clause guarantees that similar individuals will receive similar government treatment. This does not mean that the government may not discriminate. If the government's \"classification\" (aka discrimination) relates to a proper governmental purpose, then the classification will be upheld. Equal protection acts as a safeguard that this classification, or line drawing, is properly and fairly done. \n \n Awareness of disparate impact on class:\n Disparate \"impact\" but a nondiscriminatory \"purpose\":\n The Court examined a District of Columbia qualifying test (verbal and reading skills) for police officers that was passed by many more whites than blacks. The Court held that because the test was \"reasonably related to the requirements of the police recruit training program\" and was not designed or operated \"to discriminate against otherwise qualified blacks,\" the department could constitutionally continue to use it. Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976). \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Suspect class of fundamental right:\n Suspect classes: Race, National Origin, Religion, and Alienage (in some cases) Fundamental Rights: Includes those rights that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or deeply rooted in our nation's history (e.g. Rights to: travel, privacy, vote). See the Fundamental Rights Jurisprudence flow chart. \n \n http://faculty.lls.edu/~manheimk/cl2/straudrx.htm\n \n So the basis of the court is that we need to keep things relevant to recognize teh inheret differences between men and women. If you truly want no gender discrimination then there cannot be classifications of men, women. No men's room, no men's clothing, no women's sports, no women's prisons, etc\n \n \n \n \n \nAlso courts may interpret Constitutions as protecting gay equality, along with other forms of equality. \n \n Agisn if gays are discriminated tehn so am I. last time I check all gay males and all straight males had the same right. If we don't please identify it by law. Not this we can't marry who we love. Actual law that denies you a right that you would otherwise be entitled to if you were straight.\n \n \n \nIt's not based on behaviour. You mentioned that a gay man and a lesbian could marry...\n\n it's discriminatory towards behavior\n \n \n \n \nWouldn't that be because one's a man and the other is a woman? Their behaviour then, isn't relevent.\n\n Exactly so the law applies equally to both gays and stright",

   "Goodridge vs. Department of Public Health, Mass. Supreme Judicial Court, 2003\n \n Page 16:\n \n \"The marriage ban works a deep and scarring hardship on a very real segment of the community for no rational reason. The absence of any reasonable relationship between, on the one hand, an absolute disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to enter into a civil marriage and, on the other, protection for public health, safety, or general welfare, suggestes that the marriage restriction is rooted in persistent prejudices against persons who are(or who are believed to be) homosexual.[FN33] \"The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\" Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984) (construing Fourteenth Amenedment). Limiting the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the basic premises of individual liberty and equality under law protected by the Massachusettes Constitution.\"\n \n Page 18-19:\n \n \"All people are born free and equal and have certain natural, essential and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lieves and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness. Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color creed or national origin.\"\n \n This provision, even prior to the amendment, guaranteed to all people in the Commonwealth--equally--the enjoyment of rights that are deemed important or fundamental. The withholding of relief from the plaintiffs, who wish to marry, and are otherwise eligible to marry, on the ground that the couples are of the same gender, constitutes a categorical restriction of a fundamental right. The restriction creates a straightforward case of discrimination that disqualifies an entire group of our citizens and their families from participation in an institution of paramount legal and social importance. This is impermisible under art. 1\n \n Analysis begins with the indisputable premise that the deprivation suffered by the plaintiffs is no mere legal inconvenience. The right to marry is not a privilege conferred by the State, but a fundamental right that is protected against unwarranted State interference. See Zablocki v. Redhai, 434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978) (\"the right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individuals\"), Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (freedom to marry is \"one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness of free men\" under due process clause of Fourteenth Amendment); Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (marriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man\"). See also Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95-96 (1987) (prisoners' right to marry is constitutionally protected). This right is essentially vitiated if one is denied the right to marry a person of one's choice. See Zablocki v. Redhail, supra at 384 (all recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court place \"the decision to marry as among the personal decisions protected by the right to privacy\") [FN1]\n \n \"A classification may be gender based whether or not the challenged government action apportions benefits or burdens uniformly along gender lines. This is so because constitutional protections extend to individuals and not to categories of people. Thus, when an individual desires to marry, but cannot marry his or her chosen partner because of the traditional opposite-sex restriction, a violation of art. 1 has occurred. See Commonwealth v. Chou, 433 Mass. 229, 237-238 (2001) (assuming statute enforceable only accross gender lines may offend Massachusetts equal rights amendment). I find it disingenuous, at best, to suggest that such an individual's right to marry has not been burdened at all, because he or she remains free to choose another partner, who is of the opposite sex.\n \n The equal protection infirmity here is strikingly similar to (although perahps more subtle than), the invidious discrimination perpetuated by Virgina's antimiscegenation laws and unveiled in the decision of Loving v. Virginia, supra. In its landmark decision striking down Virginia's ban on marriages between Caucasians and members of any other race on both equal protection and substantive due process grounds, the United States Supreme Court soundly rejected the proposition that the equal application of the ban (ie., that it applied equally to whites and blacks) made unnecessary the strict scrutiny analysis traditionally required of statutes drawing classifications according to race, see id. at 8-9, and concluded that \"restricting the freedom to marry soley because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\" Id. at 12. That our marriage laws, unlike antimiscegenation laws, were not enacted purposely to discriminate, in no way neutralizes their present discriminatory character.\n \n With these two propositions established (the infringement of a fundamental right and a sex-based classification), the enforcement of the marriage statutes as they are currently understood is forbidden by our Constitution unless the State can present a compelling purpose further by the statutes that can be accomplished in no other reasonable manner.[FN3] See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 655-656 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189(2003); Lowell v. Kowalski, 380 Mass. 663, 667-669(1980). This the State has not done. \n \n Page 20:\n \n \"But, as a matter of constitutional law, neither the mantra of tradition, nor individual conviction, can justify the perpetuation of a hierarchy in which couples of the same sex and their families are deemed less worthy of social and legal recognition than couples of the opposite sex and their families. See Lawrence v. Texas, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 2486(2003) (O'Connor J., concurring) (moral disapproval, with no other valid State interest, cannot justify law that discriminates against groups of persons); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa., v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 850 (1992) (\"Our obligation is to define the liberty for all, not to mandate our own moral code\").\n \n Page 51:\n \n \"Because marriage is, by all accounts, the cornerstone of our social structure, as well as the defining relationship in our personal lives, confining eligibility in the institution, and all of its accompanying benefits and responsibilities to opposite couples is basely unfair. To justify the restriction in our marriage laws by accusing the plaintiffs of attempting to change the institution of marriage itself, terminates the debate at the outset without any accompanying reasoned analysis.\"",

   "Goodridge vs. Department of Public Health, Mass. Supreme Judicial Court, 2003\n \n \n CORDY, J. (dissenting, with whom Spina and Sosman, JJ., join).\n \n The court's opinion concludes that the Department of Public Health has failed to identify any \"constitutionally adequate reason\" for limiting civil marriage to opposite-sex unions, and that there is no \"reasonable relationship\" between a disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to enter into a civil marriage and the protection of public health, safety, or general welfare. Consequently, it holds that the marriage statute cannot withstand scrutiny under the Massachusetts Constitution. Because I find these conclusions to be unsupportable in light of the nature of the rights and regulations at issue, the presumption of constitutional validity and significant deference afforded to legislative enactments, and the \"undesirability of the judiciary substituting its notions of correct policy for that of a popularly elected Legislature\" responsible for making such policy, Zayre Corp. v. Attorney Gen., 372 Mass. 423, 433 (1977), I respectfully dissent. Although it may be desirable for many reasons to extend to same-sex couples the benefits and burdens of civil marriage (and the plaintiffs have made a powerfully reasoned case for that extension), that decision must be made by the Legislature, not the court.\n \n If a statute either impairs the exercise of a fundamental right protected by the due process or liberty provisions of our State Constitution, or discriminates based on a constitutionally suspect classification such as sex, it will be subject to strict scrutiny when its validity is challenged. See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 655-656, 660-661 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (fundamental right); Lowell v. Kowalski, 380 Mass. 663, 666 (1980) (sex-based classification). If it does neither, a statute \"will be upheld if it is 'rationally related to a legitimate State purpose.' \" Hallett v. Wrentham, 398 Mass. 550, 557 (1986), quoting Paro v. Longwood Hosp., 373 Mass. 645, 649 (1977). This test, referred to in State and Federal constitutional jurisprudence as the \"rational basis test,\" [FN1] is virtually identical in substance and effect to the test applied to a law promulgated under the State's broad police powers (pursuant to which the marriage statutes and most other licensing and regulatory laws are enacted): that is, the law is valid if it is reasonably related to the protection of public health, safety, or general welfare. See, e.g., Leigh v. Board of Registration in Nursing, 395 Mass. 670, 682-683 (1985) (applying rational basis review to question of State exercise of police power).\n \n The Massachusetts marriage statute does not impair the exercise of a recognized fundamental right, or discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of the equal rights amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution. Consequently, it is subject to review only to determine whether it satisfies the rational basis test. Because a conceivable rational basis exists upon which the Legislature could conclude that the marriage statute furthers the legitimate State purpose of ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure for the bearing and raising of children, it is a valid exercise of the State's police power.\n \n A. Limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman does not impair the exercise of a fundamental right. Civil marriage is an institution created by the State. In Massachusetts, the marriage statutes are derived from English common law, see Commonwealth v. Knowlton, 2 Mass. 530, 534 (1807), and were first enacted in colonial times. Commonwealth v. Munson, 127 Mass. 459, 460 (1879). They were enacted to secure public interests and not for religious purposes or to promote personal interests or aspirations. \n \n The plaintiffs contend that because the right to choose to marry is a \"fundamental\" right, the right to marry the person of one's choice, including a member of the same sex, must also be a \"fundamental\" right. While the court stops short of deciding that the right to marry someone of the same sex is \"fundamental\" such that strict scrutiny must be applied to any statute that impairs it, it nevertheless agrees with the plaintiffs that the right to choose to marry is of fundamental importance (\"among the most basic\" of every person's \"liberty and due process rights\") and would be \"hollow\" if an individual was foreclosed from \"freely choosing the person with whom to share ... the ... institution of civil marriage.\" Ante at. Hence, it concludes that a marriage license cannot be denied to an individual who wishes to marry someone of the same sex. In reaching this result the court has transmuted the \"right\" to marry into a right to change the institution of marriage itself. This feat of reasoning succeeds only if one accepts the proposition that the definition of the institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is merely \"conclusory\" (as suggested, ante at [Greaney, J., concurring] ), rather than the basis on which the \"right\" to partake in it has been deemed to be of fundamental importance. In other words, only by assuming that \"marriage\" includes the union of two persons of the same sex does the court conclude that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples infringes on the \"right\" of same-sex couples of \"marry.\" [FN2]\n \n \n \n Supreme Court cases that have described marriage or the right to marry as \"fundamental\" have focused primarily on the underlying interest of every individual in procreation, which, historically, could only legally occur within the construct of marriage because sexual intercourse outside of marriage was a criminal act. [FN4] In Skinner v. Oklahoma, supra, the first case to characterize marriage as a \"fundamental\" right, the Supreme Court stated, as its rationale for striking down a sterilization statute, that \"[m]arriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence of the race.\" Id. at 541. In concluding that a sterilized individual \"is forever deprived of a basic liberty,\" id., the Court was obviously referring to procreation rather than marriage, as this court recognized in Matter of Moe, 385 Mass. 555, 560 (1982). Similarly, in Loving v. Virginia, supra, in which the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia's antimiscegenation statute, the Court implicitly linked marriage with procreation in describing marriage as \"fundamental to our very existence.\" Id. at 12. In Zablocki v. Redhail, supra, the Court expressly linked the right to marry with the right to procreate, concluding that \"if [the plaintiff's] right to procreate means anything at all, it must imply some right to enter the only relationship in which the State ... allows sexual relations legally to take place.\" Id. at 386. Once again, in Turner v. Safley, supra, striking a State regulation that curtailed the right of an inmate to marry, the Court included among the important attributes of such marriages the \"expectation that [the marriage] ultimately will be fully consummated.\" Id. at 96. See Milford v. Worcester, 7 Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (purpose of marriage is \"to regulate, chasten, and refine, the intercourse between the sexes; and to multiply [and] preserve ... the species\"). Because same-sex couples are unable to procreate on their own, any right to marriage they may possess cannot be based on their interest in procreation, which has been essential to the Supreme Court's denomination of the right to marry as fundamental.\n \n What the Griswold Court found \"repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship\" was the prospect of \"allow[ing] the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives.\" Griswold v. Connecticut, supra at 485-486. See Moe v. Secretary of Admin. & Fin., 382 Mass. 629, 658 (1981), quoting L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 924 (1978) (finding it \"difficult to imagine a clearer case of bodily intrusion\" than being forced to bear a child). When Justice Goldberg spoke of \"marital relations\" in the context of finding it \"difficult to imagine what is more private or more intimate than a husband and wife's marital relations[hip],\" Griswold v. Connecticut, supra at 495 (Goldberg, J., concurring), he was obviously referring to sexual relations. [FN5] Similarly, in Lawrence v. Texas, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (2003), it was the criminalization of private sexual behavior that the Court found violative of the petitioners' liberty interest.\n \n \nIt does not intrude on any right that the plaintiffs have to privacy in their choices regarding procreation, an intimate partner or sexual relations. [FN6] The plaintiffs' right to privacy in such matters does not require that the State officially endorse their choices in order for the right to be constitutionally vindicated\n.\n \n Although some of the privacy cases also speak in terms of personal autonomy, no court has ever recognized such an open-ended right. \"That many of the rights and liberties protected by the Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy does not warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important, intimate, and personal decisions are so protected....\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 727 (1997). Such decisions are protected not because they are important, intimate, and personal, but because the right or liberty at stake is \"so deeply rooted in our history and traditions, or so fundamental to our concept of constitutionally ordered liberty\" that it is protected by due process. Id. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has concluded that while the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment is fundamental, Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990), because it is deeply rooted in our nation's history and tradition, the equally personal and profound decision to commit suicide is not because of the absence of such roots. Washington v. Glucksberg, supra.\n \n While the institution of marriage is deeply rooted in the history and traditions of our country and our State, the right to marry someone of the same sex is not. No matter how personal or intimate a decision to marry someone of the same sex might be, the right to make it is not guaranteed by the right of personal autonomy.\n \n The protected right to freedom of association, in the sense of freedom of choice \"to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships,\" Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617 (1984) (as an element of liberty or due process rather than free speech), is similarly limited and unimpaired by the marriage statute. As recognized by the Supreme Court, that right affords protection only to \"certain kinds of highly personal relationships,\" id. at 618, such as those between husband and wife, parent and child, and among close relatives, id. at 619, that \"have played a critical role in the culture and traditions of the Nation,\" id. at 618-619, and are \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 498-499, 503 (1977) (distinguishing on this basis between family and nonfamily relationships). Unlike opposite-sex marriages, which have deep historic roots, or the parent-child relationship, which reflects a \"strong tradition\" founded on \"the history and culture of Western civilization\" and \"is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition,\" Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972); or extended family relationships, which have been \"honored throughout our history,\" Moore v. East Cleveland, supra at 505, same-sex relationships, although becoming more accepted, are certainly not so \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" as to warrant such enhanced constitutional protection.\n \n \n \n Finally, the constitutionally protected interest in child rearing, recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535 (1925); and Care & Protection of Robert, supra at 58, 60, is not implicated or infringed by the marriage statute here. The fact that the plaintiffs cannot marry has no bearing on their independently protected constitutional rights as parents which, as with opposite-sex parents, are limited only by their continued fitness and the best interests of their children. Bezio v. Patenaude, 381 Mass. 563, 579 (1980) (courts may not use parent's sexual orientation as reason to deny child custody).\n \n Because the rights and interests discussed above do not afford the plaintiffs any fundamental right that would be impaired by a statute limiting marriage to members of the opposite sex, they have no fundamental right to be declared \"married\" by the State.\n \n Insofar as the right to marry someone of the same sex is neither found in the unique historical context of our Constitution [FN7] nor compelled by the meaning ascribed by this court to the liberty and due process protections contained within it, should the court nevertheless recognize it as a fundamental right? The consequences of deeming a right to be \"fundamental\" are profound, and this court, as well as the Supreme Court, has been very cautious in recognizing them. [FN8] Such caution is required by separation of powers principles. If a right is found to be \"fundamental,\" it is, to a great extent, removed from \"the arena of public debate and legislative action\"; utmost care must be taken when breaking new ground in this field \"lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of [judges].\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997).\n \n \n \n Applying this limiting principle, the Supreme Court, as noted above, declined to recognize a fundamental right to physician-assisted suicide, which would have required \"revers[ing] centuries of legal doctrine and practice, and strik [ing] down the considered policy choice of almost every State.\" Washington v. Glucksberg, supra at 723. While recognizing that public attitudes toward assisted suicide are currently the subject of \"earnest and profound debate,\" the Court nevertheless left the continuation and resolution of that debate to the political arena, \"as it should be in a democratic society.\" Id. at 719, 735.\n \n Similarly, Massachusetts courts have declined to recognize rights that are not so deeply rooted. [FN10] As this court noted in considering whether to recognize a right of terminally ill patients to refuse life-prolonging treatment, \"the law always lags behind the most advanced thinking in every area,\" and must await \"some common ground, some consensus.\" Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 737 (1977), quoting Burger, The Law and Medical Advances, 67 Annals Internal Med. Supp. 7, 15, 17 (1967). See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 662-663 n. 22 (2002) (\"social consensus about family relationships is relevant to the constitutional limits on State intervention\").\n \n This is not to say that a statute that has no rational basis must nevertheless be upheld as long as it is of ancient origin. However, \"[t]he long history of a certain practice ... and its acceptance as an uncontroversial part of our national and State tradition do suggest that [the court] should reflect carefully before striking it down.\" Colo v. Treasurer & Receiver Gen., 378 Mass. 550, 557 (1979). As this court has recognized, the \"fact that a challenged practice 'is followed by a large number of states ... is plainly worth considering in determining whether the practice \"offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\" ' \" Commonwealth v. Kostka, 370 Mass. 516, 533 (1976), quoting Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 798 (1952).\n \n Although public attitudes toward marriage in general and same-sex marriage in particular have changed and are still evolving, \"the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal interests for which [plaintiffs] contend\" are \"manifestly [less] deeply founded\" than the \"historic institution\" of marriage. Matter of the Estate of Cooper, 187 A.D.2d 128, 133-134 (N.Y.1993). Indeed, it is not readily apparent to what extent contemporary values have embraced the concept of same-sex marriage. Perhaps the \"clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures,\" Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 312 (2002), quoting Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 331 (1989). No State Legislature has enacted laws permitting same-sex marriages; and a large majority of States, as well as the United States Congress, have affirmatively prohibited the recognition of such marriages for any purpose. See P. Greenberg, State Laws Affecting Lesbians and Gays, National Conference of State Legislatures Legisbriefs at 1 (April/May 2001) (reporting that, as of May, 2001, thirty-six States had enacted \"defense of marriage\" statutes); 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738C (2000) (Federal Defense of Marriage Act).\n \n Given this history and the current state of public opinion, as reflected in the actions of the people's elected representatives, it cannot be said that \"a right to same-sex marriage is so rooted in the traditions and collective conscience of our people that failure to recognize it would violate the fundamental principles of liberty and justice that lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions. Neither ... [is] a right to same-sex marriage ... implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if it were sacrificed.\" Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 556-557 (1993). \n \n The one exception was the Alaska Superior Court, which relied on that State's Constitution's express and broadly construed right to privacy. Brause, 1998 WL 88743 at *3-*4. [FN12] In such circumstances, the law with respect to same- sex marriages must be left to develop through legislative processes, subject to the constraints of rationality, lest the court be viewed as using the liberty and due process clauses as vehicles merely to enforce its own views regarding better social policies, a role that the strongly worded separation of powers principles in art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights of our Constitution forbids, and for which the court is particularly ill suited.\n \n B. The marriage statute, in limiting marriage to heterosexual couples, does not constitute discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution. In his concurrence, Justice Greaney contends that the marriage statute constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). [FN13] Such a conclusion is analytically unsound and inconsistent with the legislative history of the ERA.\n \n \nThe central purpose of the ERA was to eradicate discrimination against women and in favor of men or vice versa.\n See Attorney Gen. v. Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic XXX'n, 378 Mass. 342, 357 (1979). Consistent with this purpose, we have construed the ERA to prohibit laws that advantage one sex at the expense of the other, but not laws that treat men and women equally, id. at 346-349 (assuming that \"separate but equal\" treatment of males and females would be constitutionally permissible). The Massachusetts marriage statute does not subject men to different treatment from women; each is equally prohibited from precisely the same conduct. See Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 215 n. 13 (1999) (\"there is no discrete class subject to differential treatment solely on the basis of sex\"). Compare Commonwealth v. King, 374 Mass. 5, 16 (1977) (law prohibiting prostitution applied to both male and female prostitutes and therefore did not discriminate), and Personnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274-275 (1979) (declining to characterize veterans' preference as sex discrimination because it applied to both male and female veterans), with Attorney Gen. v. Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic XXX'n, supra, and Lowell v. Kowalski, 380 Mass. 663 (1980) (where statutes and rules at issue advantaged one sex over another).\n \n Of course, a statute that on its face treats protected groups equally may still harm, stigmatize, or advantage one over the other. Such was the circumstance in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), where the Supreme Court struck down a State statute that made interracial marriage a crime, as constituting invidious discrimination on the basis of race. While the statute purported to apply equally to whites and nonwhites, the Court found that it was intended and structured to favor one race (white) and disfavor all others (nonwhites). The statute's legislative history demonstrated that its purpose was not merely to punish interracial marriage, but to do so for the sole benefit of the white race. As the Supreme Court readily concluded, the Virginia law was \"designed to maintain White Supremacy.\" Id. at 11. Consequently, there was a fit between the class that the law was intended to discriminate against (nonwhite races) and the classification enjoying heightened protection (race).\n \n By contrast, here there is no evidence that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples was motivated by sexism in general or a desire to disadvantage men or women in particular. Moreover, no one has identified any harm, burden, disadvantage, or advantage accruing to either gender as a consequence of the Massachusetts marriage statute. In the absence of such effect, the statute limiting marriage to couples of the opposite sex does not violate the ERA's prohibition of sex discrimination. [FN14]\n \n \n \n \n On October 19, 1976, just before the general election at which the amendment was to be considered, the commission filed its Interim Report, which focused on the effect of the Massachusetts ERA on the laws of the Commonwealth. 1976 Senate Doc. No. 1689. A section of the report, entitled \"Areas Unaffected by the Equal Rights Amendment,\" addressed some of the legal regimes that would not be affected by the adoption of the ERA. One such area was \"Homosexual Marriage,\" about which the commission stated: \n \n \"An equal rights amendment will have no effect upon the allowance or denial of homosexual marriages. The equal rights amendment is not concerned with the relationship of two persons of the same sex; it only addresses those laws or public-related actions which treat persons of opposite sexes differently. The Washington Court of Appeals has already stated that the equal rights amendment to its state constitution did not afford a basis for validating homosexual marriages. In Colorado, the attorney general has likewise issued an opinion that the state equal rights amendment did not validate homosexual marriage. There are no cases which have used a state equal rights amendment to either validate or require the allowance of homosexual marriages.\" (Footnotes omitted.) Id. at 21-22. [FN16]\n \n The views of the commission were reflected in the public debate surrounding the passage of the ERA that focused on gender equality. See, e.g., Referenda reviewed, Boston Globe, Nov. 1, 1976, at 26; Voters' guide on nine state referendum measures, Boston Herald American, Nov. 1, 1976, at 17. Claims that the ERA might be the basis for validating marriages between same-sex couples were labelled as \"exaggerated\" and \"unfounded.\" For example, before the vote, the Boston Globe published an editorial discussing and urging favorable action on the ERA. In making its case, it noted that \"[t]hose urging a no vote ... argue that the amendment would ... legitimize marriage between people of the same sex [and other changes]. In reality, the proposed amendment would require none of these things. Mass. ballot issues ... 1 Equal Rights Amendment. Boston Globe, Nov. 1, 1976, at 29. And in the aftermath of the vote, the Boston Globe heralded the electorate's acceptance of \"the arguments of proponents that the proposal would not result in many far-reaching or threatening changes.\" Referendums fared poorly, Boston Globe, Nov. 4, 1976, at 29.\n \n \n \n C. The marriage statute satisfies the rational basis standard. The burden of demonstrating that a statute does not satisfy the rational basis standard rests on the plaintiffs. It is a weighty one. \"[A] reviewing court will presume a statute's validity, and make all rational inferences in favor of it.... The Legislature is not required to justify its classifications, nor provide a record or finding in support of them.\" (Citation omitted.) Paro v. Longwood Hosp., 373 Mass. 645, 650 (1977). The statute \"only need[s to] be supported by a conceivable rational basis.\" Fine v. Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 401 Mass. 639, 641 (1988). See Massachusetts Fed'n of Teachers v. Board of Educ., 436 Mass. 763, 771-772 (2002). As this court stated in Shell Oil Co. v. Revere, 383 Mass. 682, 687-688 (1981): \n \n \n \n In analyzing whether a statute satisfies the rational basis standard, we look to the nature of the classification embodied in the enactment, then to whether the statute serves a legitimate State purpose, and finally to whether the classification is reasonably related to the furtherance of that purpose. With this framework, we turn to the challenged statute, G.L. c. 207, which authorizes local town officials to issue licenses to couples of the opposite sex authorizing them to enter the institution of civil marriage.\n \n \n1. Classification. The nature of the classification at issue is readily apparent. Opposite-sex couples can obtain a license and same-sex couples cannot. The granting of this license, and the completion of the required solemnization of the marriage, opens the door to many statutory benefits and imposes numerous responsibilities. The fact that the statute does not permit such licenses to be issued to couples of the same sex thus bars them from civil marriage. The classification is not drawn between men and women or between heterosexuals and homosexuals, any of whom can obtain a license to marry a member of the opposite sex; rather, it is drawn between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples.\n\n \n 2. State purpose. The court's opinion concedes that the civil marriage statute serves legitimate State purposes, but further investigation and elaboration of those purposes is both helpful and necessary.\n \n Civil marriage is the institutional mechanism by which societies have sanctioned and recognized particular family structures, and the institution of marriage has existed as one of the fundamental organizing principles of human society. See C.N. Degler, The Emergence of the Modern American Family, in The American Family in Social-Historical Perspective 61 (3d ed.1983); A.J. Hawkins, Introduction, in Revitalizing the Institution of Marriage for the Twenty-First Century: An Agenda for Strengthening Marriage xiv (2002); C. Lasch, Social Pathologists and the Socialization of Reproduction, in The American Family in Social-Historical Perspective, supra at 80; W.J. O'Donnell & D.A. Jones, Marriage and Marital Alternatives 1 (1982); L. Saxton, The Individual, Marriage, and the Family 229-230, 260 (1968); M.A. Schwartz & B.M.

Marriage has not been merely a contractual arrangement for legally defining the private relationship between two individuals (although that is certainly part of any marriage). Rather, on an institutional level, marriage is the \"very basis of the whole fabric of civilized society,\" J.P. Bishop, Commentaries on the Law of Marriage and Divorce, and Evidence in Matrimonial Suits \u00a7 32 (1852), and it serves many important political, economic, social, educational, procreational, and personal functions.\n \n Paramount among its many important functions, the institution of marriage has systematically provided for the regulation of heterosexual behavior, brought order to the resulting procreation, and ensured a stable family structure in which children will be reared, educated, and socialized. See Milford v. Worcester, 7 Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (civil marriage \"intended to regulate, chasten, and refine, the intercourse between the sexes; and to multiply, preserve, and improve the species\"). See also P. Blumstein & P. Schwartz, American Couples: Money, Work, Sex 29 (1983); C.N. Degler, supra at 61; G. Douglas, Marriage, Cohabitation, and Parenthood--From Contract to Status?, in Cross Currents: Family Law and Policy in the United States and England 223 (2000); S.L. Nock, The Social Costs of De-Institutionalizing Marriage, in Revitalizing the Institution of Marriage for the Twenty-First Century: An Agenda for Strengthening Marriage, supra at 7; L. Saxton, supra at 239- 240, 242; M.A. Schwartz & B.M. Scott, supra at 4-6; Wardle, supra at 781-796; J.Q. Wilson, supra at 23-32. Admittedly, heterosexual intercourse, procreation, and child care are not necessarily conjoined (particularly in the modern age of widespread effective contraception and supportive social welfare programs), but an orderly society requires some mechanism for coping with the fact that sexual intercourse commonly results in pregnancy and childbirth. The institution of marriage is that mechanism.\n \n The institution of marriage provides the important legal and normative link between heterosexual intercourse and procreation on the one hand and family responsibilities on the other. The partners in a marriage are expected to engage in exclusive sexual relations, with children the probable result and paternity presumed. See G.L. c. 209C, \u00a7 6 (\"a man is presumed to be the father of a child ... if he is or has been married to the mother and the child was born during the marriage, or within three hundred days after the marriage was terminated by death, annulment or divorce\"). Whereas the relationship between mother and child is demonstratively and predictably created and recognizable through the biological process of pregnancy and childbirth, there is no corresponding process for creating a relationship between father and child. [FN17] Similarly, aside from an act of heterosexual intercourse nine months prior to childbirth, there is no process for creating a relationship between a man and a woman as the parents of a particular child. The institution of marriage fills this void by formally binding the husband-father to his wife and child, and imposing on him the responsibilities of fatherhood. See J.Q. Wilson, supra at 23-32. See also P. Blumstein & P. Schwartz, supra at 29; C.N. Degler, supra at 61; G. Douglas, supra at 223; S.L. Nock, supra at 7; L. Saxton, supra at 239-240, 242; M.A. Schwartz & B.M. Scott, supra at 4-6; Wardle, supra at 781-796. The alternative, a society without the institution of marriage, in which heterosexual intercourse, procreation, and child care are largely disconnected processes, would be chaotic.\n \n The marital family is also the foremost setting for the education and socialization of children. Children learn about the world and their place in it primarily from those who raise them, and those children eventually grow up to exert some influence, great or small, positive or negative, on society. The institution of marriage encourages parents to remain committed to each other and to their children as they grow, thereby encouraging a stable venue for the education and socialization of children. See P. Blumstein & P. Schwartz, supra at 26; C.N. Degler, supra at 61; S.L. Nock, supra at 2-3; C. Lasch, supra at 81; M.A. Schwartz & B.M. Scott, supra at 6-7. More macroscopically, construction of a family through marriage also formalizes the bonds between people in an ordered and institutional manner, thereby facilitating a foundation of interconnectedness and interdependency on which more intricate stabilizing social structures might be built. See M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth: Law and Family in Nineteenth-Century America 10 (1985); C. Lasch, supra; L. Saxton, supra at 260; J.Q. Wilson, supra at 221.\n \n This court, among others, has consistently acknowledged both the institutional importance of marriage as an organizing principle of society, and the State's interest in regulating it. See French v. McAnarney, 290 Mass. 544, 546 (1935) (\"Marriage is not merely a contract between the parties. It is the foundation of the family. It is a social institution of the highest importance. The Commonwealth has a deep interest that its integrity is not jeopardized\"); Milford v. Worcester, 7 Mass. 48, 52 (1810) (\"Marriage, being essential to the peace and harmony, and to the virtues and improvements of civil society, it has been, in all well-regulated governments, among the first attentions of the civil magistrate to regulate [it]\"). See also Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (\"Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the [human] race\"); Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 211 (1888) (marriage \"is an institution, in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress\"); Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 45 (1885) (\"no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth ... than that which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman ... the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement\"); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 165 (1878) (\"Upon [marriage] society may be said to be built, and out of its fruits spring social relations and social obligations and duties, with which government is necessarily required to deal\").\n \n It is undeniably true that dramatic historical shifts in our cultural, political, and economic landscape have altered some of our traditional notions about marriage, including the interpersonal dynamics within it, [FN18] the range of responsibilities required of it as an institution, [FN19] and the legal environment in which it exists. [FN20] Nevertheless, the institution of marriage remains the principal weave of our social fabric. See C.N. Degler, supra at 61; A.J. Hawkins, Introduction, in Revitalizing the Institution of Marriage for the Twenty-First Century: An Agenda for Strengthening Marriage xiv (2002); C. Lasch, supra at 80; W.J. O'Donnell & D.A.

A family defined by heterosexual marriage continues to be the most prevalent social structure into which the vast majority of children are born, nurtured, and prepared for productive participation in civil society, see Children's Living Arrangements and Characteristics: March, 2002, United States Census Bureau Current Population Reports at 3 (June, 2003) (in 2002, 69% of children lived with two married parents, 23% lived with their mother, 5% lived with their father, and 4% lived in households with neither parent present).\n \n It is difficult to imagine a State purpose more important and legitimate than ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure within which to bear and raise children. At the very least, the marriage statute continues to serve this important State purpose. [FN21]\n \n 3. Rational relationship. The question we must turn to next is whether the statute, construed as limiting marriage to couples of the opposite sex, remains a rational way to further that purpose. Stated differently, we ask whether a conceivable rational basis exists on which the Legislature could conclude that continuing to limit the institution of civil marriage to members of the opposite sex furthers the legitimate purpose of ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure for the bearing and raising of children. [FN22]\n \n \n \n We must assume that the Legislature (1) might conclude that the institution of civil marriage has successfully and continually provided this structure over several centuries [FN23]; (2) might consider and credit studies that document negative consequences that too often follow children either born outside of marriage or raised in households lacking either a father or a mother figure, [FN24] and scholarly commentary contending that children and families develop best when mothers and fathers are partners in their parenting [FN25]; and (3) would be familiar with many recent studies that variously: support the proposition that children raised in intact families headed by same-sex couples fare as well on many measures as children raised in similar families headed by opposite-sex couples [FN26]; support the proposition that children of same-sex couples fare worse on some measures [FN27]; or reveal notable differences between the two groups of children that warrant further study. [FN28]\n \n We must also assume that the Legislature would be aware of the critiques of the methodologies used in virtually all of the comparative studies of children raised in these different environments, cautioning that the sampling populations are not representative, that the observation periods are too limited in time, [FN29] that the empirical data are unreliable, and that the hypotheses are too infused with political or agenda driven bias. See, e.g., R. Lerner & A.K. Nagai, No Basis: What the Studies Don't Tell Us About Same-Sex Parenting, Marriage Law Project (Jan.2001) (criticizing forty-nine studies on same-sex parenting -- at least twenty-six of which were cited by amici in this case--as suffering from flaws in formulation of hypotheses, use of experimental controls, use of measurements, sampling and statistical testing, and finding false negatives); Stacey, (How) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter, 66 Am. Soc. Rev. 159, 159-166 (2001) (highlighting problems with sampling pools, lack of longitudinal studies, and political hypotheses).\n \n Taking all of this available information into account, the Legislature could rationally conclude that a family environment with married opposite-sex parents remains the optimal social structure in which to bear children, and that the raising of children by same-sex couples, who by definition cannot be the two sole biological parents of a child and cannot provide children with a parental authority figure of each gender, [FN30] presents an alternative structure for child rearing that has not yet proved itself beyond reasonable scientific dispute to be as optimal as the biologically based marriage norm. See Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 222 (1999) (\"conceivable that the Legislature could conclude that opposite-sex partners offer advantages in th[e] area [of child rearing], although ... experts disagree and the answer is decidedly uncertain\"). Cf. Marcoux v. Attorney Gen., 375 Mass. 63, 65 (1978). Working from the assumption that a recognition of same-sex marriages will increase the number of children experiencing this alternative, the Legislature could conceivably conclude that declining to recognize same-sex marriages remains prudent until empirical questions about its impact on the upbringing of children are resolved. [FN31]\n \n The fact that the Commonwealth currently allows same-sex couples to adopt, see Adoption of Tammy, 416 Mass. 205 (1993), does not affect the rationality of this conclusion. The eligibility of a child for adoption presupposes that at least one of the child's biological parents is unable or unwilling, for some reason, to participate in raising the child. In that sense, society has \"lost\" the optimal setting in which to raise that child--it is simply not available. In these circumstances, the principal and overriding consideration is the \"best interests of the child,\" considering his or her unique circumstances and the options that are available for that child. The objective is an individualized determination of the best environment for a particular child, where the normative social structure--a home with both the child's biological father and mother--is not an option. That such a focused determination may lead to the approval of a same-sex couple's adoption of a child does not mean that it would be irrational for a legislator, in fashioning statutory laws that cannot make such individualized determinations, to conclude generally that being raised by a same-sex couple has not yet been shown to be the absolute equivalent of being raised by one's married biological parents.\n \n That the State does not preclude different types of families from raising children does not mean that it must view them all as equally optimal and equally deserving of State endorsement and support. [FN32] For example, single persons are allowed to adopt children, but the fact that the Legislature permits single-parent adoption does not mean that it has endorsed single parenthood as an optimal setting in which to raise children or views it as the equivalent of being raised by both of one's biological parents. [FN33] The same holds true with respect to same-sex couples--the fact that they may adopt children means only that the Legislature has concluded that they may provide an acceptable setting in which to raise children who cannot be raised by both of their biological parents. The Legislature may rationally permit adoption by same-sex couples yet harbor reservations as to whether parenthood by same-sex couples should be affirmatively encouraged to the same extent as parenthood by the heterosexual couple whose union produced the child. [FN34]\n \n In addition, the Legislature could conclude that redefining the institution of marriage to permit same-sex couples to marry would impair the State's interest in promoting and supporting heterosexual marriage as the social institution that it has determined best normalizes, stabilizes, and links the acts of procreation and child rearing. While the plaintiffs argue that they only want to take part in the same stabilizing institution, the Legislature conceivably could conclude that permitting their participation would have the unintended effect of undermining to some degree marriage's ability to serve its social purpose. See Commonwealth v. Stowell, 389 Mass. 171, 175 (1983) (given State's broad concern with institution of marriage, it has \"legitimate interest in prohibiting conduct which may threaten that institution\").\n \n As long as marriage is limited to opposite-sex couples who can at least theoretically procreate, society is able to communicate a consistent message to its citizens that marriage is a (normatively) necessary part of their procreative endeavor; that if they are to procreate, then society has endorsed the institution of marriage as the environment for it and for the subsequent rearing of their children; and that benefits are available explicitly to create a supportive and conducive atmosphere for those purposes. If society proceeds similarly to recognize marriages between same-sex couples who cannot procreate, it could be perceived as an abandonment of this claim, and might result in the mistaken view that civil marriage has little to do with procreation: just as the potential of procreation would not be necessary for a marriage to be valid, marriage would not be necessary for optimal procreation and child rearing to occur. [FN35] In essence, the Legislature could conclude that the consequence of such a policy shift would be a diminution in society's ability to steer the acts of procreation and child rearing into their most optimal setting. [FN36] Hall-Omar Baking Co. v. Commissioner of Labor & Indus., 344 Mass. 695, 700 (1962) (\"Legislative classification is valid if it is rational and bears some relationship to the object intended to be accomplished\" [emphasis added] ).\n \n The court recognizes this concern, but brushes it aside with the assumption that permitting same-sex couples to marry \"will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite-sex marriage,\" ante at, and that \"we have no doubt that marriage will continue to be a vibrant and revered institution.\" Ante at. Whether the court is correct in its assumption is irrelevant. What is relevant is that such predicting is not the business of the courts. A rational Legislature, given the evidence, could conceivably come to a different conclusion, or could at least harbor rational concerns about possible unintended consequences of a dramatic redefinition of marriage. [FN37]\n \n There is no question that many same-sex couples are capable of being good parents, and should be (and are) permitted to be so. The policy question that a legislator must resolve is a different one, and turns on an assessment of whether the marriage structure proposed by the plaintiffs will, over time, if endorsed and supported by the State, prove to be as stable and successful a model as the one that has formed a cornerstone of our society since colonial times, or prove to be less than optimal, and result in consequences, perhaps now unforeseen, adverse to the State's legitimate interest in promoting and supporting the best possible social structure in which children should be born and raised. Given the critical importance of civil marriage as an organizing and stabilizing institution of society, it is eminently rational for the Legislature to postpone making fundamental changes to it until such time as there is unanimous scientific evidence, or popular consensus, or both, that such changes can safely be made. [FN38]\n \n There is no reason to believe that legislative processes are inadequate to effectuate legal changes in response to evolving evidence, social values, and views of fairness on the subject of same-sex relationships. [FN39] Deliberate consideration of, and incremental responses to rapidly evolving scientific and social understanding is the norm of the political process--that it may seem painfully slow to those who are already persuaded by the arguments in favor of change is not a sufficient basis to conclude that the processes are constitutionally infirm. See, e.g., Massachusetts Fed'n of Teachers v. Board of Educ., 436 Mass. 763, 778 (2002); Mobil Oil v. Attorney Gen., 361 Mass. 401, 417 (1972) (Legislature may proceed piecemeal in addressing perceived injustices or problems). The advancement of the rights, privileges, and protections afforded to homosexual members of our community in the last three decades has been significant, and there is no reason to believe that that evolution will not continue. Changes of attitude in the civic, social, and professional communities have been even more profound. Thirty years ago, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the seminal handbook of the American Psychiatric Association, still listed homosexuality as a mental disorder. Today, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, the American Psychoanalytic Association, and many other psychiatric, psychological, and social science organizations have joined in an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs' cause. A body of experience and evidence has provided the basis for change, and that body continues to mount. The Legislature is the appropriate branch, both constitutionally and practically, to consider and respond to it. It is not enough that we as Justices might be personally of the view that we have learned enough to decide what is best. So long as the question is at all debatable, it must be the Legislature that decides. The marriage statute thus meets the requirements of the rational basis test. Accord Standhardt v. Superior Court, 77 P.3d 451 (Ariz.Ct.App.2003) (marriage statutes rationally related to State's legitimate interest in encouraging procreation and child rearing within marriage); Baker v. Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 313 (1971) ( \"equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the state's classification of persons authorized to marry\"); Singer v. Hara, 11 Wash.App. 247, 262-263 (1974) (\"There can be no doubt that there exists a rational basis for the state to limit the definition of marriage to exclude same-sex relationships\").\n \n D. Conclusion. While \"the Massachusetts Constitution protects matters of personal liberty against government intrusion at least as zealously, and often more so than does the Federal Constitution,\" ante at--, this case is not about government intrusions into matters of personal liberty. It is not about the rights of same-sex couples to choose to live together, or to be intimate with each other, or to adopt and raise children together. It is about whether the State must endorse and support their choices by changing the institution of civil marriage to make its benefits, obligations, and responsibilities applicable to them. While the courageous efforts of many have resulted in increased dignity, rights, and respect for gay and lesbian members of our community, the issue presented here is a profound one, deeply rooted in social policy, that must, for now, be the subject of legislative not judicial action.",

   "Goodridge vs. Department of Public Health, Mass. Supreme Judicial Court, 2003\n \n The judge in the Superior Court endorsed the first rationale, holding that \"the state's interest in regulating marriage is based on the traditional concept that marriage's primary purpose is procreation.\" This is incorrect. Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family. General Laws c. 207 contains no requirement that the applicants for a marriage license attest to their ability or intention to conceive children by coitus. Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married. See Franklin v. Franklin, 154 Mass. 515, 516 (1891) (\"The consummation of a marriage by coition is not necessary to its validity\"). People who cannot stir from their deathbed may marry. See G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 28A. While it is certainly true that many, perhaps most, married couples have children together (assisted or unassisted), it is the exclusive and permanent commitment of the marriage partners to one another, not the begetting of children, that is the sine qua non of civil marriage.\n \n \n \n Moreover, the Commonwealth affirmatively facilitates bringing children into a family regardless of whether the intended parent is married or unmarried, whether the child is adopted or born into a family, whether assistive technology was used to conceive the child, and whether the parent or her partner is heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. If procreation were a necessary component of civil marriage, our statutes would draw a tighter circle around the permissible bounds of nonmarital child bearing and the creation of families by noncoital means. The attempt to isolate procreation as \"the source of a fundamental right to marry,\" post at (Cordy, J., dissenting), overlooks the integrated way in which courts have examined the complex and overlapping realms of personal autonomy, marriage, family life, and child rearing. Our jurisprudence recognizes that, in these nuanced and fundamentally private areas of life, such a narrow focus is inappropriate.\n \n \n \n The \"marriage is procreation\" argument singles out the one unbridgeable difference between same-sex and opposite-sex couples, and transforms that difference into the essence of legal marriage. Like \"Amendment 2\" to the Constitution of Colorado, which effectively denied homosexual persons equality under the law and full access to the political process, the marriage restriction impermissibly \"identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board.\" Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996). In so doing, the State's action confers an official stamp of approval on the destructive stereotype that same-sex relationships are inherently unstable and inferior to opposite-sex relationships and are not worthy of respect.\n \n \n \n \n The department's first stated rationale, equating marriage with unassisted heterosexual procreation, shades imperceptibly into its second: that confining marriage to opposite-sex couples ensures that children are raised in the \"optimal\" setting. Protecting the welfare of children is a paramount State policy. Restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples, however, cannot plausibly further this policy. \"The demographic changes of the past century make it difficult to speak of an average American family. The composition of families varies greatly from household to household.\" Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 63 (2000). Massachusetts has responded supportively to \"the changing realities of the American family,\" id. at 64, and has moved vigorously to strengthen the modern family in its many variations. See, e.g., G. L. c. 209C (paternity statute); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D (grandparent visitation statute); Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (same); E.N.O. v. L.M.M., 429 Mass. 824, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999) (de facto parent); Youmans v. Ramos, 429 Mass. 774, 782 (1999) (same); and Adoption of Tammy, 416 Mass. 205 (1993) (coparent adoption). Moreover, we have repudiated the common-law power of the State to provide varying levels of protection to children based on the circumstances of birth. See G. L. c. 209C (paternity statute); Powers v. Wilkinson, 399 Mass. 650, 661 (1987) (\"Ours is an era in which logic and compassion have impelled the law toward unburdening children from the stigma and the disadvantages heretofore attendant upon the status of illegitimacy\"). The \"best interests of the child\" standard does not turn on a parent's sexual orientation or marital status. See e.g., Doe v. Doe, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 503 (1983) (parent's sexual orientation insufficient ground to deny custody of child in divorce action). See also E.N.O. v. L.M.M., supra at 829-830 (best interests of child determined by considering child's relationship with biological and de facto same-sex parents); Silvia v. Silvia, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 341 & n.3 (1980) (collecting support and custody statutes containing no gender distinction). \n \n \n \n The department has offered no evidence that forbidding marriage to people of the same sex will increase the number of couples choosing to enter into opposite-sex marriages in order to have and raise children. There is thus no rational relationship between the marriage statute and the Commonwealth's proffered goal of protecting the \"optimal\" child rearing unit. Moreover, the department readily concedes that people in same-sex couples may be \"excellent\" parents. These couples (including four of the plaintiff couples) have children for the reasons others do -- to love them, to care for them, to nurture them. But the task of child rearing for same-sex couples is made infinitely harder by their status as outliers to the marriage laws. While establishing the parentage of children as soon as possible is crucial to the safety and welfare of children, see Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconness Med. Ctr., 435 Mass. 285, 292 (2001), same-sex couples must undergo the sometimes lengthy and intrusive process of second-parent adoption to establish their joint parentage. While the enhanced income provided by marital benefits is an important source of security and stability for married couples and their children, those benefits are denied to families headed by same-sex couples. See, e.g., note 6, supra. While the laws of divorce provide clear and reasonably predictable guidelines for child support, child custody, and property division on dissolution of a marriage, same-sex couples who dissolve their relationships find themselves and their children in the highly unpredictable terrain of equity jurisdiction. See E.N.O. v. L.M.M., supra. Given the wide range of public benefits reserved only for married couples, we do not credit the department's contention that the absence of access to civil marriage amounts to little more than an inconvenience to same-sex couples and their children. Excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage will not make children of opposite-sex marriages more secure, but it does prevent children of same-sex couples from enjoying the immeasurable advantages that flow from the assurance of \"a stable family structure in which children will be reared, educated, and socialized.\" Post at (Cordy, J., dissenting).\n \n \n \n No one disputes that the plaintiff couples are families, that many are parents, and that the children they are raising, like all children, need and should have the fullest opportunity to grow up in a secure, protected family unit. Similarly, no one disputes that, under the rubric of marriage, the State provides a cornucopia of substantial benefits to married parents and their children. The preferential treatment of civil marriage reflects the Legislature's conclusion that marriage \"is the foremost setting for the education and socialization of children\" precisely because it \"encourages parents to remain committed to each other and to their children as they grow.\" Post at (Cordy, J., dissenting).\n \n In this case, we are confronted with an entire, sizeable class of parents raising children who have absolutely no access to civil marriage and its protections because they are forbidden from procuring a marriage license. It cannot be rational under our laws, and indeed it is not permitted, to penalize children by depriving them of State benefits because the State disapproves of their parents' sexual orientation. \n \n \n \n The rights of couples to have children, to adopt, and to be foster parents, regardless of sexual orientation and marital status, are firmly established. See E.N.O. v. L.M.M., 429 Mass. 824, 829, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999); Adoption of Tammy, 416 Mass. 205, 210-211 (1993). As recognized in the court's opinion, and demonstrated by the record in this case, however, the State's refusal to accord legal recognition to unions of same-sex couples has had the effect of creating a system in which children of same-sex couples are unable to partake of legal protections and social benefits taken for granted by children in families whose parents are of the opposite sex. The continued maintenance of this caste-like system is irreconcilable with, indeed, totally repugnant to, the State's strong interest in the welfare of all children and its primary focus, in the context of family law where children are concerned, on \"the best interests of the child.\" The issue at stake is not one, as might ordinarily be the case, that can be unilaterally and totally deferred to the wisdom of the Legislature. \"While the State retains wide latitude to decide the manner in which it will allocate benefits, it may not use criteria which discriminatorily burden the exercise of a fundamental right.\" Moe v. Secretary of Admin. & Fin., 382 Mass. 629, 652 (1981). Nor can the State's wish to conserve resources be accomplished by invidious distinctions between classes of citizens. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-217, 227 (1982).\n \n \n \n [28] Justice Cordy suggests that we have \"transmuted the 'right' to marry into a right to change the institution of marriage itself,\" post at (Cordy, J., dissenting), because marriage is intimately tied to the reproductive systems of the marriage partners and to the \"optimal\" mother and father setting for child rearing. Id. That analysis hews perilously close to the argument, long repudiated by the Legislature and the courts, that men and women are so innately and fundamentally different that their respective \"proper spheres\" can be rigidly and universally delineated. An abundance of legislative enactments and decisions of this court negate any such stereotypical premises.\n \n [29] We are concerned only with the withholding of the benefits, protections, and obligations of civil marriage from a certain class of persons for invalid reasons. Our decision in no way limits the rights of individuals to refuse to marry persons of the same sex for religious or any other reasons. It in no way limits the personal freedom to disapprove of, or to encourage others to disapprove of, same-sex marriage. Our concern, rather, is whether historical, cultural, religious, or other reasons permit the State to impose limits on personal beliefs concerning whom a person should marry.\n \n [30] Justice Cordy's dissenting opinion, post at - and nn. 24-28 (Cordy, J., dissenting), makes much of the current \"battle of the experts\" concerning the possible long-term effects on children of being raised in households headed by same-sex parents. We presume that the Legislature is aware of these studies, see Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, 200 Mass. 482, 487 (1909), aff'd, 222 U.S. 225 (1911), and has drawn the conclusion that a child's best interest is not harmed by being raised and nurtured by same-sex parents. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 7. See also Adoption of Tammy, 416 Mass. 205 (1993); 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.09 (3) (2000) (\"The Department [of Social Services] shall not deny to any person the opportunity to become an adoptive or foster parent, on the basis of the . . . sexual orientation . . . of the person, or of the child, involved\"). Either the Legislature's openness to same-sex parenting is rational in light of its paramount interests in promoting children's well-being, or irrational in light of its so-called conclusion that a household headed by opposite-sex married parents is the \"optimal\" setting for raising children. See post at (Cordy, J., dissenting). We give full credit to the Legislature for enacting a statutory scheme of child-related laws that is coherent, consistent, and harmonious. See New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc'y v. Commissioner of Admin., 437 Mass. 172, 180 (2002).\n \n [31] If total deference to the Legislature were the case, the judiciary would be stripped of its constitutional authority to decide challenges to statutes pertaining to marriage, child rearing, and family relationships, and, conceivably, unconstitutional laws that provided for the forced sterilization of habitual criminals; prohibited miscegenation; required court approval for the marriage of persons with child support obligations; compelled a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain the consent of both parents before undergoing an abortion; and made sodomy a criminal offense, to name just a few, would stand.\n \n Indeed, every State court that has recently considered the issue we decide today has exercised its duty in the same way, by carefully scrutinizing the statutory ban on same-sex marriages in light of relevant State constitutional provisions. See Brause vs. Bureau of Vital Statistics, No. 3AN-95-6562CJ (Alaska Super. Ct., Feb. 27, 1998) (concluding marriage statute violated right to privacy provision in Alaska Constitution) (superseded by constitutional amendment, art. I, \u00a7 25 of the Constitution of Alaska); Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 571-580 (1993) (concluding marriage statute implicated Hawaii Constitution's equal protection clause; remanding case to lower court for further proceedings); Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 197-198 (1999) (concluding marriage statute violated Vermont Constitution's common benefits clause). But see Standhardt v. Superior Court, 77 P.3d 451 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003) (marriage statute does not violate liberty interests under either Federal or Arizona Constitution). See also Halpern v. Toronto (City), 172 O.A.C. 276 (2003) (concluding marriage statute violated equal protection provisions of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms); Eagle Canada, Inc. v. Canada (Attorney Gen.), 13 B.C.L.R. (4th) 1 (2003) (same).",

Yet neither of us really need to have such things pointed out, we don't still have the shackles of slavery on our thoughts. Some others seem to be less fortunate. I know your motto is \"some people will never change..use /ignore\", but I like to witness the amazing denials that humans produce, I find it disturbingly fascinating.\n \n And yes, I'm continually surprised not at how people arrive at conclusions in error or fail to see the big picture, but how they arrive at conclusions that are completely and totally opposite of reality or logic. And not in one aspect, in all aspects of their conclusions, their reasoning behind it, and the denial of anything to the contrary. Then sealing the deal by not only holding, and supporting these contradictory beliefs, but to then label those beliefs as they exact opposite of what they are. It blows my mind. And it's not just on issues like this, it's in every aspect of every nook and cranny of our society. And it must necessarily be like this it seems.\n \n I suspect I will die being surprised at this basic failure of some humans...just as I'm continually relieved and proud that so many people seem to have genuine understanding and empathy.\n \n -Mach",

Behaviors are not good or bad, they need to be taken in context with rights to have legal implications. You can shoot a gun all day (behavior). If you shoot and it hits somone, you violate their rights. Same behavior, different context, one breaks a law, one does not, one violates someone's rights, one does not. The behavior of marriage is OK to you, yet not OK to you. What gives? Are you confusing yourself or are you just always so confused about your own claims?\n\n See your analysis is contradicting. You say you can shoot your gun but if you shoot it in another situation its wrong. Same thing you can marry some people. fi you marry others relatives, minors, same gender, currently married, etc then you break the law.\n Same analysis as you\n \n \nWhy are men not allowed to marry men, when it restricts their rights, when many people want these rights, and when men are legally allowed to marry women? Who's rights does it restrict if they ARE allowed to marry? What specific rights would be restricted? How is the behavior of marrying a human [male], different in terms of violating everyone's rights, form marrying a human [female]?\n\n That isn't the policy consideration when making a law. We don't consider rights restricted. We consider public interest.\n Who's right is resticted in prostiution? Who's right is restricted in polygamy? minors marrying? Relatives marrying? drug use in private? public nudity?\n \n \nCan you compare and contrast for us?\n \n Consenting adults, couples, that are of the same sex, want equal treatment under the law with regards to being able to legalize their union, so that they can enjoy the same rights benefited to hetero couples.\n \n You want to restrict their right to be married to one another because:\n 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n I want to because protect marriage as it is.

In order to obtain this license, one is required, among other things, to attend a 16 hour course and pass a written examination.

The reason for this is the potential risk of injury to another from richotes or other risks. \n \n Likewise, it is against the law to marry a close relative because of the potential injury to a child born of such a union.\n \n It is against the law to marry a minor because of potential injury to the minor as they are not considered mature enough to make judgements concerning their welfare. \n \n It is against the law to marry someone who is currently married as it would cause injury to the other person to whom they are currently married.\n \n Same gender marriage causes injury to no one.\n \n \n \nI want to because protect marriage as it is.{What kind of a sentance is this?} I believe in a democracy we have the right to determine correct behavior as long as it doesn't violate the constitution. i {I} believe we as a people make that determination not judges.

A constitutional ammendment was passed and then rescinded over this issue. What is the public interest in legalized drinking? What is the benefit to society of legalized drinking?\n \n Is gambling \"correct behavior\"? Again, some may say yes; some may say no, for moral or religious reasons. Yet it is legal. What is the public interest in legalized gambling? What is the benefit to society of legalized gambling?\n \n This \"we\" you speak of does have the right through the legislative branch of government, to enact laws restricting behavior.

It is the responsibility of the judicial branch of government to determine if such laws violate the constitution.
