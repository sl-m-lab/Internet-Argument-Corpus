   "There is no cure for the common cold. Everyone knows this, so it's no real surprise. A more interesting question would be to ask why there's no cure. Now, I know that the cold isn't a single disease. I know that many different organisms can cause the fever, stuffy nose and sneezing of a cold. This certainly would make it harder to find the cure for the common cold. But given the number of medical researchers, the last 80 years of exploding knowledge, and the gigantic amounts of money spent on medical research, the question persists and deserves an answer - why in the world don't we have a cure or vaccine?\n \n http://www.lfospot.com/latest.htm\n \n Pretty Interesting slant on the medical field.

Enviornement has little effect, compared to immunity.\n\n You are right about immunity, the body has the amazing ability to create memory cells (memory B cells) which can recall a certain virus, thus enabling the body to fight it more effectively and efficiently the next time it sees that virus. Memory B cells are secondary immune-system components that have an affinity for a particular antigen. Like other B cells, memory B cells originate from lymphocytes that develop and are activated in the bone marrow. They become antigen-specific when stimulated by interleukin-4 (IL-4).\n \n But, environment has a huge role to play in a persons exposure to viruses.
