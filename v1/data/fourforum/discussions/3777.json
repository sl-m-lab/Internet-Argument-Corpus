   "Some of those from another forum will recall that I announced for President in the last election, and that I promised to resign if elected as soon as I secured the lifelong benefits, a book deal and a library for both my books. Since the inflow of campaign funds did not materialize I decided to yield to the lesser qualified but better funded candidates John and Dubya. The turmoil over the validity of John's Purple Hearts has caused me to reconsider any future run for office. While in the Army I was involved in a night mission in infantry tactics at Ft. Bliss Texas. Someone poured sand on top of a blank round and shot me in the butt from close range. While I did not receive a Purple Heart, I did receive a purple buttock and I'm sure my political enemies will exploit this. Because of this I will not seek nomination or accept a draft.\n Dono",

That could be a hinderance.\n\n \n \n No, she just impedes federal investigations against her husband and involves herself in fraudulent behavior with certain companies (Whitewater?).\n \n In addition, she also used over $10 million of US taxpayers money to fund her vacation with Cheslea and some friends to Africa for a few weeks. \n \n She also took numerous questionable donations for her Senatorial campaign. Two years ago Clinton's campaign deliberately understated its fundraising costs so it would have more money to spend on elections. Also, prosecutors are now saying that businessman Peter Paul made donations because he wanted a pardon from President Bill Clinton. He donated over $2 million to her campaign which was never reported to the FEC.\n \n Other than these, I guess you might say she could try and go for the Evangelical Christian label.",

   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Bredesen\n I can't believe Phil Bredesen is on the list. He was the mayor of Nashville (where I am) and he turned the city around mostly(financially). Now he's the governor of Tennesse and he replaced a corrupt administration with one that's apparently honest. So far, from what I can tell he's really helped clean up the state finances. Tennesse has a nice form of Medicare called Tenncare that was being rampantly abused. So much so that it could have bankrupted the state. Bredesen cleaned up the abuse and fraud and has got the system back on track (even though it looks like they may get rid of it altogether). Tenn doesn't have a state income tax and he's one of the one's that's fought to keep it that way. \n \n I don't know how he'd do as pres, but so far he's been a dern fine governor for Tennessee.",
