   "I taught at a college for twenty years, and I am retired now. But, I still substitute at High schools and Middle schooles in Washington D.C\n Now, the reason for school violence is the following below.\n 1. Children now a day have a big mouth. They say stuff to other kids. Example, my son Jason got called a XXXXXX. Some kids have to call others mean things or start problems to put themselves up because they really hate themselves.\n (In other words, the kid that is being rude, is calling a student a XXXXXX because that bully has problems in his or her own life and wants to make him or her self feel better by picking on that one particular kid.)\n 2. Black people don't cause fights. I take that as a racist statement. Yes, some black colored people fight. But that whole \"Black people fight and commit more violence in schools than whites do\" is a bunch of XXXX.\n Maybe in your school. But, it is all mixed.\n (Girls of all colors and races fight now because of a silly rumor that started, or disrespect, or a arguement of some sort. Guys fight over stupid things like talking bad about a gf or family member, a rumor, a challenge, disrespectful things said, or simply problems other than those.\"\n Now, it is called assualt. Kids at schools are arrested for fighting. Then they spend a few days in the kids corrections building, and they get a suspension by the school.\n School violence is almost impossible to prevent. Some schools like our high schools in Washington D.C. have security guards. But, fights will always break out. \n Problem is you got hard XXX kids out there picking fights and that is all. Nothing more and nothing less. \n -John Milosevic",
