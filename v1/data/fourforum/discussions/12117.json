   "\"WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Barack Obama on Thursday defended his choice of a popular evangelical minister to deliver the invocation at his inauguration, rejecting criticism that it slights gays.\n \n The selection of Pastor Rick Warren brought objections from gay rights advocates, who strongly supported Obama during the election campaign. The advocates are angry over Warren's backing of a California ballot initiative banning gay marriage. That measure was approved by voters last month.\n \n But Obama told reporters in Chicago that America needs to \"come together,\" even when there's disagreement on social issues. \"That dialogue is part of what my campaign is all about,\" he said.\n \n Obama also said he's known to be a \"fierce advocate for equality\" for gays and lesbians, and will remain so.\n \n Warren, a best-selling author and leader of a Southern California megachurch, is one of a new breed of evangelicals who stress the need for action on social issues such as reducing poverty and protecting the environment, alongside traditional theological themes.\n \n The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, said Warren's opposition to gay marriage is a sign of intolerance.\n \n \"We feel a deep level of disrespect when one of the architects and promoters of an anti-gay agenda is given the prominence and the pulpit of your historic nomination,\" the group said in a letter to Obama, asking him to reconsider.\n \n Obama's selection of Warren is seen as a signal to religious conservatives that the president-elect will listen to their views. During the campaign, Warren interviewed Obama and Republican John McCain in a widely watched television program that focused on religious concerns.\n \n Gay rights advocates say they are troubled that Obama would give Warren such a visible role at his swearing-in. \"By inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration, you have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table,\" the letter said.\n \n Obama, however, pointed out that a couple of years ago, he was invited to speak at Warren's church, despite their disagreements on a number of issues.\n \n The president-elect said a \"wide range of viewpoints\" will be presented during the inaugural ceremonies.\" Obama defends choice of evangelical pastor\n \n I'd love to know exactly how it is that inviting Warren to the inauguration tarnishes \"the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table\", as these gay rights folks are claiming. Once again, it is notable here which side is opposing this 'wide-range of views' present at the inauguration--and it ain't the religious conservatives (as the gay rights activists so often portray them as). :)",

No one has yet been able to show a single gay person of which his or her position at Obama's table is 'tarnished.' This isn't about intolerance toward gays, no matter how much these guys would rather try and make that the issue. It's about a case of gay pride folk having intolerance toward a good man speaking at the inauguration. No one else seems to care--even Gavin Newsom! Good grief, hardly ANYONE could ever qualify if disagreement alone isn't even tolerated. Again, people really need to get over it and pick fights that matter. I mean seriously. Bent out of shape because a mainstream pastor who fights against AIDS and poverty gets to give an invocation at the inauguration? Sometimes I wonder how these guys (not gay people in general, just these guys) even function alongside society with such a counter-cultural my-way-or-the-highway approach. There really are some other issues out there than this one thing by which some here seem to be the litmus test of all litmus tests by which all people should be judged. Lucky for them, most gays probably wouldn't think that way. It's one thing to oppose acts that truly do discriminate. This would be totally different if it were a case of telling gays \"no, you can't come.\" But it's a case of raising a ruckus over an act of inclusion that really has nothing to do with gays whatsoever (other than the very indirect issue of the pastor's fairly mainstream moralistic views about gay relations, of which couldn't even affect any policy in this case even if Warren wanted to. Big whoop. emoticon_rolleyes)",

   "This is too paranoid. The only reason a number of Christian churches are being criticised for their anti-gay bigotry is because they are bigoted against gays. This isn't an act of love, it's an act of hatred, of rejection, of division and exclusion.\n\n \n All you can do is disregard what I say as paranoid and say it's based on anti gay bigotry. And you think that if you continue to repeat yourself enough times, that somehow makes it true. You just refuse to comprehend that we are following the spiritual principles of Gods word in our rejection of homosexuality as a morally right or natural sexual expression and lifestyle. \n \n You can't understand how we are capable of loving you as individuals while rejecting what your lifestyle represents, spiritually speaking. Your hatred for what we represent is founded in being completely blind to what we know to be absolute spiritual truths which were established by God out of a deep love and concern for us as His children. God is not anti-homosexual because He is some sexually uptight scrooge. He sees deeper than Man does and sees the pitfalls of all of the sexual sins He has condemned, be they straight or gay in there expression. But you just refuse to see that truth lesz and must personalize it in order to play the poor victim card. After all, there can't be a victim in your world without there being a villain, so your community has chosen the christian as the great oppressor.\n \n \n Then to cap the stupidity of this, they claim they are acting in the name of Christ!!!!\n\n \n Stupidity? Really? What is stupid is to deny that we have anything more invested in our opposition to the homosexual lifestyle than following the principles which God laid out in His word. I mean, how consistent would it be if we understand that God considers homosexuality an unnatural lifestyle and then we embraced it as right and normal for you? Would that be loving you as we tolerated the your open and prideful rebellion against what He stands for? I think not. I suppose you would embrace such an act of hypocrisy from us, but to those of us who know the Lord and have personally experienced His unconditional Love, it just isn't possible for us to deny His truths in favor of sinful Man. \n \n Also, just to clarify how consistent we are; if straight men who were serial adulterers lived lives where they openly boasted about their cheating and lascivious behavior against their wives, do you think that the evangelical church community would just look the other way as these men brought mistresses to church on sundays and declared that they were unrepentant about their open sin against their wives, their marriages, against their children and ultimately God? Not on your life lesz. But unlike other sinners, homosexuals today are proud of their open rebellion against Gods Holy standards which He gave us to live by. And you insist that we must embrace what you openly and proudly represent or be labeled intolerant homophobic bigots. Well sorry; that just isn't going to happen. You will never guilt us into accepting what the bible clearly condemns as wrong, unnatural and immoral. \n \n \n Go pull the other one, Archie. You do not speak for Christ, and nor do most Christian churches. They wouldn't know him if they met him in the street.\n\n \n You're absolutely right lesz, I don't speak for Christ. I either speak for myself or I let Christ and His Word speak for me. These aren't my words or my principles which I'm sharing with you. They are what the bible say's about homosexuality. All I'm doing is submitting myself to my Gods authority and trying to live according to His standards. And He knows of all of my failures to live up to them, yet He loves me anyway, just as He loves everyone else, saint and sinner alike. \n \n You erroneously believe that God is your enemy lesz. That is why the hate and bitterness just rolls off of your words here. If you could just comprehend that it is you who is making yourself His enemy by rejecting Him and rebelling against everything He represents. After all, if God truly be God, how could you possibly expect Him to submit Himself to your human demands? Especially when those demands oppose His moral standards so completely. Just something to think about lesz.\n \n \nAs usual, you pervert the concept of tolerance for us as you ignore the blatant intolerance you promote for all committed christians. You think that because we reject the sinfulness of your anti-biblical lifestyle we refuse to be tolerant of you as individuals when nothing in reality supports that view. Neither Warrens church nor any other main line evangelical churches call for violence against homosexuals. They don't lobby for criminal prosecution or any other legal recriminations against homosexuals, yet because we oppose redefining marriage for the majority in order to satisfy an unnatural minority lifestyle, you label us intolerant.\n \n But you are blind to all of the intolerant propaganda, attacks, lawsuits and insults being made here by you and your fellow homosexuals as well as the blatant hatred expressed by your community at large against anyone who dares to speak from a scriptural point of view against the homosexual lifestyle. \n \n You are all total and complete hypocrites and you can't even see it as you rage against Christ and His followers for only loving you enough to share the truth of the spiritual liberty which He died on the Cross to give to any and all who will receive it. Remember this lesz, in spite of your bitter and hateful denials, Christianity has never rejected you, it is you who rejects christianity.\n",

A black or white mindset, with no reason.\n \n Archangel: I was saying gay acts are as integral to being gay, as Christian acts such as worship and prayer are to being a Christian. Morality is the most advanced degree of human thought. Thus, calling something immoral should have a thoughtful reason behind it. If one can call gay acts or behaviours immoral without a reason for it, I can do the same for Christian acts. However, because Christians are the majority, it would be difficult to get these put into law, or have much of a real effect on the lives of Christians. There are places where Christians are the minority and do not have equal rights. They're denied rights because the majority sees things as black or white as you do when it comes to gays.",

They are \"human, all-too-human,\" as it were.\n \n Moreover, no passage attributes the condemnation of homosexuality to Jesus himself, while their venom strikes me as quite contrary to His words and His example. On another thread, you mentioned a capacity called \"spiritual discernment,\" and claimed that \"the natural man\" lacks it. Well, I happen to believe in capacities called \"textual discernment,\" \"historical acumen,\" and \"interpretive judgment.\" And I believe that Biblical literalists lack them, which is why I emphatically don't believe that their allegedly \"literal\" interpretations amount to diddly-squat.\n \n \nAnd speaking of arrogance, only in this generation could I be attacked as heretical by other alleged christians for interpreting the bible for what it actually say's.\n\n \n First, I don't think the issue of what the Bible \"actually says\" is remotely as simple as literalists such as yourself like to pretend that it is.

How literal are you?...)\n \n Second, I didn't accuse you of heresy for having a wrong interpretation of scripture. I accused you of heresy for presuming to know the mind of God.\n \n Finally, feel free to take any accusations of heresy coming from me with a hefty grain of salt. I don't give a damn about orthodoxy, which is nothing but support for the powers that be. My use of the term \"heresy\" was nose-twitting.\n \n \nSo feel free to correct me Matthew, my fellow believer. Tell me what God is telling us in these verses.\n\n \n As I said, I don't hear the voice of God in those passages, but the prejudices of men.\n \n \nAlso, if the bible can't be trusted as Gods thoughts/word rather than Mans words, of what value is any of it since there is no truth in this World what so ever?\n\n \n I think there's plenty of value to it. It doesn't have to be literally true to express truths that are both meaningful and valuable. Nor does every part of it have to express such truths just so that some parts of it can. I realize that these are cornerstones of Biblical literalism (and hence of the entire rotten edifice built upon it), but there is no justification for them. They are overgeneralizations, pure and simple.\n \n And the \"no truth in this world whatsoever\" line is just poppycock. If the Bible and only the Bible were a candidate for truth, then the denial of its truth would amount to saying there's no truth. But I don't for one second believe that the Bible and only the Bible is a candidate for truth.\n \n \nEither the word of God is trustworthy or it isn't. It would be useless to pick and choose what one will accept based on their personal moral discernment and have any hope that they are choosing Gods truth over what reflects man's truth.\n\n \n I don't think my interpretations of scripture cherrypick based on personal preferences. I want to understand the whole text, not merely in terms of internal consistency, but in relation to the various historical circumstances under which it was written and the various historical effects it has produced.\n \n But I do think that when someone describes his position as God's truth not man's, all he's doing is concealing a conentious view under a cloak of allegedly divine authority in order to end debate and conveniently declare himself victorious.",

   "Since I don't regard the Bible as a transcript of what God says, I don't think that God is the one doing the condemning in these passages. They are \"human, all-too-human,\" as it were.\n\n \n Then you are calling God and His word a liar. \n 1Th 2:13 For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.\n \n \nMoreover, no passage attributes the condemnation of homosexuality to Jesus himself, while their venom strikes me as quite contrary to His words and His example. On another thread, you mentioned a capacity called \"spiritual discernment,\" and claimed that \"the natural man\" lacks it. Well, I happen to believe in capacities called \"textual discernment,\" \"historical acumen,\" and \"interpretive judgment.\" And I believe that Biblical literalists lack them, which is why I emphatically don't believe that their allegedly \"literal\" interpretations amount to diddly-squat.\n\n \n Really? Now you are calling Jesus a liar on 2 fronts. First, He commented on Gods command that men and women are God made Man and Woman originally, created marriage for the sake of procreation, and also quoted the very passages in Genesis which you claim reflect Mans word rather than Gods word. So what does that say about Jesus when you reject His trust in genesis as absolute spiritual truth?\n \n Mat 19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made [them] at the beginning made them male and female,\n \n Mat 19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?\n \n Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\n \n \nFirst, I don't think the issue of what the Bible \"actually says\" is remotely as simple as literalists such as yourself like to pretend that it is. (Incidentally, do you go around advocating death for homosexuals? After all, that is what Leviticus \"actually\" says. I am curious about this, and quite serious. How literal are you?...)\n\n \n Asked and answered to chester who asked the same shallow question which proved also that he has as little spiritual discernment as you do. http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12117-gay-rights-people-objecting-obamas-choice-invocation.html#post338011\n \n \nSecond, I didn't accuse you of heresy for having a wrong interpretation of scripture. I accused you of heresy for presuming to know the mind of God.\n\n \n And I never presumed to know the mind of God. But I have been given the authority to discern the lie from the truth. And you represent the lies of secular humanists who attempt to whitewash Gods word to fit your personal moral value system. By that, you corrupt and pervert His absolute truths. \n \n \n \nAs I said, I don't hear the voice of God in those passages, but the prejudices of men.\n\n \n Which is just more evidence that you deny Gods authority over us through His Holy Word.\n \n \nI think there's plenty of value to it. It doesn't have to be literally true to express truths that are both meaningful and valuable. Nor does every part of it have to express such truths just so that some parts of it can. I realize that these are cornerstones of Biblical literalism (and hence of the entire rotten edifice built upon it), but there is no justification for them.

If the Bible and only the Bible were a candidate for truth, then the denial of its truth would amount to saying there's no truth. But I don't for one second believe that the Bible and only the Bible is a candidate for truth.\n\n \n That's precisely what I'm saying and it's what God is saying in His word also. Satan is the god of this world and he is the father of lies. So anything you accept apart from Gods truths are ultimately lies of the devil, whether you accept that or not.\n \n \nI don't think my interpretations of scripture cherrypick based on personal preferences. I want to understand the whole text, not merely in terms of internal consistency, but in relation to the various historical circumstances under which it was written and the various historical effects it has produced.\n \n But I do think that when someone describes his position as God's truth not man's, all he's doing is concealing a conentious view under a cloak of allegedly divine authority in order to end debate and conveniently declare himself victorious.\n\n \n Sure it's cherry picked. Otherwise you would believe even those things which you can't relate to according to the cultural mores of this generation. You would trust Gods word more than you trust mans.",

That verse was written in the Age of the Law/Old Testament when it was the communities responsibility to protect itself from sin and rebellion against Gods law. Also, that verse didn't order any individual to take it upon themselves to play judge, jury and executioner even for the ancient culture it was applicable for.\n\n \n This response interests me for a number of reasons. Let me enumerate them briefly:\n \n 1. Why does the \"Age of Law\"-\"Age of Grace\" distinction mean that what the Bible said during the earlier period ought not be followed now? I ask, because you claim that the Bible's truths are \"absolute\" and \"eternal\" and \"unchanging.\" You can't have it both ways.\n \n 2. If we need not accept every dictate of Leviticus because it was written in the \"Age of Law,\" then why do we need to accept every account in Genesis that was written in the same age?\n \n 3. Why is it okay for you to use historical circumstances to ascribe greater importance to some passages than others, but when I use historical circumstances for the same purpose, I'm objectionably cherry-picking the text?\n \n Now back to your reply to me:\n \n \nAnd I never presumed to know the mind of God.

It's a fallible text written by human beings attempting to express their transcendent religious beliefs and feelings and experiences. So when I think something in the Bible is erroneous or egregious, I don't blame God but men.\n \n I just don't think of the Bible the same way that you do. I think your way is unjustifiable, and that it has pernicious practical consequences, as well.\n\n \n You really don't see the error of your rationale do you? You seem to think that because you reject the absolute truth of the bible as Gods word, as do all of the atheists and secular humanists on this forum, I might add, that that somehow exonerates you from being held responsible for rejecting those truths. In other words, if I pointed to the Sun as the Earths source of heat and light and you said you didn't accept that as an explanation, would that mean that the Sun as I explained it ceased to exist and you were innocent of not believing in it? Of course not. Your denial does nothing to change the reality of the situation from Gods perspective so your rejection of the truth of Gods word as HIS word being absolute truth is calling Him and His word a liar.\n \n I also must ask you to tell me, in your opinion, what differentiates you from the atheists and secular humanists on this forum who have the same exact opinion of Gods word as you do? As a so called christian, what separates you from them at all? The answer from my perspective is nothing at all. Maybe you can correct me, though I seriously doubt it. So you can claim to be debating me from a christian perspective, but you are no different than the unbelievers whom you identify with.\n \n \nAnd let me add that I'm not even calling the Bible's human authors \"liars\" necessarily. I don't have any reason to doubt their sincerity. But in some cases, I have reason to doubt their accuracy or their rectitude. \n\n How very liberal of you. So let me get this right. The bible calls itself Gods word through out it. It claims to be His authoritative message to guide Humanity in all of His ways. But just because the human writers who actually wrote those assurances, according to you were sincere in making these inaccurate, misleading and incorrect statements, you will generously say they're not lying, but just that you doubt their accuracy? \n \n And you can't see that if you're right about that statement, then the bible has no authority at all as it claims to have? Which means that you have completely dethroned God as the Lord of your life as a christian by denying that the bible He says is His word, is actually His word. In other words, you have still called Him a lair.\n \n \nFirst of all, I don't see the \"for the sake of procreation\" appearing anywhere in the three verses you've quoted. Apparently your \"literal\" reading of the text involves reading quite a bit more than is \"actually\" there. Which, I've noticed over the years, is quite typical of \"literalism.\"\n\n \n Yeah, so what? What's your point? Are you saying that just because God didn't say that in those 3 verses, that He didn't say it at all? By me repeating the command, am I really reading more into the bible than was actually said? Or just expanding my explanation of what God said at that time? How tedious of you to hold me to such a limited right to expound when you know very well, hopefully, that God commanded them to fill the Earth with their seed.\n Gen 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n \n Gen 1:27 So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\n \n Gen 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\n \n \nSecond of all, I'm glad you raised the issue of \"spiritual truth.\" Because I think there is a great deal of spiritual truth expressed in the book of Genesis! I just don't think there's much historical or scientific truth to be found there. And I don't think this diminishes the value of its spiritual truth at all. That, it seems to me, is the fundamental difference between you and me.\n\n \n According to God the Genesis account of Creation is historically true. So what you think changes nothing according to Gods perspective of events. As for scientific truths, show where the bible is ever speaking as a scientific authority from mans shallow and very limited point of view? Or from any point of view for that matter. It speaks and offers no confirming evidence for what it say's because according to God, His word is self evident and requires no evidence to support it. God only requires that we trust Him enough to believe He is not a liar. Obviously that isn't the case with you.\n \n \nI had asked about your interpretation of Leviticus' call for the death of homosexuals, wondering how literally you took that. And you replied:\n \n Why is this question \"shallow?\" You claim that every word of the Bible is literally true. Since the passage says that homosexuals \"must be put to death,\" I wanted to know if that's something you agree with.\n \n Meanwhile, here's what you said to Chester:\n \n This response interests me for a number of reasons. Let me enumerate them briefly:\n \n 1. Why does the \"Age of Law\"-\"Age of Grace\" distinction mean that what the Bible said during the earlier period ought not be followed now? I ask, because you claim that the Bible's truths are \"absolute\" and \"eternal\" and \"unchanging.\" You can't have it both ways.\n\n \n Let's try this again, Gods morals and values are unchanging which is why homosexuality is still condemned in the Age of grace. But How God is dealing with Humanity is different since Messiah came and died for our sins and thereby defeated death. You need to do a deeper study if you really want to understand this, as it's an extensive study. \n \n Can you understand that that when dealing with separations of time through the Ages that even though what was unlawful then remains unlawful now, that the lawful response to that moral failing, whether it be straight or gay, can be responded to with grace rather physical punishment due to the dissolution of the power of the Law over us through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross in which He died for our sins? Are you completely blind to His impact on how a loving God is attempting to deal with all sinners in this Age of Grace? Compared to how He dealt with sinners in the Age of the Law?\n \n \n2. If we need not accept every dictate of Leviticus because it was written in the \"Age of Law,\" then why do we need to accept every account in Genesis that was written in the same age?\n\n \n When you learn the difference between a moral dictate which hasn't changed at all, and the impact Jesus had on how Gods dealing with Men has impacted the exercise of His Grace on us as opposed the the OT Laws of judgement, then you will understand why.\n \n \n3. Why is it okay for you to use historical circumstances to ascribe greater importance to some passages than others, but when I use historical circumstances for the same purpose, I'm objectionably cherry-picking the text?\n\n \n Because you're changing the intent of the historical circumstances in order to put your secular humanist spin on them. I am discussing them in their original and proper context which is exactly what you are disagreeing with me on. See the difference? I'm interpreting Gods word, and you are reinterpreting it.\n \n \n-sigh- And herein lies the trouble: You are trying to set yourself up as an authority. As far as I am concerned, you have no authority at all.\n\n \n Again you attempt to imply that i wrongly take upon myself authority which is given to all believers in Christ. And furthermore, by denying we have that authority you claim a form of Godliness while denying the power which comes with it. How can you claim to know Christ while fitting EXACTLY what He warned us of regarding people like you?\n \n 2Ti 3:1 But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come:\n \n 2Ti 3:2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,\n \n 2Ti 3:3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good,\n \n 2Ti 3:4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,\n \n 2Ti 3:5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!\n \n 2Ti 3:6 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,\n \n 2Ti 3:7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\n \n Tts 2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,\n \n Tts 2:12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;\n \n Tts 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\n \n Tts 2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\n \n Tts 2:15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. \n So, once again, just because you claim I don't have the authority as a believer in Christ to exhort, correct and rebuke your denials of Gods truths, God Himself gives all believers that authority which surely trumps your personal and very erroneous personal opinion.\n \n \nAnd I think that it's Biblical literalists who are distorting God's words to fit their value systems. They claim an ostensibly divine mandate for their earthly authority, so that they can exercise power over other human beings. In other words, Biblical literalism is a transparently self-serving form of authoritarianism.\n\n \n Really? What kind of value system do you think a beer drinking, pot smoking womanizing 22 year old kid from the 70s had anyway? The greatest impact my conversion from islam to Christ had on my family was the fact that my character and priorities in life changed in such a dramatic way. I truly became a new creature in Christ when I was born again, just as the bible promises will happen to every believer. \n \n Why do you think that the constant lies and shallow condemnations from alleged christians like you who haven't a clue about what a real relationship with the living God is, has no effect on our belief system? It's because we understand where you're coming from because we were once spiritually dead just as you are. But we now belong to a different hierarchy of authority under God which it's impossible for you to relate to as an unredeemed man.\n \n \nNope. I deny your authority. You should really stop confusing my criticisms of you with crticisms of Him.\n \n But I do thank you for that invocation of your \"authority.\" It's most revealing about what's really at stake in this dispute.\n\n \n No problem. I have shown you where my authority comes from. And you are totally allowed to reject that authority as a free will agent who was created in Gods image. Just remember that your rejection of God and the authority He makes available to us, His children, will have no bearing on you being held responsible for rejecting that power by Him on the day of reckoning. It's our responsibility to seek Gods truth in life, He will never force Himself on us.\n \n \nThis is getting a bit broad of the topic. If you're interested in continuing the discussion -- I confess I'm not sure there's much point -- maybe we should move it to another section. Your call.\n\n \n Whatever; I doubt your heart is open to a deeper proof than your natural man can see. So take this for what you think it's worth. I thought it necessary to correct your misconceptions of my position though. So I'm satisfied if you are. Just remember this Matthew, neither I nor any man can save anyones soul. \n \n Only God can change ones heart. So each man must humble Himself before God in sincere prayer and trust Him to reveal Himself to him personally. That is the key to salvation. Never trust any man, but only God through Christ who is able to wash away all sins and give new life. Salvation is a personal journey, just as being born and dying is. That's where the proof of what I'm saying is found. With God Himself, not man. I promise you this though; If you grope out into the darkness of this world seeking His absolute and unconditional truth, God will find you.",

Telling them that they are wrong in their make-up and that they need to perpetually beg forgiveness for just being is abusive (this goes for all of us apparently - we are so awful that we should just be grateful that God loves us at all - sounds like sh_t parent to me). Expecting that they live a life of celibacy (or a LIE) is cruel. Falsely accusing them of hurting society, marriage or children is prejudice. The whole thing is truly ugly. If it is what your God expects than I am clearly more moral than he. I will not embrace a God like that.

Because the bible itself say's it's Gods inspired word so nothing Matthew or anyone else say's which conflicts with that truth means a hill of beans to God, nor does it validate their rejection of His word as the \"Word of God.\" In Gods sight, and His opinion will be all that matters, to deny Gods word as false is to call God a liar.\n \n Just imagine saying to the God of all creation once you're standing before Him; Uh, I didn't believe the bible was your word Lord, that's why I rejected it. You know what He'll say in response to that? You should have asked me because I was here all along, through every step of your life I was there and available to you. And then He will point out a hundred, or maybe a thousand times where God placed people and situations before you in order to get your attention. The only difference between us smiley is I responded finally, one of those times He reached out to me.\n \n So don't ever say I believe that Christians are special or any more deserving than unbelievers are. the only difference between us is that we responded to God while alleged christians like Matthew like to claim their christian heritage as they deny everything Gods word say's that doesn't fit with his personal perspective of right and wrong.",

Maybe you should study up on what separates a true follower from a false follower of Christ. \n Discernment of True and False Prophets/Teachers/Preachers/Churches\n G. A true prophet rightly divides the Word of God. \n Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth. But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness. ~ 2 Timothy 2:15-16\n \n A false prophet shares opinions and distorts Scripture. \n As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest1, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. ~ 2 Peter 3:16 \n \n K. A true prophet is socially unacceptable to the proud and does not conform to people's expectations. \n For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence. ~ 1 Corinthians 1:26-29 \n \n A false prophet is socially acceptable and conforms to people's expectations. \n For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. ~ 2 Timothy 4:3-4 \n \n L. True prophets are generally disliked. \n Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. ~ Matthew 5:12 \n Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. ~ James 5:10 \n \n False prophets are generally liked. \n Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets. ~ Luke 6:26 \n Myspace.com Blogs - Discernment of True and False Prophets/Teachers/Preachers/Churches - ? Timothy ? MySpace Blog\n \n \nJust out of curiosity, is there anything that you believe God's word says that fails to fit your personal perspective of right and wrong?... Somehow I imagine the two are basically coextensive.\n \n So how do we differ on that score?...\n\n \n According to the cultural mores of this generation, yes, but I understand that according to the time, the culture and the Old Testament Law, what He did was right and not to be questioned by me because He is God. So even though it conflicts with what is acceptable today, it was justifiable back then based on what these pagan societies represented as enemies and neighboring countries who sought to influence the moral stability of Israel, the people God was leading and protecting at the time. \n \n So, unlike you, I understand that it isn't necessary for God to have acted according to my modern sensibilities in order for me to respect what History records were decisions He made regarding His protection of Israel at that time. In other words Matthew, it isn't necessary for Gods actions to fit my personal perspective of right and wrong in order for me to respect and honor His authority over us in all areas of life. I know better than to judge our perfect and holy God who as the author of life is perfectly able to do the righteous and holy thing, no matter how difficult it is for us to understand at the time.",

My point is that arriving at that conclusion cannot be reached by just pointing to the text and saying \"Read!\" In order to understand a book as complicated as the Bible, you have to really interpret the text. The meaning is often not clear, and it doesn't become clearer just via repetition of the act of reading.\n \n \nBut for some reason, you are blind to that aspect as you insist that I not refer to you as an alleged christian.\n\n \n I am not blind to \"that aspect.\" It isn't there.

Ironically, you seem completely blind to this aspect.\n \n \nAnd it doesn't even bother you that all of the atheists embrace your interpretation of the bible when you know they hate what it represents when accurately quoted.\n\n \n It doesn't bother me that they interpret the Bible non-literally.

And despite the fact that I've raised the issue several times, you haven't addressed it even once. So I don't think you're presenting me with any reason whatsoever to change my mind.\n \n \n...and I make no apologies for pointing that out to you.\n\n \n Of course you don't. That would require more humility than a self-styled prophet has got.\n \n \nMaybe you should study up on what separates a true follower from a false follower of Christ.\n\n \n Maybe you should study up on how to evangelize more effectively. I think your conduct on this board -- as with conservative Christian conduct generally -- helps to turn non-Christians away from the Church.\n \n (And please note: I did not there deny your relationship with Christ, I merely criticized your mode of evangelism.)\n \n \n[Note: Rearrangement of order of text for topical purposes]So, unlike you, I understand that it isn't necessary for God to have acted according to my modern sensibilities in order for me to respect what History records were decisions He made regarding His protection of Israel at that time.\n\n \n So are there areas where you believe God's actions don't line up with your sensibilities? Seriously? Somehow, I just can't buy that.\n \n \n...what He did was right and not to be questioned by me because He is God. ... I know better than to judge our perfect and holy God who as the author of life is perfectly able to do the righteous and holy thing, no matter how difficult it is for us to understand at the time.\n\n \n Do you understand how this \"it's right, no questioning allowed\" attitude is the very essence of authoritarian thinking?\n \n I'm not presuming to judge God. But a little questioning is nothing to be afraid of, as Jesus himself makes plain in Gethsemane or in crying out on the cross (and I somehow doubt that God is too afraid of it). I am saying that when people start demanding that God not be questioned, they are invariably demanding that their interpretation of God not be questioned: The rest of us are just supposed to disregard our personal relationships with God and accept their authority. (I note again that \"authority\" is a much-used word by you.)\n \n So again, while I don't question your personal relationship with the lord, please note that I have a good reason for thinking that literalists in general, and especially you in particular, are very authoritarian. God didn't give us the capacity of natural reason just so we could ignore it and follow unintelligible divine orders or arbitrary human ones.",

   "Not when it's gay rights people who picked the fight this thread is referring to.\n\n Yeeaaahhhh....\n So when a religious person throws out insulting comments at gays, it's the gays who RESPOND to the preacher's comments who are \"picking the fight\"...\n Once again, the lack of acknowledgment of reality is underwhelming.\n \n \n \nWell, the sky didn't fall after all when Warren took the podium. Whadya know ... \n\n Considering nobody said the sky would fall, that consequence seems entirely expected by both sides...\n \n \n \nNary a word about gay rights, and once again the mis-characterization that gets put out there of these pastors being awful evil and dastardly gay-fixated people proves wrong.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n Jyoshu, the things Warren said that prompted people objecting to his participation ARE REAL.\n The fact that he didn't use that opportunity to further an anti-gay position does not mean anything. I think people on both the pro-gay and anti-gay side of the aisles would agree that using the invocation as a platform for such a political feint would have been inappropriate.\n \n What you just did is equivalent to saying \"Look. O.J. didn't kill anybody today. That must mean he's not a killer...\"\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nI seriously wonder if the knowing that truth usually ends up winning out in these cases is exactly WHY some didn't want Warren to give that invocation. Anyway, nobody got their excuse to pastor-bash! :p\n\n Yeah. You would \"wonder\" that, wouldn't you...\n When nobody has given you a reason for that, and I would be surprised if any on the anti-gay side expected to use THAT spot to advance an anti-gay agenda...\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n The \"truth\" involves a big picture, Jyoshu.\n Not some brief invocation that didn't even broach the issue at all.\n What you just did is like saying \"Well, there were no bears in Haines today, so I guess Alaska doesn't have any bears...\" emoticon_xdonno",
