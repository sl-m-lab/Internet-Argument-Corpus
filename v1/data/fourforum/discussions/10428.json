   "A couple of nights ago, I happened to watch a TV program called 'Deal or No Deal?' For those unfamiliar with the format, the contestant has a box within which one of twenty-two cash prizes are concealed, from 1p to &#163;250,000. The other prizes are sealed inside other numbered boxes, and in each round the contestant must pick three to be opened (thus narrowing down the possibilities for what their box contains). Based on the numbers revealed, an invisible 'banker' will then offer to buy 'their' box from them. Deal, or no deal? The aim of the game is to either deal at the right time, when the offer peaks, or to hold out and see what's in your box.\n \n I'd seen the program several times, but the most recent episode was a particularly entertaining one: a dreadful start with most of the high value prizes being revealed, leading to risible offers from the banker, then a nailbiting finish where only &#163;15,000 and &#163;100,000 were left. An offer of &#163;44,000 was put on the table, and to everyone's horror and amazement she didn't deal - then she swapped her box for the other one, and won &#163;100,000. It was real edge-of-your seat stuff.\n \n What really struck me was just how compelling it can be to watch someone vie with blind chance, and to see all the little superstitions that come into play in an attempt to gain the upper hand.

We flirt with it when we gamble, we take steps to mitigate it when we insure our lives or our property, when we drive sedately, when we vaccinate our children.\n \n Even if we are not unique in appreciating the concept of chance - of there being things beyond our control - we are surely unique in our ages-long conscious struggle to push back that boundary, to bring what was beyond our control, within it. We take wild animals and domesticate them, domesticate crops, fire, electricity, nuclear fission. If there is one thing that uniquely defines the human race's strategy for survival, it is to bring things under our control. Other creatures cooperate, other creatures behave altruistically, but no other creature strives for dominion.\n \n Gambling itself is an explicit psychological taming of chance: it's the electricity that comes out of a socket, the fire that comes when you strike a match or light a stove. It's chance that we can play with and then put back in the cupboard when we're done. It's chance we permit ourselves to be governed by, telling ourselves we're still ultimately in control because we're participating voluntarily. But even then, we're not fully comfortable with allowing it into our lives. We have lucky numbers we pick, lucky charms we squeeze. Deep down, we know chance is the enemy.\n \n And I believe that knowledge drives two kinds of behaviour: scientific and religious. Science concerns itself with determining the precise limits of our actual domain, and making real, verifiable steps towards expanding it. Religion, all religion, is ultimately the pretence that everything is already under our control - or at least, under the control of someone or something to whom we can appeal, someone who will hear our voices and act on our behalf. And if he doesn't act and the tornado hits your house anyway, it was at least meant to be; it wasn't just chance. All the other trappings of religion - the clothes you have to wear, the food you have to avoid, the bits you have to cut off - they're just god's phone number. As a species with a social hierarchy, we'd be suspicious if the head honcho did things for us without us having to jump through hoops.

Talk about making god in our own image!\n \n How often have you said or heard some variant of \"Science may look for answers, but the bible already has them all\", or \"You have all those books, but I only need one\"? To the deeply religious, scientific thinking can be hard to stomach because it represents such a vertiginous loss of certainty, such a huge abdication of the illusion of control and influence. To the scientist, religious thinking can be equally hard to stomach because of the mysteries she knows would in truth be left unsolved; the potential dangers or opportunities that we would miss by pretending we already know everything we need to.\n \n Given all this, it should come as no surprise that evolution is perceived by the religious to be the ultimate outrage. And what is the epithet spat most often by every creationist detractor of the theory?

Chance. \"Evolution says everything happened by chance.\" You can almost hear the rage fizzing between the lines: \"How dare scientists credit chance, the ancient, faceless enemy we put out of sight and mind by choosing to believe in god, with having any hand in our own existence?\" A more bitter pill I cannot imagine having to swallow.\n \n I believe that, but for the role chance necessarily plays in evolutionary theory, it would go as little remarked in religious circles as gravity or fluid dynamics.

   "Initially, I'd hazard a guess that both stem out of mankinds inate curiosity.\n Some take the route of science and cautious approach to achieve their ends, others, for what ever plausible or implausible reasons take an unprepared chance.\n \n As for the contest, the people are picked for many reasons, including psychological. They know that what ever they chose is better than the nothing they already have. They also are there for other reasons than the money, such as the excitement and entertainment. Some also don't have good skills and most people also don't think straight when put 'on the spot'. \n \n I pride myself on adaptability and the ability to plot on the Byzantine level but, I do know that when presented with something I really want or a 'good deal', I'll jump on it.\n \n Humanity seems to be at war with Chaos. Everything we strive for is order. The Christian God for example isn't about evil or love or good...it's about order. Law vs the Chaos. A system we can work in and, yes, control vs something that's random and unpredictable and whimsical.\n Some societies are more into this than others. Some, Russia comes to mind, have a fatalistic attitude and acceptance of the whim of life.\n \n I'd say the best you can do is ride the wave and know that, eventually, it'll hit a brick wall somewhere. \n \n Meh, I'm at work...rambling.\n \n But, I'm reminded of an old Sci-Fi show called Space: Above and Beyond.\n In it, androids under human control were hacked with a program \"Take a Chance.\"\n 'Interesting Times' ensued.",

Thanks for reading!\nYou've covered quite a bit of ground here.\n \n I've seen the \"Deal or No Deal\" program too many times already. (we use Howie Mandel as host and the top prize is $1,000,000.) The draw for the audience is I think not the chance game but the curiosity game. The viewing audience has no chance of winning...it just wants to know what the results of the contestant's playing with chance will be...just as they want to know who gets voted off the island or who wins the Dancing with the Stars variety show or who gets fired by Donald Trump. The producers and phone service providers see a potential for pure profit in their ruse to dupe millions of people into text messaging their votes (\"vote as many times as you like\") on the various possible winners.\n \n I find it more pleasurable to limit my TV viewing to weather forecasts, documentaries, nature and science programs.\n \n \n \n As a former duck hunter, I knew my chances of bringing home bragging rights would be greater if I stationed myself at a location known to be frequented by ducks rather than at the local barber shop. Though I doubt any animals attach a similar thought to their own food hunting behaviors, the Arctic Fox apparently knows its chances of finding food will be greater if it follows a safe distance behind a Polar Bear. While the fox is not likely reasoning that his chances are better, somehow he knows to hang with the bear.\n \n The conflict between religious pontification and scientific discoveries was responsible for Galileo being stiffled during his most valuable lifespan. Since man is likely the only animal that has ever wondered where he came from, he is understandably the only animal to ever try to figure it out. It is unfortunate that we were so impatient to know the answers that we made some up in order to bridge the chasm of mysteries surrounding what actually happened. We had no idea what billions of years meant when we formulated the Divine Answers. Some of us cannot fathom that concept yet....and because we still have no tolerance for blasphemy, we insist that the Divine Answers are all we need. This is merely the church's method of maintaining the mystique surrounding our existence and controlling people through fear of the unknown.\n \n Chances are...when you wear a silly grin...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ...people will accuse you of having an illegal smile.:)",

It neither rejects evolution NOR attributes to chance. So there's no bitterness to the pill for me. For someone who believes in God, and that evolution is real, then it can be the only possible explanation. It's really little different than any time a religious person attributes a natural process or phenomenon to God. Religious people do this all the time with many issues; the reason it's taken longer for evolution to become one of those issues is that there was (and still is) an organised effort to oppose it. The fundamentalist mentality that existed in the Scopes Monkey Trial has never gone away completely. And for religious people, the problem isn't just between evolution and 6-day-creation; it also causes an 'interior' conflict between literalists and non-literalists over scripture.\n \n Anyway, yours was a thought-provoking post.",
