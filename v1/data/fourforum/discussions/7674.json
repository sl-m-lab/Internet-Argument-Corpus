If I shoot an electron at a target I can't just draw a line and say that the electron in somewhere on that line. The best we can do is say what the probability is that it's somewhere. This isn't just a matter of us not having good enough testing equipment. The electron is, for all purposes, a probability wave, distributed over space. Until we actually do something that would confirm or deny that it's in a particular spot, it isn't really anywhere specific. For macroscopic objects that probabilities are such that the odds of you being where it looks like you are are 99.(lots of 9s)%, so I'm not sure if the cat is meant to be an illustration or if it's actually supposed to be both dead and alive until its probability wave is collapsed.",

That contradiction doesn't seem to be entirely disposed of by saying that one state is more likely than the other at a given moment. \n \n Is anyone confident that a description of aspects of the quantum world can avoid this sort of affront to logic?\n\n \n What QM tells us is that logic, or at least common sense, is in fact wrong. We're used to thinking that some things are either in state A or in state B. My pen is either here, or it's over there, but it can't be both. QM says that my pen is actually in both places at the same time, as a probablility wave. QM doesn't avoid this apparent contradiction, it tells us that our perception of how things work is wrong. For macroscopic objects the odds of it being in one state vastly overwhelms the odds of it being in any other state, so we have no really intuitive grasp of probability waves; we never experience them first hand. It's only in the quantum world that this effect becomes apparent. The cat experiment is an attempt to relate an macroscopic event, a cat being alive or not, with a quantum event. Since the only way to describe the radioacitve decay is in terms of a probablity wave, and the cat lives or dies based on the decay, then the state of the cat is described by the same wave.\n \n I'm not sure how literally the experiment is meant to be taken. A clearer example, to my mind, would be to put a cat in a closed box and state that you can say that cat is in the box until you look; that the cat exists as a probablity wave spread over the universe until such time as the wave is collapsed.

Essentially, the problem of observation comes back to the difficulty of understanding that particles literally exist as probabilistic waves until we measure them. They do not have an objective existence. No one knows why this is the case any more than we know why gravity exists. \n \n Remember science doesn't ask why?, it asks how? and what?. I'm not trying to be patronising; it's easy to forget this when learning about the strange quantum world. All our results in classical physics make intuitive sense because they deal with the world we perceive. Classical theory makes sense because it describes accurately phenomena we already know about. Quantum theory describes things that we can never see, that we didn't even know existed until the 20th century.\n \n So asking \"How can the observer have any effect on the objective reality of what he observes ?\" is doomed to failure, all we know is that it does. The two-slit experiment proves it conclusively: When we position a detector at one of the slits, there is no interference pattern because the particle is 'forced to choose' a path; when there is no detector, or the detector is switched off, an interference pattern is produced because the particle goes through both slits at once and interferes with itself. There's no way around it. \n \n It gets even weirder: if the detector is precisely timed to switch on and perform a measurement after the particle has gone through the slits, we still find that the interference pattern disappears, so the particle has suddenly 'decided' to behave not like a spread-out wave, but a particle that has only gone through one of the slits. \n \n With your electron-in-a-box example, you can either say that the electron exists as a wavefunction that occupies both halves of the box until you check; or you can say that the electron has no objective reality until you check. It comes to the same thing. It is a paradoxical problem that we can never actually observe a wavefunction, because of course the act of observation collapses the wave function. But we can infer its reality through the different results given by the two-slits experiment, and I'm sure a knowledgeable physicist would be able to think up an experiment that prove it in the electron-in-a-box scenario. If it weren't for the strange results of quantum experiments like these, it would be possible to leave it to philosophy, but in fact we find that actual reality doesn't make any sense.\n \n We have to accept the results even though we can't conceptualise the reality of what's going on in the experiment. As for being \"utterly bizarre, even mad\", nobody disagrees. Jim Al-Khalili, Fellow of the UK Institute of Physics and author of Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed, has this to say (page 18) about the two slits experiment:\n \n \n Crazy, isn't it?\n",
