   "These responses are trite and cliched.\n \n Think of Jesus.\n \n Think of the children.\n \n Guns on airplanes (hint: the absence of guns on airplanes did not prevent 9/11 - guns on planes might have stopped it, but it was against the law for airlines to provide this kind of security).\n \n Drunk drivers \"use their cars to kill people\".\n \n You're selfish if you aren't willing to force everyone else to give up their weapons through the police state apparatus.\n \n Let's look at gun prohibition's impact on gun-deaths, not at gun prohibition's impact on total deaths, because deaths that occur from weapons other than guns don't matter - only gun deaths are evil.\n \n Those who fear the federal government are dangerous and paranoid - the government is your friend! Let's use the federal government against these people.\n \n We even have some pro-\"assault weapons ban\" XXXX, because the cosmetic appearances of firearms are important criteria to ban them on.\n \n \nGuns don't kill people, people kill people!\n No, people with easily-accessible guns kill people.\n\n \n Which is why murder rates in nations with highly restrictive gun laws are near 0.\n \n These replies are brief ignorant snippets from someone too focused on \"gun evils\" to look at the bigger picture.",

   "Well, the blog article referenced is a very good example of the argument technique I have commented on before, where one side tries to discredit the other by creating an extremist stereotype of the opposition to paint the opposition's arguments as extremist. The author of the blog will not acknowledge that people on my side of the debate search for a middle ground. Instead, he paints us all as Rambo wannabees running around in full camo claiming the sky is falling. The author of the article wants to tell the audience of \"ordinary Americans\" that \"I'm like you. But these gun rights guys are not like us. They are extremists who must be feared.\" (my quotes there, his follow) Instead of exploring whether common ground could exist with a gun rights supporter, he decides to dismiss us all as \"selfish\" people who use \"scare tactics,\" who \"demonize\" the opposition, who are \"unreasonable,\" who actively \"promote\" the possession of firearms by felons and young children. We gun rights supporters are \"dangerous,\" \"paranoid\" men who support \"morally bankrupt\" policies by actively promoting \"conspiracy theories.\" We are no different than McVeigh or Koresh. And in fact we have their blood on our hands. We are responsible for the \"hateful consequences\" of Oklahoma City and Waco. This is so because we march in lock step with \"mercenary\" leaders who have a hidden \"dark side.\" Our gun rights organization has been hijacked and \"unduly influenced\" by \"extreme right wing people.\" We promote \"ridiculous, extremist views.\" We are not like \"ordinary Americans.\" Instead, we must be exposed for the fanatics we are. The author of the blog will not acknowledge that we are even individual people with differing opinions. Instead we are but small parts of the dehumanized, evil \"gun lobby.\" It is little wonder that he later decides to judge my spiritual standing too. I see problems with every \"clich\u00e9\" cite and refutation he makes, but I'm not going to go through them all today. I'll take them one at a time later if need be. \n \n Regarding the portion of the blog cited here, let me say this:\n \n He says \"we need to protect ourselves from those who say they need weapons to protect themselves from a tyrannical federal government!\" Would the dead lying in the killing fields of Cambodia agree? Would the victims of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans agree? Ah, he may say, these are different countries and we are different, but he can't have it both ways. He argues that examples of other nation's gun control laws cannot be discounted by the NRA lobby. \"What's so different?\" he asks about these other countries. What is different indeed? Have we in America evolved beyond petty lusts for power over our fellow man? Is his faith in the fidelity of those who would rule us at present, and in the fidelity of those unknown rulers of the future misplaced? \n \n He chooses to place a large amount of faith in the belief that our public servants will not abuse their trust absent constitutional guarantees: \"But to protect our security we recognize the need to make certain sacrifices to maintain our security.\" It sounds almost like he is quoting Bush or Ashcroft here. This is the same argument some use to eat away at other liberties, like the right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. Would he permit this argument to justify warrantless searches of homes without probable cause to fight terrorism, or does the logic change when the right which is assaulted is one he might hold dear?\n \n \"Such as not carrying guns on airplanes.\" I can agree with this one, because I believe the government has a compelling interest in preventing terrorists from having handguns on planes. But where does our blog author stand on pilots being armed? Would he dispute my stated belief that if the 9/11 pilots had been armed then we would have had 19 deaths instead of thousands?\n \n \"We have the easiest access to guns and the weakest gun laws. To argue that there's no connection between this and the gun death rate is irresponsible and reflects an major, illogical form of denial....\" I have dealt with this \"more guns = more deaths\" argument before. Statistics do not bear out this assumption. We have a violence problem in America. I am involved with this problem nearly every day, and I tell you the presence of a firearm never gives rise to the motive to use it for criminal ends. I would be willing to talk with the blog's author about specific laws designed to address our violence problem if he has any to offer.\n \n \"Looked at another way--only a fraction of cars are used by drunk drivers to kill others, but that doesn't take away the need to register cars or the need to set up checks to catch drunk drivers. It may be a hassle to the rest of us, but good, decent, law abiding people are willing to live with it because it helps society rid itself of drunk drivers....\" To deal with this argument we first have to decide whether we believe we have a recognized RKBA, because whether it is a right or not impacts what regulations we can have on it. The blog's author first argues (in another passage on the blog) that the right is individual but not absolute and subject to some limitation, then in the next paragraph he claims that it is not an individual right and he cites without quoting from (or giving any indication he has ever read) U.S. v. Miller. \n \n However, let me sidestep this issue and address it this way. Unlike guns, I do not hear anyone from the NTSB claiming we need to ban cars. Many people on the gun rights side of the debate fear registration because it has traditionally been used as a pretext for confiscation. So I'll make the blog author a deal: If his side of the debate will agree that I have an individual RKBA, that confiscation would violate this right, and that they will never seek to confiscate my firearms, then I'll agree that the benefits of registration outweigh the potential harm. But I also want him to tell me how to address the difficulties in enforcing a registration scheme, because no one has ever provided me with any specifics in that regard.\n \n Now let me turn to his use of religion. Religion is an interesting method of attack, yet in my opinion the blog's author oversteps is case. It is apparent that his view of religion is the only authorized view, and that if I diverge from it by desiring to own a firearm then I have broken with the true faith by being \"selfish.\" Now the blog's author has never met me. He knows nothing about me, and I know little about him. I find it uncomfortable for him to claim that he possesses a window through which he may to look into my soul and accurately judge the morality of my beliefs. Yet, his confidence in his ability to judge the very personal issue of my spiritual standing with my God demonstrates why he believes it is such a small matter for him to be capable of judging me unfit and unreliable enough to own a firearm. In making both arguments he assumes the posture of being wiser, more trustworthy, and more Godly than me. Perhaps the hawk does soar by his wisdom, but I will choose to find my own path to my God. I believe that path is easier to follow when my government is prevented from interfering with it. To ensure this I also choose to demand that my government respect all of my liberties and not just those that our blog author favors.\n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).",

   "We have the easiest access to guns and the weakest gun laws.\n\n \n Interesting point of view. Let's see here...\n \n No gun laws = bazillions of gun crimes \n Easy gun laws = bazillions of gun crimes\n HARD gun laws = ????\n \n Let me ask you something. Why do we have gun laws? Most gun laws say something along the lines of:\n \n \"Private, LAW ABIDING citizens may own this type of gun and not that kind of gun.\"\n \n \"Private, LAW ABIDING citizens may not carry loaded firearms unless...\"\n \n \"Private, LAW ABIDING citizens can only use guns for self defence when the following criteria is met...\"\n \n So we have gun laws that control what LAW ABIDING citizens can and cannot do with guns.\n \n So what about the LAW BREAKING citizen who has total disregard for the law?\n \n The LAW ABIDING citizen does what is right. He keeps the law.\n \n The LAW BREAKING citizen doesn't care what is right. He breaks the law.\n \n So if gun laws get harder and more extreme, what do you think is going to happen to the LAW BREAKING citizen? \n \n Not much - until the LAW BREAKING citizen gets caught - in other words - the LAW BREAKING citizen is out to commit a crime. If that means the LAW BREAKING citizen is going to carry a loaded, concealed weapon, with a high capacity magazine in a federal office and shoot the place up - he's going to do so. \n \n Did the law actually prevent the LAW BREAKING citizen from doing so? NO. He's a law breaker - that's why.\n \n Did the law deter the LAW BREAKING citizen from aquiring the gun? No - he most likely stole it or purchased it underground - once again - total disregard for the law.\n \n Did the fact that high capacity magazines are still illegal in some states (ie California) deter the LAW BREAKING citizen from using one? No - he's a law breaker and doesn't care.\n \n Did the fact that the LAW BREAKING citizen carried a concealed the weapon and took it into a federal building make any difference? No - he's a law breaker.\n \n So what about the LAW ABIDING citizen who would like to own a high capacity magazine? If he is not committing any crimes - why should he be penalized because someone else committed a crime in the past?\n \n What about the LAW ABIDING citizen who would like to carry a concealed weapon for personal protection (think, late night, ATM/7-Eleven soda and chip runs for that late night movie)? If he is not committing any crimes - why should he be penalized because someone else committed a crime in the past?\n \n No, most gun laws don't protect society, they don't help the LAW ABIDING gun owner and they sure as heck don't deter the LAW BREAKER!\n \n Oh - take the guns off the street so no one has a gun? - yeah - that will work (insert sarcasm here) - drugs are illegal - but they are still being bought and sold on street corners, back alleys, and out of the trunk of your neighbor's \n car.\n \n No, making guns go away won't work either. People who are determined to commit a crime, violent or otherwise are going to do so regardless of the laws.\n \n I do agree that the law should provide stiff penalties for those who commit such crimes as murder, rape, child abuse, etc. Even theft.\n \n But owning a high capacity magazine? Carrying a concealed weapon for protection? That's a bit absurd if you ask me.\n \n And not to mention the restrictions on the types of guns a person can own - I think it's a matter of training and responsibility - I do believe gun owners should be required to pass both a written test for the particular gun(s) they plan on owning/using, a handling test for the particular gun(s) they plan on owning/using, and a basic range/target (qualify) test for the particular gun(s) they plan on owning/using. I personally wouldn't want to see someone behind the wheel of an vehicle who doesn't know what their doing. I think guns should be treated with the same kind of respect (if not more).\n \n No, more laws banning certains types of guns, accessories to guns, etc. While I agree that owning a bazooka is overkill (for me), but if I'm a collector, then why not so long as I can PROVE adequate knowledge and skill and have maintained a clean background (ie no criminal record)?\n \n We need more laws enforcing proper knowledge and training in the use of firearms. \n \n As a LAW ABIDING citizen of the United States, I should be able to carry a weapon, exposed or concealed, loaded, cocked and locked, at the ready, throughout the nation with the same laws state to state, so long as I can prove that I do not have a criminal past, especially with regards to weapons and prove that I have the capacity to knowledgably and properly operate the firearm of my choice in theory and in practice whether it's for hunting, sport, or personal self defence. This also means that I must accept any and all responsibility from my actions pertaining to accidents, neglegence, or pre-meditation.\n \n I do believe LAW ABIDING citizens need to share in the responsibilities of owning a firearm.\n \n But I also believe that government should focus more on punishing those who misuse firearms for criminal activities without posing undue \"blanket\" restrictions that also affect the LAW ABIDING citizen.\n \n Just my two cents worth.",
