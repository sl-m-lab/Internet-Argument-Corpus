Could be that we're just a bunch of friendly people that like to swap views regardless of how inane and insipid some of the opinions seem to us. I try for a tone that is friendly and not cruel, since I feel nature has been cruel enough to some posters. I am constantly amazed at how intelligent and astute the posters that agree with me are, and I suspect that some of those that disagree with me are former brain donors. I enjoy and appreciate the art of the insult and I have been zapped by some experts in my time. Although I have mellowed over time like good whiskey, I still have a propensity to pi*s people off. So, in advance for future affronts some may take, I mean nothing personal and I might even like you, which could indicate something about my tastes.\n Dono",
