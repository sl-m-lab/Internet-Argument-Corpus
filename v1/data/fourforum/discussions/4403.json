Moreover, by your logic, if sheer numbers actually have any meaning, then you should be a Roman Catholic, since they are more numerous than all of the other sects of christians put together. I think that there are more Muslims than any single Christian sect, but of course there are at least two different sects of Islam (Shiites and Sunni), maybe more. Moreover, the numbers of Muslims is growing worldwide while the numbers of Christians is declining. Atheists and non-religious actually make up about 15.2% or 19% of the population of the earth, depending on which chart you read.\n \n And you, jyoshu, are free to believe what you will.

I'll find a similar book laying around somewhere that says how he was joking with those 10 commandment thingys and how the stories were his fictional writing, his hobby. Anyway, that would have no credibility with Christians or other religions and I would have to find different holy books, but if I found a book and that convinced me of Christianity I'm sure many Christians would say it was God's work and I was saved.

Not to mention that other culture's histories are not solely based on religion. Much of the South American history pre-invasion that we know of today is not religious based. We know their economy, military and state organization outside of religious sources. As for babylonian and other ancient cultures, the same applies.

Words have meaning, it's only for religious or other deceptive purposes that we would act as if nothing has a definition.\n \n \n \nOut of religion, of course.

Let people believe what they want instead of being intentionally insulting to them as you are here.\n\n \n \n I am not being intentionally mean, and you cannot verify my intentions, do not misreprent me on the forum.\n You further misrepresent me when you say \"you don't like religious people\", I have never said that, and it's insulting.\n \n That's against forum rules, don't both misrepresent me, and insult me, in the same sentence. Stick to the topics and don't discuss me personally.\n \n Nothing in life is not measurable, by definition. Your transgression of forum rules IS measurable, I suggest you shape up and try \"debate\", on the, you guessed it, \"debate forum\".\n \n -Mach",

If existinence implies testable, and there is no evidence of a testable god, then the claim cannot be submitted as \"true\", since it cannot be verified. It's therefore false.

How could we make this rational determination unless we observed something? Would we be correct, or is it relative?\n \n You find that after working with children at your job, you no longer feel anger and no longer raise your voice around children. You find you actually enjoy the interaction. You decide, rationally, based on the evidence of your experience, that you seem to have developed more patience..that is, a higher tolerance for interaction with children. But how could this be? There is no \"evidence\"? Of course there is, to suggest otherwise seems to miss the definition.\n \n Likewise, you may be able to tolerate 10 minutes and feel you are indeed \"patient\". Yet another, someone who spend 10 hours with the same stimulus, might claim THEY are patient, and you, based on the evidence, are not. How can such a person do this without observation of some kind? (Hint: they could not).\n \n An analogy would be this:\n \n You claim you experienced a whoozile.\n You claim it is a real \"feeling\".\n \n Now, you felt it, which means you \"observed\" this sensation. You \"experienced\" it. That's evidence. To suggest you could experience something, yet not experience it, is of course contradictory, which is ultimately what you're supporting.

(well, science sorta proposes that based on the evidence.) this point of highly concentrated energy is proposed to be orginated by the collision of the dimensional \"branes\" of other existing universes.\n \n is there any point where God did any creating in this sequence?\n \nVampire - A reanimated corpse that is believed to rise from the grave at night to suck the blood of sleeping people.\n \n For the purpose of this forum we can assume that the vampire does indeed rise from thee grave at night to suck the blood of sleeping people and the people's beliefs are right if they exist. Note that this isn't every night.\n\n i'll also take into consideration that vampires can morph into bats at night (or whenever they feel like it)\n \n any corpse rising out of a grave repeatedly, and returning to it afterwards, will leave evidence, mainly the disturbed dirt (plus the problem of burying itself back). then theres the problem of the victims that lose their blood after a vampire takes his meal. the victim would either die in their sleep due to a loss of blood, or awake the next day with the pain of being bitten. this again is evidence that would exist if vampires existed. \n \n i believe that part of the definition includes that if a person dies as a result of a vampire attack, they too will become a vampire. lets say that in order to continue its existence, a vampire must drink the blood of at least one person a week. and lets say that 1 in 10 people dies as a result. starting with 1 vampire, at the end of 10 weeks we have 2, and another 10 weeks that number doubles. in 3 years (approx 150 weeks) there would be over 32000 vampires. in 4 years (200 weeks) there would be over 1 million vampires. i dont think i need to go further \n \n things like vampires that we can define in physical and logical terms will undoubtedly provide physical and logical evidence for their existence or non-existence",

   "Now, you felt it, which means you \"observed\" this sensation. You \"experienced\" it. That's evidence. To suggest you could experience something, yet not experience it, is of course contradictory, which is ultimately what you're supporting.

   "Well Zac, it's sort of like eating something that you assume you will find distasteful beforehand . . . . don't knock it if you're unwilling to try it. You're basically the 4% (athiests) accusing the other 96% (religious) of the world's population of having ideas with no credibility. You are within your right to believe what you want, but please be tolerant of most others to believe what they want regardless of what you consider to be credible or not.\n\n \n A lot hangs on what you mean by 'tolerant' here. Few atheists, I think, are intolerant of others' beliefs to the extent of wanting to forbid them those beliefs. Is it 'intolerant' to express the view that, for example, religious beliefs are absurd? With respect, 'don't knock it if you're unwilling to try it' is a cop-out in this context: if you are personally unwilling to try, say, virgin sacrifice, are you thereby disqualified from criticising it in others?\n \n I don't know where you got your 96% from, but I won't quibble with it: certainly a far greater proportion of humanity professes some form of religious belief than professes none. It's the sheer diversity of that belief - with every religion's truth claims denying every other's, and the monstrous improbability that just one has got it right - that first made me an atheist.",
