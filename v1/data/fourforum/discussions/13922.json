Every slave-owning civilization in history has had two things in common: they've tried to keep their slaves from owning weapons (besides Gladiators), and they've tried to keep their slaves as ignorant as possible.\n \n The only thing the Egyptians wanted their slaves to know is how to build pyramids. The only thing the Southern Plantation owners wanted their slaves to know is how to pick cotton. The only thing modern Arab countries want their women to know, for the most part, is how to cook and clean. Now there's certain things that Australia doesn't want their citizens to know.",
