Its basic anatomy.\n\n \n At least these fall into the category of \"impractical\" or \"impractical to train\", unlike the more egregious category of \"devastating\" martial arts moves such as \"pressure point strikes that can stop a man's heart\" which are entirely mythical.\n \n \nAll I'm saying is, its probably unsportsmanlike in a sparring match to gouge the opponents eyes out.\n\n \n This is true. But if I put a BJJ fighter in a room against a professional eye gouger, and told them both to gouge each others eyes, I'd guarantee the BJJ guy would be better at doing it. Same with breaking someone's neck or arm or ankle. Similarly a kickboxer could break someone's knees better than a trained knee-stomper. Learning these techniques as a method of fighting just doesn't work unless you're up against someone you badly outmatch in the first place. It just doesn't make sense to me. A mediocre wrestler could bite the ear off a professional ear biter - I just don't get it.\n \n That and not only are these things unsportsmanlike in the ring, they're unsportsmanlike in the real world too - they'll really, really, #### people off. Try and gouge some guy's eyes out and don't be surprised that when you fail, he's going to stomp on your face when you're passed out.\n \n \nPS: My master trains my city's police force.\n\n \n Why would the police want to learn deadly or debilitating moves like stomping someone's knee or gouging their eyes? They have guns don't they? Surely the whole point of going in to take someone down would be to subdue them without creating a law suit and a cripple?\n \n At least can you see the problem with making any real claim about a style which cannot be tested?\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Nakai\n \n This guy got eye gouged, beat the guy, won his next fight and then lost to royce gracie... yes his opponent was successful in causing permanent disfigurement.\n \n The last time someone attempted an eye gouge when he was being ground and pounded I'm aware of, the guy having his eye gouged bit the gouger's finger... I could certainly see it being effective from a dominant position, but then shouldn't you train to get that position, since the process of gouging an eye is fairly intuitive and doesn't really require training?",

I am only a mere white belt in Gracie BJJ (taught by a man named Art [brown belt at the time of my training who was taught by the Gracie family themselves] in Cypress/North Houston, Texas) so I profess no extensive knowledge in the art.\n \n When I was in boarding school, the wrestling coach caught wind of my interest and small amount training in BJJ. He used me to practice sparring with his wrestlers, and since I am allowed to do several moves that are illegal in a wrestling match and use leverage instead of force I could train with all of the weight classes.\n \n I'm not going to say that I won every session, that would be a lie, but his wrestlers were the best in our region and several of them got out of sticky situations rather easily sometimes. After the match, I'd congratulate them and comment about how they looked like they were done for, and they would tell me that anything is better than me trying to break their arm every five seconds.\n \n Oh, how I love rolling arm-bars.",
