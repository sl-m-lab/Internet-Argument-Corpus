   "Good to see it's just a matter of time. The term 'lifestyle' throughout the article is a little bothersome but overall, good news! \n \n \n http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070529/27674_Gay_Tolerance_in_U.S.__Reaching_Record_Marks.htm\n \n Pro-gay rights attitudes have reached high points this year, according to a new poll, with more Americans expressing tolerance.\n \n Today, 57 percent of the American public believes homosexuality should be sanctioned as an acceptable alternative lifestyle - the highest the Gallup Poll has recorded since 1982. Also indicating higher tolerance, 59 percent of Americans believe homosexual relations should be legal.\n \n The Gallup Poll has recorded a general increase over the past 20 years of those who believe homosexual relations should be legal. The statistic reached an all-time high in May 2003 at 60 percent but then fell to 50 percent in July of that year and has remained level through 2005. A June 2003 Supreme Court decision that struck down a Texas law banning homosexual sodomy appeared to have produced a backlash of public opposition to gay rights, the Gallup report noted. The leveled trend began rising again last year with 56 percent saying homosexual relations should be legal and today, the statistic is nearly at the record 60 percent mark.\n \n Revealing a long-term increase in pro-gay rights attitudes, 46 percent (up from 27 percent in 1996) believe same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid with the same rights as traditional marriages. And the percentage of those who say they should not be recognized by the law as valid fell from 68 percent in 1996 to 53 percent today.\n \n On the question of morality, Americans were found to be nearly evenly divided. Since 2001, the percentage of those who say homosexual relations are morally acceptable has increased from 40 percent to 47 percent. And for the first time in the 21st century, less than the majority of Americans say homosexual relations are morally wrong (49 percent). Last year, 51 percent said such relations are morally wrong.\n \n At the same time, the majority of Americans say sex between an unmarried man and woman (59 percent), divorce (65 percent), and having a baby outside or marriage (54 percent) is morally acceptable.\n \n As debates continue over the origin or cause of homosexuality, the Gallup Poll found that an increasing percentage of Americans believe homosexuality is something a person is born with. The poll showed 42 percent express such a view compared to 13 percent in 1977. And the percentage of Americans who believe homosexuality is due to factors such as upbringing and environment fell from 56 percent in 1977 to 35 percent today.\n \n Among those who believe homosexuals are born that way, 78 percent say homosexuality should be considered an acceptable lifestyle. In contrast, among those who believe homosexuality is caused by upbringing or environmental factors, only 30 percent say it should be acceptable.\n \n Gallup's results support other surveys that indicate more open and accepting attitudes among today's young adults. A recent Pew survey found 58 percent of 18-25-year-olds say homosexuality should be accepted.\n \n The Gallup Poll found younger Americans aged 18-34 years old (75 percent) are more likely to express the same view than older Americans aged 55 years and older (45 percent). Women (61 percent) are also more likely than men (53 percent) to say homosexuality should be an acceptable alternative lifestyle, the poll further found. And highly religious Americans who attend church weekly (33 percent) are less likely to say it's an acceptable lifestyle than those who seldom or never attend church (74 percent).\n \n Results from the Gallup Poll are based on telephone interviews with 1,003 adults, aged 18 and older, conducted May 10-13, 2007.",

   "Here's another take on the survey from a different website. This article is trying to show that we are indoctrinating children to accept homosexuals in elementary school. This is so absurd imo. \n \n \n http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007/may/07053003.html\n \n Gallup Poll Shows Highest-Ever Acceptance of Homosexuality in America\n \n By Elizabeth O'Brien and John-Henry Westen\n \n PRINCETON, NJ - May 30, 2007 (LifeSiteNews.com) - American Gallup Poll results, released this morning, indicate that tolerance of homosexuality within the United States has reached a record high. According to the Poll, since 1977 public support of legalization of \"homosexual relations between consenting adults\" has risen from 43% to a record-breaking 59%. \n \n According to Gallup, the general trend is an increased support for homosexuality. Notably, the observed increase in acceptance of homosexuality has occurred concurrent with a nationwide promotion of homosexuality in the American public elementary school system. \n \n LifeSiteNews.com covered a video-clip entitled \"It's Elementary\" that shows a Gay Pride Day event at Cambridge Friends School in MA. Filmed over ten years ago, the clip shows how children of various grade levels are indoctrinated with the belief that homosexuality is an amoral and equally valid alternative lifestyle. Speaking in front of teachers and fellow-class mates, children explained their growing acceptance of homosexuals and the homosexual lifestyle. \n \n In the film, an unidentified African American female teacher asks: \"I don't know what to do about this but, as a school are we saying that kids have to support this? ...If a child comes from a background that says homosexuality is not correct, are we telling that child that they're supposed to, this is what you are supposed to do?\" An unidentified Caucasian female teacher responds, \"I think that we are asking kids to believe this is right. Not as a matter of moral principal, but as a matter of, we're educating them and this is part of what we consider to be a healthy education.\" (see coverage: http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007/apr/07042407.html ).\n \n Further evidence that it is largely changes in the educational system that have brought about the increase in national acceptance of homosexuality is found in the vast disparity of opinion between the old and young. In the Gallup Poll, for example, only 45% of people of over 55 years of age support \"homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle\"; whereas young people from ages 18-34 years old are 75% in favor. \n \n Gallup asks, \"Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriage?\" The answers to this question clearly indicate support of legally valid homosexual-\"marriage\" has steadily risen over the past 11 years (from 27% to 46% in support since 1996). Gallup report author Lydia Saad notes, \"This gay-marriage question follows a number of questions about homosexual rights in Gallup's Values and Beliefs survey. When the same question is asked in other Gallup surveys that do not include such questions, a lower level of support for gay marriage is usually found.\" \n \n In light of Massachusetts permitting homosexual 'marriage', the poll results also give credence to warnings of family advocates who pointed out that the law is a teacher. In a 2005 letter to then-Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, then-Toronto Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic warned against legalizing homosexual marriage. He stated, \"The law is a teacher. Does Canadian society as a whole, and do parents in particular, understand what the law will be teaching in this instance? It will be teaching that homosexual activity and heterosexual activity are morally equivalent. Public schools will be required to provide sex education in that light. Many parents, religious and non-religious, would not agree, nor would many, if not the majority, of Canadians. Is it fair to put children in the position of having to reconcile the values and beliefs of their parents with a novel state-sponsored understanding of marriage that may not be truly supported by the majority of Canadians?\"",

And as for genocide, you want us to pull out so the true mass murderers will be free to commit their genocide unchecked by our troops who are helping the good people of Iraq. But sadly, you are too blind and ignorant to support the liberators and condemn the Terrorists. Real moral of you.\n \n \nThe only ones tearing down values in this country are you and your fellow brand of christians. Just look around at all of the priests molesting children, the huge divorce rate (highest in the Bible belt), the complete denial of science, and I could go on and on - It is due to you and your heterosexist fellows.\n\n \n Please do, because you haven't repeated the same old diatribe a complete thousand times yet. Come back when you have some relavent facts to throw at me because I'm not catholic, everyone gets divorced from all walks of life, we don't deny all types of science, just the fairy tales only XXXXXX cling to, so go on and on if you like because as usual, you're just spewing more dung.\n \n \nFirst off, how is it harmful? Second off, it is your \"God\" that says it is a sin, and you have NO RIGHT to try to impose your \"God's\" homophobic demands on others who do not believe in him or those who do not believe in your particular brand of Christianity.\n\n \n It's harmful because God said it is. He said it's an abomination and I'm sure the day will come when He will clarify his reasoning for you. And this is a debate board so I have every right to state my opinion here. But no where did I make any demands on anyone. It's just that the truth I speak so convicts your spirit and sears your conscience of how wrong the lifestyle is, you feel like I'm insisting that you stop it. But please post where I said anyone must stop any activity for any reason at all if you can.\n \n \nOh, and the only ones practicing indoctrination around here are you and your fellow \"Christians\". Believe me, I was once one of the victims of that indoctrination - luckily I escaped when I got into college and managed to save myself from your religion.\n\n \n No, it's your side that doing the indoctrinating. And your doing it to helpless children like the philosophical cowards that you are would do. And I have a news flash for you, you can't save yourself and get to anywhere worth being. So delude yourself and good luck with your self imposed salvation. I wish you much luck with that. emoticon_xgood",

Note that these are all nouns.\n \n I can disagree with the idea of man moving about in water, i.e., \"swimming\" as a concept. I can't \"disagree\" with you swimming. I can dislike it, be offended by it, object to it, and so on. But the word \"disagree\" is fundamentally misused in such a context--in this case, IMHO, to disguise a visceral and rationally unjustifiable distaste as a \"mere difference of opinion,\" to avoid the appearance of bigotry.\n \n I also find it interesting that the exact same behavior, when performed by two people of the opposite sex (and in much greater numbers) brings no objection, no outraged threads on internet forums, no calls to deny those people full marriage rights.

You can disagree with the theory of gravity, but you can't disagree that it exists. A person on Neptune might \"disgree\" with air, but only in the sense that to him it's theoretical. Once he learns there is really such a thing, his statement becomes nonsensical.\n \n And yes some people say they \"disagree\" with the concept of homosexuality. Jerry Falwell did, in the sense that he didn't believe there is such a thing. He thougt, and explicitly stated, that there is only heterosexuality--anything else is just \"experimentation\" that \"went too far.\" Those of us who are homosexual know, however, as do the overwhelming majority of international behavior and medical scientists, that this is not true. It's an established fact that there is such a thing as a normal if less common homosexual sexual orientation among living things.

   "\n \n I am attacked for delivering a message of redemption for all people that simply must be accepted to be received. \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Part of your problem is that you use the same pitch that every other religious person uses to sell their product. If you were the only religion on the market it would still be hard to buy. But there are countless numbers of religions and they all hold the absolute truth. And I can't believe you preach to homosexuals when there are millions of believers who believe millions of things. We already know we are gay. We already know that what your message is all about, and we also know that it is just as useless to us now then it was the first time we heard it. Maybe you should try to get all the believers to believe the same thing. Once you all get organized and vote on which god is going to be the real one you might fool a few more people.\n What you perceive as being attacked is people defending themselves against your unwarranted and unwelcome and undeserved \"message\". It doesn't matter what you think is your god's truth. When you deliver it is rude, abrasive, and completely out of line.\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n And if the gay community wants to interpret it as a message of hate and condemnation rather than a message of forgiveness and healing, then I can't change that. \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The people you are delivering this message to do not believe they need to be forgiven and/or healed. Anymore then you feel you need to be forgiven or healed for being a heterosexual. What part of that equation do you not understand?\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n But you should all know that by interpreting what a gracious and loving God has done for ALL OF US, as a condemning act, only causes them to condemn themselves and not the God they reject.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n You happen to BELIEVE that a gracious and loving god has done so much for all of us. That is the key factor in this issue. Your belief is just that, it's your belief. Fine for you, but not fine for others, and that's life. \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n I get a real kick out of the mockery I receive for attesting to the fact that, as the unbelievers say it godditit.

And all we must do is receive it.\n\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n What are the odds of you accepting Hindu doctrine? What would you think of a Hindu speaking his message relentlessly and loudly and with no regard for the fact that his audience could care less what he had to say? Or that his audience believed in a different god? Or they were just tired of him trying to make his belief become other peoples reality? You would tune him out, or run away, or try to shut him up, etc. How can you not realize you are no different from the over zealous Hindu? As far as gay people go, they have dealt with that \"message\" of yours their entire lives. And despite it's caustic and dehumanizing content they have managed to rise above it's allgiance to ignorance and intolerance. What gay people have learned in their journey through life is how to find truth in a world of lies. The truth is learned when we can accept our sexuality. When we realize that we cannot change it. And when we realize there is no need to change it. That is the truth, all the rest is bull****! And the reason that gay people reject your message is because it has nothing to do with truth.

According to His moral code it's wrong and harmful and results in spiritual rebellion against Him which the animosity against Him being expressed here is evidence of. If gay sex, like fornication, pedophelia and beastiality weren't harmful to us then God wouldn't have condemned these practices. He isn't a killjoy samiinh, He's a concerned parent who warns His children about the dangers of life just as all concerned parents do when raising their children in this World. Stop blaming God and start seeking to understand His truth and you'll find it's based in unconditional love and our best interest in all areas.\n\n \n *sigh* We've been through this time and again.

   "\n \n Gaetano:\n But your god leaves no other paths for homosexuals to express their sexuality. Homosexuals in a committed monogamous relationship are just as sinful as homosexuals sodomizing 10 differnet partners a day. Homosexuals in your book have two options. One of them is celebacy and the other one is pretending to be a heterosexual. Neither one is acceptable, not from your god, nor on the lip service of any of his followers.\n \n ARCHIE, a bit of friendly advice - work on some simple English comprehension skills, please. NONE of the below addresses the point of the paragragh you are responding to. (I have bolded it for you.) We already know you think your God thinks all sin is bad and that we can be saved. If you care to preach this, fine, do so. However, if you are going to quote someone in your poste you should respond to what they actually said. To do otherwise is rude and makes you look stupid. \n\n \n Jito, may I suggest you do some serious work on your reading comprehension skills because I answered his question in the very first sentence of my response, and posted the # of the post so you can go back and see your original response at #105.

(And remember, I don't disagree with you that people have a sexual orientation anyway. I'm not debating that.)\n\n \n I think that is a poor analogy. In fact, on the issue of abortion there are several parties involved, while I think the decision ultimately lies with the woman, because it is her body. It's a difficult decision for many women, and I think they shouldn't be singled out for social disapproval either (a whole other issue I hope we don't sidetrack on). Why do people feel the need to disagree with gay sexual actions, when it only involves the two parties who have the sexuality and are acting on it? The reality is the people involved do face social disapproval. There are things we should disapprove of for good reasons, but what are the ethics involved in contributing to a social reality where a group of people face more difficulty of any kind for actions which are related to an important part of who they are, and which have no bearing on anyone else's life?\n \n Glibly saying, \"suck it up\" or \"learn to deal with it\", as you do, is not an argument.

It would be more difficult for them as people, if they didn't have social approval, including approval for their sexual actions, like gay people face. The straights who disapprove of gays, make things more difficult for the gay people then they would have as a day-to-day reality for themselves.

   "Well, everyone, looks like I have been added to the growing ignore list of Archangel - typical YEC tactics - ignore what you can't debate: it really shows how poor their arguments are.\n \n Apparently the paranoid Archangel believes I am someone named \"Ravin\" from his past (I have never met him before in my lifeand have no clue what he is talking about).\n \n Oh, and anyone that still views Archangel as a \"Christian\", here is a much toned down version (expletives removed) of the PM he sent me to inform me I was on Ignore:\n \n You are the most despicable philosophical coward I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. You and I haven't had one debate about Islam in the short time you've been here. Nor have I had any debates about Islam since you've been here and yet somehow you understand my views on Islam ? Huh Ravin ? You lying sack of manure. \n \n Do you think I don't recognize your mannerisms and style ? Your shallowness and ability to evade and twist another posters words to imply they're saying something they didn't even intend to say ? Only a liar and a coward debates like you and I knew there weren't two of you out there. You are now on ignore you disgusting coward of a human being as I'll not lower myself to the level of such trash to try to reason with such a lowlife as you are.. \n\n \n Apparently my comments on what I read in the Peace in the Middle East forum on Archies comments triggered his paranoia.\n \n \n \n Anyway, to get this post back to the actual topic, it is wonderful that gay tolerance in the US is reaching record marks, but Archangel here is a prime example of intolerance still being alive and well.",

   "Ah, so now saying \"muslims\" HAS to mean EVERY MUSLIM IN THE WORLD. Logic at its utmost here, Archie. :xbanghead :xbanghead \n \n Sorry to tell you this Archie, but when I say \"Christians\" or \"Wiccans\", I do not mean \"all christians (as you are an example of the hateful kind)\" or \"all Wiccans\". Why would I mean something different when I say \"Muslims\"?\n\n \n Next time Oreo, do a little research. AA is almost always fact free in his posts. Just a simple wikipedia search can reveal the numerous lies, omissions and downright inaccuracies in his posts. AA has me on ignore because I fact check his posts.

Go to Saudi Arabia on vacation with your S.O. and stand on any street corner in the center of Rhyad and make out for just 45 seconds at high noon, getting it on video of course. Any takers ? Who wants to test the religion of peace ? They would cut your heads off so quick your heads would spin as they hit the ground. Pun totally intended.\n\n \n Archie, dear, we are as aware of religious bigotry in Muslim nations are we are aware of it here. What does it prove that many -- not all -- Muslim nations are usually more violent than Western ones towards gay people? In Iraq, for example, under the US regime, gays are being executed solely because of their sexual orientation. Do we blame the Iraqi authorities or the US military ones?\n \n \nChristians don't condone or call for the death of gays, all we do is try to reach them with the gospel but we are hated while islam is defended as a misunderstood belief system.\n\n \n Who is defending Islam? The point is most of us posting here probably live in the West, mostly in N. America or Europe, where a number of Christians STILL call for the execution of gays. Not the majority, nor the major churches, but there are Christians who do feel and preach that biblical penalties should be used against gay people.\n \n The issue here is religious extremism, not whether the sects which call for extreme violence against gays are Christian or Muslim -- both are evil. The reason we focus on Christianity more is that Islamic extremists are presently far less of a problem for us in the West than Christian ones, because they are a tiny and relatively powerless minority. In the West, Christian anti-gay propaganda far outnumbers the Muslim equivalent, and it wasn't all that long ago that Christians were as violent towards gays as many Muslim sects are today. We needn't fear Islamist Sharia in the West, but we should be very wary of Christianist theocracy.\n \n It might interest you to know there are also gay Muslim organisations in the West who are active against Islamic homophobia.

From their statement of principles:\n 4) We affirm the equal status and equal worth of all human beings, regardless of religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. We oppose any restrictions on women's full participation in society and believe that separation and segregation of men and women is contrary to the equity among genders enshrined in the Quran. We endorse the human rights and liberties of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-sexual individuals.

Even though today there are still problems, Women for the most part are treated equally. \n \n I would say the Gay Rights movement is about 50 years behind Women Rights, if you think about it was only in the 60s(in England) when laws against sex acts between consenting men where abolished. It took another 20 years for these laws to be abolished in Scotland.

The term 'lifestyle' throughout the article is a little bothersome but overall, good news! \n \n \n\n \n I am very happy to see the number of people accepting gays and lesbians is much higher and hope that number continues to climb. Like you, I'm bothered by the term \"lifestyle\", but as you said: Good News!\n \n In April in Washington state (where I live), our governor, Christine Gregoire, signed a domestic partnership bill into law. It takes effect July 22 this summer, and will provide gay couples many of the rights recieved by married couples (including right to hospital visitation, power of attorney, inheritance, etc.). As a lesbian (who has been married 18 years now), I am very excited about the progress here in Washington. Hopefully this is a sign that some day in the near future, gay marriage will be legal here in Washington and the bill passed back in 98 defining marriage as between a man and a woman will be overturned. \n \n My wife and I will certainly be among the first to register for domestic partnership here in Washington.",

I'd go even further and suggest that the gay rights movement evolved from the struggle for equal rights for women. Without the gains for feminism, I believe gay rights would never have stood a chance. Still, the gains in the last 30 years have been dramatic, and moving perhaps faster even than the women's movement did. From illegality to legal marriage in many countries and one US state in 30 years? Not bad.\n \n You are right we will have to be patient before true equality is achieved, but it's moving faster than I would have predicted even 10-20 years ago. If you had asked me in the 80s whether legal gay marriage would happen anywhere in my lifetime, I'd have fallen over laughing.\n \n I've just moved back to Scotland after some 25 years living in the US, and it's interesting how language use has changed. People here no longer seem to talk officially about husbands or wives, but more neutrally about \"partners\". I'm not sure whether this is the result of greater legal recognition of gay relationships in the UK, and I suspect it's probably more to do with the fact that people tend to live together more often without getting married these days, but it's a positive change for gay people whatever the reason.",

The only ones depraved in this situation are the \"Christians\" who are trying to deny us the ability to marry the people we love and get equal benefits to heterosexuals.\n \n I did not \"choose\" to have these attractions, and I could not get \"turned on\" by or attracted to a male if I wanted to (believe me, I tried back when I was trying to supress my orientation due to the preaching in my church - I had sex with several guys - it did nothing for me).\n\n \n Brigid, your talking to a wall here.

   "I dare you to blame the Christians for those injustices. Those were committed by our secular Government and in no way were committed in Gods name. \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I would say when many American Indians were forced to convert to christianity it most certainly in the name of god. Plantation owners were hard core bible believing christians. And how kingd they were to share their god with the people that they held in bondage. The opposition to giving women the right to vote was christian based.\n You need to be reminded that it was a godless, depraved, secular government that delivered equal rights to the black people of this country. A white christian nation was not about to let these former slaves acieve equality. So the godless, depraved, secular government had to make racial discrimination illegal. Why would a nation with so many wonderful christians need a secular government to teach them how not to treat human beings with dark skin? They should have learned that from Jesus. Now many christians claim that it was Jesus who taught them to believe that blacks and whites were equal. It's ironic that the message of the lord became apparent to many christians across the land, when the secular government made racial discrimination illegal. When that good old christian moral compass can't seem to point it followers in a moral direction, it takes some secular XXX kicking to help them get back on track.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n They were motivated by greed, fear and a need to gain power as a Nation. But neither do they destroy or negate all of the good America has done for the rest of the World.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n There was scriptual backing for all of the above. I never implied that those incidents destroyed or negated any good deeds of this country.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n We are the Great Melting Pot because of the oppressed and abused peoples who have fled to our shores from every other Continent.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n If you are aware of that why do you insist on oppressing and abusing those you do not approve of? You speak in riddles and circles.\n \n \n \n \n Archagel:\n But tell me gaetano, how many Americans a year flee from America in search of a better or more just life ? Only criminals and super rich liberals that's who.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I have no idea, and what has that got to do with the fact that other peoples lives are none of your business?\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n So typically, Jitobear can love you and applaud you for pointing out the few blemishes in America's past but I condemn you for not also pointing out the good we have done and the light we have shined on the World as the beacon of truth and Justice that we were.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n This discussion is not about the good things that America has done. I am quite aware of this country's good deeds. Your christian worldview that you try to force upon others is the jist of this discussion. That is not ood deed at all, it is a very bad deed.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Remember this gaetano, not only Christians have come to America seeking religious freedom, but people of every belief system have come here knowing that finally they could worship the God of their choice, or no God at all without fear of punishment or oppression from this Government.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I am well aware of that fact. I am also well aware of the fact that freedom of religion means freedom from religion as well. Up to this date there is still no fear of punishment or oppression from the government, but you are doing your best to change that. I find it hard to believe that you have any reverence or respect for any other religious belief then christianity. You have declared every other belief system false, based on the dellusion that yours is somehow true\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n I truly pity the shallowness of your World view gaetano. The way you people (The Natural Man)can pick and choose that which you will remember in forming your opinions about right and wrong. considering only what suits you as convenient based on your personal comforts zone in establishing a moral center. You prove you have no absolute truth in which to rely as you make moral judgments in your life. \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Well I will tell you how shallow I really am. Despite your ignorance and arrogance and your belief in something I find unbelievable, I will always defend your right to be who you are and believe as you choose. It is not my job to decide whether or not you are right or wrong. It is my responsiblity as a citizen of a free nation to make sure that your freedom to be right or wrong stays intact. I will not allow my personal feelings about what you believe and how you choose to live your life come before your freedom to live the life that you have been given. \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n You are like ships with no rudders as you steer through life with no moral or ethical direction or destination in mind at all. \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I feel the same way about you, but that gives me no right to limit your freedoms. \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Judge me as harshly as you like, but at least I know where I'm going because I know where I've been. And I've been where you are so I know the futility of your perspective.\n\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I do not wish to judge you, what would be the point? I am glad you think you know where you are going but I fail to see how you are ever going to get there when you are so obsessed with telling everyone else what they need to do or need to stop doing so they will know where they are going as well.\n You have no idea where I have been, nor do you have any idea of where I am going. It's okay for you to talk about your god and what he does and what he'll do, and what you should do, and what he'll if you don't do it, etc. But the last thing you know anything about is where I've been. To start with you have never been catholic, Italian, or gay. You never knew my family or friends, nor do you see life as I do.\n I recall reading your post and you explained that you found god when you were 18 or so. I guess we do have something in common. I was 18 when I found that god was a myth. I went to 12 years of catholic school and when I got out and joined the real world I discovered that lots of people believed in false religions with the same passion and sincerity that my people believed in catholicism. Then there were those who believed passionately and sincerely in no god at all. I thought that the whole world knew that god expected them to be catholics, and I also thought they they chose other religions because they were angry at the real god because they did not want to hear his truth. Much in the same way that many christians view homosexuals. They are gay because they are angry at god, etc, etc. Ignorance is bliss.\n Anyway what I discovered is that I wanted to learn what others believed and why they believed as they did. I realized that what I was raised to believe was just one of many perspectives. While beliefs in gods varied, I found a common ground in communicating with all kinds of people. It was called respect. I discovered that just about everyone except your basic masochist enjoyed and appreciated being treated with respect and dignity. I thought that the time and energy I spent praising and worshipping and praying to a god that did not approve of other people's belief choices was very hippocritical. I knew these people, they had become my friends. I couldn't understand how I as a simple sinful mortal could love these people as they were and how god in all his greatness, mercy, and unconditional love had them marked for eternal damnation. An all knowing god with a birdseye view from heaven above can see that god varies from country to country and culture to culture. Yet that was not a legitimate excuse for not realizing that he was the real god. I began to feel both guilty and lucky that I had been born in a place where everyone around me believed in the real god. What if I had been born in China where they don't know anything about the real god? As time went by and my questions went unanswered by both god and his followers I began to see a god I no longer cared for. An all powerful entity who was comfortable with eternal damnation for innocent human beings who didn't even know who he was. I could have been one of those unfortunate people, but god chose me to be born in a place where I could come to know how wonderful he was. And be blessed with the honor to serve him. I had grown to know and love to many god people who were to become helpless victims of his wrath and it made me sick. I lost the desire to spend eternity with a god that had so little regard for his \"children.\" \n In closing I have been where you are and I have moved on. As for the futility of my perspective, there isn't one. Life tells me that the bible is a fairytale and it's evil god nothing more then a fictional character. You continue to insist upon the reality of something you believe to be true. You have no proof, you have no evidence. I believe the bible is a fairytale. You think it's real, but it doesn't change my mind that it's a fairytale. What you offer as proof and/or evidence are futile and desperate attempts to convince others that your belief is fact.",

   "NorthJersey.com Print | Close\n N.J. ready for gay marriage, survey says\n Thursday, August 16, 2007\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \n TRENTON -- Twice as many New Jerseyans \"would be fine\" with allowing gay couples to marry as would be upset if lawmakers enacted a marriage equality law, according to a new poll.\n \n The Zogby survey of 803 New Jersey voters was commissioned by the gay-rights group Garden State Equality to mark the six-month anniversary of New Jersey's civil unions law on Sunday.\n \n Gay couples were granted the same legal rights, but not the title, as married couples on Feb. 19 when New Jersey became the third state to offer civil unions. Gay rights activists have continued to press for full marriage equality, saying civil unions do not satisfy a state Supreme Court ruling that entitles gay couples to the same benefits as married couples.\n \n The poll, released Wednesday, showed 63 percent of voters surveyed said they would not be upset if the Legislature upgraded civil unions to marriage equality, compared with 31 percent who would be upset.\n \n And 72 percent said lawmakers would not jeopardize their reelection bids by enacting marriage equality, compared with 21 percent who felt such a vote could effect an incumbent's chances of remaining in the Legislature.\n \n Regardless of their personal beliefs, those polled believe New Jersey will allow gay couples to marry within a couple of years, by a margin of 61 percent to 29 percent.\n \n \"Regardless of whether any public official supports marriage equality or wants to maintain the state's failed civil unions law, no official in New Jersey can credibly say that marriage for gay couples is a divisive issue in the state,\" said Steven Goldstein of Teaneck, chairman of Garden State Equality.\n \n \"Even voters who oppose marriage equality are ready to accept an upgrade of the state's civil unions law to real marriage equality,\" he said.",

   "Hi, folks. I am back home after more than a month away. We went to Mass. to clear out my father's house (he passed away in May) and prepare it for sale. It was hard, but the work is done, and the house is now on the market. The probate is finished also, so I am free to sell the house. This is especially hard because I grew up in that house, and it holds so many precious memories, but there is no practical way for me to keep it. \n \n Anyhow, my personal life aside, I am encouraged by this latest Gallup poll. I think that right now we need to work on recruiting ministers and other people of faith to change the message that is taught in churches about gay people. I think the greatest barrier we now face is in the teachings of so many Christian leaders. I think we must address how ministers and other religious leaders talk about us, and we need to get gay Christians and liberal Christians of all orientations active in this effort. \n \n I do not think it helps for us to denounce conservative Christians and call them names. That just alienates people and causes greater polarization. I think we need Christians who support equality to speak the language of the conservative Christians and use the Bible to challenge the anti-gay message that right-wing pastors have been promoting.",

You cannot stand in that metaphorical theatere and yell fire under the umbrella of free-speech!\n\n \n Actually one does have the right to work for a law that one knows is unconstitutional or that violates the bill of rights. A person can work to enact any law that he or she wants. If a person can get such a law passed, it will stand until someone challenges it in a lawsuit and a court strikes the law down as unconstitutional. \n \n The \"fire in a crowded theater\" metaphor was articulated by the Supreme Court in its ruling in the case of Schenck v. United States. This was a case challenging the Espionage Act and sedition clause, which were passed by Congress during World War I. The law barred any kind of criticism of the government, any disparaging statements about the government. The law was used to send critics of the war, mainly socialists and anarchists, to prison. The head of the Socialist Party, Eugene Debs, was sent to prison for criticizing the government for sending people to prison under this law! \n \n The Supreme Court upheld the Espionage Act in the Schenck case, saying that the government can limit free speech in wartime. More sigificant than the falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater metaphor was the \"clear and present danger\" test applied by the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that the law in question sought to limit speech that presented a \"clear and present danger\" to the government of the United States, and thus the law was constitutional. In the years after this controversial (and I think wrong-headed) ruling, the Supreme Court gradually came to narrow what restrictions on speech it would allow under the \"clear and present danger\" test. The Court came to rule that for the government to restrict speech, the danger of the speech really did have to be clear and immediate, and the government could not restrict speech that simply criticized the government or that criticized a war or the draft. \n \n This is all background, but I thought it might be interesting for people to know the origins of the \"fire in a crowded theater\" metaphor. It came from a Supreme Court ruling that really no longer stands as it did in the early 20th century.",

What is the real difference between criticizing someone's religious beliefs and trying to change someone's religious beliefs through persuasion? There is not a clear distinction there, since both are free speech. There is nothing wrong, in my view, with Soulforce challenging the religious beliefs of other Christians regarding gay people and trying to change how other Christians treat gay people. Soulforce has done remarkable work in this area. The Equality Riders rode around the country to conservative Christian colleges and universities to challenge the religious beliefs of fellow Christians about gay people and to urge young Christians to think differently about gay people. \n \n The opponents of slavery challenged the religious beliefs of slaveholders regarding slavery and sought to change those beliefs. The opponents of racial segregation challenged the religious beliefs of proponents of segregation, who based their support for segregation on the Bible. The opponents of segregation sought to change both the laws and the beliefs of the people who supported segregation. The supporters of women's suffrage challenged the religious beliefs of those who argued that the Bible called for women to submit to their husbands and who used a religious argument for why women should not vote. The speeches of women's suffragists were a clear attempt to challenge beliefs that many people drew from the Bible. Americans today criticize the religious beliefs of Al Queda, because they engage in terrorist acts on the basis of their religious beliefs. Should we not seek to discourage people from embracing the beliefs of Al Queda simply because these beliefs are religious? \n \n There is a difference, I think, between the government stopping people from expressing their religious beliefs, which would be the denial of freedom of religion, and people debating religious beliefs and using persuasion to try to change minds when they regard beliefs as socially harmful. That's just free speech. People on the religious right try all the time to change the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists like myself. I find it annoying sometimes, but I honor their free speech right to criticize my beliefs if they want to, or to try to use persuasion in the public sphere to change my beliefs. (They won't succeed.)\n \n The question of legislation is trickier. People can work for whatever legislation they want. That doesn't mean that they will get it passed or that the laws they pass will be constitutional. People can certainly work to pass legislation on the basis of their religious beliefs....people do it all the time. I do it. Our church social justice committee works to try to end the death penalty, and we work with many Christians on this, especially Catholics. To tell people that they should not work for legislation on the basis of their religious morality is not going to win people over. People will work to pass legislation on the basis of their religious morality whether we like it or not. When we disagree with the proposed legislation, we simply have to work to defeat it. And if we believe that the legislation is unconstitutional, we have to challenge it in court.",

The supporters of women's suffrage challenged the religious beliefs of those who argued that the Bible called for women to submit to their husbands and who used a religious argument for why women should not vote. The speeches of women's suffragists were a clear attempt to challenge beliefs that many people drew from the Bible. Americans today criticize the religious beliefs of Al Queda, because they engage in terrorist acts on the basis of their religious beliefs. Should we not seek to discourage people from embracing the beliefs of Al Queda simply because these beliefs are religious? \n \n There is a difference, I think, between the government stopping people from expressing their religious beliefs, which would be the denial of freedom of religion, and people debating religious beliefs and using persuasion to try to change minds when they regard beliefs as socially harmful. That's just free speech. People on the religious right try all the time to change the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists like myself. I find it annoying sometimes, but I honor their free speech right to criticize my beliefs if they want to, or to try to use persuasion in the public sphere to change my beliefs. (They won't succeed.)\n\n \n To me there is a distinction between changing the minds of people and changing the religion. I am not comfortable with trying to change the definition/outline of Catholic beliefs/rules - I have no issue with trying to convince Catholics that said beliefs (or portions of them) are wrong. Does that make sense?\n \n \nThe question of legislation is trickier. People can work for whatever legislation they want. That doesn't mean that they will get it passed or that the laws they pass will be constitutional. People can certainly work to pass legislation on the basis of their religious beliefs....people do it all the time. I do it. Our church social justice committee works to try to end the death penalty, and we work with many Christians on this, especially Catholics. To tell people that they should not work for legislation on the basis of their religious morality is not going to win people over. People will work to pass legislation on the basis of their religious morality whether we like it or not. When we disagree with the proposed legislation, we simply have to work to defeat it. And if we believe that the legislation is unconstitutional, we have to challenge it in court.\n\n \n I understand that people can and do try to get laws enacted based upon their religion. If it lacks a measurable reason for protecting rights / protecting from harm / etc. it makes me angry. Its a waste of tax dollars and time.",

I also think it's too bad we have to fight to prevent the passage of laws that undermine fundamental rights for people, but we do have to. People's religious convictions have often led them to support causes that harm people rather than helping anyone. On the other hand, people have worked for some good causes out of religious conviction.",
