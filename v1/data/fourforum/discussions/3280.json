   "Title: Critically understanding politics leads to eventual enlightenment \n \n by Eugene Ramirez (.....Vegan, graduate student, Latino, spiritual, progressive-liberal residing in San Antonio, Tx -- More of my editorials can be read at http://www.EugeneRamirez.com/html/editorials.html)\n \n As I mentioned in my August 2003 editorial, \"The Power of One Voice to Change The World,\" I voted in favor for my school district's bond proposal (in my high-school auditorium) at the age of 18. Even before then, in June 1994, an entire segment on Flag Day was devoted to my comments, which I called in to KSAT 12's \"What's Driving You Crazy\" when I was 14 years old.\n \n But my activism did not stop there. Since then, I have had more than 10 letters to the editor published in the San Antonio Express-News, (some trivial) and two in the San Antonio Current. \n \n Also, during the Gore-Bush presidential 2000 election, I dragged my Dad, sister and the kids out to the voting polls at a local elementary school. I know if I had not taken them with me, they would have never voted during that crucial election. Before the vote, I even went a step further and helped them get signed up with the voter registration cards and told them which candidate to vote for in each category.\n \n I am a progressive-liberal so when I vote, of course, I vote Democrat. I will never vote Republican. Society has changed a lot in 50 years and continues to change in unison with \"popular opinion.\" As progressive-liberals, we look toward the future and acknowledge the growth and strides that society goes through. To increase evolutionary societal-change, we remain cognizant with reference to breaking through \"complacency\" or the \"status quo\" in order to further more progress in society.\n \n Regrettably, Republican ideology generally avoids change that occurs in society and instead pushes for things to \"stay the same,\" or for them to \"go back to the way it used to be.\" But if people \"go back\" to the way things used to be, they will again unleash many of society's ills that we continue to desperately fight against. Moreover, I cannot comprehend why anyone would want to re-elect our current Republican president once more.\n \n Among many other things, earlier this year, Bush advocated writing discrimination into the Constitution, he has been handed nearly everything to him in life because of his last name, he cannot sufficiently articulate on par with most other politicians, he continues to push through legislation and tax cuts that benefit the very rich, and he has aligned himself with extreme right-wing organizations and people.\n \n As a matter of fact, one of the nation's most powerful driving force is deeply embedded into the Republican Party: The Religious Right. In my May 2004 editorial, \"Learning From Religious Fanaticism Can Prevent Future Atrocities,\" I cite how religion has been used for hundreds of years to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion. \n \n Today, of course, we do not experience the extreme religious fanaticism that occurred centuries ago. Nevertheless, with the Religious Right backed by millions of dollars and millions of faithful followers, they easily continue lobbying their agenda to Washington. As it is now, it is also a very threatening situation when seven of the highest-ranking Republican senators receive a 100 percent scorecard from the right-wing organization, the Christian Coalition.\n In his book, \"The Most Dangerous Man in America?: Pat Robertson and the Rise of the Christian Coalition,\" Robert Boston sheds much light on Robertson's theocratic rhetoric, which threatens the separation of church and state on many interrelated issues. Most absurdly, during an address to the American Center for Law and Justice in 1993, Robertson commented, \"There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.\" \n \n The author also makes known many of Robertson's sordid actions and claims, which include his ability to communicate with God directly, and the insensitive comments he made shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that were also very similar to Jerry Falwell's. Unfortunately, President Bush has certainly done his part to please the Religious Right. For instance, many will never forget when he appointed extreme right-wing John Ashcroft as our country's attorney general. \n Regarding Ashcroft, in my letter-to-the-editor published in the San Antonio Current on Jan. 25, 2001, I said, \"During his time in the Senate, John Ashcroft sponsored unconstitutional legislation violating the Bill of Rights. He is against the Fourth Amendment. He refused to protect abortion clinics from right-wing organizations. He praised Confederate soldiers for fighting to uphold slavery. He blocked the nomination of a gay man for an ambassadorship. He fought federal judgeship of an African American, and blocked efforts to bring an end to racial profiling.\"\n \n Despite all that, whenever people start to discuss politics, I still cringe inside and smile patiently with poise. I say this because, inevitably, I know I will witness a heated and passionate debate about which political party is \"better\" or \"right\" for our country. I hear the familiar drivel all the time, \"Republicans are better than Democrats,\" and, \"no, Democrats are better than them.\" Undoubtedly, Democrats prevail as the better choice. However, I feel compelled to remind people of a more obscured reality they too would see if they delved deeper into the financial aspect of our political parties.\n \n First, both Republicans and Democrats rely heavily on corporate-interest money to intensify their campaign presence in mass media. A visit to the website, OpenSecrets.Org, shows the thousands or millions of dollars in contributions categorized by election-year that wealthy financiers give to both Democrats and Republicans. For this reason, I am doubtful that in my lifetime America will elect an \"average\" Joe or Jane, who works a blue-collar job, to become president. It appears the powerful in this country need only ensure they possess a sufficient amount of money in order to be heard or hold elected office.\n \n Additionally, in the past, both parties did their share of wrong, which some apologized for. All we need to do is look back to the Iran-Contra scandal with Reagan (Republicans), and the Lewinksy affair with Clinton (Democrats). I remember the uproar among Republicans when Clinton pardoned some questionable people before leaving office in 2001. However, I was quick to remind those Republicans that the first President Bush pardoned Regan, himself and others involved in Iran-Contra. Bush also issued those pardons on Christmas Eve, (a strategic move) on a least-conscious news day, when Clinton did not do such a thing.\n \n Political parties aside, my question is: What can millionaire politicians (or their billionaire lobbying allies) do for us citizens that they did not already promise in the past? And how in the world can they say they can relate to my life? Can they really empathize with my struggles growing up when I was homeless at times or days when we had very little food and lived in very small apartments or living quarters? \n \n Since many politicians always say they are \"of the people,\" will they also take the city bus with me to school like I have done ever since middle school? Furthermore, I am positive my vegetarian (almost vegan) lifestyle will not be a problem with them, but when they discover I do not live a luxurious lifestyle, will they find it odd when I decline to eat at their lavish restaurants so I can save my money for the rent? Indeed, can they truly relate to me? I do not think so.\n \n Unfortunately, for many others, the result of this political facade leads to increasing voter apathy and general complacency and particularly among minorities who can see through the \"I'm just like you\" pretense. Despite all this, it is very important to vote. As I said in my August 2003 editorial, many people have died or walked miles just for the right to vote. Clearly, everyone has an opinion, yet not all of them vote during elections. So, if you want to see change in the world, do not just sit there and debate. Get out and vote! \n \n In the end, I just want a president who will fight for all civil rights (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and others), be liberal-progressive, have common sense and not cave in to corporate interests. I know this will not happen this election year in November, and this hopeful reality may be far off in the distance. But like most people who share my sentiment, I will stay optimistic but also realistic, and hope undecided people and people who have been complacent and apathetic to voting in the past, will eventually start to use their power to initiate some change because we definitely need it.",
