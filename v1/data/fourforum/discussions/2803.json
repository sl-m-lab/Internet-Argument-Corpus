Why is it we don't see geological column, radiometric evidence, or How'd the animals fit on the ark? Why the anti-evolution bias?",

   "Ah, because, according to book titles and websites, creationism can't start making its positive claims until it has totally refuted the theory of evolution. As you may recall, the book titles are always:\n \n Evolution: A Theory in Crisis\n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/091756152X/qid=1090867669/sr=1-8/ref=sr_1_8/002-2147192-6525630?v=glance&s=books\n \n Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrong\n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895262002/qid=1090867669/sr=1-9/ref=sr_1_9/002-2147192-6525630?v=glance&s=books\n \n Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds\n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0830813608/ref=pd_gw_qpt_3/002-2147192-6525630?v=glance&n=577394\n \n \n \n The creationists always see it as task #1 to try to refute some claims made by evolutionary theory. This usually takes most of the book. The last 10 pages are where they make the case for why Christianity and Genesis are the only truth.

I believe the reason there are only anti-evolution arguments is that creationist arguments hold no water, and therefore are of little use in debating when one can simply google post-1960's data and prove it wrong. Attacking evolution requires some decent form of thought, and effort. Creationism can only claim victory after it has disprove evolution, it cannot claim victory on it's own arguments. \n \n So in essence, anti-evolution arguments require the use of a brain and effort, which ultimtely is the point of debating, to utilize the brain.",
