   "I flipped to The Fifth Estate - a Canadian version of 60 Minutes - last night, and low and behold they were doing an entire hour on the Benny Hinn Ministry.\n \n I could only watch the first 1/2hr because I had to go to a hockey game, but I think that's probably a good thing - my blood pressure was going through the roof. emoticon_mad \n \n Here's a link to the show - http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/main_miracles.html\n \n I was so angry and disgusted by this man, I was actually yelling at my TV.\n \n Firstly, I was mad at the people that go to this guy's shows and shower him with money - how stupid and naive can you be? People well aware of his lavish life style and misdeads, but who chose to turn a blind eye, intentionally naive and ignorant. Then, as the show progressed, I realized that the majority of these people were desperate. The were ill, with little hope of recovery from modern medicine, and had turned to Benny Hinn as a last ditch effort. The were poor, living in poverty, hoping that their contributions to him would turn their lives around and bring prosperity. I then felt immense pity and empathy for these people - and my anger at Benny Hinn ratcheted up about 10 notches.\n \n I could rant for an hour about how much this man angers and disgusts me, so I'm gonna try an keep it real short.\n \n He preys on the ignorant, the weak and sick, on people's desperation and on those who can least afford it. He's a blatant liar and a fraud. He hasn't healed anyone, and carefully screens those he allows on stage. \n \n He openly asks for money, while at the same time preaching that money is evil and you \"can't take it with you to heaven\". And yet, Benny Hinn lives a life of 5 star hotels, private jets, Mercedes Benzs, and private seaside mansions. All of this tax free under American laws that recognize The Benny Hinn Ministry as a religious organization - exempt from all tax and accounting laws.\n \n This man is a criminal of the worst kind. He's a shameless two bit hustler, bilking desperate people out of their savings, only he's doing it on the scale of Enron. IMHO, he should be behind bars. \n \n It would seem to me that Christians everywhere should be uniting against this man, instead, they buy tickets - enough to sell out the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on 3 consequtive nights (the biggest rock bands in the world can't do that) to witness his sham.\n \n I don't know how the man sleeps at night. If I ever got past his high priced Secret Service style entourage and police escort, I think I might do some very un-Christian like things to him. :xcensored \n \n Waxy",
