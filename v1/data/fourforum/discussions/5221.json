   "AMD's dual-core CPUs come out swinging\n \n By Rich Brown\n (May 9, 2005)\n \n Two weeks ago, AMD released its dual-core Opteron server chips and announced that we'd soon see dual-core tech brought to the desktop in the form of its Athlon 64 X2 processors. CNET Labs was able to test one of the new chips, and today we can share performance figures. The results are dramatic. AMD's new dual-core Athlon 64 X2 4800+ CPU hands the company a decisive victory over rival Intel; a system from AMD using the X2 4800+ bested an Intel-submitted PC with the Pentium Extreme Edition 840 (PEE 840) on every one of CNET Labs' dual-core benchmarks. With four Athlon 64 X2 chips announced today, AMD gives consumers greater dual-core CPU choices than you get with Intel and its lone PEE 840. What's more, the Athlon 64 X2 chips work with existing AMD motherboards, providing DIY consumers flexibility in bringing dual core to their current platform without having to overhaul the entire PC, starting with the motherboard.\n \n http://www.cnet.com/4520-6022_1-6217968-1.html?tag=prmo1\n \n $1001.00 per chip! emoticon_wow",
