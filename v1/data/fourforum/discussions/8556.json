   "If we as Christians are to hold our doctrine of eternal life vs. eternal damnation as being a true phenomenon, then how much time do we have to save a human soul? \n \n There isn't any rehearsal. We don't get a second life to come back and try it again. It's one life, one shot to get it right the first time. We don't have time to play around or argue with each other. Instead, our ordinance is to work together as one body of Christ. \n \n Apostle Paul has introduced us as Gentiles to the healing power of the gospel to save souls from pain and suffering. All we have to do is to bring our brothers and sisters, who are thirsting for spiritual understanding, to the fountain of life to drink the water of Christ.\n \n How much faith does it require for us to preach the gospel in exchange for our eternal salvation? \n \n Amen!",

God being infinite means no beginning or end. When our mortal bodies pass, I do not believe that our existence ends. We must continue to grow in our understanding towards God in a different way. I have never passed away before so I cannot describe what it is like. If you think about it, wouldn't it be the greatest injustice imaginable if we are given say 100 years to work out our salvation and that infinitesimal speck of time compared to eternity determines our eternal fate? I might suffer forever, forever, because I couldn't get it right? No, I do not believe a magnanimous God would turn His back on His own creations for infinity infinities just because he/she couldn't get his/her act together in a time period that is comparable to less than an instance.",

   "Is existing that unhappy for you? I am very sorry if it is but growing Godward shouldn't be an intimidating thought, unless you think God is malevolent.\n\n \n It's not about being happy or unhappy at a moment in time. It's simply the prospect of going on and on without end. Take a moment to seriousy think about this.\n \n Life is change. If there's life after death, there's two possibilities that I can think of: You either keep changing or you don't. If you don't change, then you cease to lead any kind of meaningless existence which would quickly drive you insane and then last forever. If you do keep changing, then you have another two possibilities: you either change so much that you lose any sense of who you used to be - in which case could it really be called growth if you can't remember where you came from? - or you keep changing and growing eternally without end, keeping your sense of self. This isn't really any better, though, because even after a million billion years of growth and change you would have reached exactly zero of your full potential, since a million billion years next to eternity is pretty much nothing. And remember, if God decides that you've reached your goal and are ready to stop changing, then its either insanity or at the very least an infinitely boring eternity of singing hymns and worshipping the God who only brought you into the world to tell him how great he is.\n \n I'll take oblivion, thanks.\n \n Change and growth are only meaningful if there's a finite amount of time to accomplish them in. 80 to 100 years is plenty of time to either figure things out or say screw it all. Of course, there are plenty of times when that lifespan is cut rather short, but that's just something you'll have to take up with your god.",

I used to lay awake sometimes as a child and contemplate what being in Heaven would be like. Just continuing to live forever and ever and ever and ever.
