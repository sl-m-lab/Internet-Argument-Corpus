For instance pain (physical) is usualyl caused by an abnormalty in how the body functions. When your skin is cut you feel pain.\n I think you are referring to more mental things such as hate, sadness, and love. \n Hate - Dislike. Usually brought upon by actions or thoughts that are displeasing. \n The same idea goes for all three.\n \n You are saying something like that when a relationship ends you are feeling an emotion (sadness usually) and therfor its beyond science. \n The chemical reaction doesn't feel your mind feels. The heart is usually symbolism for what feels \"broken\" when really feelings such as this take place in the mind which gives you the negative impulses you feel... \n \n Why do you think we have a soul?\n What is the soul?\n Why do we need it?\n In your opinon what purpose does the soul serve.\n \n Our body and mind seem to fill the job occupation for everything the human body does.\n Mind - Actions, Thoughts, Memories, Feelings, etc...

I see no reason why a human should have a soul. It seems unnecessary. Whats to say that your body doesn't go up to heaven or wherever with you. \n \n \"u guys are like logical u need logical reasoning (at leas that is what i am picking up if i have it wrong im truly sorry for making this assumption (sp??) of you)\"\n \n - Its all I got in an illogical world.\n \n \"But what if there isnt a logical answer for everything some things are a mystery.\"\n \n - Logic helps seperate fairly tales from truth. We will never know the real answer to this question or questions similar to it. We must gather diffrent options and find the one with the most logic to it. Then we come to sites such as these, debate our logic and reasoning and hopefully learn something...\n \n I ask you again why do you feel as if you have a soul?\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Katie,\n \n I have found several refences containing the world \"soul\"\n I will go look at most of them later but I'll just go over with a few for you.\n \n Genesis 2:7 - \"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. \" \n \n - \"and man became a living soul\" \n \n I think a defenition of a soul seems to be another word for man as alot of these refrences do. You can not just see the word \"soul\" and go by your own defenition you must ALWAYS look at the context of the word.\n \n Genesis 42:21 - And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. \n \n - \"the anguish of his soul\" I think that soul here is used in place of mind or feelings. Obviously my most philosophical definitions of soul its not going to have \"anguish\". \"the anguish of his soul\" refers to his feelings, which are generated and controlled by the mind / brain.\n \n ((Note: The word \"brain\" is not found in the old or new testament.))\n \n Soul is also used as a word for spirit, or will. (Such as a team spirit)\n \n Matthew 10:28 - And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\n - \"cannot kill the soul\" (spirit)\n \n - \"destroy both sould and body in hell.\" Once again I think an accurate definition of this would be a spirit or pride of one.\n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

This is a more obvious equation for a personality and there are far more complex reasons for them......\n If one is to have a soul, and that soul determines your personality then your personality is destined and beyond your control.....\n \n \"And may i ask why you believe there isnt a Soul?\"\n \n - That same reason I don't beleive in a magical dragon named thread.

   "Originally posted by SilentPoet \n Do you beleive that people have a soul? Why do you think yes or no? Define soul using your own terms. \n Mind, Body and _______?\n or just Mind and Body\n How is the soul diffrent than the mind?\n Let me know what you think\n \n Always Stay Open Minded \n \n \n I didn't read this entire thread so perhaps this has already been brought up. I believe there was a credible study that took place that weighted people who were on their death bed to determine if perhaps they lost weight soon after death. It was determined that a person would suddenly lose about 2 pounds after they had died. The scale was not only weighting the person, but was also weighting the bed they were on and everything on the bed obviously, so nothing fell off that bed during these tests. It was concluded that perhaps a soul did exist and that actually could be weighted.\n \n I read about this a long time ago so if there is any credibility to this story it will probably be covered somewhere on the Internet.\n \n \n Just to add my opinion on the whole matter, I voted that I'm not sure if we have a soul. Whether the soul has to be something given by God or if it doesn't need to be religion related at all, I'm sure there is a possibility that there is a soul or something like it. The complexity of this world is so far beyond what we can understand that absolutely anything is possible and some things are more likely than others. Out of body experiences are so common that it is hard to believe that there isn't something to it beyond what we can understand.",

   "Ok...this is probably offensive to some egos, because it is frightening to me...I believe that we (humans, aliens, animals, etc.) do have a soul, and that it is an \"extention\" of a higher power's energy--rather like the cells make up the body. The scary part is that I believe that when our lives are over, our \"soul\" is \"reabsorbed\" by the \"collective\" (please excuse the Star Trek reference) and (maybe) \"recycled\" in a new form to experience a life in a different/new form. I think our personality, memories, etc., will no longer exist in a way we can comprehend, since the \"soul\" is \"blended\" back among the whole. Rather like one drop of red dye added to a swimming pool...it does change the whole, but in a tiny way, and in a way that changes the first drop completely. \n This belief system probably has a name--no thought is really original, is it?--but I dont recall ever having heard anyone else talk about it.

Because its a mystery its all a mystery (the soul included) yea sure scientist have THEORIES most i do agree with but some not so much.\"\n \n - Of course its a mystery.

   "Poet,\n Yes, I have a brain but it often fails me. Or do I fail it because I sometimes spew things out before thinking? An impossible dichotomy-- that I might fail my brain or it fail me???\n \n \nIs not the theist mind dependant on chemical reactions? How so is the theist mind not that of an animal where you claim an atheist mind is.\n \n \n I guess what I am proposing is a twist on Descartes' \"Cognito ergo sum.\"\n \n Yes, the brain of the theist is dependent upon chemical reactions just as the atheist's brain is. They function in the same manner. However, in the reasoning of the theist, the atheist's disposition does not alter his essence. The atheist is a product of divinity the same as the theist (he's just not aware of it--yet :)). \n \n I did not mean to say that the atheist has the brain of an animal and the theist doesn't. I mean to say that if the atheist is correct he can have nothing more than the brain of an animal because that is the only thing that fits with his theory (if he is right then theists also have nothing more). How does rational thought seep into this sum of natural selection, random mutation, and biochemistry? I have a difficult time thinking of that evolutionary leap from random or ordered fate to freewheeling abstract thought...the leap from the total objectivism that atheistic evolution demands with the evident reality of subjectivism...the leap from inanimate matter to animate living matter...from irrational instinct to rational thought\n \n I say, as a theist, that my thought is facilitated by biochemical reactions, that my thought follows the pathway of chemical reactions, or maybe that the reactions may be the evidence of my thought. The atheist must say that my thought is the product of biochem rxns or in actuality, I am a biochem reaction. \n \n If my belief is true then I do not fully and totally depend upon chemical reactions. The chemical reactions are not the ultimate directing power. There is something (soul) put there by the creator that separates me from other beings. There is something supernatural that has made me rational and given me free will. Something that allows creative, imaginary, original thought. It is evident that atheists also have free will and thought. Our beliefs do not change metaphysics. We are the same but we have different beliefs. Whose is correct?\n \n You were making the comparison of believing in God and pink flamingos but I don't think the two are comparable. You were making the assertion that believing in something that is unseen and unprovable was not rational--true in the case of the flamingos but not in the case of God. In actuality the more practical, logical sequence for a rational mind is to believe he came from \"rationality.\" No matter how ordered science is, no matter how objective, step by step, and concrete...the material order and evidence is the very thing that limits the logic of jumping into rationality from matter that has no hint of rationality. How do you say that believing in pink flamingos is irrational if the belief in flamingos is simply a chemical reaction? Maybe this is the first time that a random variable caused the chemical reaction that created that thought. Pink flamingo thoughts can be neither rational nor irrational in a materialistic approach. Pink flamingo thoughts just are. (I am assuming some things about your beliefs. This got me into trouble with lurch on another thread. Correct me if I am attributing to you things you do not believe).\n \n Let me explain this less tediously with a quote in the next post. This quote was originally posted in the Religion forum on the thread \"Religion as a regression to animalistic behavior\" It is Post #16 from 7/15/2003 if you are interested at looking at the context. \n \n Watch for a new thread with some questions to atheists from me that will further illustrate my points. I'm not sure if I will post it in religion or philosophy. These are questions from Christians who were once atheists--C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton. (BTW, I wasn't sure if you saw my last post on the abortion thread concerning abstinence. We were posting back and forth for awhile on the \"I need help\" thread I think. It is quite wordy and a response would be time-consuming so I don't expect one but do take a look if you have the time and inclination).",

   "Here is the quote I spoke of in my previous post by G.K. Chesterton in his book Orthodoxy: \"For we must remember that the materialist philosophy (whether true or not) is certainly much more limiting than any religion. In one sense, of course, all intelligent ideas are narrow. They cannot be broader than themselves. A Christian is only restricted in the same sense that an atheist is restricted. He cannot think Christianity false and continue to be a Christian; and the atheist cannot think atheism false and continue to be an atheist. But as it happens, there is a very special sense in which materialism has more restrictions than spiritualism. Mr. McCabe thinks me a slave because I am not allowed to believe in determinism. I think Mr. McCabe a slave because he is not allowed to believe in fairies. But if we examine the two vetoes we shall see that his is really much more of a pure veto than mine. The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe. But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracles.  Poor Mr. McCabe is not allowed to retain even the tiniest imp, though it might be hiding in a pimpernel. The Christian admits that the universe is manifold and even miscellaneous, just as a sane man knows that he is complex.The sane man knows that he has a touch of the beast, a touch of the devil, a touch of the saint, a touch of the citizen. Nay, the really sane man knows that he has a touch of the madman. But the materialist's world is quite simple and solid, just as the madman is quite sure he is sane. The materialist is sure that history has been simply and solely a chain of causation, just as the interesting person before mentioned is quite sure that he is simply and solely a chicken. Materialists and madmen never have doubts.\n \n Spiritual doctrines do not actually limit the mind as do materialistic denials. Even if I believe in immortality I need not think about it. But if I disbelieve in immortality I must not think about it. In the first case the road is open and I can go as far as I like; in the second the road is shut...Now it is the charge against the main deductions of the materialist that, right or wrong, they gradually destroy his humanity; I do not mean only kindness, I mean hope, courage, poetry, initiative, all that is human.  For instance, when materialism leads men to complete fatalism (as it generally does), it is quite idle to pretend that it is in any sense a liberating force. It is absurd to say that you are especially advancing freedom when you only use free thought to destroy free will.  The determinists come to bind, not to loose. They may well call their law the 'chain' of causation. It is the worst chain that ever fettered a human being. You may use the language of liberty, if you like, about materialistic teaching, but it is obvious that this is just as inapplicable to it as a whole as the same language when applied to a man locked up in a mad house. You may say, if you like, that the man is free to think himself a poached egg. But it is surely a more massive and important fact that if he is a poached egg he is not free to eat, drink, sleep, walk, or smoke a cigarette. Similarly you may say, if you like, that the bold determinist speculator is free to disbelieve in the reality of the will. But it is a much more massive and important fact that he is not free to raise, to curse, to thank, to justify, to urge, to punish, to resist temptations, to incite mobs, to make New Year resolutions, to pardon sinners, to rebuke tyrants, or even to say 'thank you' for the mustard...\"",

   "A point for consideration:\n \n The soul is the coordinator of four major components of the person. Those components are 1) mind (or will) 2) body 3)emotions 4) spirit. Often times in the bible the soul is represented by the word heart. \n \n If we allow our bodies to be the most important things in our lives then the body drives our emotions which in turn drive our will and effect our spirit in a negative way. \n \n On the other hand if we are ordered in such a way as to make our spirit the primary then it will drive our will which will drive our emotions and then our body. In this way we do nto have to be slaves to our bodies. \n \n The care of the soul is through reformation. We have all been formed spiritually. We must be reformed and then transformed. Romans says to be transformed by the renewing of your minds. In both of the above examples, either the spirit or body controls and that is dependent on what we set our minds. \"Set your minds on things above.\" Not sure if this helps or hurts.

   "The Stanford Institute of Reasearch have proven it is posible for the mind to leave the body and view objects that are physicaly a great distance away. This is known as Remote Viewing. It is commonly refered to as Astol travel. Thier is also a drug which is administerd to pacients who have an ilergic reaction to normal anisthetics. This drug creates the \"illusion of leaving the body\" people have said they would be floating around thier unconsious body with full memory. The thing is they could actulay recal things and events they should not have been able to unless they had left thier bodies. The mind does not need this to be itself. In dreams we are very content on where we are and what we are doing. The dream is a very realistic illusion. Dreams create the president that we do not need this physical universe to be ourslves and be happy.\n \n My nanna was clinicaly Dead. She new this because she was electrouted in a hospital. When one is dead one can not observe the world because one is dead. She claims to have seen a nurse inject her with adrenalin. This did occur. She claims to have seen this happen when she was dead. Dead people do not have hilusinations as electrical activity in the mind does not occure in dead people. This is a clear case of and oxy XXXXX.\n \n I would love to discuss the nature of time but it probably would be best to do that on another thread. It is relivent because if time is not real then the consept of death has to be an illusion. If thier is no time one simply is.

   "Poet:\n \n I am afraid I have precious little evidence. When discussing the nature of things in philosophy, evidence would, at least appear, less important than logic. My evidence would be based in biblical information. I am not sure that would be appropriate in this forum.\n \n However, from a philosophical standpoint, this is a discussion from some time back. Most people, I think would say that there is a part of reality that is unseen, a spiritual realm. Some, to be sure would not agree. That would not make them right. \n \n I think the fact that people have a conscience, that they know right from wrong is an indicator of a soul. The concept of emergent downward causality is a fairly common psychological principle. The idea is of the mind being more than just the brain. We are more than just the sum of our parts. People, if they are generally functional, will try to hide that which is wrong. They have a conscience. \n \n 2ndly, People do not always do what they want to do and often do that which they don't want to do. We are not simply cognitive, controlled by our minds. We are also emotional. Crimes of passion occur.\n \n Lastly, people long to be a part of something greater than themselves. The idea that there is this longing and nothing with which to satisfy it is very depressing and without hope. I would not wish that on anyone. \n \n I don't believe I have what it takes to prove the existence of the soul any more than I could prove the existence of God.

   "It requires something greater than ourselves. It points to the fact that we are unable to control ourselves. There must be something outside of us that can enable us, because we are not able to.\n\n \n Your basing this on absolutely nothing. I'm willing to defend the idea of a soul to some extent but not to the extent that your willing to. Your suggesting that just because our minds cannot control themselves that we must have a soul or something greater than us? That just doesn't make sense. Do you think the soul diolates our eyes when we look at a bright light? Do you think the soul makes us hungry since we cannot control when we feel hungry? Do you think the soul makes random memories pop up in our minds when something familiar is sensed? Just because our consciousness cannot control our mind and our mind cannot control everything that it does doesn't mean that there is something perfect behind it guiding it, it means that there is something flawed inside of it. There are so many flaws to the human mind that there is no reason to debate that it is controlled by a greater being to the extent your suggesting. We randomly forget things. We have our immune system begin attacking us. Drugs affect the mind. Do you think the soul is responsible in all these cases? Do you think the soul is in charge of the majority of our thoughts rather than the primitive side of our mind? Do you think animals have a soul considering their primitive minds are similar to the primitive side of our mind?\n \n PS - Just to make it more clear what I'm getting at here, I'm wondering what else you think the soul controls. If your suggesting the soul can control what we think is right and wrong and we cannot, what else can it control. Why do drug affect it and such?\n \n \nHere, the issue is something that we can see.

If you are willing to admit that the unseen can control the seen then it is a short step to the soul. David, in the Psalms frequently refers to a soul. Many of the new testament writers do as well.\n\n \n Actually it is a short step to the inner workings of the mind.\n \n \nThe thought is much more realistic than the concept that the world was created randomly given the unbelievable intricacy and order examined in things such as DNA, RNA, galxies, black holes, cell structure, protein synthesis, neurons, etc. The law of entropy is real. Things when left to themselves tend to disorder (simply examine a kindergarten class left alone for 30 minutes. YIPES!). To simply say it is unrealistic is not evidence but conjecture. What is your argument?\n\n \n When comparing kindergardeners to the universe your comparing human elements to something that isn't even remotely comparable to them. God is an easy way to answer what we don't understand such as the universe, but we have much to learn about the universe and assuming God doesn't exist, which I think is likely, then eventually we will be able to explain how this all came together. At that time it will make sense. If God even does exist he will never make sense to the living as any Christian will tell you that we cannot possibly understand God. Also you talk about the universe as if you have an understanding of it. Please don't presume that as no one has an understanding of the universe to make statements such as you just did. To say it was even done randomly is to make a strong presumption. There may well be a controlling force that isn't God.\n \n \nAdditionally, there is more archeological evidence for the contents of the bible than for any other writing in existence. On this point I will see if I can get you a source.\n\n \n The Bible is flawed in that you cannot presume anything written in it is literal unless it has already happened. I doubt you can even say that God exists based on the Bible as you cannot prove this to be true without having to reference things in the Bible that haven't actually been recorded in our history. The Bible hurts itself in this way.\n \n \n Just getting back to the topic of the soul, I do believe that there are too many things that we don't understand to make any assumptions on what is real and what isn't. This include almost everything in science and religion. The soul may possibly have some connection with how the mind works and maybe it doesn't. My opinion would be that the soul would have no connection with such a flawed tool or it would show itself as being flawed or show how little control it actually has.\n \n One major point I wanted to save till the end of this post is this question. If you believe the soul is linked to the mind and that the soul is the ultimate controller of the mind, then do you believe that it is not within our control to choose what we do and believe in without the influence of the soul? If so, then isn't is possible that our soul may make the choice as to whether we go to Heaven or Hell because it plays such an influence on our life? If so, then isn't it true that it wouldn't be a conscious choice of our whether we devote our life towards Jesus or not and rather our lives are in the hands of something we have no control over? If so, doesn't this defeat the purpose God intended for us to have?\n \n I think this thought process gives us a reason to believe the soul plays only a small role in our thoughts if any at all, assuming it exists and God put it there. Having something that controls our subconscious like that would go against a lot of principles held true by Christians. Let me know what you think.",

Now that is power if there ever was power. If the soul is independent from our body and mind and is able to help us determine what is right and wrong, then it plays a major role in who we become.\n \n If your not linking the soul with right and wrong, then how is the conscience an indicator of a soul? A conscience helps us determine what is right and wrong. If you think this is done within our mind and not by the soul, then why is this a sign that a soul exists?\n \n \n As for the mind not controlling us, I think you are incorrect. Our mind is the part of us that we cannot control and it has a great deal of control over us. I think what Poet had said dealt with letting emotion take over conscious thought. People can control a certain aspect of their mind, but when it comes to primitive reactions such as rage, the primitive part of the mind can be allowed to take over instead of the part that thinks rationally.\n \n \n Concerning the universe, it is running fine on its own right now as far as we can tell. Why couldn't it have been running like this for all of its history?\n \n \n Sorry if I'm misunderstanding something about the souls connection to the mind. I just find it to be a bit extreme to think that the soul can be used to explain what happens in our minds.",

He is considered an authority in the fields of Philosophy and Theology. \n \n While the universe seems to be going pretty well, I would agree that neither you nor I actually know the current condition of the universe as it is also far too vast for our experience. Entropy, is a physical law. If the Universe was always the way it was, how do you explain entropy?",

   "First I'd like to apologize for my late response on this thread. I came across it while I was surfing and found that I should have responded awhile ago.\n \n \n AMD4ever.\n \n \nSo perhaps the soul could affect thought and we just don't know how it does it. That's all I'm saying.\n\n \n Yes its possible.\n \n Epaphras_faith,\n \n \n\n [(me)People, if they are generally functional, will try to hide that which is wrong. They have a conscience.\n (poet)- This requires a soul?] \n \n It requires something greater than ourselves. It points to the fact that we are unable to control ourselves. There must be something outside of us that can enable us, because we are not able to. \n \n \n Or perhaps they hide what they do wrong for fear of the consequences of their actions.\n \n \nHere, the issue is something that we can see. By the way, you cannot see your mind. You can only see it effects, your behavior in particular. You cannot even see your thoughts. You may be able to communicate them but they are not seen directly, only indirectly through communication. If you are willing to admit that the unseen can control the seen then it is a short step to the soul. David, in the Psalms frequently refers to a soul. Many of the new testament writers do as well.\n\n \n Please provide reference.\n \n \n \nThe thought is much more realistic than the concept that the world was created randomly given the unbelievable intricacy and order examined in things such as DNA, RNA, galxies, black holes, cell structure, protein synthesis, neurons, etc. The law of entropy is real. Things when left to themselves tend to disorder (simply examine a kindergarten class left alone for 30 minutes. YIPES!). To simply say it is unrealistic is not evidence but conjecture. What is your argument?\n\n \n Complexity is a relative term. Thus complexity does not exist in the universe unless through ones mind.\n \n \n \nAdditionally, there is more archeological evidence for the contents of the bible than for any other writing in existence. On this point I will see if I can get you a source.\n\n \n Yes some evidence does exist which shows that some stories in the bible are true but this does not prove the existance of God or a soul.\n \n \nLastly, argumentum ad hominum is a fallacy term meaning an attack on the source or speaker without dealing directly with the subject. It is a form of avoiding an argument. It would be like you saying that my argument on entropy above was incorrect because I am a fundamentalist and that is my bias. It doesn't attack the argument it attacks me.\n\n \n ...OK...",

   "Steven Hawking in \"A brief History of Time\" states that the evidence concerning the nature of the universe leads to one of two conclusions. It is either a finite universe with no boundary or it is an infinite universe with a boundary. It sounds contradictory, but that would be the mathematical model.
