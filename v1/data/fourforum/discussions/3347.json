It's better than a shot in the dark, but it really isn't an exact science. It could all stop tomorrow, or the whole mountain could be airborne next weekend, no one knows, and to the best of my knowledge anyway, we don't have any way to find out.\n \n As far as the question of whether or not they're doing all they can, I don't know all the details, but it seems to me that the USGS is on top of it.\n \n Waxy",

   "The way I understand it is that Mt St Helens' magma has much more gas introduced into it (for the lack of a better phrase) than those such as Mt Etna in Italy or those in Hawaii. It tends to thicken the lava making it coagulate much sooner, but also making much more explosive.\n Also, according to the USGS, there is no way of monitoring volcanoes due to each one being a separate and distinct unit, leaving no means to forecast events based on similar scenarios around the world.\n What puzzles me is the monitoring process itself. Is the process based solely on instruments or is there also a requirement for visual. And if visual monitoring is required how much is left up to opinion or theory (since volcanoes are separate entities)?\n\n \n Off the top of my head:\n \n Well, to be more exact there are two main reasons why Mt. St. Helens produces explosive volcanism based on the compostition of its magma. Firstly, as you said, it has a high quantity of dissolved gas within it. This is a separate issue too the viscosity, although the two factors combine to produce violent eruptions. \n \n As the magma rises towards the surface, the pressure and temperature the material is subjected too changes. In particular, the drop in pressure results in the dissolved water and gas (volitiles) boiling out of the magma. These volitiles will then form pockets that try to rise much more rapidly than the liquid magma due to the buoyancy contrast. However, the magma can only allow the gas to rise at a certain rate, creating huge stresses within the rising magma mass.\n \n The magma at Mt. St. Helens is also highly viscous. This means it flows less easily and is less able to freely rise than and gently de-gas than a low viscosity magma (an example of which is the sort of material that is commonly erupted in Hawaiian volcanism). If you feel like a demo in the kitchen, try opening a bottle of carbonated pop and watch the freely rising gas bubbles- imagine this as a low vicosity magma; for Mt. St. Helens, try air bubbles in treacle and see how much more difficult it is for air to pass through it.\n \n Combine the high gas content and viscosity together and you have a material that becomes subjected to immense internal stresses as it rises towards the earths surface. These forces will act on the solid material they pass through- the volcano. Sooner or later, if the volitiles cannot be freely released the stress becomes so great a section of the volcano may be literally blown out to release these huge forces, as was seen in the 1981 eruption.\n \n \n As to the monitoring that is used on a volcano that is likely to erupt there are many forms. There will be large arrays of seismic sensors placed in the vicinity of the volcano. These will record the \"micro quakes\" that occur in the run up to an eruption. When located in 3D, the quakes give an indication of where large stresses are being released and help build a picture of what is going on inside the mountain as the magma chamber fills and material moves towards the surface.\n \n Likewise, there will be geochemical monitoring of gas that is released from vents and the crater- as the compostion and quanity released changes it gives an indication of the state of the magma.\n \n \"Visual\" monitoring is also used- there is a famous set of photos of the side of Mt. St. Helens before it exploded in 1981 where the whole mountain side swells up. While apparent to the eye, I imagine more precise measurements are taken using laser theodolites which can be set up to detect small changes in the shape of the volcano. I guess satellite and aerial reconnaissance can also be utilised.\n \n It is very difficult to make the final call on these things I imagine- even with all the tools at the USGS's disposal it cannot issue a casual eruption alert- the consequences of which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Likewise they cannot be 100% certain a what time an eruption will occur- they have to reduce the uncertainty over the timing of an eruption to as narrow a window as possible, and issue a warning accordingly.\n \n On the subject of US volcanoes, another area of intense interest is the Yellowstone caldera. The last eruption (about 100,00 years ago IIRC) made Krakatoa look like a storm in a teacup, and a similiar eruption today would have serious consequences indeed for people. On that scary note, thats all I have for now emoticon_ic",
