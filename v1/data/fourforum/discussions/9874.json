Don't you know what those are? I showed you pictures of the Hell Creek formation in which many strata were visible. Weren't you paying attention? Or is is that creationists think that the earth is flat?\n \n-- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time.\nI suspect that you wouldn't know a uniformitarian principle if it kicked you in the shin. Please explain the principles and how finding fossils on the surface contradicts them. Unsupported assertion is nothing more than babble.\n \nFor example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other \"ancient\" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand.\nDid you look at the pictures and read what I explained to you? Do you remember the picture of the fossil dig in the side of the hill where the T. rex fossil was found? Were you not able to see the strata in the side of that hill? Have you ever actually seen any of the Hell Creek formation? How about the Grand Canyon?\n \nOf course evolutionists will come back and claim \"erosion\" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.\nSo you were unable to see evidence of erosion in the pictures that I showed you? By the way, the fossils are not bone - they are rock. They are a different kind of rock that the sedimentary rock in which they are found. Perhaps if you actually educated yourself you would know that the fossils are usually much harder than the surounding sediment. Of course, anyone who made an effort to learn before speaking would know that.\n \nI've got a 900-page book called \"Hidden Archeology\" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the \"wrong\" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.\nI'll bet you don't have a 900 page book called \"Hidden Archeology.\" Have you actually tried to investigate any of these so called \"forbidden\" artifacts?

An example of their limited perspective is their insistence and defense of erosion while never even considering the very real occurrence of sedimentary build up which should also place fossils 60 million years old to deep to get to, if those fossils really lived 60 million years ago that is. emoticon_confused \n \n ATTEMPTING TO KNOW THE UNKNOWABLE RESULTS IN BELIEF\n \n The age of the Earth is a fact. The Earth is here, it exists, it had to come from somewhere, and it had to come from somewhere at a specific time and that time is in the past, so the age of the Earth is a fact.\n \n It is just an unknowable fact.\n \n Any explanation for an unknowable fact cannot itself be fact, it must forever be a product of the mind, a made up fantasy, something for which belief is accorded.\n \n When we are dealing with beliefs, we are not dealing with reality. As a result, we tend to claim our beliefs facts and then undertake crusades to eradicate any opposing beliefs.\n \n Speculations about the age of the Earth are so intertwined with religious beliefs that the controversies that surround the question will, in all probability, survive the twentieth century and plague the foreseeable future.\n \n The best phrase with which to summarize the controversy, or at least its tone, is the assertion that the Earth is flat.\n \n \"Flatearther\" was a term manufactured by Darwinists to avoid the religious issues inherent in opposing evolution.\n \n No one at any point in the history of the planet ever made the claim that the Earth was flat!\n \n Darwinian supporters accused their opponents of believing that the Earth was flat, implying that at some point in the past, when science was fantasy and people held beliefs not supported by fact, ignorant savages held the belief that the Earth was flat. Opponents of evolution are thus flatearthers, ignorant primitives. Taking any other tact would result in a challenge to the Church's teachings dealing with creation. If man was created by God, then he certainly didn't evolve from simpler life forms, in the words of the anti-Darwinists, apes.\n \n Calling their opponents \"Godlovers\" didn't seem to have the necessary sting to it and involved a bit of danger, the least of which was public scorn, so the Darwinists created a belief that ignorant people believed at one time that the Earth was flat and that, by implication, also believed that God created man and that these flatearthers were not dealing with the facts of reality, the science that the Darwinists were making up to explain the origin of life on Earth.\n \n In many respects, the argument goes to the very core of a science that claims that its beliefs are based on fact. All of Modern Science's claims, that gravity is a property of mass, that the Earth rotates as a result of angular momentum, that planetary orbiting is the result of the solar system condensing out of a swirling mass of gas, that the universe was created in a very large explosion, that light is a wave, electricity a moving charge and magnetism the result of molecular magnets, obtain their authority from the belief that they address the facts in reality because they purport to verify those facts by measurement as opposed to the religious creation myths, which claim their authority from revelation.\n \n Actually, the difference is one of degree. Creation myths are designed to explain how things got the way they are, and scientific myths dealing with creation merely contain the added claim that the way things are have been verified by measurement. There is no way to measure the formation of the solar system, either as to how or when, and there is no way to measure how species evolved, so that any difference in explanation is only as valid as the name-calling opportunities presented to each, \"Your mommy was an ape!\" or \"You're an ignorant flatearther!\"\n \n No matter who says what with how much authority, we're still dealing in beliefs, made-up stuff the validity of which will never be known because the facts they deal with, the source of current existence, no longer exist and are therefore unknowable.\n \n MOUNTAIN RANGES AND LAYERS OF SEDIMENT\n \n The evidence that mountain ranges were thrust up in catastrophic events litters the mountain ranges themselves, with sea level fossils littering mountain sides, remnants of tropical plants necklacing mountain peaks which are themselves unweathered and therefore of recent origin and the geologic structures themselves clearly the result of upthrust rather than accretion.\n \n The evidence that mountains were built up gradually by magma extrusions is nonexistent. However, because magma comes out of volcanoes and builds up the sides of those volcanoes, it is conceivable that very big mountains could be built up by magma flows and therefore they were. In a modern version of the extrusion belief, instead of the magma pouring out of a hole in the ground, it lubricates the movement of giant plates which float around on the surface of the Earth, occasionally undercutting one another, pushing up mountain ranges in the process.\n \n There is no evidence that plates are floating around on molten magma, but because it is possible that they could be, this is the explanation for mountains, with perhaps the exception of the Rocky Mountains, the Atlas Mountains, the Andes and chains in the Antarctic to name a few.\n \n When these mountains in turn contain evidence that supports the biblical flood which could never have taken place because it is a religious myth, then immense, slow moving ice ages, acting over eons, were created, ice ages whose cause defies explanation, but which are needed simply to explain how giant boulders, hundreds, sometimes thousands of tons of solid rock called erratics because they are out of place, could be transported vast distances from their geographical sources, some found on ground higher than ice soars, others in the middles of desserts where no ice ever tread.\n \n Without a catastrophic occurrence, the physical evidence that catastrophic acts had to have wrought has to be explained away by something else because the catastrophic acts could never have happened.\n \n Better to have an unexplainable ice age than a biblically described event!\n \n The basis for all of these self-delusions, these beliefs in things which don't exist, magma extruded mountain ranges, roaming continental plates, ice ages, is the need to know that which cannot be known, the age of the Earth.\n \n Lyell observed in the mid-nineteenth century that layers of sediment laid down layers of rock one atop the other. This stratification meant that each layer represented a geologic era in the history of the Earth. Because some of these strata contained the remains of the life that existed when the strata was laid down, the strata could be used as a clock to gauge the age of the Earth and the order of development of life on the Earth.\n \n There were two assumptions that had to be made if strata were going to be used to write the history of the Earth. The first was that the thickness of the strata could be converted into years, that the time each strata represented was knowable.\n \n This, of course, was simple delusion.\n \n The second assumption required to turn the observation of strata into a history book, a \"record,\" the word chosen because it produces the illusion that beliefs are facts, was that the strata had to have been uniformly laid down over the entire face of the Earth throughout the eons. It wouldn't do for the English, in whose country the idea was hatched, to build one clock based on a reading of their strata, and the Americans to build another clock using the strata in North America. It was necessary for all strata to represent the same history no matter where on the face of the Earth the strata appeared.\n \n This is a complex delusion indeed!\n \n If the Earth had been mucked up by a bunch of catastrophes, if floods had poured throughout the land, mountain ranges had been thrust up here and there in response to earthshaking events or monumental earthquakes had mixed and mismatched the strata, then the clocking device of the strata would be useless in telling us that which we could not know.\n \n As knowing is much more pleasant than not knowing, catastrophes had to be done away with. Because they were biblically excluded to start with, anything in the Bible was bunk, a doctrine could be created and believed in which excluded the possibility of catastrophes mucking up the stratigrapical time clock. To underline the need for absolute belief, unthinking acceptance by the faithful, the doctrine was given an extremely religious sounding name, uniformitarianism, the uncapitalized \"u\" identifying it as a nonreligious belief. This belief, that all geological phenomena are the result of gradual forces that have operated uniformly from the origin of the Earth to the present time, is sacrosanct today, surviving even the occasional dinosaur death-dealing asteroid.\n \n EVOLUTION DICTATES THE CLOCK'S RATE\n \n Attempts to come to grips with some sort of explanation for life on Earth that didn't include the active hand of a metaphysical creator had been swirling around for hundreds of years before Darwin came up with his narrative on the evolution of species.\n \n Because Naturalists were Empiricists whose purpose was to use measurement systems to classify life, the various forms of life on Earth were in the process of being categorized, placed into neat compartments so that when people were talking about something, they knew what they were talking about. \"Species\" is the category defined by the ability to interbreed. Darwin's story dealt with the formation of life at the simplest level and its assumed evolution into more complex forms. Because interbreeding was a natural barrier to the transition of one species into the next, Darwin was concerned with the evolution of species.\n \n Because species evolution is a formidable mental jump as well as an impossible physical transition, the \"how\" was left to chance, species thought to evolve even today from one to the next as a result of happenstance, with the species most suitable to its environment the species that dominate that environment.\n \n There are more holes in Darwin's theory of evolution than there are interpretations of that theory, but its basic precept is that one species somehow becomes another species, retaining some of the characteristics of the prior species to be used in conjunction with other chance characteristics accidentally created and incorporated with the existing characteristics because the new configuration was found to be viable in the environment.\n \n A dog changing into a horse or an ape changing into a man (there were no dinosaurs in Darwin's world) present formidable mental obstacles. There are certainly similarities, and today with our computer software, we can morph one into another with ridiculous ease, but to attempt on a mental level the physical processes involved in converting bones and organs, hair and teeth from one to the other is just too much to endure.\n \n When something isn't endurable, the best thing to do is find something else that is endurable. Instead of concentrating on whether such a transformation could occur, it is easier to just assume it did and focus on something else, something like the time it took to occur.\n \n After all, we are dealing with reality aren't we, there are dogs and horses, apes and men, we aren't making up anything here, just dealing with how the facts got the way they are. Why bother trying to paint a moving picture of the transformation when we can just make up endless time, barely conceivable itself, but more conceivable than the transformation, and then say that the transformation occurred in endless time because endless time accommodates all chances?\n \n Today, evolution from one species to the next is taken as proven fact. When anyone questions the existence of evolution, they are charged with being modern-day flatearthers, Creationists, and then the argument is couched in terms of bare religious belief or observable measurable facts. The observable measurable facts are embodied in recording the \"evolution\" of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands during periods of drought and plentiful rainfall. Because of the type of food that survives under each condition, the environment either favors long-beaked or short-beaked finches, starving out the unfavored finches in the process.\n \n But simply observing that one finch thrives on one set of environmental conditions while another survives during the opposite set of environmental conditions does not say anything about dinosaurs evolving into turkeys.\n \n Why not consider evolution a process in which characteristics were evolved and encoded and thus available to all subsequent life forms to express as needed so that new species evolve by strategies which utilize combinations of superseded, existing and new characteristics as the environment dictates?",

Why must you lie and deceive in order to feel like you're winning something. I responded to your demand for a defense by saying I wont defend the flat earth statement.

Is that your definition of honesty ? Why doesn't that surprise me at all.\n \n What I marvel at is that you sanctimonious pseudo intellectuals never dealt with ONE POINT my post made other than the single sentence about the flat earth. Isn't it telling that you love to tear apart minor side issues while never dealing with factual questions that reveal the VERY REAL WEAKNESSES IN YOUR SHALLOW AND DELUSIONAL BELIEFS. Like this, for example, which was the point of that post.\n \n MOUNTAIN RANGES AND LAYERS OF SEDIMENT\n \n The evidence that mountain ranges were thrust up in catastrophic events litters the mountain ranges themselves, with sea level fossils littering mountain sides, remnants of tropical plants necklacing mountain peaks which are themselves unweathered and therefore of recent origin and the geologic structures themselves clearly the result of upthrust rather than accretion.\n \n The evidence that mountains were built up gradually by magma extrusions is nonexistent. However, because magma comes out of volcanoes and builds up the sides of those volcanoes, it is conceivable that very big mountains could be built up by magma flows and therefore they were. In a modern version of the extrusion belief, instead of the magma pouring out of a hole in the ground, it lubricates the movement of giant plates which float around on the surface of the Earth, occasionally undercutting one another, pushing up mountain ranges in the process.\n \n There is no evidence that plates are floating around on molten magma, but because it is possible that they could be, this is the explanation for mountains, with perhaps the exception of the Rocky Mountains, the Atlas Mountains, the Andes and chains in the Antarctic to name a few.\n \n When these mountains in turn contain evidence that supports the biblical flood which could never have taken place because it is a religious myth, then immense, slow moving ice ages, acting over eons, were created, ice ages whose cause defies explanation, but which are needed simply to explain how giant boulders, hundreds, sometimes thousands of tons of solid rock called erratics because they are out of place, could be transported vast distances from their geographical sources, some found on ground higher than ice soars, others in the middles of desserts where no ice ever tread.\n \n Without a catastrophic occurrence, the physical evidence that catastrophic acts had to have wrought has to be explained away by something else because the catastrophic acts could never have happened.\n \n Better to have an unexplainable ice age than a biblically described event!\n \n The basis for all of these self-delusions, these beliefs in things which don't exist, magma extruded mountain ranges, roaming continental plates, ice ages, is the need to know that which cannot be known, the age of the Earth.\n \n Lyell observed in the mid-nineteenth century that layers of sediment laid down layers of rock one atop the other. This stratification meant that each layer represented a geologic era in the history of the Earth. Because some of these strata contained the remains of the life that existed when the strata was laid down, the strata could be used as a clock to gauge the age of the Earth and the order of development of life on the Earth.\n \n There were two assumptions that had to be made if strata were going to be used to write the history of the Earth. The first was that the thickness of the strata could be converted into years, that the time each strata represented was knowable.\n \n This, of course, was simple delusion.\n \n The second assumption required to turn the observation of strata into a history book, a \"record,\" the word chosen because it produces the illusion that beliefs are facts, was that the strata had to have been uniformly laid down over the entire face of the Earth throughout the eons. It wouldn't do for the English, in whose country the idea was hatched, to build one clock based on a reading of their strata, and the Americans to build another clock using the strata in North America. It was necessary for all strata to represent the same history no matter where on the face of the Earth the strata appeared.\n \n This is a complex delusion indeed!\n \n If the Earth had been mucked up by a bunch of catastrophes, if floods had poured throughout the land, mountain ranges had been thrust up here and there in response to earthshaking events or monumental earthquakes had mixed and mismatched the strata, then the clocking device of the strata would be useless in telling us that which we could not know.\n \n As knowing is much more pleasant than not knowing, catastrophes had to be done away with. Because they were biblically excluded to start with, anything in the Bible was bunk, a doctrine could be created and believed in which excluded the possibility of catastrophes mucking up the stratigrapical time clock. To underline the need for absolute belief, unthinking acceptance by the faithful, the doctrine was given an extremely religious sounding name, uniformitarianism, the uncapitalized \"u\" identifying it as a nonreligious belief. This belief, that all geological phenomena are the result of gradual forces that have operated uniformly from the origin of the Earth to the present time, is sacrosanct today, surviving even the occasional dinosaur death-dealing asteroid.\n ",

If you post something while attempting to pass it off as yours (again, plagiarism), then own up and defend it.",

   "Archangel, why should anyone spend any time at all answering you? Liminus and I are still waiting for responses to posts we made addressing your claims from 2 weeks ago. Since we posted our replies, you a) told me that I wouldn't get a response til hell froze over (which I'm taking to mean you can't respond. Why else wouldn't you formulate a proper response?) b) promised Liminus a response ASAP, and c) disappeared for a week, then reappeared with a post consisting of plagarized claims that you won't even defend. And your reason for not defending the claims you cited? Why, you didn't read the site you plagarized from before cutting and pasting it. And we are supposed to spend the time it takes to research your claims, craft a response, write it up and post it? For what possible reason? You have made it quite clear that you will respond with nothing (if at all) but ignorance and insults.\n \n If you want a reasoned, researched response to your claims, respond in kind to others posts. For about the 10th time, I'm inviting you to respond to my post about seed development, explaining how and why it is incorrect (back it up as well). Then, I will post a response to whatever point you choose. Until then, why should we waste our time?\n\n \n If I ever got a reasoned, researched response from you, things might be different TQ. But all you have ever done is look down your nose with your superior attitude and claim how ignorant the creationist perspective is. So I see no reason wasting my time trying to reason with the likes of you. And if you think you're going to bully me into responding to you, you have another thing coming. I don't care how many times you call me out or claim victory. Victory comes in the game of life, not on some debate board, so where it counts I know I'm the winner. So I'm telling you straight out that you don't deserve a response as you will just twist it to infer I said something I never intended to say anyway. Hopefully this clears up any confusion in your small mind so you can sleep at night now. emoticon_xgood",

   "I know somehow in his post, Archie figures he has rebutted the assertion that creationist tactics consist of posting regurgitated, plagarized, discarded arguments, then running away when they're (again) refuted, only to return at a later time with the same arguments, but for the life of me, I can't see how he's done it...\n \n Archie, please explain to me and my \"small mind\" how expecting an actual response from you when I posted exactly what you asked for is \"bully\"ing you. I don't recall \"claiming victory\", just asking for an actual response from you. Nor did I \"look down [my] nose with [my] superior attitude\". You asked a question: how could trees develop seeds contained in such delicious fruit without an intelligent designer. I posted back with a reasoned path that is quite plausible. You dismissed it as my \"fantasy\" to prop up my \"imaginary beliefs\". I asked you many, many many times for a more proper response, which you have never, ever even attempted.\n \n Put it this way: if you don't like the accusation that all you do is post #### then run away when it's refuted, only to return with the same #### 2 weeks later, then complain that no one responds to you, don't do it. Seems pretty self explanatory to me.\n \n So, are you ever going to actually respond to my, or anyone's, posts? More than likely, as we can see above, not. So why should we waste our time and energy, especially when you like to then disavow support for this bit or that in your plagarized posts when it's pointed out as a hoax (thunderbird pic from Fox studios) or ridiculous (Flat Earth Society)?\n \n Until you actually begin to stand by what you post, or actually respond to posts made in response to you with something other than \"La la la, I can't hear you!\", you're nothing but a waste of time.",

   "The trouble with Creationists -- is there only one trouble? -- is that all they have to go on is faith. The difficulty is that while faith must be blind or it isn't faith, the society we inhabit worships science, because science produces the goods. It works, even if sometimes we aren't too sure whether we like the products. So Creationists have science envy, because they feel somehow that science carries more credibility than mere faith.\n \n Consequently, they invented their so-called \"Creation Science\", followed by its illegitimate offspring, IDism, which attempts to refresh religion with scientific lipstick, and try to find \"evidence\" for their biblical mythology. They admire skepticism, but are only able to apply it to ideas that contradict their faith; never to their own faith.\n \n So they'll continue to believe in disproven mythologies like the Garden of Eden and Noah's Flood. They'll continue to misinterpret evidence, because their faith is far stronger than their skepticism. Archie is a lost cause, because if he once stops believing in any part of the bible, he'd have to abandon all of it, and that he can't do. He cannot mature from a religious mythos-based childhood to a scientific logos-based adulthood, and thus needs to belittle those of us who have managed the transition, where he cannot bring himself to follow.",
