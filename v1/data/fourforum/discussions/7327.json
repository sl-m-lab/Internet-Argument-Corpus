State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion.

Peterson, ed., Thomas Jefferson: Writings (1984), p. 347 \n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm\n \n\n \n and ...\n \n \n\"Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.

Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its \n consequences.... If it end in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise and in the love of others it will procure for you.\"\n --Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, 10 Aug. 1787.\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm\n \n\n \n Is Jefferson telling Peter to give up his civil rights?!??!

Don't worry, I'll explain some in a minute...\n \n \nhansberrym: -Did Jefferson leave out atheists when he wrote the following?

Jefferson continued to introduce the legislation over many years.\n Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance was written 1785, so it is clear from the record that Madison and Jefferson, the two most involved with laying down the principles embodied in the Establishment Clause simply did not abandon or renounce the self evident truths espoused in the Declaration.\n Far from it, they restated that our rights come from God, the Creator, etc. \n \n And yes it does make sense to ask if it violates the Establishment Clause. It doesn't matter one bit if it came before or after, only whether it is in violation of the Establishment Clause or not. The principles were certainly known prior to the drafting of the Bill of Rights in 1789. In fact Jefferson and Madison spelled out what those principles were in the same documents we are discussing. \n \n I guess you could wriggle out by pointing out that in 1791 the First amendment was only a prohibition on Congress, but that is not the point of my question. It is quite a blind leap of faith to argue that the two most influential proponents of religious liberty either did not understand the principles they were espousing or that they chose to violate them in the very legislative acts that we look to today as the best evidence for the meaning of the Estbalishment Clause. \n \n \n \n The quote I had meant to post earlier/Jefferson Virginia Bill For Religious Freedom:\n \"Well aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do;...\"\n \n Are Atheists well aware the Almightly God created the mind free...? \n \n If that same act were passed today, would it violate the Establishment Clause?

   "Still doesn't void the fact that Jefferson wrote his original bill about 14 years before the First Amendment even existed..\n\n \n Thus proving that the concepts were known well before the First Amendment was ever written. Further, that Jefferson repeatedly introduced the legislation means that it was something he continued to support over many years. For instance Jefferson was well aware that Pennsylvania forbade religious establishment by government and sought the same for Virginia, and later for the nation. The principles behind the Establishment Clause were certainly known before 1789.\n \n \n \nJefferson was a deist, not a Christian. In fact, he found Christianity to be foolish. He followed Jesus - THE MAN'S - teachings, but did not consider Jesus to be a deity, and rejected the virgin birth, and all other miracles in the Bible.

IF x was written after Y - which is NOT the case - THEN would it violate Y? That makes a difference.\n\n \n No, if laws are in conflict, the earlier becomes void. I was not speaking of guilt in a sense that they would have been liable of punishment as you most surely knew, but rather did they violate the principle of the Establishment Clause which of course existed before the First Amendent.\n \n I have posed the question every which way that I could think of in response to your dodging. \n \n Is it your position that Jefferson and Madison violated the principle of the Establishment Clause by acknowledging God as the source of our rights in their respective legislation? I do not know whether or not the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom was still on the books when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, but are you saying that Act became or would have become unconstitutional if it were still law when the 14th was ratified? If it were passed again today word-for-word would it violate the Establishment Clause?\n \n You have dodged this question repeatedly -why can't you simply answer the question? \n \n \n \nAre you trying to take a bill that demands equal treatment regardless of one's religious position and turn it into an alleged support for Christianity? \n .\n\n \n No, my point throughout has been that Jefferson and Madison (and others including the framers of the PA constitution which forbade religious establishments) acknowledged the self evident truth that our rights come from God, the Almighty, the Universal Sovereign, Natures God, etc. repeatedly in legislation aimed at protecting religious liberty and forbidding religious establishments -therefor one can not plausibly say that such a proclaimation by government would be a violation of the Establishment Clause.",

Or, I answer but you don't personally like my answers.\n \n \nhansberrym: Is it your position that Jefferson and Madison violated the principle of the Establishment Clause by acknowledging God as the source of our rights in their respective legislation?\n\n \n No, because the establishment clause did not yet exist: therefore, it is impossible for Jefferson or Madison to have violated it or its principles in The Declaration of Independence, the Virginia Bill for Religious Freedom, or the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments. \n \n \nhansberrym: No, my point throughout has been that Jefferson and Madison (and others including the framers of the PA constitution which forbade religious establishments) acknowledged the self evident truth that our rights come from God, the Almighty, the Universal Sovereign, Natures God, etc. repeatedly in legislation aimed at protecting religious liberty and forbidding religious establishments -therefor one can not plausibly say that such a proclaimation by government would be a violation of the Establishment Clause.\n\n \n And your logic fails, for the reason I have pointed out several times: the Declaration of Independence, the Virginia Bill for Religious Freedom, and the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, all PREDATE the First Amendment's establishment clause. So you can't use them as valid kind of examples of \"violations\" of the first amendment.\n \n Your logic also is problematic because the two men would have been talking about DIFFERENT GODS! Jefferson's Deistic God was not Madison's Christian God. So in essence, the two men's claims are contradictory: our rights could not have come from Jefferson's God and also from Madison's other God. You overlook the differences and logical mash the different gods into one all-combined God that no one actually believes in: and therefore, that no one actually believes our rights could come from.\n \n Further, you seem to forget that the Declaration of Independence states:\n \n \n\"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\n\n \n God isn't who gives governments their just powers: we humans are. \n \n Further, you seem to not understand what compromise means. Take the Constitution and slavery. As you know, 13 years before the Constitution was signed the Declaration of Independence was signed. The DofI said that \"all men are created equal\". Well, what about slaves? The Constitution did not abolish slavery. In a sense - much stronger than the weak sense you've been using - the Constitution \"violated\" the Declaration of Independence, not only because it allowed slavery to continue, but also because it held that a black man was worth only 3/5 of a white man. There simply was still too much opposition to get the votes needed to eliminate slavery and so on, so the legislatures compromised: it was either that or not have a Constitution. You need to take this kind of thing into consideration when you analyze historical documents. For example, could Jefferson have fully expressed his own personal religious views in an official document and still expect it to be passed? No. He was restrained by the political need to compromise, just as those who wrote and approved the non-anti-slavery, a-black-man-is-worth-3/5-of-a-white-man, Declaration of Independence-violating US Constitution were.",

You overlook the differences and logical mash the different gods into one all-combined God that no one actually believes in: and therefore, that no one actually believes our rights could come from.\n\n \n Your previous post answers that question quite nicely. Jeffersons 1821 Autobiography explains that the Virginia legistlature when reviewing his draft of the Va Bill for Religious Freedom considered inserting Jesus' name but instead used the more general reference to God so as to include all denominations.\n \n \n \n\n Further, you seem to forget that the Declaration of Independence states:\n God isn't who gives governments their just powers: we humans are. \n\n \n That was a rather clumsy attempt at dodging the issue. \n The issue is that the framers stated repeatedly that rights come from God. I am sure they also said lots of other things, but it doesn't change the fact that they said rights come from god, even in legistlation aimed at forbidding the government from establishing religion. Therefor that simple proclamation itself can't reasonably be an establishment of religion or a violation of religious liberty-else the legislation would have violated itself.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Further, you seem to not understand what compromise means.

The slavers would have been quite happy to have slaves counted same as anyone else since that would have only increased the political power of the slave holding interests. \n \n \n Second, You said ealier that Jefferson was a deist, but he did restate that our rights come from God in legislation aimed at promoting religious liberty and forbidding religious establishments, and furthermore that legislation was enacted into law demonstrating that it was not merely his private opinion, but the understanding of the majority of the legistlators. Assuming Jefferson was a deist, it seems that he got what he wanted and it was those christians who would have rather had Jesus' name inserted into the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom that were forced to compromise.",
