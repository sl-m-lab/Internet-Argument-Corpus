These people coming over for a better life are hurting those who want to legally immigrate. Is that fair?\n\n \n Look at US immigration quotas for a better understanding of what drives illegal immigration. As an example, S. America is alloted 4,000 refugee status immigrants per year. Family immigration (you as a non-American have blood family with US citizenship in the US) for all countries outside the US has a floor of 276,000, with waiting lists calculated in years. \n \n The US supported and nourished S. American dictatorships for decades, dictators who raped (and rape) the resources of their countries for US gain while oppressing their native populations who were morally dominated with the import Catholicism that promoted unrestricted birth rates and extreme poverty. Those actions are now bearing fruit with mass starvation, civil unrest and emigration to what they perceive as the land of plenty, the US. \n \n I'm with sinjin; open the borders. I prefer a guest worker program, but that's too sensible for racist America, a country built on immigration. If the drain on US social services reaches a point of crisis and cutbacks are required, maybe some of the multitude of lazy 'real' Americans sucking on the government tit will have to work for a living.

It's about removing the incentive to be here for those who break the law. I realize there are too many companies willing to make concessions for the low-cost labor, but their labor CAN be replaced. I think Bush's plan is too weak to actually get anything done, but if all companies would be held accountable for hiring illegals, and this was strictly enforced, the Mexicans would eventually stay home, or apply like the rest of the law-abiding immigrants. How many US companies have 8-yr old child laborers? And why not? Because we have labor laws against it, and they are enforced. Most businesses large and small would be too afraid to work an 8 yr old child. It could be the same with illegals.\n \n Regarding the argument that they do jobs \"Americans are not willing to do\" -- that's our own damn fault for making welfare programs more attractive than earning a living. That's another debate for another forum, but it's a contributing factor. \n \n Not to mention, they DO NOT contribute, except in labor. Most do not pay taxes, most do not ever want to pay taxes, but many do live in part off of our tax money. Either we have an immigration policy or we dont. There should be no in-between.\n \n As for your friends living outside the US in Mexico and Costa Rica, I'd say why do they live there? If it's temporary for a US job that requires international travel or if it's for missionary work that's one thing (their job placement can be changed to somewhere else if necessary and they should have a home somewhere in the states anyway), but if they've moved there permanently because they like it there better than the US, I'd say renounce your American citizenship and become a citizen of Costa Rica or Mexico.

Those that do may still provide those benefits to illegals. It's estimated that illegals cost US taxpayers $10's of Billions/year.\n \n\n In the Globalised World, it is simply supply and demand.

If there is a ready workforce willing to work for low wages, why hire a US citizen at a higher wage? Is it possible that we have low paying jobs precisely because we have illegals willing to work for below market wages? In other words, do we have an oversupply of cheap labor, so wages are low?\n \n\n I went to Dublin recently and I would not say they spoke the same language, like us Scots they have bastardised it to such a degree I wouldn't even call it English. ;)\n \n One thing I can say a Women with an Irish accent is the only thing that makes me weak at the knees :)\n\n \n Gotta like those British Isles accents, English, Scottish, Irish or Welsh (if you can understand them). ;)",
