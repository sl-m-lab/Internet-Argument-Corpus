   "A fascinating article on the gay men and women whose invaluable contribution echoes down the years throughout American history.\n \n \"The American right presents homosexuality as something alien to the American experience - an intruder that inexplicably gate-crashed America in 1969 in the form of a rioting drag queen clutching a high heel in her fist as a weapon. The statements of Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, or Mitt Romney insistently hint that the XXX does not belong under the flag. But there's something odd here. For people who talk incessantly about honouring American history, they have built a historical picture of their country that can only be sustained by scrubbing it clean of a significant part of the population and everything they brought to the party (if not the Tea Party).\n \n In his new book, A XXXXX History of the United States, the cultural critic Michael Bronski runs the film backward, through 500 years of American life, showing there were gays and bisexuals in every scene, making and remaking America. They were among some of the country's great icons, from Emily Dickinson to Calamity Jane to perhaps even Abraham Lincoln and Eleanor Roosevelt.... \"\n \n Johann Hari: the hidden history of homosexuality in the US - Americas, World - The Independent",

   "If you are saying that homosexuality had some contribution to the USA then I would disgree and it certainly had a miniscule influence on the USA until recently.\n If you are saying that some influencial people were homosexuals then...what else new everyone knows that\n \n In fact the author makes far more of the Indians tolerating homosexuality than any ' influence' on the settlers and how can 'hidden' history have influence?",
